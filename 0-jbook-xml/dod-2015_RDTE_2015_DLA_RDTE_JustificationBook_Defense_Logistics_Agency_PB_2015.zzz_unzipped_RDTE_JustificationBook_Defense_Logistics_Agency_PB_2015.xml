                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Through the Theater Enterprise Deployment and Distribution (TED2) analysis, the Geographic Combatant Commanders identified several gaps between United
States Transportation Commands strategic lift processes and Geographic Combatant Commander's distribution processes. Highlighted is a lack of capability to (1.) manage transportation planning and execution processes for cargo and passenger movement within their respective theaters of operation or (2.) match global movement requirements against available lift assets to produce an optimized transportation schedule that meets delivery requirements.  AT21 Increment 3 Theater Capability will identify key touch points between strategic and theater processes and synchronize end-to-end delivery of personnel, equipment and supplies by providing enhanced visibility, collaboration, automated processes, alerts and exception management capability supporting transportation planning and execution for theater force and sustainment movements.  When fully implemented, it will provide opportunities to streamline cargo movement by optimizing capacity and provide complete visibility by synchronizing theater movements with strategic movements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY 2013 Sequestration Reduction: -$0.316 million
Deferred/cancelled FY2013 new starts, reduced funding for academic research, slowed pursuit of anti-access/area denial/sea basing technologies, slowed development of tools designed to both optimize and reduce overall cost of global transportation movements, and slowed technology enhancements that will improve the efficiency of DOD's supply chain and warfighter effectiveness.

FY2015 Other Program Reduction (Budget Control Act 2011): -$5.031 million</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The central idea of the Focused Logistics Joint Functional Concept “is to build sufficient capacity into the sustainment pipeline, exercise sufficient control over the pipeline from end to end, and provide a high degree of certainty to the supported joint force commander that sustainment, and support will arrive where needed and on time.”  The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Research and Development (R&amp;D) program helps achieve this vision by pioneering advanced logistics concepts and business processes that provides the leanest possible infrastructure, the use of the best commercial and government sources, and the application of business practices.  The Logistics R&amp;D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that will provide a significantly higher level of support at lower costs, than would be otherwise attainable.  The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits.  One example is the Department of Defense (DOD) Electronic MALL (EMALL).  DOD EMALL was the first web based, distributed architecture on-line ordering capability.  It has been adopted by the Army, Navy and the Department of Homeland Security.  DLA’s overall Log R&amp;D program has demonstrated positive net present value and a positive return on investment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY2014 Congressional Rescissions: -$2.000 million

FY2015 Other Program Reduction (Budget Control Act 2011): -$3.476 million

The lower funding will result in significant disruption and delay for critical DLA Logistics R&amp;D efforts.  The Medical On-line Business Analytics capability will be delayed depriving DLA of the ability to properly plan and monitor orders to critical medical customers.  The Supply Chain management project reductions means additional anti-counterfeiting technology will not be fully developed and implemented, increasing the risk that counterfeit parts will enter the DOD supply system. In addition, emerging additive manufacturing technology will not be available for low volume parts.  The Strategic Distribution and Reutilization reductions mean that DLA support to the COCOM’s deployments will be more costly because they will not be able to access regional suppliers through the IBEX2 system.  Reductions to the Energy readiness program mean cost increases to the Services for fuel because fewer alternative fuel additives will be available.  Finally, the reductions to the Defense Logistics Information project means DLA will not be capable of taking advantage of major advancements in Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) program objective is to research, identify, and implement potential or existing technologies using high-risk, high-payoff tools, methods, techniques, and products.  The DLIR program partners with commercial industry to perform short-term projects (STPs) in various logistics business areas which align with the Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA’s) strategic vision. DLIR improves functional and business processes using the latest technologies available, which support the nation’s warfighter. The technical areas of interest are:

1.)  Development of Logistics Data Interoperability &amp; Availability. Enhances the functionality and compatibility of data in a complex data environment using supply chain relationships and lifecycle management to allow flexible visibility.  2.)  Next Generation Automated Electronic Commerce and Sourcing.  The Next Generation Automated Electronic Commerce and Sourcing technical area of interest focuses on employing the best of breed processes, practices, and technology to enable and/or streamline electronic commerce from the customer’s point-of-need to point-of-satisfaction.

DLIR is working several short term projects in the first area of interest only. They are positioning DLA to move towards a model-based enterprise (MBE), using and acquiring 3-Dimensional model-based data instead of 2-Dimensional hardcopy for weapon system sustainment and support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>E-Mall Access for TENTNET:  This project will make it possible for MilSpec Tent information to be available to all EMALL users.  It will expand the number of tent and shelter products that have rich technical and performance information available on DOD EMALL. The project is structured to benefit the entire tent manufacturing community by making their product more visible and, more importantly, it will improve the quality of product information available to the warfighter.  Plans include completing data collection and web design for three additional MILSPEC tents, complete modifications, and develop web-based training capability.  

Extension of Supply Chain Simulation project:  This represents additional tasking for an existing project.  The project will simulate the capability of the tent supply chain to surge production under varying conditions and requirements.  We expect this project to produce an effective decision making tool for DLA’s Industrial Capabilities Programs allowing program management to evaluate the effect of placing buffer stocks at various levels within the supply chain.  Anticipate completion by Sept 2011.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>USTRANSCOM is tasked to provide globally integrated, agile deployment and distribution solutions and related enabling capabilities to support national security, force readiness and sustainability within an increasingly constrained defense budget. Unpredictable and extended global distribution routes, limited visibility of sustainment requirements, force packaging limitations, lift constraints, anti-access/aerial denial concerns, complex supply chains, as well as non-networked battlefield command and control, planning, and decision support tools impede timely customer logistical support.  To project unimpeded global power and influence, USTRANSCOM must have access to relevant, real-time information and invest in enabling capabilities that contribute to mission success.  Effective knowledge sharing and transparency across the joint logistics enterprise, facilitated by secure enterprise-wide visibility into logistical processes and the ability to effectively collaborate/operate in a degraded cyberspace, is required to promote effective, efficient and responsive global management of force projection and sustainment resources.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This requires investigation into next generation Automated Information Technology (AIT)/Total Asset Visibility (TAV) technologies and/or container security to improve end-to-end distribution visibility and enhance planning/ execution and transform sustainment operations.  Includes the ability to determine immediate, reliable, and accurate shipment status through system access or event management.  Develop an over-arching process and system architecture which will automate and integrate existing and innovative new programs across the supply chain to provide complete In Transit Visibility (ITV) data, to include visibility of non-DOD cargo during humanitarian/disaster relief operations. The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Also need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DOD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Synchronizing strategic/theater delivery capabilities to meet increasingly dynamic customer needs.  Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by the disparity of systems, differing data standards, and insufficient interfaces.  Queries and retrieval of status and shipment information cannot be executed due to lack of connectivity between the various components of the supply chain.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct "what -if" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset’s course, speed or departure/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.  The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Also need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DOD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Capabilities which improve deployment, distribution and supply chain decision-making/collaboration (planning stage to real-time execution and retrograde operations) without need for highly specialized operators.  Projects in this area address the following: decision support tools, distribution process simulations/analytics, distribution demand forecasting/execution monitoring, training, automated decision-maker support (e.g., queuing, alerting, courses of action), automated status monitoring with information fusion and drilldown capability, and resilient C2 infrastructure capabilities.  Current planning, forecasting and collaboration capabilities do not permit full synchronization of people, processes and assets to execute planned operations.  Automated tools must be able to dynamically analyze/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems.  Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by disparate systems, multiple data standards and insufficient interfaces.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department has found it critical to National Security to maintain an ability to produce legacy microelectronics long after they are available from commercial foundries which move to more advanced technology levels based upon the global market. The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) uniquely accomplishes this mission for the Department by providing both a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics parts that are no longer available from, or bid by, commercial sources but are essential to combat operations. This is a critical capability in an atmosphere of increasing worldwide supply chain risks with threats to defense microelectronics. The threats include risks, such as, counterfeiting, Trojan horses, unreliability and rapid obsolescence coming from an unpredictable and unsecure supply chain. As fiscal pressures force the Department to maintain its weapon systems longer than originally planned and their extended combat use increases attrition, the need for DMEA’s unique capabilities increases.

Microelectronics is a crucial technology and central for all operations within the Department. Yet, as vital as this technology is to Department operations, the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market. The Department frequently requires legacy microelectronics long after commercial foundries have moved on to advanced technology levels. As such, the semiconductor industry does not respond to the Department’s unique needs of ultra-low volumes, long availability time frames, or its high-level security concerns. In these cases, DMEA procures a license to produce technologies in-house that are no longer commercially manufactured or are unavailable due to no-bids owing to low volume requirements. These licenses enable DMEA to be the Department’s microelectronics supplier of last resort, providing the Department with a long-term, trusted, and assured source.

DMEA provides increasingly rare microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides decisive, quick turn solutions for defense, intelligence, special operations, cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market. DMEA’s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions—along with its unique technical perspective—allows it to develop, manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability. DMEA can then use these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele. After many years of performing analogous efforts, the technical experience, mission knowledge, and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are often incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key tool in the intelligent and rapid development and application of advanced technologies to identified military needs.

Working alongside industry, DMEA has created a model partnership that provides this capability for the Department. DMEA’s unique flexible foundry supports the Department with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now assured to remain in one location for as long as they are needed. To obtain these processes, DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses. These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed intellectual property (IP) and the related processes for Department needs. These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry’s right to bid first on resulting production volumes. DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components. If not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production. A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners’ valuable IP and processes. DMEA is Government owned and operated, providing the structure and confidence that an industry partner’s IP is protected from potential competitors. This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring, installing, and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems, combat operations, and support needs. As such, DMEA serves the Department, other US Agencies, industry and Allied nations.

DMEA assists hundreds of programs every year. DMEA has provided its unique engineering assistance and capabilities to older systems, current systems, and even to programs not yet in the production phase. This includes the F-18 Super Hornet, F-22 Raptor, F-35, RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-9 Reaper, AEGIS Advanced Surface Missile System, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), among many other programs. DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Ops, Cyber, Intelligence, and the Radiation-Hard communities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Microelectronics Technology Development and Support (MTDS) PE budget decreased in FY2015 due solely to the imposition of sequestration reductions at 13.5%.  Reductions were made in both the MTDS Project and the Trusted Foundry Project.  The MTDS Project sequestration reductions will delay and complicate the recapitalization and modernization of DMEA’s infrastructure.  Trusted Foundry Project sequestration reductions will impact the availability of leading edge technologies and other key specialty processes and the line of trusted catalog components, including FPGAs, that are required by DoD programs.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>With the increase in worldwide asymmetrical operations requiring quick turn, ultra-low volumes and complete trust along with the extension of life for the major weapon systems in all Services, DMEA’s unique-in-the-world capability has experienced significant growth in utilization over the last six years. Although DMEA’s Technology Development budget has remained steady (with a minor economic growth factor) during that time, DMEA’s support for the Department has increased 19.5% per annum over the same period. In order to fund these steadily growing requirements, DMEA has delayed or foregone many basic infrastructure updates, scheduled equipment replacements, and the acquisition and implementation of the IP that is needed to continue to support the Department. This increased budget for DMEA Technology Development extends DMEA’s current capabilities to meet the increased demand and keep pace with the rapid pace of microelectronic technologies.

The Microelectronics Technology Development and Support funds provide DMEA with the core resources to execute its primary mission of providing an in-house ability to quickly develop and execute appropriate solutions to keep a system operational, elevate the sophistication level or to meet new threats. These solutions include producing high mix, low volume, unique microelectronics that are endemic to military requirements and are not commercially available. These funds provide for the development and support necessary to ensure rapid prototyping, insertion, and support of microelectronics technologies into fielded systems, particularly as the technologies advance. DMEA maintains critical microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides an in-house capability to support these strategically important microelectronics technologies within the Department with distinctive resources to meet the Department’s requirements across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support. This includes producing components to meet the Department’s requirements for ultra-low volume, an extended availability timeframe, and a trusted, assured, and secure supply of microelectronics. These funds provide basic infrastructure updates as well as an in-house technical staff of skilled and experienced microelectronics personnel working in state-of-the-practice facilities providing technical and application engineering support for the implementation of advanced microelectronics research technologies from reverse engineering through design, fabrication, test, assembly, integration and installation. These funds also provide for the recapitalization and modernization of aging microelectronic infrastructure, acquisition and implementation of design and test tools, the development of advanced techniques to reverse engineer circuits, the adaptation of tools and processes to detect increasingly sophisticated counterfeit microelectronics in the defense supply chain, the development of trusted field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and the extension of the process technologies that are necessary to keep pace with the needs of defense customers as weapon system support requirements migrate toward current state-of-the-art technologies. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key resource in the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements in response to the newest asymmetric threats and to modernize aging weapon systems. DMEA designs, develops, and supports vital classified assets for ongoing and time-sensitive specialized intelligence operations and missions of the Department and the Special Operations Commands. DMEA will comply with DoD Strategic Objective 3.5-2D for any demonstration programs at DMEA.

Today’s weapon systems experience extended field operations and/or are required to remain in service beyond planned replacements, driving the need for growth in DMEA’s unique capabilities. This need, along with the continual contraction of commercial resources, makes DMEA the only available resource allowing these systems to remain operational. As such, DMEA and its capability are considered a National Critical Asset.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The increased missions seen in the last several years by Combatant Commands (COCOMs) and Special Operations have caused those organizations to dramatically increase their demands for DMEA’s unique capability to provide quick technical solutions to immediate operational needs. To meet these increases, DMEA will add capacity and capability by recapitalizing and modernizing aging microelectronic infrastructure, extending and upgrading process IP, developing advanced techniques to reverse engineer circuits, adapting tools and processes to detect increasingly sophisticated counterfeit microelectronics to ensure a secure supply chain, and developing trusted field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), all to meet quick turn solutions on which COCOMs and Special Operations can rely.</r2:Text>

However, the proposed annual reductions to DMEA’s budget will delay and complicate the recapitalization and modernization of DMEA’s infrastructure.  DMEA modernization is critical to keep pace with the evolving long-term technical support requirements of DoD’s major weapon systems.  Delaying modernization will negatively impact DMEA’s historically impressive responsiveness and result in troubled weapon systems staying in mission incapable status for prolonged periods of time.  The inability of programs to resolve their technical issues “surgically” at DMEA, may force them to adopt higher level solutions at higher cost. Therefore, as vital as this DMEA infrastructure is currently, as the overall Department funding is reduced, the capability and responsiveness provided by this organization becomes more essential.   These proposed reductions will not only cause the deferral of all further increases in workload, but will likely reduce the ability to provide specialized support to current clients.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department and the National Security Agency (NSA) require uninterruptible access to state-of-the-art design and manufacturing processes to produce custom integrated circuits designed specifically for military purposes. Under DODI 5200.44, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical/essential systems need to be procured from Trusted sources in order to avoid tampered or sabotaged parts. Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities (foundries) is making fabless semiconductor companies the norm in the U.S. Sophisticated off-shore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies have resulted in outsourcing of electronics component and integrated circuit services to offshore facilities. These trends threaten the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic on-shore suppliers and reducing access to Trusted fabrication sources for advanced technologies. These trends are of acute concern to the defense and intelligence community. Secure communications and cryptographic applications, among other defense applications depend heavily upon high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement can translate into a significant force multiplier and capability advantage. Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors.

The Trusted Foundry program provides the Department and NSA with access to the Trusted state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities necessary to meet the confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs of their customers. The program also provides the Services with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components. The NSA Trusted Access Program Office, has successfully contracted with commercial sources to satisfy their state-of-the-art semiconductor requirements. It is imperative for a wide range of technologies in ongoing and future Department/ and NSA systems that access to Trusted suppliers continues. Most importantly, Trusted Foundry access is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs requiring state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY 2013 ($-33.048M) and FY 2014 ($-2.700) Secretary of Defense Initiatives
The Defense Enterprise Business Systems (DEBS) was addressing not only Sequestration but an overall RDT&amp;E proposed Congressional Reduction.  Due to the uncertainty of these issues,  investment programs reduced immediate FY2013 and FY2014 execution requirements to those actions needed to prevent breaks in service pending final resolution of the President's budget.  The delay in the final approval of the budget also impacted the ability to initiate planned acquisition  that have longer contractual lead times.  The combined impact of the actions resulted in  Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI) delaying the start of mandatory ERP software version migration to Oracle R12 to FY2014 and delaying the deployment to additional Agencies; Defense Retiree and Annuitant Pay System (DRAS2) 2, delayed the prime contract award until  FY 2014; Defense Information System for Security (DISS) delayed and down scoped key contract actions needed to fully implement the intent of Section 3001 Public Law 108-458, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12.  Funds that would have supported functional enhancements to the Defense Travel System (DTS), Wide Area Workflow and systematic technology research were diverted to the higher priority programs.

FY 2015 Secretary of Defense Initiatives: $1.117million - due to additional DEBS program requirements.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The BEIS utilized the mature, existing infrastructure of Defense Corporate Database/Defense Corporate Warehouse (DCD/DCW), Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS), and Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) to provide timely, accurate, and reliable business information from across the DoD to support auditable financial statements as well as provide detailed information visibility for management in support of the Warfighter.  The goals of BEIS are to ensure data compliance with Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) standards; provide security-defined, enterprise-level access to information for ad hoc management queries; and produce external financial management reports/statements based on standardized data.  BEIS provides solutions to these goals by:
- Establishing the authoritative source for SFIS values and providing for standardization by implementing SFIS and United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) compliant financial reporting capabilities for Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports.
- Providing an enterprise-wide information environment that will serve as the single source for enterprise-wide financial information.
- Serving as the DoD-wide system for Treasury Reporting.
- Providing decision makers with significantly greater access to financial information through data visibility and business intelligence (e.g., Executive Dashboard).
The BEIS functional baseline encompasses a family of services organized into six distinct lines of business, four of which have achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC).  The remaining two services, Financial Reporting Services and Cash Accountability Reporting Services, will provide DoD enterprise-wide financial visibility and will serve as the centralized financial data source and the single source for enterprise Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports, as well as Treasury Reporting.  The BEIS financial management capabilities will be used by the Military Services, Defense Agencies, and the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller).  These modernization efforts will complete deployment/implementation of BEIS capabilities and will serve the Department Auditability goals and objectives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>BEIS leveraged existing infrastructure in DoD’s investment in DCD/DCW, DDRS, and DCAS. BEIS formally implemented a portfolio management approach to program management that helped to ensure a management strategy was in place to better reallocate assets within the portfolio. BEIS has and will continue to deliver needed capabilities more rapidly and efficiently using a Family of Systems (FoS) concept providing a functional baseline organized into six distinct lines of business: General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, Enterprise Level Business Intelligence Services, Cash Accountability and Reporting Services, and Financial Reporting Services. These services are provided by individual IT systems that collectively, make up the BEIS FoS. The BEIS FoS program is composed of four core systems; Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS), Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI), and Defense Corporate Database/Defense Corporate Warehouse (DCD/DCW). Capabilities are being developed incrementally with multiple releases per year to meet the Enterprise Transition Plan milestones provided to Congress. BEIS has achieved FOC for the following system components/services: DCD/DCW, to include General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, and Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI) and transitioned these to DFAS for operations and sustainment.   Based on the list of remaining requirements for BEIS DDRS Financial Reporting Services and BEIS DCAS Cash Accountability and Reporting Services an overall schedule including integrated activities as well as identified products and milestones has been developed. Contracts are competitively awarded to keep costs down. Intra-governmental services are being used where possible for infrastructure support by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Technical Services Organization and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Information Processing Center.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DAI mission is to deliver auditable Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliant business environments for Defense Agencies providing accurate, timely, authoritative financial data supporting the DoD goal of standardizing financial management practices improving financial decision support, and supporting audit readiness.  Currently, Defense Agencies use more than 10 different non-compliant financial management systems supporting diverse operational functions and the warfighter in decision making and financial reporting.  These disparate, non-integrated systems do not meet statutory requirements to produce timely, auditable reports.


The DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies’ financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of  agencies and field activities across the DoD.  DAI will support a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision making.   The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a “.mil” environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.


The DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), version 11i (R11).  DAI implemented an Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards.   The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative source).  


DAI supports the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Strategy 5, “Reform the business and support functions of the Defense enterprise”.  DAI is also aligned to the FY 2012/FY 2013 DOD Strategic Management Plan Business Goal 2: “Strengthen DoD financial management to respond to warfighter needs and sustain public confidence through auditable financial statements”. The objective of the Defense Agencies Initiative is to achieve auditable, CFO Act compliant business environments for the Defense Agencies with accurate, timely, authoritative financial data. 


The primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements. Common business functions within budget execution include  the Department’s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report; Procure to Pay;  Acquire to Retire (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (Time and Labor reporting only); and Order to Cash.  Future capabilities will support Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, Budget Formulation, Grants Financial Management, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA)) as well as a Contract Writing capability.


DAI is currently implemented at 11 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, (OUSD(C)) (Time and Labor only) and supporting over 9,200 users.  In addition, since Oracle is phasing out maintenance of Oracle EBS, Release 11i, the program is required to migrate to EBS Release 12 (R12). The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system.  Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, complete the R12 upgrade, initiate the annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE 16) assertion packages, and sustain the system.  


The benefits of DAI are:
- Common business processes and data standards;
- Access to real-time financial data transactions;
- Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;
- Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities; Standardized line of accounting with the use of SFIS; and
- Use of United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.


The DAI PMO will provide the R12 Upgrade system integration services that include: acquisition management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows (RICEFW) objects; testing (information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, security, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated enterprise resource planning system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DAI is being developed and implemented using an evolutionary/incremental strategy including major annual software releases to accommodate upgrades as required by changes to the Department’s BEA including new laws, regulations and policies as governed by its Functional Sponsor and Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).  DAI anticipates receiving an Acquisition Decision Memorandum establishing DAI as a MAIS in the DoD Acquisition Lifecycle.  The DAI PMO will establish an Acquisition Program Baseline with the Program Executive Officer (PEO) and MDA.  The PMO will also prepare for an Acquisition Milestone B review.   

The PMO is responsible for all aspects of program control and execution. The DAI PMO will use a combination of contract types to support the development of required capabilities.  Since the DAI PMO serves as the system integrator, the PMO will use a collaborative team of support contractors that will provide expertise in critical/functional areas.  The PMO will re-compete services as they expire.  The PMO will seek to increase small business involvement.  The PMO does not intend to bundle services or obtain a system integrator.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The following performance metrics will be performed on the DAI system:  

Functionality: Financial system performance.  PEO will determine substantial compliance with the annual Investment Review of PMO assertion of compliance with the latest version of the Department’s BEA in scope requirements for Defense Financial Management Improvement Guidance (DFMIG) and other laws regulations and policy. Objective: Substantial compliance.

Program Conformance to BEA Processes, Data Standards, and Business Rules.  The PEO will determine substantial compliance with the annual Investment Review of PMO assertion of compliance with the latest version of the Department’s BEA. Objective: Substantial compliance.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Information System for Security (DISS) is a family of systems solution that specifically addresses the security clearance and suitability determinations requirements of Section 3001 of Public Law 108-458, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) which requires 90% of all clearances – whether Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential – to be completed within 60 days, as well as supports Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) compliance across the DOD.  The DISS will electronically collect, review, and share relevant data, government-wide, as mandated by the IRPTA and, guided by relevant Executive Orders, Congress, and GAO recommendations, deliver and maintain an appropriately vetted world-class workforce.  

As a secure, end-to-end IT system, the DISS will be the authoritative source for the management, storage, and timely dissemination of and access to personnel security, HSPD-12, and suitability information and will accelerate the clearance process, reduce security clearance vulnerabilities, decrease back-end processing timelines, and support simultaneous information sharing within various DOD entities as well as among a number of authorized federal agencies.  

The DISS family of systems is comprised of two components: the Case Adjudication Tracking System (CATS) and the Joint Verification System (JVS).  Once fully deployed, the DISS family of systems will replace the Joint Personnel Adjudication System, which contains approximately six million active security clearance records and supports over 80,000 users.  The DISS has also been designated as the repository for adjudicative results for Suitability and HSPD-12 determinations by the 13 July 2011 USD(I) memo “Storage of Adjudicative Results in the Defense Information System for Security.”</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The DISS (CATS) has been designated as the DoD non-Intelligence Community IT system for case management and adjudications by the 10 April 2009 USD(I) memo “Designation of the DoD Case Management and Adjudication Systems.”  Currently, CATS processes over 500,000 cases annually; electronically producing favorable adjudicative decisions for approximately 24% of Secret level cases.

Further, the 3 May 2012 Deputy Secretary of Defense Memo “DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Consolidation” consolidated all DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) into one consolidated DoD CAF responsible for personnel security adjudicative functions as well as favorable Suitability and HSPD-12 adjudications.  The DISS (CATS) is the DOD CAF’s designated IT case management system.

Achieving the above goals will significantly enhance the operational readiness of the national security community and the Federal government.  It will decrease the time required to get an individual through the investigation process.  It will strengthen and reinforce reciprocity throughout the federal community by eliminating redundant or incomplete investigations by standardizing adjudicative decisions and by making available to all agencies adjudicative determinations of the Federal government.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Defense Information System for Security (DISS) is being fielded as a Family of Systems (FoS) employing an evolutionary acquisition approach by fielding incremental capabilities.  The CATS v3 is currently deployed to end users; however the CATS v4 Development will support the consolidated DoD Central Adjudication Facility business processes with a single CATS system.  The JVS increment will enter the Business Capability Lifecycle (BCL) at Milestone B, according to the Material Development Decision (MDD) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed by the Milestone Decision Authority on 25 April, 2011.   

The DISS PMO is responsible for program execution and will employ contract types as directed by the agency contracts policies in order to support the delivery and sustainment of the DISS Capabilities.  DISS development contractors employ an agile development methodology to allow for a flexible approach that incorporates user requirements and feedback throughout the development lifecycle while meeting delivery requirements as prescribed by the associated development contract. The Agile development methodology allows for the fielding of incremental capabilities IAW the program’s acquisition approach.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Travel System (DTS) is a fully integrated, electronic, end-to-end financial management system that automates temporary duty travel for the Department of Defense (DoD). DTS meets unique DoD mission, security and financial system requirements within the guidelines of Federal and DoD travel policies and regulations. DTS automates travel authorizations, reservations and arrangements, voucher processing, payment, reconciliation, accountability and archiving. DTS employs Digital Signature and Login/Authentication which requires users to provide a signed response using a valid DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate to gain access to the DTS application. Travel documents created in DTS are digitally signed with the user’s PKI certificate to provide a means of identifying the signer, verifying the document’s integrity, and enforcing non-repudiation of the signature by the signer.

DTS is a Major Automated Information System (MAIS), Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1AC program. DTS delivers capability by evolutionary acquisition utilizing incremental development; recognizing up front the need for future capability improvements. DTS has a flexible design so that each increment builds upon its core functionality, dependent on available, mature technology providing increasing capabilities to travelers, travel administrators, and process owners. Full Operational Capability (FOC) was declared in March 2010. Future capability improvements will be implemented as P3I beginning FY 2011.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Virtual Interactive Processing System (VIPS) was planned to modernize and automate the Information Technology capabilities for qualifying Applicants into the Military Service.  VIPS would have been the future accessioning system to be used by the US Military Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM) and would have replaced their legacy system, USMEPCOM Integrated Resource System (USMIRS). USMEPCOM serves as the single entry point for determining the physical, aptitude, and conduct qualifications of candidates for enlistment. VIPS would have provided the capability to electronically acquire, process, store, secure, and seamlessly share personnel data across the Accessions Community of Interest. If VIPS had been fully implemented, VIPS would have reduced the cycle time required to induct enlistees to meet the needs of Homeland Defense, reduced the number of visits to the Military Entrance Processing Stations, reduced manual data entry errors, and reduced attrition through better pre-screening practices. GAO reported that better pre-screening practices would have yielded cost savings and cost avoidance of $83M per year for the VIPS automated elements.  

Due to schedule delays and further refinement of the requirements, VIPS entered into a Critical Change state on May 11, 2011.  The Department of Defense (DoD) Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO) Acquisition Decision Memorandum dated December 7, 2012, cancelled the VIPS program and directed the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to conduct a Technical Demonstration (TD) of a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) to inform any future acquisition approach to meet existing requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>In FY 2013 the VIPS PMO acted in accordance with the DCMO directive to conduct a TD of a SOA capabilty to inform any future acquisition approach to meet existing requirement that was issued in FY2012.  Concluded any existing VIPS development efforts as part of a smart shutdown.  Additionally, conducted an orderly shutdown of the existing VIPS development efforts.  Identified critical deliverables such as hardware, design specifications, instrumentation, modeling tools, etc. for delivery to the Government.  

In coordination with USMEPCOM the former VIPS PMO established a TD for a Medical Pre-Screen Capability.  The TD was initiated in FY2013 and was established to inform an acquisition approach and business case for a future program to meet the existing USMEPCOM accession system requirements.  The TD was also established to serve as a risk reduction for a SOA link to the integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR)program.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Originally the VIPS Progam had intended to align with the BCL and had planned to use an incremental approach to satisfy USMEPCOM’s requirements. Requirements had been articulated to support the development of the core platform for VIPS as well as capabilities to fully assess a candidate into the military. The revised Increment 1.0 content would have provided sufficient capability to retire the legacy system, USMEPCOM Integrated Resource System (USMIRS) through a series of capability deployments beginning in FY 2014. Future increments would have addressed the full VIPS capabilities necessary to realize the Return on Investment (ROI).

Originally the VIPS Increment 1.0 was procured under a single contract, competitively awarded to provide both a core infrastructure and business functions to support the accessions process. The VIPS PMO awarded a single Increment 1.0 contract on September 30, 2010 that would have initially provided for the design of VIPS Increment 1.0 through PDR. The prime contractor sucessfully completed the design, development, and acceptance testing of the ROC prototype. On May 11, 2011, the VIPS PMO entered Critical Change state and the DCMO directive dated December 7, 2012 issued new direction for the program to conduct a TD for a SOA capability.  The VIPS PMO has complied with the DCMO directive and is currently working with the prime contractor to satisfy the memo's direction.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>WAWF is the DoD enterprise system for secure electronic submission, acceptance and processing of invoices. It is mandated for use by all DoD Services and Agencies for electronic invoicing by DFAR 252.232-7003. WAWF processes over 86 million transactions worth $301B per year and saves DoD millions of dollars annually in processing cost and avoided interest (over $77.6 M in FY10). WAWF brings together the invoice, the receiving report, and the contract from EDA to provide the accounting and entitlement systems with the three-way match needed to authorize payment. WAWF is also the Enterprise data entry point for the Item Unique Identifier (IUID) and Government Furnished Property (GFP) programs, the source of receipt and acceptance data for Service Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERP), and is central for the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) enterprise solutions for Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) and Inter Governmental Transfer (IGT). The benefits to DoD are a single face to industry suppliers, global accessibility of documents, reduced need for re-keying, improved data accuracy, real-time processing, secure transactions with audit capability, and faster processing resulting in reduced interest penalties. For vendors, benefits include the capability to electronically submit invoices, reduction of lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contract payment records.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The primary objective of Defense Retired and Annuitant Pay System 2 (DRAS 2) is to establish and maintain a modernized retired military pay accounts.  DRAS 2 will replace the current Defense Retiree and Annuitant Systems (DRAS) and selected manual processes with proven state of the market technology using Clinger-Cohen guidance for selection of the solution.  Rapid fielding techniques will be used to close business process gaps by delivering incremental capability that provides clear financial benefits.  This modernization will allow for the consolidation of disparate DRAS systems and processes, the reduction of system redundancies and inefficiencies, increased customer satisfaction and compliance to Department of Defense (DoD) and federally mandated Information Assurance (IA) requirements.  The DRAS2 modernization is in keeping with the DoD Strategic Management Plan for FY2014-2015 goals and the White House CIO Council 2.0 initiatives.  In FY2015, DRAS 2 has it's own PE 0605090S separate from the PE referenced in this submission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD) is a multi-service/multi-agency solution established as a key initiative to provide full visibility of funds distributed through echelon I and II for the Military Departments and at all levels for the Defense Agencies to improve and modernize the OUSD(C) funds distribution process.   Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place.  

Within the current DoD environment, progress has been made streamlining a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems.  Efforts continue to improve the visibility of funding information, eliminate manual efforts and  undue complexities to the management of budget authority, and to eliminate impediments in the flow of funding documents.  The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions.   This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous.  

The envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow.  Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data.  Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.

The operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment.  The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program is to support the Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI), an Acquisition Category I program.  Previous funding for DAI was documented in the Defense Enterprise Business Systems program element 0605070S.


The DAI mission is to deliver auditable Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliant business environments for Defense Agencies providing accurate, timely, authoritative financial data supporting the DoD goal of standardizing financial management practices improving financial decision support, and supporting audit readiness.  Currently, Defense Agencies use more than 10 different non-compliant financial management systems supporting diverse operational functions and the warfighter in decision making and financial reporting.  These disparate, non-integrated systems do not meet statutory requirements to produce timely, auditable reports.


The DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies’ financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of  agencies and field activities across the DoD.  DAI will support a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision making.   The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a “.mil” environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.


The DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), version 11i (R11).  DAI implemented an Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards.   The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative source).  


DAI supports the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Strategy 5, “Reform the business and support functions of the Defense enterprise”.  DAI is also aligned to the FY 2012/FY 2013 DOD Strategic Management Plan Business Goal 2: “Strengthen DoD financial management to respond to warfighter needs and sustain public confidence through auditable financial statements”. The objective of the Defense Agencies Initiative is to achieve auditable, CFO Act compliant business environments for the Defense Agencies with accurate, timely, authoritative financial data. 


The primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements. Common business functions within budget execution include  the Department’s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report; Procure to Pay;  Acquire to Retire (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (Time and Labor reporting only); and Order to Cash.  Future capabilities will support Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, Budget Formulation, Grants Financial Management, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA)) as well as a Contract Writing capability.


DAI is currently implemented at 11 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, (OUSD(C)) (Time and Labor only) and supporting over 9,200 users.  In addition, since Oracle is phasing out maintenance of Oracle EBS, Release 11i, the program is required to migrate to EBS Release 12 (R12). The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system.  Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, complete the R12 upgrade, initiate the annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE 16) assertion packages, and sustain the system.  


The benefits of DAI are:
- Common business processes and data standards;
- Access to real-time financial data transactions;
- Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;
- Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities; Standardized line of accounting with the use of SFIS; and
- Use of United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.


The DAI PMO will provide the R12 Upgrade system integration services that include: acquisition management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows (RICEFW) objects; testing (information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, security, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated enterprise resource planning system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DAI is being developed and implemented using an evolutionary/incremental strategy including major annual software releases to accommodate upgrades as required by changes to the Department’s BEA including new laws, regulations and policies as governed by its Functional Sponsor and Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).  DAI anticipates receiving an Acquisition Decision Memorandum establishing DAI as a MAIS in the DoD Acquisition Lifecycle.  The DAI PMO will establish an Acquisition Program Baseline with the Program Executive Officer (PEO) and MDA.  The PMO will also prepare for an Acquisition Milestone B review.   

The PMO is responsible for all aspects of program control and execution. The DAI PMO will use a combination of contract types to support the development of required capabilities.  Since the DAI PMO serves as the system integrator, the PMO will use a collaborative team of support contractors that will provide expertise in critical/functional areas.  The PMO will re-compete services as they expire.  The PMO will seek to increase small business involvement.  The PMO does not intend to bundle services or obtain a system integrator.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

-Batch Throughput – Completion rate and delivery by specified time during batch window specified in SLA
b) Database related (DAI Program Management Office)
-System Availability 
-On Line user system response


3) Network Management:
-The Agency (user) being supported is responsible for the communications infrastructure necessary for leaving their location to connect users to the NIPRNet 
-DISA is responsible for communications on NIPRNet between the end user and the main DAI environment
-DAI Program Management Office is responsible for activities occurring within the application and the Oracle Database

4) Systems Management 
-NIPRNet and Infrastructure  - Centralized within DISA CSD 
-DAI System – centralized within DAI Program Management Office

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA's) ability to deliver Americans the right logistics solution in every transaction requires more than successful management of the Department's wholesale supplies and suppliers. It requires supply chain excellence. Our military's ability to generate and sustain combat readiness indefinitely, anywhere on the globe requires that DLA-managed materiel flow seamlessly and as needed from the nation's industrial base to where it is ultimately used.

DLA's Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program seeks to solicit high-risk research and development proposals from the small business community. All selections shall demonstrate and involve a degree of technical risk where the technical feasibility of the proposed work has not been fully established. Phase I proposals should demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology and the merit of a Phase II for a prototype or at least a proof-of-concept demonstration. Phase II selections will be strongly influenced on future market possibilities and commercialization potential demonstrated.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA's) ability to deliver Americans the right logistics solution in every transaction requires more than successful management of the Department's wholesale supplies and suppliers. It requires supply chain excellence. Our military's ability to generate and sustain combat readiness indefinitely, anywhere on the globe requires that DLA-managed materiel flow seamlessly and as needed from the nation's industrial base to where it is ultimately used.

DLA's Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program seeks to solicit high-risk research and development proposals from the small business community. All selections shall demonstrate and involve a degree of technical risk where the technical feasibility of the proposed work has not been fully established. Phase I proposals should demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology and the merit of a Phase II for a prototype or at least a proof-of-concept demonstration. Phase II selections will be strongly influenced on future market possibilities and commercialization potential demonstrated.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

FY2015 - $2.655M

Lower funding will cause a significant disruption and delay for critical DLA Manufacturing Technology projects.  Reductions to the Combat Rations Program means microwave technology processing which more efficiently processes combat rations will not be ready for industrial implementation driving up support costs.  Reductions to the Customer Driven Uniform Manufacturing means the needed collaboration capability the GAO identified among the Services, DLA and the industrial base not be in place leading to non-conforming products and excess costs.  Casting Program reductions will result in cancellation of efforts that lowers costs and improves environmental compliance.  Other casting projects' schedules will be extended which will increase DOD costs.  The reduction to the forging program means new forging technology will not be implemented in the industrial base causing weapon systems' support costs to increase and readiness levels reduced.  Reductions to the Battery Network project means that new battery technology vital to operational forces may not be available in the quantities needed for emergencies at a reasonable cost.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY 2010, DLA Troop Support Subsistence sold $4.7 billion in subsistence goods and services to the Department of Defense and other customers.  The Rations portion of this business was $702M in FY 2010.  The Combat Rations R&amp;D funding request is .002% of sales. The Combat Rations Program is focused on improving the manufacturing technologies related to the production and distribution of the combat rations that are at the forefront of these operations, including Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) as well as Unitized Group Rations (UGR).  The objectives are increased readiness, improved quality, optimum sizing for transportation and storage; and better ration variety.  CORANET research efforts also help control the cost of the combat rations.  The CORANET program engages all elements of the supply chain including the producers, military Services, Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), US Army Veterinary Command, US Army Public Health Command, DLA Logistics R&amp;D, DLA Troop Support Subsistence and academia to research and transition improved technologies for operational rations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This new initiative, MUST, addresses gaps in product specifications by exploring a flexible environment that integrates multiple input and output formats to improve management, configuration control and communication between the Government and Defense Industrial Base manufacturers. Technical initiatives include developing a semantic data driven product data environment. Data mining will be adapted to populate the data models. The primary benefit will be a significant reduction in TDP errors and improved data access by the multiple tiers of industrial base.  
The MUST BAA closed in early FY 14.  Contract actions are underway and awards to MUST Partners are anticipated by the third quarter of 2014.  The MUST Roadmap is being developed.</r2:Text>

Cast parts are 2% of National Stock Numbered parts but represent 4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% of them are castings.  This program develops innovative technologies and processes to improve the procurement, manufacture, and design of weapon system spare parts that use castings.  The Procurement Readiness Optimization-Advanced Casting Technology (PRO-ACT) program takes a systems view and considers not only the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) perspective but also the Military Service Engineering Support Activities (ESA) which DLA works with to solve technical issues, as well as the industrial supply base.  The program has three components:  Rapid Acquisition, Quality, and Cost Effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Weapon system spare parts that use forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA backorders.  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered parts but represent ~4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% of them are forgings. This program develops methods and technology to improve the supply of forged parts.  This program takes a holistic view of the problem and attacks root causes inside DLA, at DLA’s engineering support activity partners in the Services, and at DLA forging suppliers.  The program has three thrusts:  Business Enterprise Integration to improve supply support approaches; FORGE-IT to develop and improve technical problems; and R&amp;D which develops new technology for forging suppliers, including new methods for making forge dies (typically the longest lead time item) and for simulation of metal flow inside the forge die (to eliminate trial and error development of the die).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Develop a capability to emulate most obsolete digital integrated circuits (ICs) in the Federal catalog using a single, flexible manufacturing line.  DoD has estimated $2.9 billion is spent every five years redesigning circuit card assemblies.  Many of these circuit card redesigns are performed to mitigate IC obsolescence.  Commercial ICs have short Product Life Cycles (often only 18 months).  IC Manufacturers subsequently move on to later generations of ICs, leaving little to no sources for their previous IC products.  DoD maintains weapons systems much longer than IC lifecycles, resulting in an obsolescence problem.  In order to avoid costs and potential readiness issues associated with buying/carrying excess inventories acquired before commercial availability ceases, or redesigning the next higher assembly to mitigate the obsolete IC, DLA (as the manager of 88% of the IC Federal Stock Class) must have the capability to manufacture needed IC devices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) has been in operation since February 1996. The PDC is a public/private partnership managed by the University of Hawaii (UH) under a cooperative agreement with the Department of Defense.  It is functionally within the organization of the USD(P),  ASD(HD&amp;ASA), and DASD(DCCM). The PDC is a world-recognized authority and leader in science and information technology applications relating to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR). PDC’s applications and information products enhance preparedness, situational awareness, and civil-military communications for humanitarian missions worldwide, while its national-level socio-economic Risk and Vulnerability Assessments help inform strategies by measuring indicators for national resiliency using scientific methods.

The PDC Program Office’s (USD(P),  ASD(HD&amp;ASA), and DASD(DCCM)) primary responsibility is for management and stewardship of governmental funds provided in Defense Department appropriations for DoD missions associated with DoD CrM, HA/DR, Theater Security Cooperation, and DSCA. In doing this, the Program Office develops and provides policy, oversight and guidance, and jointly develops strategic guidelines, programmatic content and priorities with the UH and PDC. The PDC Program Office also serves as a support element of the Hawaii-based organization especially in the area of gaining Federal agency support and resources, as well as business opportunities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
