                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>AITS-JPO identifies and integrates new and mature commercial information technology (IT) and advanced operational concepts into net-centric battlespace capabilities to: access and exchange critical information; exploit opportunities to enhance current force capabilities; and project future force IT requirements. AITS-JPO supports preparing for future joint force and coalition initiatives through developing and integrating a full range of data services and advanced IT applications to support cooperative activities between the US and its coalition partners. These emergent capabilities are technologies that can be rapidly infused into existing tools.  

The program uses three key mechanisms to streamline the process of fielding emergent requirements: (1) Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTD) with Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)/Combatant Command/Service/Agency teaming; (2) Joint Ventures with Combatant Commanders/Program of Record (POR) teaming; and (3) Risk Mitigation Pilots with POR/Community of Interest teaming. The JCTD process aligns with the revised Joint Capability Integration and Development System process, developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff by adapting technology and concept solutions to meet pressing warfighter needs. OSD approves new JCTDs annually and on a rolling start basis. Defense Information Systems Agency participates in both an operational and transition manager role. The JCTDs and the Joint Ventures and risk mitigation pilots, use a teaming approach thereby sharing costs and reducing the risk to individual organizations.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>AITS-JPO identifies and integrates new and mature commercial information technology (IT) and advanced operational concepts into net-centric battlespace capabilities to: access and exchange critical information; exploit opportunities to enhance current force capabilities; and project future force IT requirements. These products provide the Department of Defense (DoD) and National Senior Leaders, (e.g., the President of the United States, Secretary of Defense, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), as well as inter-agency participants with critical focus on the long-term collaboration, planning and information sharing. The AITS-JPO supports future joint and coalition initiatives by developing and integrating a range of data services and advanced IT applications. These emergent capabilities are technologies that can be rapidly infused into existing tools for use by the US and coalition partners.  

Program investments in advanced technology benefit strategic and tactical users in the intelligence, warfighting and business domains by providing them with reliable, persistent collaboration, and networking technologies including computing-on-demand to reduce the need to replicate data or services at the point of consumption. Investments also provide support for virtual end-user environments and semantic search capabilities which enhance the decision-making process. These capabilities provide the warfighter with technical superiority and to achieve interoperability and integration, while working in concert with joint, allied and coalition forces to effectively counter terrorism and enhance homeland security defense. 

The program is further divided into major subprogram areas:  Command and Control (C2) and Combat Support, Information Sharing, Network Infrastructure, Network Operations (NetOps), Cyber Threat Discovery and Program Management Support.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The program accomplishes its mission through a combination of strategies focused on operations, technical integration, program management, and financial tracking. Market research during the acquisition process includes a review of DISA contracts, other DoD contract vehicles, and other Government agency contracts which are advertised for Government-wide usage.  This market research also includes consideration of small businesses including, minority/women owned (8A) businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, mentor/protégé and other specialized contract vehicles and processes.  It evaluates all contractors available from DISA sources for their ability to deliver the products specifically required for the unique program efforts.  The program works collaboratively with vendors to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provide additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources help provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts are awarded with multiple option periods. These have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts. The AC&amp;E Division reviews existing contract vehicles and the number of contracts to minimize administrative overhead.  Instead of individual contracts for program management, business line improvement, asset management, and financial management, there is now one small business program services contract that provides services across DISA.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Performance metrics track cost, schedule, performance and program risk. Metrics track each type of technology investigation and piloting through In-Progress Reviews. OSD AT&amp;L holds program reviews twice a year to review cost, schedule, performance and delivery. For JCTDs, the program office develops an Implementation Directive and Management Plan. These guidance documents outline the project objectives, schedule, and funding for the JCTD. Military utility will be assessed by each JCTD who develop and document the detailed objectives. The Operational Sponsor (a COCOM) will evaluate the process and measure results. For technology investigation and piloting, DISA CTO uses standard operating procedures for identifying objectives and metrics.  Key metrics used include: utility of technology, time to delivery of technologies to the field, percentage of improvement in transition of technologies, and percentage of improvement in collaborative efforts with other Science and Technology organizations.  CTO met its FY 2012 performance targets.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Combat Support System - Joint (GCSS-J), is a key enabler for achieving Focused Logistics and is essential during peace, contingency, crisis, and war in support of the joint warfighter across the full range of military operations. GCSS-J, the Logistics System of Record, provides a Joint Logistics Common Operational Picture to ensure the right personnel, equipment, supplies, and support are in the right place at the right time and in the right quantities to mobilize, move, and sustain all elements of operating forces within a theater or operational area. 

GCSS-J gathers data from authoritative sources to provide a fused, integrated, near real-time, multidimensional view of combat support and combat service support across joint capability areas. These efforts provide situational awareness of the battlespace and logistics pipeline (e.g., supply, deployment and distribution, engineering, etc.). Using GCSS-J, the joint logistics warfighter no longer needs to log into multiple legacy systems and manually gather data to compile reports. GCSS-J provides real time actionable information in the form of watchboards (e.g., fuels and munitions watchboards) and near real time information in the form of reports and mapping visualizations.

                                            <r2:Text>GCSS-J will continue to meet the functional priorities of the joint logistics community, as documented by Combatant Command 129 requirements and approved by Joint Staff (J4). The Program will leverage the Joint Command and Control Common User Interface (JC2CUI) Ozone Widget Framework (OWF) to develop widgets to support Combatant Commands. The focus will be to provide widgets and new capability development using integrated data sources via web services which will provide a fused, integrated, near real-time view of combat support and combat service support throughout the battlespace and the logistics pipeline through interoperability and connectivity of information system.

The decrease -$7.587 from FY 2013 to FY 2014 reduces the overall pace and scope of development efforts of the GCSS program while leveraging efficiencies across the DISA Command and Control (C2) portfolio in support of OSD CIO guidance on IT efficiencies. The GCSS-J program will continue to focus on satisfying the most pressing Joint Staff logistics operational needs.  Funding will be realigned within the DISA Command and Control portfolio for higher C2 developmental requirements.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The GCSS-J Program Management Office (PMO) uses various contract types, employs large and small contractors, and is focused on achieving agency socio-economic goals and incorporating DoD acquisition reform initiatives in purchasing. The PMO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives. The PMO evaluates performance by conducting thorough Post-award Contract Reviews, monthly Contract Performance Reviews, and bi-monthly In-Process Reviews.  

The PMO uses a Statement of Objectives (SOO) for development efforts rather than the traditional Statement of Work, as it provides potential offerors flexibility to develop cost-effective solutions and the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives to meet GCSS-J requirements. By stating the requirements in a SOO, the contractor can produce a technical solution methodology to deliver leading edge technology to the warfighter.
</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>GCSS-J fields capabilities based on functional priorities of the Combatant Command 129 Requirements as approved and prioritized by the functional sponsor, Joint Staff J4. These requirements and goals are translated into releases with specific capabilities, which have established cost, schedule, and performance parameters approved by the DISA's Component Acquisition Executive/Milestone Decision Authority.  

Metrics and requirements are routinely gathered by the GCSS-J PMO. The metrics from the strategic server sites are analyzed by the PMO to ensure that operational mission threads continue to be met and if system enhancement/capabilities are of benefiting the user. Future capabilities include tools that allow GCSS-J to refine and enhance the type of performance metrics that can be gathered and analyzed. These tools become increasingly important as GCSS-J continues to integrate additional data sources and external applications, which allows GCSS-J to continue to transition to a Service Oriented Architecture and directly supports DoD's net-centric vision of exposing and consuming web services. As GCSS-J usage increases and new capabilities are fielded, performance metrics will ensure that the system is meeting user requirements.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As the Department of Defense's (DoD's) only non-Service Joint Operational Test Agency (OTA), the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) conducts Operational Test and Evaluations (OT&amp;E) to determine the operational effectiveness, suitability, interoperability, and survivability of systems. Efforts include:

•  Conducting lifecycle testing, evaluation, and certification of DoD Information Technology/National Security Systems (IT/NSS) that are acquired, assigned, or managed by the Services, Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and other Defense Agencies. 

•  Designing OT&amp;E events to determine if DISA and other agency’s IT systems meet user requirements, providing sustaining support services to users to help Acquisition Program Managers meet overall milestone objectives.

•  Ensuring DoD OT&amp;E best practices by working with the Office of the Secretary of Defense to improve Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) policy for IT systems, designing new test methodologies to better assess Enterprise Service systems, and aligning T&amp;E planning and execution with the Information Technology Service Management model.  

As the DoD’s Joint Interoperability Certification Authority, the JITC:
 
•   Ensures interoperability test and certification standard practices and procedures are in accordance with DoD policy, and reviews and issues over 600 Joint interoperability certifications for DoD’s IT/NSS. 

•  Manages the scheduling and prioritization of multiple annual distributed Joint Tactical Data Link simulated test events using real components (hardware in the loop interoperability test events) designed to evaluate, certify and re-certify Service/Agency Tactical systems.

•  Provides Interoperability test support within the area of responsibility and conducts exercises to evaluate Joint, Coalition and Allied operations in, or planning to deploy to theater by:

  –  Providing on-demand rapid response contingency support to Regional Combatant Commands (COCOMs), including enhancing the assessment of three of the largest interoperability exercises (the Endeavors).   
  –  Maintaining a 24x7 Warfighter C4I Interoperability Hotline and producing lessons learned reports each quarter containing published configurations for confident deployment of any equipment, anywhere and certifying that capability is interoperable in a tactical environment.
  –  Establishing the framework for the conduct of annual independent evaluations and a status of interoperability through DoD Interoperability Communications Exercises (DICE).

                                            <r2:Text>Enhanced core capabilities, OT&amp;E policy, operational evaluation, and centralized data management. Developed an OT&amp;E guidebook defining recommended processes and procedures, and provided OT&amp;E-specific training to Test Directors and Action Officers. Established an Operational Evaluation Cell to ensure test programs adhered to operational test policy and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) directives. Developed consistent integrated evaluation strategies and mission oriented evaluations, and applied agile test methodologies and statistical rigor to data collection and analysis.

Developed and implemented a data management capability that provided a persistent suite of automated data management tools to provide data collection, storage, authentication, trouble reporting, and analysis of test data. These capabilities ensure consistency and commonality across test programs, enabling sharing test results for acquisition decisions, shortening test reporting cycles, and reducing duplicative test efforts.

In cooperation with OSD DOT&amp;E, automated over 600 manual call scripts as a prototype automation and Testing as a Service (TaaS) approach and methodology for the Defense Logistics Agency and other DoD Agencies.

Enhanced workforce capabilities for writing and executing test methodologies through specialized training designed to help Milestone Decision Authorities make fielding decisions based on more statistically rigorous test results.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Major Range Test Facility Base (MRTFB) Operations sustain the infrastructure, capabilities and services of DISA’s MRTFB. While maintaining a focus on improving automation, instrumentation and virtualization, this MRTFB is working toward ensuring assets support customers with testing on demand services to enable rapid delivery of enhanced military capabilities at a reduced cost.

Test facilities are located in Ft. Huachuca, AZ; Indian Head, MD; Ft. Meade, MD with infrastructure comprised of 140,000 square feet of raised floor space, four acres of outdoor information technology (IT) range space divided into 47 unique environments; reachable through eight different communication networks. Additionally, the infrastructure is compliant with multiple levels of security, scaled to support more than 1,000 annual testing events to evaluate the DoD’s Command, Control, Communications, Computing and Intelligence (C4I) Information, cyber technology and enterprise (Cloud) services.  

This infrastructure can be configured into more than 350 unique configurations to support any interoperability testing event worldwide.

MRTFB Capabilities encompass reference implementation models (RIM) of more than 200 IT systems, testing tools to aid both test execution and data collection/analysis, and structured test and evaluation (T&amp;E) methodologies and processes.  
–  The RIMs represent major C4I capabilities (e.g. data link standards and sensors); Cyber IT (e.g. Public Key Infrastructure(PKI) and Host Based Security System(HBSS)); Command and Control (C2) systems (e.g. Common Data Link); tactical transport systems (e.g. Teleport, HF/RF/UHF); Intelligence Systems (e.g. Motion Imagery and Integrated Broadcast System); enterprise services (e.g. mobile device managers, Infrastructure as a Service, enterprise email); and enterprise environments (e.g. Coalition Interoperability Assurance and Validation, Joint Information Environment (JIE)) and others.
–  The testing tools expedite T&amp;E in areas supporting Business Transformation (e.g. Hewlett Packard Performance Center); Exercise Support (e.g. Joint Analysis Net-centric Enabled Test Tools); Enterprise Services (e.g. DISA Enterprise Test Environment and TestForge.mil); CYBER IT (Mission Thread Tool) and others.
–  The T&amp;E Methodology Processes employ a streamlined approach to evaluating customer products against stated capabilities and/or requirements, ensuring they comply with statutory and regulatory mandates.  The methodologies are based on structured evaluation criteria designed to: test the critical elements of the product, eliminate over tested products, over priced deliverables and missed deadlines.

Will support DoD strategic initiatives by: providing the test capabilities and facilities infrastructure, process tracking and reporting systems, as well as hardware and software maintenance to enable direct test support to DoD’s major IT/NSS acquisitions (e.g., Joint Information Environment, Enterprise core services, Defense Enterprise Email, DoD Mobility Program, Global Combat Support System, Joint Tactical Data Links, C2, global/terrestrial/satellite/tactical communications systems). Will continue efforts to provision a Joint Test and Evaluation Environment that meets the requirements of the entire spectrum of DoD's IT acquisition process and life cycle needs.

The increase of +$1.311 from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the net effect of increases for civilian pay and program cost growth, and decreases for adjustments to inflation and reductions in support of the SECDEF initiative on improving DoD Operations and transfer to higher agency priorities.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Effective FY 2013, a T&amp;E Mission Support Services (MSS) cost plus and firm fixed price contract will provide T&amp;E support by performing a wide range of non-personal services to encompass testing, scientific, engineering, logistic, administrative, and ancillary support of the DISA T&amp;E missions. The T&amp;E MSS contract will provide maximum flexibility and allow for expansion and contraction of staff years as workload dictates. An additional contract will be a Federal Preferential Sole Source Procurement set-aside which will provide consolidated facilities support.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Metrics include: Percentage of time T&amp;E networks service capabilities are available to support core mission areas, with a target success rate of 98%.  TaaS results will be realized when 75% of all JITC services are provided through one or more of their DISA TaaS catalog offerings.  TaaS effectiveness will be realized when JITC services scale based on customer demand signal, on a annual basis at first, and gain more efficiencies over time scaling twice annually, and ultimately quarterly. TaaS efficiencies will be realized when customer fulfillment rates sustain 100%, with a 25% average reduced threshold and a 50% reduced time objective.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Through the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) and Pegasus (formally GRIFFIN), the Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program enables secure sharing of operational and intelligence information and enhances collaboration between United States forces, trusted allies and other multinational partners. This effort also increases overall combat effectiveness by leveraging capabilities and information from all partners and reducing the possibility of fratricide.  These coalition information sharing systems are in direct support of the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) strategic goals to “Win our Nation’s Wars” and “Deter conflict and promote security”.  The MNIS program supports five Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with connectivity in 89 nations, the North America Treaty Organization, 11 Bilateral agreements and 150 sites with over 80,000 users worldwide.  MNIS also evaluates new technologies and develops tactics, techniques and procedures to facilitate the integration of emerging technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability.  The integration of new technology for CENTRIXS and Pegasus is accomplished through research, integration, and testing using the Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network.  

A planned improvement to the CENTRIXS coalition network, Common Mission Network Transport (CMNT), will provide distinct and permanent transport capabilities;  enabling network operation centers to priority command and control information more efficiently.  CMNT supports DoD instruction 8110.1 guidance for integrating CENTRIXS and other operational networks into existing DoD general service communications infrastructure as a separate network servicing all DoD MNIS requirements.  This capability provides a common transport for encrypted traffic.  CMNT will be the established encrypted network to facilitate the movement of virtual private network traffic between segments.

The MNIS emerging capability, Unclassified Information Sharing Services (UISS), extends US information sharing capabilities to mission partners providing enterprise-level solutions that allow COCOMs to share unclassified information with US Government agencies and non-traditional partners such as, host nations, intergovernmental organizations, and nongovernmental organizations. The employment concept for the UISS is to implement enterprise Web-based, “non-mil” platform, available to as broad a community as needed to support mission operations, with worldwide, 24 hour-a-day, seven day-a-week access, to any user with an Internet connection, including web-enabled mobile personal devices.  Using an Internet-based capability and an integrated suite of commercial-off-the-shelf collaboration tools the UISS capability will enable unclassified information exchanges and ad-hoc communications for shared communities of interest and issue-specific groups among and across organizations and individuals.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program is a portfolio of four coalition information sharing capabilities designed to enable and improve sharing of operational and intelligence information among US forces and multinational partners.

1) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS), supports intelligence and classified operations at the Secret Releasable level.  There are multiple, cryptographically-isolated CENTRIXS enclaves serving various communities of interest (COI) that support multinational efforts including Overseas Contingency Operations and counter-narcotics operations. CENTRIXS is regionally focused and combatant command (COCOM) centric. The MNIS Program Management Office provides selected centralized services from two Defense Enterprise Computing Centers for five of the 40+ CENTRIXS networks/COIs, and engineering support for standardized solutions.  

2) Pegasus, (formerly GRIFFIN)/Improved Connectivity Initiative (ICI), connects the national Command and Control (C2) systems of Combined Communications Electronics Board (CCEB) Nations including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States, using commercial-off-the-shelf security appliances and cross domain solutions that facilitate situational awareness and operational planning/execution. Pegasus has a strategic focus and is member nation centric. 

3) The Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network (CFBLNet) provides a controlled coalition Research, Development, Trials and Assessment coalition information sharing “sandbox” for the US, CCEB Nations, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other mission essential nations. This sandbox is used to evaluate new technologies and to develop tactics, techniques and procedures that facilitate the transition of promising technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability enhancements.  CFBLNet's direct customers are the CCEB nations’ military operational and intelligence entities led by their US counterparts at the COCOM and Agency levels.  It is being used for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstrations, NATO missile defense initiatives, and by the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance community to test capabilities prior to deployment.

4) The Unclassified Information Sharing Service (UISS), extends US information sharing capabilities to mission partners , enterprise-level solutions that allow COCOMs to share unclassified information with other US Government agencies, host nations, inter-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, and other partners.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The National Military Command System (NMCS), operated by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, provides the President, Secretary of Defense, and other national senior leaders the ability to maintain situational and operational awareness and command and control of military forces in all crisis and/or national emergency contingencies. DISA's NMCS Engineering program meets the NMCS Systems Engineer responsibilities, per Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) S-5100.44 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3280.01B, to provide the Joint Staff with operationally efficient and cost-effective engineering solutions to ensure that components and facilities satisfy operational requirements including emergency messaging, situational awareness, crisis action, and information management.

The NMCS engineering program is vital in supporting the government's ability to safeguard national security and respond to contingencies globally and/or nuclear war. NMCS Engineering focuses on implementing collaborative tools into current and crisis operations areas, integrating adequate back-up storage and recovery of voice, video and data across the continental United States to support key leaders, transitioning nuclear command and control to Internet Protocol based networks, migrating data and voice network to next generation satellites, implementing modern crypto-logical devices, and utilizing wireless networking to support Warning Systems and situational awareness. In addition, NMCS engineering continues to maintain the NMCS Reference Guide required by DoDD S-5100.44 and to develop engineering and test plans for the installation of hardware and software systems utilized within the NMCS.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The NMCS Engineering Branch conducts regularly scheduled In-progress Program Reviews (IPRs) and Configuration Control Board (CCB) meetings to monitor status of engineering projects/tasks. Each current project/task is evaluated in terms of how well the technical work is progressing and how allocated resources are being utilized. Adjustments to resources, schedules, and technical directions are made, as required.  Future projects/tasks are also discussed, thereby ensuring an integrated approach is maintained across all related project/task areas. To further increase the utility of the IPR/CCB structure, the Joint Staff customer participates in the project/task reviews. The result of this approach is a truly integrated effort of NMCS Engineering, contractor, and Joint Staff working together to achieve common program goals. Suitable products are delivered within allocated resources and delivered on schedule 90% of the time.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Modeling and Simulation project provides architecture, systems engineering and end-to-end (E2E) analytical functions for the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and its customers, ensuring integrated capabilities to fulfill warfighter mission requirements. Modeling and Simulation activities support the Department of Defense (DoD) communications planning and investment strategy, including: application performance assessments, contingency planning, network capacity planning and diagnostics, and systems-level modeling and simulation. Project efforts provide across-theater information awareness for Combatant Commands through application solutions for integrated networks, including DoD’s missions in Afghanistan and the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) by: (1) supporting the development and implementation of Global Information Grid (GIG) Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE) processes essential to evolving the GIG in a manner that enables interoperability and E2E performance for critical GIG programs; (2) developing standardized DISA systems analyses and integration processes to improve systems integration across DISA for all DISA developed communication systems and services; and (3) providing the underlying modeling and simulation and analytical support for E2E DISA and DoD systems engineering and assessment. 

Project efforts provide DoD decision makers, with services and a suite of tools capable of identifying key points of impact on DoD command and control information systems and recommending tradeoffs within the GIG configuration with regard to prioritized performance, availability, and security. This effort will reduce the risk in products deployed to the warfighter through improved network performance and traffic analysis, and an efficient means of troubleshooting and subsequent redesign.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>GIG EWSE uses contractors for technical integrated product team support, and piloting and validation support. Booz Allen Hamilton, and Lockheed Martin are the main providers for this support. These companies are uniquely qualified to provide the necessary level of technical support needed to address GIG E2E performance issues.

Modeling and Simulation uses a range of contractors for modeling support to the various projects. Contractors range from small to large business, predominantly using open competition methods and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) tasks and utilizing multi-year (base plus option years) contracts where possible. Support includes network modeling tool and processes development to adapt to ever-evolving OSD/DISA programs and projects, analyses, capacity planning, and network redesign using the models. Some specific support (e.g., integration with proprietary software) will require contracting with OPNET (e.g., sole source). Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are also considered depending upon the task.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>A performance metric for Modeling and Simulation is DISN core bandwidth sufficiency, tied to transport and IP capacity planning and activation of bandwidth in the DISN core to keep at least 25 percent spare capacity, to allow for provisioning of unforeseen requirements and rerouting under outages.  Current status stands at 69.5% capacity, with a projected capacity status after tech refresh of 57.4%, thus maintaining spare capacity in excess of 25%.

The EWSE projects will be measured by the number of intermediate and final GIG Technical Guidance and/or GIG Technical Profiles that are published to support interoperability of DISA command and control programs and the number of engineering/technical solutions that are adopted by programs/initiatives across DoD, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), and the services. These solutions will be coordinated with the stakeholder/user to ensure EWSE has the right solution to the right problem.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) has the responsibility of defining and validating the overall technical strategies for the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) in line with the DoD IT Efficiency strategy and Department of Defense Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO) Campaign Plan. These strategies establish the foundation for technology investments, technical development, Cooperative Research and Development Agreements, and the operations and sustainment of critical net-centric products and services provided by DISA. DISA CTO conducts technical system engineering reviews and oversight. CTO’s early identification of technology needs will be managed through the Technology Management Framework (TMF), a part of the broader Advanced Technology Identification and Insertion Process (ATIIP) which uses as its substrate an institutionalized, directorate partnering construct (i.e. DISA CIO, CTO, Strategic Planning and Information (SPI), based upon an Enterprise Architecture (EA) methodology. 

The CTO supports end to end (E2E) technology evaluations, assessments, process improvements, as well as the analysis and review of all potential technology solutions, products, services, and capabilities to ensure consistency with GIG architectures and standards.  This is critical to support the Military Services, Combatant Commands, office of the Secretary of Defense/Joint Staff and other mission partners.

The CTO maintains the Technology Environment, which provides the infrastructure, tools, processes, and techniques to perform various types of assessments and evaluations. These include informal quick looks, technology demonstrations, proof-of-concept events, and technology piloting events, as well as formally orchestrated operational assessments.  The Technology Environment is capable of supporting a broad range of topics and issues such as EA, wireless and mobile computing, transport technologies, net-centricity compliance, unified capabilities services, Web 2.0, Cloud computing, and social networking.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Market research during the acquisition process includes a review of DISA contracts, other DoD contract vehicles, and other Federal Government agency contracts which are advertised for Government-wide usage.  This market research also includes consideration of small businesses including, minority/women owned (8A) businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, mentor/protégé and other specialized contract vehicles and processes. Market research evaluates all contractors available from DISA sources for their ability to deliver the products specifically required for the unique program efforts.  The program works collaboratively with vendors to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provide additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources help provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts are awarded with multiple option periods. These have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) is the Department of Defense (DoD)’s consolidated worldwide telecommunications capability that provides secure, end-to-end information transport for DoD operations.  It also provides the warfighter and the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with a robust Command, Control, Communications, Computing, and Intelligence infrastructure to support DoD net-centric missions and business requirements.  The Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN) is a DoD Secure Voice, Command and Control Network that is controlled and directed by the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  It provides multi-level secure, rapid, ad hoc, voice calling and conferencing capability to the President, Secretary of Defense, Services, COCOMs, subordinate organizations (military and civilian) and coalition allies.  DRSN also supports the National Emergency Action Decision Network (NEADN)/Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) and the Enhanced Pentagon Capability/Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network. These funds support three major efforts:

DISN Systems Engineering Support:  This effort includes:  engineering for Internet Protocol  and optical transport capabilities to ensure the essential operations of a robust and secure DISN; refreshing the systems that instrument and automate the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions and creating a single DISN-wide view for network managers and operators; other activities in support of the DRSN communications capabilities.   

NEADN/PNVC:  The NEADN provides selected system engineering for continued development and testing of the PNVC equipment for senior leaders.  The PNVC system provides a military satellite-based, survivable, secure, and near toll-quality voice conferencing capability for the President, Secretary of Defense, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior national/military leaders anywhere in the world as needed.  Funding supports the acquisition activities for the PNVC baseband equipment, including critical and essential engineering required to develop new vocoder and cryptographic and audio-summing equipment.   
 
Distributed Tactical Communications System (DTCS):  The DTCS is a variation of the Iridium satellite phone used by the warfighter under the Enhanced Mobile Satellite Service.  DTCS improves Iridium’s capability to network and sub-network users to improve performance, reduce end-to-end latency and improve data handling to the handset.  New handsets and software modifications will be required to utilize the improved service and allow Iridium satellites to “relay” information between the satellites. Funding provides engineering, development and testing resources for continued improvement to the Naval Surface Weapons Center’s Technology Prototype to a fully fielded operational capability.  Handsets are already fielded as part of a Central Command Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement.  </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The FY 2012 increase of +$5.384 provided systems engineering, test and evaluation, and program support for DoD Mobility and transition of Integrated SATCOM Operational Management (ISOM) software and hardware into the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) Operational Support System.  The increase was partially offset by reduction in conference audio requirements for the Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC).

The FY 2014 increase of +$14.871 will fund the development of Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) conference management software, additional hardware for the baseband enclosure for PNVC and implementation of Secure Mobile Infrastructure for DoD’s Mobility program.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>PNVC project metrics track the development status of program acquisition documents, as required by the component executive. These documents include:  Project Execution Plan, Concept of Operations Acquisition Strategy, Capability Production Document, System Engineering Plan and other documents required by the DISA’s Component Acquisition Executive.  Additionally, for management and system engineering support vendors, monthly reports are critical to tracking overall programmatic and engineering progress and the percent of total deliverables received on time.

For product development activities, effective progress is measured based upon the task order milestones in the form of development reviews and weekly progress meetings.  As end items (hardware and software) become available for test, additional measures will be available.  Specifically, the percentage of successfully verified requirements out of the number tested and the number of critical trouble reports outstanding longer than six months, will be tracked.

Web procedures developed throughout FY 2014 will be more focused on external customers based on Service Level Agreements defined and developed in FY 2013. Critical aspects of the OSS Central will also be fully implemented such as Role-Based Access Control and Attribute-Based Access Control gateway to provide a solid security foundation for internal and external users. Funding will provide continued support for real-time services with an emphasis with support for order entry, provisioning workflow and integration with other key OSS components such as the Network Change and Configuration Management System.

The increase of +$.018 from FY 2013 to FY 2014 supports expanded network management requirements for the OSS.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Products acquired for EMS requirements are professional services, network management software, supporting hardware, and development tools.  Professional services will be procured through existing contracts available to DISA.  The DISA Computing Services will be used for hardware and software leased managed services, as well as the NASA enterprise equipment contracting vehicle when necessary and applicable.

The IP enabling of the DRSN DSS-2A switch, Secure voice conference management improvements, HEMP Phone and related DRSN components will use an existing Air Force Command and Control Switching Systems (CCSS) Depot Support contract with the Secure Voice Switch systems manufacturer (Raytheon) to perform the development and modification work, system integration and testing support.

The Mobility initiative supports systems engineering and development of a DoD Mobility solution.  The focus is on acquisitions to support the program across the DoD to include scheduling, delivery approach, and risk management.  This also includes the vision and phased approach to unified capabilities for classified and unclassified wireless capabilities to meet DoD needs by FY 2014.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>DISN OSS funding supports the IP convergence of voice services at ADIMSS Hub Sites as follows – 
FY 2012 – 5 Remaining Sites Out of 22. 17 Sites where completed utilizing funds from prior years.
This activity supports the capability of ADIMSS Hub Sites providing VoIP capability for DISN customers at edge sites.

Funding provides development in DISN information sharing services that will be provided by the OSS Central web site. The objective is to develop OSS Central as the predominate interface for information sharing services for DISN customers. As a result of the development of information sharing capabilities, there will be an increase in OSS Central users. The following estimates provide the development of OSS Central Service Support procedures and the growth in OSS Central users.

FY 2012 – 3 info sharing procedures completed, 9 info sharing procedures in development, 2,600 users (19% of estimated user base complete)
FY 2013 – 14 info sharing procedures, 5,200 users (37% of estimated user base complete)
FY 2014 – 14 info sharing procedures, 10,000 users (71% of estimated user base complete)

The development of web procedures supports Information Sharing Services for both internal and external DISN users based on defined user group requirements. This metric supports the evolution of DISN users to OSS Central by providing Information Sharing Services.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) provides the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) engineer with plans and procedures; systems analysis; operational assessments; systems engineering; and development of concepts of operation and architectures. The NC3 System provides connectivity from the President and the Secretary of Defense through the National Military Command System to nuclear execution forces integral to fighting a “homeland-to-homeland,” as well as theater nuclear war. MEECN includes the Emergency Action Message dissemination systems and those systems used for integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment, presidential decision-making conferencing, force report back, re-targeting, force management, and requests for permission to use nuclear weapons. Efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense, military forces, and an informed decision-making linkage between the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Combatant Commands. MEECN ensures our national leadership has proper command and control of our forces during times of national emergency, up to and including nuclear war.  </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the mission of the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Systems Engineer to the Joint Staff and Executive Leadership. It also provides NC3 expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Information Officer (CIO) National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC) Management Office. Systems Analysis supports long range planning and vulnerability assessments to ensure the NC3 System is adequate under all conditions of stress or war and recommends investment strategies to evolve the Nuclear Command and Control System to achieve desired capabilities. Operational Assessments of fielded systems and weapon platforms provides the sole means for verification of NC3 systems’ performance in support of plans and procedures, operation orders, training, equipment, and end-to-end system configuration. Assessments provide strategic and theater level C3 interfaces into the NC3 System. Supporting efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense and strategic and theater forces. Systems Engineering provides the Senior Leadership C3 System with technical and management advice, planning and engineering support, and Test &amp; Evaluation. Leading Edge Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence technology is assessed for all communication platforms supporting executive travelers and senior leaders to include the interoperability of hardware and operational procedures. These technology elements support the President's and other DoD command centers and aircraft (e.g., Air Force One and the National Airborne Operations Center).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Performance is measured by compliance with contract deliverables schedules for specifically included products, such as: operational assessment plans, operational reports; revisions to the EAP-CJCS Volumes VI and VII; NC3 System Description documents, and Nuclear C3 Architecture Diagrams.  In addition, performance of the Nuclear C3 System is directly measured by the operational assessments funded by this program element.  These periodic assessments evaluate the connectivity used for the five functions of Nuclear command and control: Situation Monitoring, Planning, Decision Making, Force Execution, and Force Management.  Assessment results are used by the Joint Staff to direct changes in system engineering and integration, programmatic execution, and training.  

Specific performance metrics include the following:
Provide engineering products in all task areas that satisfy DoD/CIO and Joint Staff needs within allocated resources 90% of the time.

Conduct assessments of the NC3 system and the SLC3S that provide actionable results and recommendations for the Joint Staff and DoD/CIO to pursue improvements to these capabilities 90% of the time.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Community Data Center (CDC) researches, designs, builds, tests, demonstrates, and evaluates an innovative system to analyze a significant portion of the DoD’s and partner network traffic for anomalous network behavior using unique techniques and processes.  This unique analysis capability addresses the massive data overload associated with analyzing network traffic and raw data, and significantly improves the ability of the DoD to operate, defend, and protect its networks.  The CDC research achieves the goal of operating, defending, and protecting the network, by using augmented and sessionized network traffic, non-traditional approaches, advanced IT algorithms, and the compiled expertise of cyber operators, analysts, investigators, and defenders to develop a near-real-time “top down” ability to view and analyze the network for the discovery, identification, and analysis of anomalous patterns of activity not humanly detectable, that could represent illegal or improper behavior, and are significant threats to the network.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>This funding supported Audit Management, Continuous Monitoring Risk Scoring and the CDC for preventing insider threat activities.  The funding was used to construct the data integration, correlation, reduction, and analysis capabilities within the CDC supporting the audit event analysis and log aggregation as well as the Cross Domain Enterprise Solution defensive requirements.  

The FY 2012 decrease of -$0.252 supports higher Agency priorities.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Community Data Center (CDC) researches, designs, builds, tests, demonstrates, and evaluates an innovative system to analyze a significant portion of the DoD’s and partner network traffic for anomalous network behavior using unique techniques and processes.  This unique analysis capability addresses the massive data overload associated with analyzing network traffic and raw data, and significantly improves the ability of the DoD to operate, defend, and protect its networks.  The CDC research achieves the goal of operating, defending, and protecting the network, by using augmented and sessionized network traffic, non-traditional approaches, advanced IT algorithms, and the compiled expertise of cyber operators, analysts, investigators, and defenders to develop a near-real-time “top down” ability to view and analyze the network for the discovery, identification, and analysis of anomalous patterns of activity not humanly detectable, that could represent illegal or improper behavior, and are significant threats to the network.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>Funding improved CDC, Audit Management and Continuous Monitoring Risk Scoring data aggregation and analytics to help reduce the risk of “insider threats”.  The funds designed and developed information exchange and system interfaces to existing data feeds, design, develop and implemented a capability for detecting pre-defined malicious insider activities performed by users or administrators in near real time by using attack patterns based on log and log like data.

Market research and an analysis of the current DISA tools revealed the current Audit Management tool could be modified to satisfy the requirements (to prevent insider threat activities).  Steps to modify the tool were initiated by leveraging the existing contracts and tools.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) funds a Joint Command and Control (JC2) portfolio which includes: GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and JC2 Architecture.

GCCS-J is the Department of Defense (DoD) JC2 system of record that provides critical joint warfighting C2 capabilities by presenting an integrated, near real-time picture of the battle space for planning and executing joint military and multinational operations. GCCS-J is focused on meeting emerging operational needs through sustainment and synchronization support to operational baselines (Global and Joint Operations Planning and Execution System). GCCS-J is used by all nine Combatant Commands at sites around the world, supporting joint and coalition operations. The Services rely heavily on GCCS-J components to reduce their command and control (C2) operational costs.  Efforts are focused on completing the evolution of the current operational system into a modern C2 system capable of supporting joint needs across the Department.  

JPES is a portfolio of capabilities supporting joint policies, processes, procedures, and reporting structures. It is supported by communications and information technology used by the Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC).  JPEC uses these capabilities to monitor the following activities: planning, execute mobilization, deployment, employment and sustainment, redeployment, and demobilization.   At full maturity, the JPES capabilities will be integrated with other adaptive planning and execution systems to facilitate the rapid development and sustainment of plans and a seamless, dynamic transition to execution in a net-centric environment.  The JPES portfolio of capabilities consists of a core set of infrastructure services referred to as the JPES Framework and a variety of mission applications to include Joint Force Projection and the Joint Capabilities Requirements Manager and eventually the capabilities that support the modernization of the JOPES Information Technology (IT) system.

JC2 Architecture is a reference architecture that aligns closely to the DoD Information Enterprise Architecture.  The JC2 Architecture describes architectural and operational concepts, technical constructs, and is a repository for valuable reference information relating to C2 standards and information security.  It is the authoritative source of information and technical direction for the JC2 arena.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Command and Control System – Joint (GCCS-J) is DoD’s Joint Command and Control (JC2) system of record and provides the foundation for migration of service-unique C2 systems into a Joint, interoperable environment. The Defense Information System Agency’s (DISAs) portfolio includes funding to support GCCS-J, Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES), and the development and sustainment of the JC2 Architecture.  GCCS-J incorporates the core planning and assessment tools required by combatant commanders and their subordinate Joint Task Force Commanders while meeting the readiness support requirements of the Services.  Adaptive Planning and Execution Joint Planning Services are being developed to modernize the adaptive planning functions in a net centric environment.  DISA continues to provide support for the operational system to ensure continued access to information integration and decision-support capabilities that enable the exercise of authority and direction over assigned and attached forces, in a net-centric, collaborative information environment.  Additionally, DISA provides critical C2 capabilities to the Commander-in-Chief, Secretary of Defense, National Military Command Center, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Joint Force Commanders, and Service Component Commanders.  

JPES is a set of capabilities that address components of the DOD’s Adaptive Planning Roadmap (13 December 2005) and Adaptive Planning Roadmap II (5 March 2008).  JPES produces enhancements to the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES), focused adaptive planning capabilities, and provides a set of core infrastructure services necessary to provide the warfighter a fully interoperable environment where functionality can be easily added as mission needs dictate.

The JC2 Architecture is a foundational element of JC2 capabilities for the Department.  The JC2 Architecture provides a set of net-centric tenets associated with data, functional service and the C2 infrastructure that describes architectural and operational concepts, technical constructs, and is a repository for valuable reference information relating to C2 standards and information security.  Each year, the DISA architecture team, annually, produces a transitional architecture that documents the current state of C2 capabilities, anticipated changes/enhancements either in progress or planned by the JC2 community.

Initiate the JOPES Implementation plan for modernization. 

The decrease of -$7.812 from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to OSD directing that the Integrated Gaming System (IGS) and the Rapid Force Flow Data Analysis Tool (RFFDAT) formally known as the Rapid TPFDD Builder (RTB) development activities be discontinued. The funding for these two efforts was realigned to higher Agency and Department priorities.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>All development, integration, and migration efforts within the portfolio are primarily supported through Cost Reimbursable Task Orders issued under competitively awarded contracts.  Use of performance-based contract awards is maximized while use of Time and Material contracts is minimized to those providing programmatic support versus software development, integration, or testing.  Acquisition Strategies are structured to retain contractors capable of satisfying cost, schedule, and performance objectives.  Contract awards incorporate provisions requiring contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data.  This strategy mitigates risk by requiring monthly Contract Performance Reviews (CPRs) and utilizing award fee contracts where appropriate to incentivize performance.  Both GCCS-J and JPES apply formal acquisition rigor to include reporting requirements, as appropriate, by acquisition program designation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Spectrum Organization (DSO) designs, develops, and maintains Department of Defense (DoD) automated spectrum management systems, evaluation tools, and databases. The DSO databases are the prime sources of information for DoD use of the Electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. The DSO provides technical measurement and analysis in support of DoD spectrum policy decisions to ensure the development, acquisition, and operational deployment of systems are compatible with other spectrum dependent systems operating within the same EM environment. Additional efforts focus on improving future warfighter EM spectrum utilization through technological innovation, and influencing research and development emerging technology efforts. 

Improved spectrum support includes the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS), a net centric capability that will provide commanders with an increased common picture of spectrum situational awareness of friendly and hostile forces while transparently deconflicting competing mission requirements for spectrum use. This capability will enable the transformation from the current preplanned and static assignment strategy into autonomous and adaptive spectrum operations.

                                            <r2:Text>Capabilities were migrated to new hardware and operating environments and the evolved DoD and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) spectrum data standard was implemented. Additional background environment data sources were added to the Joint Spectrum Data Repository and enhanced monitoring transactions with Military Departments (MILDEPs) systems were implemented. All developed capabilities were documented and tested by users before being deployed at a Defense Enterprise Computing Center (DECC). SPECTRUM XXI Online (SXXIO) v2.1 was enhanced and deployed to spectrum managers in the COCOMs. The initial operational capability (IOC) of the DoD Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) Evaluation and SSRA Tool was developed. This tool provides acquisition program managers with the ability to identify and assess the newly acquired system’s potential to affect the performance of existing systems within the operational EME and vice versa.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:Description>Spectrum Common Operating Picture (SCOP) will provide an automated end-to-end capability to pull together all of the spectrum and other related data sets currently used to support spectrum planning and operations, and layer this data to provide a clear visualization of the spectrum environment, similar to how a Geographic Information System (GIS) layers geospatial and related data. There is no comprehensive automated tool or service available today that allows decision makers to set priorities with the benefit of a common display of timely and relevant spectrum information. The capability will provide operational and tactical planners and commanders in the field with a comprehensive layered picture of spectrum use through a Service Oriented Architecture-based web service tied to a GIS driven by robust, accurate information.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Engineering support services are provided by the use of a contract. No in-house government capability exists, nor is it practical to develop one that can provide the expertise necessary to fulfill the mission and responsibilities of DSO. Full and open competition was used for the current contract with ITT Industries, Inc. GEMSIS' acquisition approach is to obtain capabilities by adopting existing capabilities, buying commercial products, or developing new capabilities by delivering incrementally within the context of a streamlined and adaptive acquisition approach.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The PEO ES continually expanding portfolio of enterprise services supports 100 percent of the active duty military and Government civilians; 258 thousand embedded contract personnel; 75 percent of the active Guard and Reserve; and 25 percent of the Guard and Reserve users. This meets the Department’s requirement to support 2.5 million users on the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network  and 300 thousand users on the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network. The PEO-ES portfolio of services continues to expand through the transition of local services to the Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise and providing enhanced functionality that allows DoD personnel to go anywhere within the DoD, login, and be productive, the implementation of an access control infrastructure that enables secure information sharing throughout the DoD, and the integration of pre-planned product improvements to existing enterprise services keeping them relevant to the end-users’ missions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Program Executive Office (PEO) for Enterprise Services (ES) continues to expand their portfolio of services that currently includes the core capabilities delivered by the Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Program, a resilient and flexible access control infrastructure that enables secure information sharing in the Department of Defense (DoD), and the transition and operationalization of local services into the larger DoD enterprise. Critical warfighter, Business, and Intelligence Mission Area services within the PEO-ES portfolio include an enterprise collaboration capability supporting over 710,000 DoD users, Enterprise Search that exposes data sources throughout the DoD, Service Oriented Architecture Foundation supporting a robust Enterprise Messaging service that provides producers the ability to publish one message that, in turn, can be distributed to hundreds of end-points supporting the subscribers to that information and a critical enterprise authoritative data source service that supports the user’s need to identify and use authoritative data and services. The PEO-ES portfolio also includes the Strategic Knowledge Integration Web (SKIWeb) providing decision and event management support to all levels of a widespread user-base that ranges from the Combatant Commanders to the Joint Staff to Coalition partners on the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network; DoD Visitor that allows personnel to “go anywhere within the DoD, login, and be productive”; and the Defense Enterprise Portal Service that provides users with a flexible web-based hosting solution to create and manage mission, community, organization, and user focused sites. The individual suite of capabilities within the portfolio of services provides the user with the flexibility to couple the services in varying ways to support their mission needs. This flexibility provides unprecedented access to web and application content, critical imagery, intelligence and warfighter information, and temporarily stores critical data in a secure environment. The PEO-ES portfolio of enterprise services delivers tangible benefits to the Department by providing capabilities that are applied by US Forces, Coalition forces, and Allied forces to support full spectrum joint and expeditionary campaign operations. These enabling benefits include the ability to:

• Enhance collaborative decision-making processes
• Improve information sharing and integrated situational awareness
• Share and exchange knowledge and services between enterprise units and commands
• Share and exchange information between previously unreachable and unconnected sources
• Schedule and coordinate meetings with people across the DoD Components
• “Go anywhere within the DoD, login, and be productive
• Create and manage mission, community, organization, and user-focused sites from global locations
• Exchange knowledge to enable situational awareness, determine the effects desired, select a course of action, the forces to execute it, and      
  accurately assess the effects of that action
	
The portfolio contains capabilities that are also key enablers to the Defense Information Systems Agency’s (DISA) mission of providing a global net-centric Enterprise infrastructure in direct support of joint warfighter, National level leaders, and other mission and Coalition partners across the full spectrum of operations.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The PEO-ES portfolio of services is leveraging portions of the acquisition approach approved for the NCES Program. Based on the approved NCES acquisition strategy, PEO-ES will adopt proven specifications, best practices, and interface definitions to adopt or buy new network-based services or applications that are delivered, hosted, and managed in accordance with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and that ensure available, reliable, and survivable services to support the warfighter’s mission.

The PEO-ES is using a streamlined acquisition approach to ensure that the required acquisitions contain only those requirements that are essential to meet the warfighter mission and that they can be acquired in a cost effective and time constrained manner that meets the defined mission need. This strategy will enable PEO-ES to rapidly field low to moderate risk capabilities to meet end-user operational needs through an agile requirements collection and engineering process that supports the acquisition, testing, and fielding of needed requirements in minimum time. The benefits provided by this acquisition approach include:
•	Satisfy time-urgent needs of the warfighter or theater commander
• Provide early and continual involvement of the user
• Evaluate the portfolio to determine optimum funding approach to rapidly deploy urgently needed services within the funding profile
• Effective control processes that lower cost and maintains schedule
• Provide multiple, rapidly executed increments or releases of capability
• Early dialogue between the requirements and acquisition communities to expedite technical, programmatic, and financial solutions
• Enable “insight” not “oversight” to identify and resolve problems early and ensure both the acquisition process and deployed service meets performance goals
• Enable agility in selecting modular, open-systems approach

The PEO-ES business strategy will strike a balance between ensuring accountability using acquisition best practices and deploying urgently needed services to the warfighter on a schedule that will support their mission requirements. The goal is to facilitate the DoD enterprise cloud vision where users and Programs of Record easily access enterprise services from maritime, airborne, and land-based locations worldwide through a federation of core data centers. PEO-ES will work with the user community to understand how the portfolio of services must evolve to remain relevant to the warfighter, Business, and Intelligence Mission Area mission requirements. By partnering with the DoD Components and Mission Areas, PEO-ES will rapidly deliver functionality and capability at the lowest possible cost and risk in the shortest possible timeframe.
</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>PEO ES uses continuous monitoring to ensure the portfolio of services they deliver and manage meets the users’ needs, is delivered in a cost effective manner, and is responsive to evolving mission requirements. This ensures the services meet the mission needs of the stakeholders, are delivered, improved, and sustained in a cost effective manner, and continues to add functionality that keeps the capability relevant to the missions supported. These continuous monitoring areas include:

Activity:
• Customer Perspective (Determine the customers’ (warfighter, business, and DoD Portion of the Intelligence Mission Area) needs and provide available, reliable, and survivable services that support evolving missions; solicit continual feedback from the customer on the utility, effectiveness, suitability, and relevancy of all delivered services)

Expected Outcome:
Receive an overall customer satisfaction rating of three or better on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is “no mission effectiveness” and 5 is “maximum mission effectiveness”.

Activity:
• Financial Perspective (Satisfy Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, DISA and DoD Cost Strategic Goals, determine if PEO ES funding is sufficient to deliver services that support the customers’ mission needs, effectively support preplanned product improvements (P3I), and reduce sustainment costs; use feedback from the customer perspective to determine when a service is no longer relevant to their mission requirements).

Expected Outcome:
Usage of the portfolio of core and shared enterprise services continue to expand to support anticipated and unanticipated user demand; investment in duplicative services declines; additional POR/COIs reduce development costs through reuse of enterprise services; maintenance of an overall return on investment (ROI) that is ≥ 1 or the capability provides a significant mission benefit from the customer perspective that the lower ROI is offset.

Activity:
• Requirements Satisfaction (Continue to expand, modernize, and add new functionality to the user and machine facing portfolio of deployed services; identify, transition, and operationalize local services that can satisfy new mission requirements or supplement an existing service that has lost market share and is not cost effective to update; periodically re-validate service requirements with the user community to identify enhancements required to support evolving mission needs).

Expected Outcome:
Continue to improve the performance of the portfolio of services while adding functionality, integrating local services into the enterprise infrastructure, and extending access to additional unanticipated users.

The management areas are designed to ensure that problems can be identified rapidly for resolution, while providing maximum support to the warfighters’ mission. These metrics associated with these management areas provide quantitative data that show the portfolio of services delivered by PEO-GES are secure, interoperable, and responsive to current and future warfighter missions in a cost-effective manner. The management areas and metrics will be used to continuously evaluate the value of services to the Warfighter. They will be used to determine the right time to scale and update services to keep them relevant to the warfighter’s mission. Also, when necessary, they provide the necessary artifacts to make decisions to continue, shutdown, or place in caretaker status capabilities that are not performing as expected or where the user demand has slipped or never grew to the level of keeping the service cost effective.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Department of Defense (DoD) Teleport system is a satellite communications (SATCOM) gateway that links the deployed warfighter to the Global Information Grid. The Teleport program has fielded system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational approach with Generation 1 and 2 Full Deployment authorized by DoD Chief Information Officer on February 18, 2011. Teleport Generation 3 consists of three phases; Phases 1 and 2 are in Production and Deployment while the Phase 3 is in Engineering and Manufacturing Development. Each Teleport investment increases the warfighter’s ability to communicate with a world-wide, net-centric set of information capabilities, which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.

Currently, the Teleport system operates as an upgrade of satellite communication capabilities at selected DoD satellite communications gateways.   This system provides deployed warfighters with seamless worldwide multi-band SATCOM connectivity to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Service Delivery Nodes and legacy tactical command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems. It also provides centralized integration capabilities, contingency capacity, and common interfaces to access the DISN.
 
Teleport's goal is to provide secure, seamless, interoperable, and economical upgrades to DoD SATCOM Gateways and meet the growing throughput requirements of the deployed warfighter.

The primary beneficiaries of the Teleport investment are the DoD Combatant Commanders, Military Departments, Defense Agencies, and the warfighter. Teleport Generation 3 is designed to meet the growing demands of the warfighter through the execution of the following phases:  

Phase 1: Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency [Extended Data Rate] terminals provides tactical users with a 350% bandwidth increase in survivable, anti-jam communications through all peacetime and combat operations by installing Navy Multiband Terminals (NMT) at select Teleport sites. In addition to enhanced throughput, the NMT maintains compatibility with legacy waveforms and current tactical terminals.
 
Phase 2: Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM X/Ka-band terminals provides enhanced Wideband Global System (WGS) X/Ka capability to warfighters worldwide by installing terminals from the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal (MET) program at Teleport and other gateway sites. This gateway enhancement allows Teleport to replace end-of-life Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) terminals while remaining interoperable with tactical WGS X/Ka-band users.  The MET enhancement provides a 300% Ka-band capacity increase and an 1100% X-band capacity increase to current enterprise terminal X/Ka capabilities. Additionally, it enables the Teleport system to maintain operational availability consistent with Generation 2 requirements and reduce the overall life-cycle cost of X/Ka capabilities across the DoD. 

Phase 3: Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy UHF systems interoperability will provide interoperability between MUOS users and legacy UHF users by installing MUOS-to-Legacy UHF SATCOM Gateway Component (MLGC) suites of equipment at Teleport sites.  MUOS is the next generation DoD UHF SATCOM system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services, utilizing the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band. MLGC suites will provide critical continuity and interoperability as DoD tactical satellite users transition from legacy waveforms and radios to the Joint Tactical Radio System.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Teleport program will implement an integrated test approach that will combine the objectives from multiple testing disciplines (e.g., developmental test, operational test, interoperability, and information assurance) throughout the testing lifecycle to support needed system evaluations. The Teleport program executes its own test events to achieve this integrated approach, but will partner with each phase’s respective program office generated test activities to leverage the data needed to satisfy Teleport program test objectives. An FY 2014 approach summary for each phase follows:

Phase 1: FY 2014 funding will be used to complete a system field trial, conduct a developmental regression test, conduct terminal interoperability testing, and will culminate with the Phase 1 Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) event in the second quarter FY 2014. 

Phase 2: FY 2014 funding will be used to complete terminal interoperability testing and conduct the Phase 2 OT&amp;E evolution in the first quarter FY 2014.  

Phase 3: FY 2014 funding will be used to conduct developmental testing on the first gateway component installation, conduct developmental regression testing, and culminate with an OT&amp;E of the Teleport Phase 3 integration in third quarter FY 2014.  </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>Technology Refresh and Generation 3:  Will continue a technology refresh schedule and testing activities required to sustain Generations-1/2 fielded capabilities by implementing Joint Internet Protocol Modem (JIPM), iDirect 2.X, and MUOS to DISN capabilities at select Teleport sites.  Generation 3 funding will support preparation for the Operational Test Readiness Review (OTRR), operational testing, and operational validation for both Phase 1 and Phase 2.  These events are required for Phase 1 and Phase 2 to enter their respective Full Deployment Decision (FDD) in FY 2015.  Will continue developmental testing of digital IF capability to provide flexibility and resiliency to the Teleport/Gateway systems. In addition, funding will support JIPM second generation development efforts.  MUOS Voice Gateway (MVG) (formerly MUOS to DSN) will obtain KDP B and conduct operational test and evaluation. MUOS GDS: Funds will be used for KDP B planning and documentation, and testing and certification regimen.

The decrease of -$0.903 from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to reduced planning, engineering and testing required to support Generations 1 and 2 technology refresh and Generation 3 Phase 3 entering the Production and Deployment Phase.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Teleport Program Office (TPO) uses the DoD preferred evolutionary acquisition approach to acquire Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) and modified COTS equipment when possible.  The three TPO procuring agencies, Program Manager Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) provide direct contracting support. Assistance from other Departments including Army, Navy, and Air Force is acquired via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request for both organic and contracted support.  The TPO maximizes the use of performance-based contracts and requires contractors to establish and manage specific earned value data to mitigate risk and monitor deviations from cost, schedule, and performance objectives.  Performance is evaluated thorough post-award contract reviews, performance assessment during quarterly program reviews.  The MLGC program will use various contract types to employ the vendor best suited to deliver the program’s capabilities to the warfighter.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Tech Refresh and Generation 3 Cost and Schedule Performance Metrics: 
Teleport manages and tracks its cost and schedule performance parameters using a tailored Earned Value Management System (EVMS) process, integrating the program plan, the program schedule, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and financial data.  Progress is monitored/documented monthly showing percentages complete for schedule and cost.  Formal updates with changes to the schedule are documented against the program baseline.

Tech Refresh and Generation 3 Program Metrics:
Performance metrics have been established in four measurement areas: 1) customer results, 2) mission and business results, 3) processes and activities, and 4) technology.  Specific measurement indicators and units of measure vary by measurement area, and metrics in each of the aforementioned areas are measured annually. Teleport will use the same measurement areas for performance metrics in FY 2013 and FY 2014:

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) coordinates with the Military Services and Defense Intelligence Agencies to conduct Joint/Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) testing and analysis, including event coordination, configuration, instrumentation and integration functions on the Distributed Development and Test Enterprise (DDTE).  Under the DCGS Governance, this effort, referred to as the DCGS Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Focus Team (FT), is composed of three parts:  the DDTE Focus Group, providing and sustaining a distributed development network; the Strategy Focus Group, looking at current and future net-enabled enterprise T&amp;E methods; and the Execution Focus Group, which leverages the Strategy Focus Group’s methodologies in executing DCGS Enterprise assessment events, such as the annual DCGS demonstration, ENTERPRISE CHALLENGE.  These efforts improve systems engineering and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life-cycle, resulting in improved capabilities to share net-centric data and services between the DCGS Programs of Record (PoRs) and the overarching Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E).

Operates and maintains the DDTE, providing DCGS PoRs a virtual operationally relevant assessment environment maintaining connectivity between Service facilities, National Agency capabilities, and Coalition partners.  DDTE allows robust integration of modeling and simulation T&amp;E capabilities across Joint DCGS events without introducing vulnerabilities to operational Command and Control networks and has enabled improvements in systems engineering, instrumentation and T&amp;E throughout all phases of the DCGS life cycle. 

DCGS PoRs and Coalition partners use the DDTE network, which supports the net-centric maturity assessment of the DCGS Enterprise under the DCGS Governance, to integrate architecture, standards, and capabilities for implementation of the DCGS Integration Backbone and support the migration to net-centricity, including DCGS Enterprise services for the Military Departments, DCGS-Special Operations Forces and the DCGS Intelligence Community.  National Agency capabilities supporting DCGS include Geospatial Intelligence, Signals Intelligence, Measurement and Signature Intelligence and Human Intelligence, which are integrated and tested in the DDTE domain.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The T&amp;E Focus Team (FT) performs a minimum of three DCGS Enterprise assessments per year.  At the end of the year assessment results are consolidated into T&amp;E FT input to the State of the Enterprise (SoE) Report.  A comparison of multi-year SoE Reports shows measurable DCGS Enterprise net-centric maturity progress. The T&amp;E FT will also leverage Joint Interoperability Certification testing to support the evaluation of DCGS Enterprise maturity.  Of the six DCGS PoR systems, three hold current Joint Staff, Command, Control, Communications, &amp; Computers/Cyber (J6) Interoperability (IOP) Certifications, while the other three PoRs remain in prototype status, which precludes them from completing Joint IOP Certifications.  Efforts will continue to collect data on these emerging systems towards overall J6 IOP Certification as they mature.  Due to increased automation and advances in Enterprise maturity, the T&amp;E FT increased the number of net-centric evaluations from approximately 150 data assets and 120 web services in 2011 to over 400 data assets and over 300 web services in 2012.  This effort provides the basis for the DCGS Enterprise Assessment, allowing the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) to measure the level of maturity of the DCGS Enterprise supporting the DCGS Governance.
