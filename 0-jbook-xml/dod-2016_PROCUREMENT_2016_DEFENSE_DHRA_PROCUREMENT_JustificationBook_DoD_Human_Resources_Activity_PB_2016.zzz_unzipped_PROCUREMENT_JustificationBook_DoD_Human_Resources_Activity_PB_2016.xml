            <proc:Description>The Department of Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) is a consolidated Field Activity under the direction and control of the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) (USD (P&amp;R)) established for the collection and interaction of manpower and personnel data to support Department-wide tracking,analysis,research, studies, and a wide variety of reporting requirements. DHRA provides functional information management, civilian personnel policy support, and civilian personnel administrative services to DoD Components and activities. The scope of operations is necessarily broad and encompasses all aspects of data collection and utilization of Defense manpower and personnel data records to support DoD-wide analysis, studies, research, and reporting requirements. DHRA is the responsible organization within DoD for the interchange of automated manpower data with other government agencies.  

Civilian HR automation enhancements planned for FY 2015 and FY 2016 are focused on software development to support the Department's civilian workforce, including readiness requirements for the development of automation for a performance management system; development of interfaces with the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) and other civilian HR systems;  development of DCPDS interfaces with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) initiative mandates for the HR Line of Business (LoB), and electronic Official Personnel Folder. DoD is one of six designated Shared Service Centers in the federal government focused on providing standard services across agency lines, gaining potential significant business and cost-saving benefits. DoD is considered a leader in this initiative. DCPDS is the Department's enterprise civilian HR system that has provided the savings originally projected in the achievement of full operational capability in 2002 and which has continued to operate as the DoD system serving over 800,000 employee records. Additional initiatives to sustain the Department's lead in automated systems include expansion of employee self service functionality, and customer focused portal access and systems with software development that transitions from an HR professional focus to employee/manager users. All enhancements will support the Department's focus on the further consolidation of civilian HR operations to a single operational site, with linkage to Component operations worldwide.  Other systems support includes the Investigations and Resolution Case Management System (RCMS) that support injury and unemployment compensation.  Additional business operations will be assessed in the areas of, talent management, competency assessment, and case management tracking systems.  DCPDS is the Department's enterprise civilian human resources (HR) transactional system supporting 800,000 employees, representing approximately one-third of the federal government's civilian work force.  The consolidation of all instances of DCPDS at the DDC completed in 2014 has resulted in substantial component savings.  In FY 15/16, additional data center consolidation will include additional HRIT Enterprise systems moving to the Denver Data Center (DCC).

DHRA is the proponent for all DoD Identification (ID) Card Systems. The Real-Time Automated Personnel Identification System (RAPIDS) is a program established to develop and implement a secure ID card system for the Uniformed Services and is the primary update vehicle for the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) database. Additionally, RAPIDS is the Local Registration Authority (LRA) issuance of the digital credential necessary to implement Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in the Department. DHRA centrally manages all resources for the program. The Common Access Card (CAC) is the DoD solution for an interoperable federal credentials required under Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD-12). We received funds in FY 2014 to support a web-service interface to the Health Insurance Exchange to implement the requirements of P.L. 111-148, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR) is a system that provides the reconciliation and reporting of personnel from multiple DoD sources. Initial scope will include personnel supporting the Overseas Contingency Operations focusing first in the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) area of responsibility.  JPARR will receive daily feeds from several personnel tracking systems including, but not limited to, Deployed Theater Accountability System (DTAS), Secure Personnel Accountability (SPA), and Deliberate Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segment (DCAPES). Ultimately, JPARR will be able to automate the Joint Personnel Status (JPERSTAT) Report in addition to introduce a restricted site which will be the baseline for the Congressional Boots on the Ground (BOG) Report. Further, through JPARR, additional capability will allow to drill down to the individual level.

Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO)Tracking System (NTS)/Emergency Tracking Accountability System (ETAS) is a certified and accredited DoD automated system that accounts for, and sustains visibility of noncombatant evacuees during a NEO under the authority of DODD 1000.25, DoD Personnel Identity Protection (PIP) Program. NTS is currently being used in the USAFRICOM, USCENTCOM, USEUCOM, USSOUTHCOM, and USPACOM AORs. The ETAS component is the CONUS domestic version of NTS and is for use by USNORTHCOM during disasters in the CONUS whether natural, accidental, or acts of terrorism. The primary purpose of the NTS/ETAS is to provide individual accountability of the evacuee by creating and maintaining a database of evacuees assembled during an evacuation operation and subsequently tracking the evacuees' movement through the evacuation process.

Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) is an initiative to enable the various elements (DoD, VA and the private sector) of the United States health care community to quickly, accurately, and electronically share health information. The VLER initiative is a result of Presidential guidance on April 9, 2009, which stated that DoD and VA would "...work together to define and build a system that will ultimately contain administrative and medical information from the day an individual enters military service throughout their military career, and after they leave the military."

Data Governance will formalize the ongoing demands for enterprise data collection and distribution at the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC).  To meet both the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA 10.0) as well as to keep pace with the demands of real time, dynamic information interoperability, DMDC requires major enhancements to its data architecture on both the Secret Internet Protocol router Network (SIPRnet) and Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRnet).  Security officers, care providers, Enterprise Email users, Id cardholders, Service/Agency decision makers and OSD policy experts require the best information available to meet today's requirements.  DMDC's Data Governance capability requires an integrated Master Data Management (MDM) framework which can operate in today's cloud computing environment and meet the DoD information demands.  The MDM is a set of data conventions that provide the foundation for standardizing the receipt, cleansing, storage, reporting and distribution of enterprise data.  The MDM framework includes policy, technical rule sets, data use and service level usage tracking which enables data exchange between organizations. DMDC must adopt this new data strategy and architecture so that DMDC can continue to adapt to changing information requirements by using tools and methodologies that standardize definitions and rules across disparate systems.  It will provide for flexible batch submissions and online ingestion points which simultaneously archive data yet make it available to the many DMDC products consumed daily.

Cyber Security funds are for Insider SIPRNET Data Exfiltration (i.e. authorized DoD users making unauthorized transfers of SECRET data from SIPRNET to an unauthorized source either directly or via data storage device for further transfer to an entity not authorized to have access to such data).  In addition, it limits DOD exposure to Insider SIPRNET data exfiltration threats. The Department must both deter bad behavior by increasing accountability and enforcement, and, implement barriers to data theft while preserving required ease of information sharing amongst authorized users.  To accomplish this goal, the DOD must accelerate implementation and fielding of three capability sets:
•  The ability to control and monitor pre-provisioned user access in a manner that cannot be repudiated (e.g.    using CAC-enabled PKE Authentication) mitigates insider exfiltration threat by implementing dynamic Access Based Attribute Control (ABAC)  data access and enabling enforcement and accountability 
•  The ability to enable, monitor and control the authorized transfer of information between SIPRNET and other DOD Networks as required via a globally available and operationally effective cross domain enterprise service solutions
•  Provide a major upgrade, network and COOP, not supportable by O&amp;M, for the system beginning in 2014.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The decrease in funding from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is attributable to efficiencies related to:
•  Consolidation of DCPDS regional server operations at the Denver Data Center (DDC) IAW the FY 2005 National Defense Authorization Act for increased control of the Department's information technology investments,as well as mandates for consolidation of federal data centers to support the final IT architectural changes and procurements that  support the final phase of relocating Army and Air Force regional sever operations to the DDC.  In FY 14, DCPAS completed the consolidation of all Defense Agency and Military Service DCPDS regional computing operations into a single data center.  Enhancements of information assurance infrastructure were continued to meet mandated DoD requirements for zone architecture and move toward Risk Management Framework.  In addition, the next phase of DoD Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) extension was implemented to comply with DoD mandates for DMZ requirements for all systems.  Beginning in FY 15 the sustainment of consolidated operations, migration of stand-alone applications to the DDC; and technical refresh are the primary requirements for Procurement funds.

•  Enhancement of the DEERS/RAPIDS/CAC data architecture on both the SIPRnet and NIPRnet to meet both the Federal Enterprise Architecture and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture as well as to keep pace with the demands of real time, dynamic information interoperability

FY 2016 funding for DCPDS will support the continuation of consolidated DCPDS operations at the DDC.  Consolidation vests direct operational responsibility for all DCPDS civilian HR computing operations under DHRA/DCPAS, and includes the Defense Agencies and Army, Navy, and Air Force.  The consolidation improves control, enhances information assurance, simplifies network operations, and increases operational efficiencies.  Centralized funding simplifies administration of DCPDS, where Components currently operating at the DCPDS central site pay individually for that support.  Procurement funding provides hardware which includes application and database servers, storage devices, communications infrastructure, testing equipment, tape back-up devices, firewalls and routers, switches, virtual private networks, associated software for the DCPDS application and operating systems, and centralized licensing and asset management to allow for uninterrupted support across the DCPDS program.

The FY 2016 investment in Automated Data Processing (ADP) equipment supports the RAPIDS/CAC program. This includes the acquisition, installation, and maintenance of the DMDC RAPIDS/CAC infrastructure, as well as replacing outdated and/or maintenance-intensive equipment in order to continue to ensure full functionality, system security, and HSPD-12 implementation.

The FY 2016 investment in the NEO Tracking System (NTS) will be used to upgrade fielded NTS across the COCOMs as called for in JROCM 117-10 dated 29 JUL 2010.  This centralized procurement of equipment will enable DMDC to track the systems in the field and provide support such as software upgrades, training and equipment tracking which are also responsibilities of DMDC called out in JROCM 117-10. 

The FY 2016 investment in the Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR) will allow for JPARR's continued expansion.  This investment will allow for the acquisition of hardware needed to include the U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) into JPARR.  USNORTHCOM will be the fifth Combatant Command support by these reports. 

The FY16 investment will be used to complete the architectural DoD Architecture Framework (DoDAF) views of DMDC submission processing and output data handling to our web service customers as well as to our online transaction processing database, DEERS. The analysis and definition of requirements for a robust Master Data Management plan to include documenting current and future requirements will enable DMDC to expand its Extract Transform and Load (ETL) tool which DMDC plans to procure in FY13 to include a data analytics module for tracking performance and data quality.  Additionally, the MDM environment will consolidate DMDC data dictionaries which will be leveraged by the Person Data-event Environment(PDE) which is an open, collaborative sharing environment for DoD personnel and medical research. The DEERS/RAPIDS/CAC line includes funding to support a web-service interface to the Health Insurance Exchange to implement requirements of P.L. 111-148, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

The FY 2016 investment in the DS Logon program in support of VLER benefits will be used to purchase additional identity proofings from a vendor that allows the DS Logon credential to be issued online (remotely) simplifying the process for the Beneficiary by avoiding the necessity to be in-person proofed and reducing the cost for the Government by avoiding the costs associated with in-person proofing (manpower, facility, mailings).  These identity proofings will futher be utilized to allow the Beneficiary to reset their password when they have forgotten their username, password and challenge questions.  This avoids the much higher costs associated with calls to a help desk and provides our Beneficiaries with immediate resolution.

The Cyber Security funding will allow DMDC to obtain IT hardware and software to procure a primary Secret Internet Router Protocol (SIPRNET) upgrade; build out a continuity of operations facility; provide a cross domain solution to monitor and control the authorized transfer of information between SIPRNET and other DOD Networks as required via a globally available and operationally effective cross domain enterprise service solutions; and control and monitor pre-provisioned user access in a manner that cannot be repudiated (e.g.  using CAC-enabled Public Key Enabling (PKE) Authentication and mitigates insider exfiltration threat by limiting data access and enabling enforcement and accountability.  An added benefit will be the providing the much needed 24x7 availability for the SIPRnet token issuance function.</proc:Justification>
