                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project designs, investigates and evaluates advanced sensor components, signal processing, and information fusion algorithms that will provide the future Soldier decisive new capabilities to locate, identify, decide and engage battlefield targets in tactical environments.  The ultimate impact and utility of this work will be to greatly increase the lethality, range, and speed of engagement of the Soldier.  Emphasis is on solving critical Army-specific battlefield sensing and information management problems such as false targets, complex terrain (including urban applications), movement of sensors on military vehicles, and exploitation of multimodal sensors.  Significant areas of research include: low cost sensors designed to be employed in large numbers of networked sensors for force protection, hostile fire defeat, homeland defense, counter terrorism operations, and munitions; fusion of disparate sensors such as non-imaging acoustic, seismic, electric-field (E-field), magnetic, radar; imaging infrared (IR), forward looking IR (FLIR), laser detection and ranging (LADAR), visible imagers; low cost acoustic, seismic, and magnetic sensors that can passively detect, classify, and track battlefield targets such as personnel, heavy/light vehicles, and helicopters.  Other areas of research include sensing technologies for tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) non-traditional targets as well as the location of direct and indirect fires and other hostile threats. Further areas of research include Ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronics for battlefield sensors, networked compact radar for vehicle and dismount identification and tracking; ultra wideband radar for buried and concealed threat detection, enhanced robotic mobility, stand-off characterization of infrastructure; and the detection, classification, and tracking of humans in urban terrain.  Additional areas of research are aided/automatic target recognition (ATR) allowing sensors to autonomously locate and identify targets; advanced battlefield sensor and information processing to conduct a dynamic and real time situational assessment to present a common picture of the battlespace focused on low echelon commanders; and advanced information processing methods to provide automatic information technologies that utilize widely dispersed sensor and legacy information sources.

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command Control and Communications, Ground and Soldier portfolios.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) designs and validates electronic warfare (EW) components that deny, disrupt, or degrade the enemy's use of the electromagnetic spectrum for offensive or defensive operations. This is accomplished through the investigation of electronic support measures (ESM); countermeasures against communications systems and networks; the design and fabrication of sensors used to identify and locate threat forces in an asymmetric environment; and threat warning and electronic countermeasures (ECM) against munitions sensors, missile guidance systems, targeting systems, and booby traps. Project 906 supports protection of high-value ground platforms, aircraft, and the Soldier from threat surveillance and tracking systems; imaging systems; and advanced radio frequency (RF)/electro-optical (EO)/infrared (IR) missiles, artillery, and smart munitions. Information fusion research addresses sensor correlation and fusion, relationship discovery, and management services through use of automated processing, as well as software that applies higher level reasoning techniques to support automated combat assessment. Project 906 also supports research and application of key EW sensors, direction finders and jammers to intercept, locate, and disrupt current and emerging communications and non-communications threat emitters to provide vital, quality combat information directly to users in a timely, actionable manner. Specifically, it focuses on detection of threat sensors and emitters associated with weapon systems, targeting systems and command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems and networks. 

Work in this PE is complimentary of PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0603270A (EW Technology), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology); and fully coordinated with PE 0603008A (Command, Control, Communications Advanced Technology) and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project designs, fabricates, evaluates, and applies key electronic warfare (EW)/information operations technologies to enhance platform survivability (to include ground combat vehicles, aircraft, and the dismounted Soldier) and to intercept, track and locate current and emerging threat munitions, communications and non-communications threat emitters. This project applies recent advances in radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR), and electro-optical (EO) sensors and jamming sources to detect, locate, deceive, and jam threats (to include radar directed target acquisition systems, target-tracking sensors, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), air-to-air missiles (AAMs), top attack weapons, and electronically fuzed munitions). This project also pursues the ability to neutralize booby traps. This project designs information systems to provide vital, quality combat information directly to users in a timely, actionable manner in accordance with concepts for future force intelligence operations. This project investigates RF collection and mapping technologies to offer real time emitter detection, location, and identification. In addition, this project enables a remote capability to disrupt, deny, or destroy threat communication signals and enables fusion (automated assimilation and synthesis) of battlefield intelligence data to enable interpretation of current threats and future enemy activities. This allows commanders to develop operational courses of action in time to act decisively and in a pre-emptive manner.

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Ground, Soldier and Air portfolios.

Work in this project is complimentary of PE 0603270A (EW Technology) and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology); and fully coordinated with PE 0603008A (Command, Control, Communications Advanced Technology) and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates and develops advanced technologies for High Energy Laser (HEL) weapon systems to enable more efficient lasers with greater power output. This includes technologies to support development of alternate laser sources; precision optical pointing and tracking components; adaptive optics to overcome laser degradation due to atmospheric effects; and thermal management systems to remove excess heat.  In addition, this effort conducts laser lethality demonstrations and analysis against a variety of targets and investigates the impact of low-cost laser countermeasures.  Solid State Laser (SSL) efforts continue to leverage other funds provided by the HEL Joint Technology Office (JTO), the Air Force, and the Navy to develop multiple technical approaches that reduce program risk and maintain competition. 

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Ground Portfolio.

                                    <r2:Description>This effort researches, designs and evaluates high power density engines and transmission systems needed to offset increasing combat vehicle weights (armor), increased electrical power generation needs (onboard communications, surveillance and exportable power ), improved fuel economy (fuel cost &amp; range), enhanced mobility (survivability), and reduced cooling system burden (size, heat rejection).  Currently, less than 1/3 of the total available energy from the fuel is converted into usable mechanical work (propulsion).  This effort also researches and matures thermal management technologies and systems including heat energy recovery, propulsion and cabin thermal management sub-systems to utilize waste heat energy and meet objective power and mobility requirements on all ground vehicles.  Lastly, this effort maximizes efficiencies within propulsion and thermal systems to reduce burden on the vehicle while providing the same or greater performance capability.  This effort is coordinated with PE 063005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Advanced computing, sensors, survivability and communications systems have driven electrical power demands on ground vehicle platforms beyond current generation capability, requiring some platforms in theater to turn off critical mission systems in order to power other components.  Advancing technologies for greater platform capabilities will further exacerbate the problem.  To provide the electrical power required by the Warfighter, new efficient power generation systems for platforms must be created.  As power increases, waste heat increases and must be removed from the platform.  With increased efficiency of the power generation system, less energy will be expended on cooling and can be redistributed to other needs.  This effort will design and evaluate high temperature and efficient power generation components using high operating temperature switching devices and advanced electrical generation components such as integrated starter generators and integrated starter alternators as well as advanced control techniques to make these systems more efficient.</r2:Description>

This effort will research, investigate, conduct experiments and validate APU technologies such as modular/scalable engine based APUs, fuel cell reformer systems to convert JP8 to hydrogen, sulfur tolerant JP8 fuel cell APUs and novel engine based APUs for military ground vehicle and unmanned ground systems.  This effort will also determine inputs for APU interface control documents, as well as investigate solutions for reducing APU acoustic signature for silent operation during mounted surveillance missions.

                                    <r2:Description>Track systems are one of the highest Operations &amp; Sustainment (O&amp;S) cost drivers for combat vehicle platforms.  The typical failure mechanism for these systems is associated with the elastomeric (rubber) components.  As vehicle platforms operate across a variety of terrain conditions, energy and heat from the environment causes premature fatiguing that can limit the overall life of these track systems.  The Elastomer Improvement Program (EIP) uses a state-of-the-art laboratory to research, formulate and laboratory test new elastomer compounds to increase track system durability and reduce O&amp;S costs.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the research, development, and evaluation of high-power electronic components, materials, and related technologies.  These technologies have application in compact and efficient power conversion, conditioning, and management sub-systems; energy storage and conversion devices; radio frequency (RF)/microwave and solid-state laser directed energy weapons (DEW); and traditional and non-traditional RF and laser electronic attack. All project elements are coordinated with and, as appropriate, leveraged by DEW and power/energy programs in the Air Force, Navy, High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, national labs, university consortia, and relevant industry and foreign partners.   The products of this research are required by developers of Army (DoD) systems to evolve traditional (mechanical-based) sub-systems such as geared transmissions, plate armor, and kinetic projectiles to electrically-based ones.  These products will provide the Soldier enhanced survivability and lethality through increased power management and energy savings as well as new fighting capabilities offered only by electrical power.

This project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground and Soldier portfolio.

The work in this project is coordinated with the Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC PE 063005, project 441); Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC) PE063004, project 232; Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) PE 063313, project G03; and Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC) PE 062705, project H11.  These efforts were previously funded in PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work on this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project fabricates and evaluates flexible display components emerging from the Army's Flexible Display Center (FDC) at the Arizona State University. The FDC conducts applied research on flexible display technologies that would make them inherently rugged (no glass), light weight, conformal, potentially low cost, and low power.  The resultant display technology would enable enhanced and new capabilities across a broad spectrum of Army applications (such as hands-free/wrist mounted situational awareness devices, flexible hand-held control devices, and monitors in vehicles).

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command,Control,Communications and Intelligence and Soldier portfolios.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) conducts applied research and investigates core night vision and electronic sensor components and software to improve the Army's capability to operate in all battlefield conditions.  Technologies pursued in this PE have the potential to provide the Army with new, or enhanced, capabilities to detect and identify targets farther on the battlefield, operate in obscured conditions, and maintain a higher degree of situational awareness (SA).  Project H95 advances infrared (IR) Focal Plane Array (FPA) technologies, assesses and evaluates sensor materials, designs advanced multi-function lasers for designation and range finding, and develops modeling and simulation for validating advanced sensor technologies.  In FY11 through FY16 the Army investment in advanced IR FPA technologies is augmented to ensure a world-wide technological and competitive IR sensor advantage for the United States. 

Work in this PE is fully coordinated with PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), PE 0602712A (Countermine Technology) and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. 

Work in this PE is performed by the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM)/Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC)/Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, VA.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts applied research and develops component technologies that enable improved Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition (RSTA) and situational awareness (SA) at an affordable price.  Component technologies include novel focal plane arrays (FPAs), processing and electronics improvements, and modeling and simulation to predict performance and to determine operational effectiveness.  This research focuses on dual band infrared (IR) FPAs necessary to search, identify and track mobile targets in all day/night visibility and battlefield conditions and to improve standoff detection in ground-to-ground and air-to-ground operations.  This project designs, fabricates and validates very large format IR FPAs needed for sensors to simultaneously provide wide area coverage and the high resolution for situational awareness, persistent surveillance and plume/gunflash detection.  In addition this project develops multispectral and hyperspectral algorithms for on-chip hyperspectral functionality, which offer the ability to perform detection, identification and signature identification at extended ranges as well as the ability to detect targets in "deep hide".  Reducing size, weight and power (SWaP) is a key research objective for all efforts. In FY11 through FY16 the Army investment in advanced IR FPA technologies is augmented to ensure a world-wide technological and competitive IR sensor advantage for the United States. 

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Soldier, Ground and Air portfolios.  

Work in this project is fully coordinated with PE 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), PE 0602712A (Countermine Technology) and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology). 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                                    <r2:Description>This effort investigates and designs new Digital Readout Integrated Circuit (DROIC) technology (digital-in-pixel) enabling the affordable very large format and multiband IR FPAs. The digital-in-pixel results in increased signal storage available to collect incoming signal information from the scene, compared to traditional analog techniques.  DROIC is an important component in reducing the overall IR sensor cost and SWaP by allowing much smaller FPA pitch. The increased storage improves dynamic range for targeting, situational awareness and persistent surveillance applications, contributing to the ability of the U.S. to ensure its historical night vision battlefield advantage.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) investigates, designs, and evaluates technologies to improve countermine, signature management and counter-sensors capabilities.  The focus is on sensor components, sub-components and software algorithms to improve detection of mines, explosive threats and directed energy; ballistic methods to defeat mines and explosive threats; and signature management technologies to reduce reconnaissance capabilities of the enemies.  This PE also supports DoD's Center of Excellence for Unexploded Ordnance which coordinates and standardizes land mine signature models; maintains a catalogue of mine signatures; supports the evaluation of mine detection sensors and algorithms; and working in conjunction with the US Army Engineering, Research and Development Center (ERDC), examines countermine phenomenology of surface and buried mines, and explosive threats.  Project H24 advances state of the art Countermine technologies to accurately detect threats with a high probability, reduce false alarms, and enable an increased operational tempo.  Project H35 evaluates and develops advanced signature management and deception techniques for masking friendly force capabilities and intentions.  

Work in this PE is related to and fully coordinated with PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602622A (Chemical, Smoke and Equipment Defeating Technology), PE 0602624A (Weapons and Munitions Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology).

Starting in FY12, technical efforts will focus on enabling controllable neutralization effects, primarily with lasers. With the technology transition of the munition-based technology for continued 6.3 developments, funding levels are reduced and commensurate with pursuing laser-based approaches. Achieving low/high order neutralization, including deflagration, effects will be the principal objective of the effort.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) investigates and evaluates enabling tools and methodologies that support the long-term sustainment of Army training and testing activities.  Project 048 improves the Army's ability to comply with requirements mandated by federal, state and local environmental/health laws and reducing the cost of this compliance. Project 835 develops enabling technologies to decontaminate or neutralize Army-unique hazardous and toxic wastes at sites containing waste ammunition, explosives, heavy metals, propellants, smokes, chemical munitions, and other organic contaminants, as well as technology to avoid the potential for future hazardous waste problems.  Project 895 focuses on reducing hazardous waste generation through process modification and control, materials recycling and substitution  as well as developing technologies to predict and mitigate range and maneuver constraints associated with current and emerging weapon systems, doctrine, and regulations.  Project 896 investigates technologies for ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, monitoring, modeling and mitigation to support sustainable use of Army facilities, lands and airspace to reduce or eliminate environmental constraints to military missions.   

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  

Technologies developed in this PE are transitioned to PE 0603728A (Environmental Quality Technology Demonstrations).  

Work in this PE is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project designs and develops tools and methods to enable the Army to reduce or eliminate environmental impacts both in the United States and abroad.  These technologies reduce the impact of legal and regulatory environmental restrictions on installation facilities, training and testing lands and ranges, as well as provide a means to avoid fines and facility shutdowns within the United States and reduce environmental impacts to the Warfighter abroad.  New and innovative technologies are essential for the effective control and reduction of military unique hazardous and non-hazardous wastes on military installations and associated with contingency operations bases worldwide.  Efforts focus on the impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond.  This project focuses on developing sustainable environmental protection technologies that help the Army maintain environmental compliance for sources of industrial pollution such as production facilities, facility contamination and other waste streams.  Efforts abroad include a focus on designing and developing technologies for deployed forces with environmentally safe, operationally enhanced and cost effective technologies and/or processes to achieve maximum diversion, minimization, or volume reduction of base camp and field waste.  Additional work is focused on ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, modeling, mitigation and monitoring technologies for installations associated with air quality and endangered species management.

The work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates a quantitative means to determine the environmental and human health effects resulting from exposure to explosives, propellants, smokes and products containing nanomaterials and new and emerging compounds and materials produced or used in Army industrial, field and battlefield operations or disposed of through past activities. This research provides the basis for tools and methods to maintain sustainable lands and ranges and to protect the health of the Soldier and the extended Army community. The specific end results of this research include: determination of acceptable contaminant concentration levels for residual munitions constituents (MCs) and munitions and explosives of concern that minimize adverse effects on the environment and human health and the development of methods that guide the design of nanomaterials and other new and emerging materials such that adverse effects on human health or the environment are minimized in their designed state and when they enter the environment where they may break down.  Performing research in genomics analysis, nanomaterial technologies, computational/molecular modeling tools for toxicity and exposure assessment; impacts of climate change on chemical and biological processes; and attributes of sustainable energy production further reduces the uncertainty associated with both the probability of exposure and the ultimate effect if exposed.  Results of this research will be integrated into the life cycle analysis process. Interim products are US Environmental Protection Agency approved health advisories and criteria documents to be used in risk assessment procedures.  The Army uses these criteria during negotiations with regulatory officials to set scientifically and economically appropriate cleanup and discharge limits at Army installations.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The project develops pollution prevention technologies required to reduce/eliminate the environmental footprint resulting from the manufacture, maintenance, use and surveillance of Army ordnance and other weapon systems. This project researches and develops revolutionary technologies to eliminate or significantly reduce the environmental impacts that threaten the sustainment of production and maintenance facilities, training ranges and operational areas. The project supports the transformation of the Army by ensuring that advanced energetic materials required for high-performance munitions (gun, rocket, missile propulsion systems, and warhead explosives) are devised to meet weapons lethality/survivability stretch goals in parallel with, and in compliance to, foreseeable sustainment requirements. Specific technology thrusts include environmentally-benign explosives developed with computer modeling using Department of Defense high-performance computing resources; novel energetics that capitalize on the unique behavior of nano-scale structures; chemically engineered explosive and propellant formulations produced with minimal environmental waste, long-storage lifetime, rapid/benign environmental degradation properties, and efficient extraction and reuse; and fuses, pyrotechnics, and initiators that are free from toxic chemicals. Other focus areas include base camp energy reduction initiatives, elimination of waste streams in contingency operations and toxic metal reductions from surface finishing processes. 

Work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.

This project provides the Army the technical capability to manage, protect and improve the biophysical characteristics of training and testing areas needed for realistic ranges and training lands.  Technologies within this project enable users to match mission events and training schedules with the resource capabilities of specific land areas and understand how the use of those resources effect mission support and environmental compliance.  The project investigates, designs, and develops novel methods and technologies to restore lands damaged during training activities and allow sustained use of installation facilities and training land resources.  The project supports readiness and full use of training lands through development of threatened and endangered species monitoring technology and management technologies for species at risk.  The project also designs and develops tools and technologies to avoid training restrictions and reduce constraints on training lands associated with invasive species and potential impacts from climate change.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates and applies advanced communications and network devices, software, algorithms and services by leveraging and adapting commercial research and new communications and network sciences work by the Army Research Lab, Network Science Collaborative Technology Alliance or other Basic Research efforts. This project focuses development in wireless transport (e.g. mobile radio based communications systems) to develop new techniques for improving communications in high radio frequency (RF) interference environments and to increase the communications capacity of terrestrial and satellite communications systems. This project also investigates enabling antenna components, materials, designs and configurations to reduce the visual signature of antennas on Soldier, vehicular and airborne platforms and reduce co-site interference on platforms with multiple transceivers such as radios and jammers. Additionally this project investigates cyber security devices, software and techniques to harden narrow band, wireless communications networks against cyber attacks; new mobile networking protocols to make wireless, on-the-move (OTM) communications networks more responsive to user needs. This project also investigates network operations software and techniques that improve the ability of the Soldier to manage and maintain complex, dynamic networks; and improved spectrum management software tools to make more efficient use of over-subscribed RF spectrum.

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence portfolio.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) investigates, evaluates, and advances technologies, techniques and tools for depiction and representation of the physical and human environment for use in military operations; for characterizing geospatial, atmospheric and weather conditions and impacts on systems and military missions; for conducting mobility, counter-mobility, survivability and force protection; and for enabling secure, sustainable, energy efficient facilities.  Research focuses on special requirements for battlefield visualization, tactical decision aids, weather intelligence products, and capabilities to exploit space assets.  Projects 855 and H71 support the materiel development, testing, and operations communities in evaluating the impacts of weather, terrain, and atmospheric obscurants on military materiel and operations. Project T40 advances technologies for adaptive and expedient force protection across the range of military operations (includes Deployable Force Protection).  This project also designs and evaluates software and hardware to identify and mitigate positive and negative ground obstacles; characterizes austere navigation environments and designs/evaluates materiel solutions including rapidly emplacable bridging, ground stabilization and breakwater structures; and builds and uses modeling and simulation tools to advance understanding of the interactions of weapons/munitions and novel defeat methodologies with buildings, shelters, bunkers, berms and bridges.  Project T41 investigates and evaluates application of technologies to enable garrison/post commanders to plan, monitor and operate facilities more efficiently, cost-effectively, securely and sustainably; and creates tools (including advanced models and simulation) that provide a framework for making trades and decisions.  Project T42 develops and validates models and simulations to understand the impacts of the physical environment on the performance of forces, ground and air vehicles, and sensors; as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on military operations.  Project T45 investigates and evaluates materials, components and systems that have potential to reduce energy losses in buildings and shelters; and potential to detect and mitigate consequences of contaminants such as bacteria and molds in air handling equipment and building materials.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates and advances capabilities for collection, processing, and creation of data and information depicting physical and human terrain, environmental conditions, and relationships in time and space; for digital map creation, transmission, and dissemination; and for map-based analytics for planning, decision making and execution.  This project uses non-traditional methods that exploit existing open source text, multi-media and cartographic materials addressing social, cultural and economic geography to advance the capability to produce and transmit high fidelity digital maps depicting the physical terrain, human terrain and environmental conditions. This project also develops software tools and methods for map-based analytics that allow deeper insights into the effects of the physical terrain, human terrain and environmental conditions on military operations, to include tactics and effects upon equipment and Soldier's performance.  The Army is defining and implementing the Army Geospatial Enterprise (AGE). The AGE provides map and geospatial data, information and software services seamlessly to the total force. This project explores and advances components and methods that optimize the utility of the AGE to the total Army.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops tactical weather and atmospheric effects/impacts algorithms for their integration into battlefield information products.  Efforts include high-resolution, local assessments and forecasts of meteorological conditions in near real time including effects of urban and mountainous terrain; analytical tools to assess the impact of the atmosphere to optimize system performance and operations planning and advanced atmospheric sensing applications to characterize and mitigate wind and turbulence in complex terrain.  It provides detailed model applications for various effects of the atmosphere on electro-optical and acoustic target detection, location, and identification.  This project develops both physics-based decision aids and rule-based decision support systems for assessing the impacts of weather/atmosphere across a spectrum of friendly and threat weapons systems, sensors, platforms, and operations.  Information can be applied to mission planning and execution, battlefield visualization, reconnaissance surveillance and target acquisition, route planning to maximize stealth and efficiency, web enabled tactical decision aids, and also modeling of environmental impacts for combat simulations and war games.  

This project supports the Army S&amp;T Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) Portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates, evaluates, and creates technologies for adaptive and expedient force protection across the range of military operations; for force projection and maneuver, including austere port entry and overcoming battlespace gaps (such as cliffs, ravines, mudflats, shallow rivers, and other natural obstacles) through prediction, definition, avoidance, or defeat of the gaps; for scalable weapons effects; and for high-resolution representation of near-surface terrain and environment for use with sensor models for things such as target detection and unmanned ground systems (UGS) navigation.  This research further provides physics-based representations of ground vehicle mobility, obstacle and barrier placement, survivability, and weapons effects in complex and urban terrain modeling and simulation.  Work in this project increases the survivability of critical assets from conventional, unconventional, and emerging weapons attacks and enables  maneuver support of deployed forces, while reducing their logistical footprint. This project supports Deployable force protection (DFP) efforts for overcoming critical capability gaps for protecting troops operating at smaller bases that are remote or integrated in with local communities.      

Work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Ground, and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I), and Soldier Portfolios.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this project is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS. Deployable force protection activities are coordinated with research, development and engineering centers and laboratories across the US Army, Navy and Air Force.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Deployable Force Protection</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>This effort researches, designs, and creates rapidly deployable detection, assessment, passive protection and active defensive technology-enabled capabilities to meet critical capability gaps for troops operating remotely at smaller bases or integrated with local communities. The needs at these smaller bases (less than 300 persons, not all U.S. troops) are unique based on constraints in transportability, manpower, organic resources, lack of hardening of structures, resupply, and training for example. Moreover, lack of interoperability and scaleability consume manpower and take away from time needed to perform missions. Threats include bases being overrun by hostiles; direct fire; rockets, artillery and mortars; and improvised explosive devices. Force protection challenges at these remote, smaller bases include providing increased standoff detection, blast and ballistic protection, and kinetic technologies subject to the constraints mentioned above. This work is coordinated with PE 0603784A/T08, PE 0603125A/DF5, PE 0603313A/G03 and PE 0602786A. Work is performed by Army, Navy and Air Force labs and centers.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates and evaluates technologies and techniques to ensure sustainable, cost efficient and effective facilities and to achieve resilient and sustainable installation and base operations.  The project focuses on facilities and operations technologies directly supporting training, readiness, force projection, force protection, homeland security, and forward base operations.  Facility enhancement technologies contribute to cost reductions in the Army facility life cycle process (infrastructure planning, assessment, design, construction, revitalization, sustainment, and disposal), and the supporting installation operations.  This work improves the ability of installations to support forces to meet transformation goals, improves designs for close battle training facilities, and enhances security of Soldiers, families, and civilians.  Technologies evolving from this work include integrated planning and design tools for US facilities and forward bases, models predicting water dispersed contaminant effects on facilities and occupants; sustainable facility and base management; collaborative decision support tools; and advanced materials.  In addition, technologies from this work will support analysis of socio-cultural and facility issues in forward base operations, including urban environments.  

Work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) Portfolios.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates and evaluates the condition and changes to the physical environment brought about by natural and manmade causes, especially those affecting military operations. Further, the investigations identify and quantify the physical environment's effect on personnel, platforms, sensors, and systems in order to develop improved tactics, techniques, procedures, and plans that ensure information superiority, situational awareness, and force projection. To achieve this, both empirical and theoretical approaches seek to forecast terrain properties and processes through various modeling approaches, and link them to planning and decision aids forming new capabilities for the Army.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) conducts applied behavioral and social science research that provides non-materiel solutions to ensure that Soldiers can adapt and excel and improve the Army's capability to fully leverage advances in networks, systems, and technologies as they evolve. This research provides the scientific basis to recruit, select, assign, promote, educate, train, and retain Soldiers and leaders that comprise a ready and relevant Landpower capability.  The human science applied research conducted in this program element provides knowledge-products, methods, techniques, and tools that will enable the Army to: select Soldiers who are predicted to perform well in future jobs; assign Soldiers to Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) and jobs that better match their skills and abilities; retain an effective career force through improved strategies and behavioral incentives to influence Soldiers to stay in the Army for longer periods of time; accelerate the development of leader critical thinking and interpersonal skills through virtual practice so that junior leaders are more adaptable and prepared for uncertain, rapidly changing missions; develop innovative training strategies for complex battle command skills in network-enabled environments; and design training tools for dismounted squad leadership and team maneuver with ground Soldier systems technologies.  Additional research is focused on training techniques and procedures that make it easier for trainers and training developers to rapidly respond to changes in mission or operational requirements and provide a more synergistic training and education process (e.g., automated and improved diagnostics, coaching and mentoring, performance measures, and feedback methods.

The cited work is consistent with the Director, Defense Research and Engineering Strategic Plan, the Army Modernization Strategy, and the Army Science and Technology Master Plan.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates and evaluates components and materials that  may enhance Soldier survivability from combat threats (flame and thermal threats, blast and ballistic threats, and lasers) and the field environment (e.g., cold, heat, wet) to increase operational effectiveness while decreasing the Soldier's cognitive and physical burden. Included are technologies and novel materials related to personnel armor, helmets, hearing protection, eyewear, and protective inserts for shelters. In addition, this project supports the development and refinement of essential analytic tools needed to predict and/or assess the combat effectiveness of next generation Soldier systems with a focus on human science investigation to identify and develop methods to assess human responses to sensory, physical, cognitive, and affective stimuli and stressors. 

Efforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) supports application of knowledge gained through basic research to refine drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, medical practices/procedures, and other preventive measures essential to the protection and sustainment of Warfighter health. Research is conducted in five principal areas: Combat Casualty Care; Military Operational Medicine; Military Relevant Infectious Diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine; and Systems Biology/Network Sciences. Research is funded in seven projects.  

Project 869 refines knowledge and technologies on screening tools and preventive measures for post-traumatic stress disorder and mild traumatic brain injuries, physiological monitors, and interventions to protect Soldiers from injuries resulting from operational stress, and exposure to hazardous environments and materials. Also conducts research on medically valid testing devices and predictive models used for the refinement of Soldier protective equipment. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.  

Project 870 designs and refines medical diagnostic devices, drugs, and vaccines for protection and treatment against naturally occurring diseases and wound infections of military importance, as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.  

Project 873 conducts research on HIV, which causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Work in this area includes refining improved identification methods to determine genetic diversity of the virus, preclinical work in laboratory animals including non-human primates to identify candidates for future vaccine refinement, and evaluating and preparing overseas sites for future vaccine trials. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.    

Project 874 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics (products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and diagnostics for resuscitation, life support, and post-evacuation restorative and rehabilitative care, as well as trauma care systems for use by field medics and surgeons. Research focus is on identifying more effective critical care technologies and protocols to treat severe bleeding, traumatic brain injury and other blast related injuries, and treatments for ocular injury and visual system dysfunction, as well as laboratory and animal studies of regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, and bone tissue for the care and treatment of battle-injured casualties. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. 

Project FH2 conducts applied research directed toward the sustainment of a healthy force of Warfighters through the entire deployment life cycle.  

Project VB4 conducts applied research in systems biology to provide a highly effective mechanism to integrate iterative biological tests, computer simulations, and animal studies.  Such refinement efforts using systems biology could ultimately reduce the time and effort invested in medical product refinement. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.

Project VJ4 examines over a planned 5-year period the mental and behavioral health of Soldiers to counter suicidal behavior. This work will focus on advancing the understanding of the multiple determinants of suicidal behavior, psychopathology (study of the causes and nature of abnormal behavior), psychological resilience, and role functioning. Work on this project is being performed by the National Institute of Mental Health through extramural cooperative research grants in collaboration with the Department of the Army. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

All medical applied research is conducted in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA requires thorough testing in animals (referred to as preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon transition to 6.3 Advanced Technology Research). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and assay refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves preclinical testing in animals. The EPA also requires thorough testing of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for use.

Program refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biome</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts applied research for medical countermeasures to naturally occurring infectious diseases that pose a significant threat to the operational effectiveness of forces deployed outside the United States. Effective preventive countermeasures (protective/therapeutic drugs and vaccines and insect repellents and traps) protect the Force from disease and sustain operations by avoiding the need for evacuations from the theater of operations. Diseases of military importance are malaria, bacterial diarrhea, and viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever and hantavirus). In addition to countermeasures, this project funds refinement of improved diagnostic tools to facilitate early identification of infectious disease threats in an operational environment, informing Commanders of the need to institute preventive actions and improve medical care. Major goals are to integrate genomics (DNA-based) and proteomics (protein-based) as well as other new biotechnologies into the refinement of new concepts for new vaccine, drug, and diagnostics candidates.

Research conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas:

(1) Drugs to Prevent/Treat Parasitic (living in or on another organism) Diseases
(2) Vaccines for Prevention of Malaria
(3) Diagnostics and Disease Transmission Control
(4) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)
(5) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)

For the refinement of drugs and biological products, studies in the laboratory and in animal models provide a proof-of-concept for these candidate products, including safety, toxicity, and effectiveness, and are necessary to provide evidence to the FDA to justify approval for a product to enter into future human subject testing. Additional non-clinical studies are often needed in applied research even after candidate products enter into human testing during advanced technology development, usually at the direction of the FDA, to assess potential safety issues. Drug and vaccine refinement bears high technical risk. Of those candidates identified as promising in initial screens, the vast majority are eliminated after additional safety, toxicity, and/or effectiveness testing. Similarly, vaccine candidates have a high failure rate, because animal testing may not be a good predictor of human response, and therefore candidate technologies/products are often eliminated after going into human trials. Because of this high failure rate, a continuing effort to identify other potential candidates to sustain a working pipeline of countermeasures is critical for replacing those products that fail in testing.  

Work is managed by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the NMRC. The Army is responsible for programming and funding all DoD naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.   

Promising medical countermeasures identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project 810.
 
The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project refines and assesses concepts, techniques, and materiel that improve survivability and ensure better medical treatment outcomes for Warfighters wounded in combat and other military operations. Combat casualty care research addresses control of severe bleeding, revival and stabilization, prognostics and diagnostics for life support systems (predictive indicators and decision aids), treatment of burns, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Clinical and rehabilitative medicine research addresses tissue repair including transplant technologies, orthopedic injuries, eye injuries, and face trauma.

Research involves extensive collaboration with multiple academic institutions to refine treatments for combat wounds through AFIRM. This project is coordinated with the Military Departments and other government organizations to avoid duplication.

Research conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas:
(1) Damage Control Resuscitation
(2) Combat Trauma Therapies
(3) Combat Critical Care Engineering
(4) Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine
(5) Traumatic Brain Injury

All drugs, biological products, and medical devices are refined in accordance with FDA regulations, which govern testing in animals to assess safety, toxicity, and effectiveness and subsequent human subject clinical trials.  

Promising efforts identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project 840.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work on this project is performed by USAISR, the U.S. Army Dental Trauma Research Detachment (USADTRD), Fort Sam Houston, TX; WRAIR, Silver Spring, MD; and the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM), Fort Detrick, MD.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts research to support applied research directed toward the sustainment of a healthy force of Warfighters from accession through retirement.  This research focuses on enhanced protection of Soldiers against health threats in military operations and training. Stressors that adversely affect individual Soldier health readiness are identified and studied to refine interventions that will protect Soldiers and improve their health and performance in stressful environments. This is follow-on research that extends and applies findings from over a decade of research on Gulf War Illnesses and other chronic multi-symptom illnesses that have suspected nerve and behavioral alterations caused by environmental contaminants and deployment stressors. Key databases include the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow us to evaluate interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.

Force Health Protection applied research is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services working on Army projects.

Research conducted in this project focuses on the following three areas:
(1) Millennium Cohort Research
(2) Biomarkers of Exposure and Environmental Biomonitoring
(3) Physiological Response and Blast and Blunt Trauma Models of Thoracic (Chest) and Pulmonary (Lung) Injuries
 
Promising efforts identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project FH4.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.    
 
Work in this project is performed by the U.S. Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, CA; and USARIEM, Natick, MA. 

Efforts in this project support the Soldier Portfolio and the principal area of Combat Casualty Care.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
