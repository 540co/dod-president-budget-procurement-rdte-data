            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program includes support for multidisciplinary basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines that enable the U.S. Navy to maintain
technological superiority, and for university research infrastructure to acquire research instrumentation needed to maintain and improve the quality of university
research important to the Navy. Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high priority topics and
opportunities that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline. For many military problems this multidisciplinary approach serves to stimulate innovation,
accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results into Naval applications. The Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP) supports
university research infrastructure essential to high quality, Navy-relevant research. The instrumentation program complements other Navy research programs by
supporting the purchase of high cost research instrumentation that is necessary to carry out cutting-edge research. The program supports Presidential Early Career
Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), single investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their research
careers. This program provides the knowledge base, scientific concepts, and technological advances for the maintenance of Naval power and national security.


Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>DEFENSE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION PROGRAM (DURIP)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>DURIP funds are provided to universities to purchase relatively high cost research instrumentation that is normally not included in single-investigator type research grants. Individual grants range from $50K to $1.5M. The DURIP program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) interest item and OSD directs that funding for the DURIP efforts be awarded after OSD announces the awardees, which typically takes place towards the second half of the fiscal year. In turn, universities need to purchase the instrumentation and take delivery before any billings are generated. It frequently takes several months for delivery and billing to be completed.  DURIP is a one year program.

The decrease in FY2017 reflects a reduction in the number of DURIP awards.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>MULTIDISCIPLINARY UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INITIATIVE (MURI)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Research efforts include high priority topics that intersect more than one traditional discipline. MURI topics are selected to address Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Focus Areas as described in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan. 
The MURI program is an OSD interest item and OSD directs that funding for the MURI efforts be awarded after OSD announces the awardees, which typically takes place towards the second half of the fiscal year. Since the MURI program funds academic researchers, execution of the efforts typically ramps up during the summer academic break months. MURI projects make significant contributions to Navy and DoD objectives by; speeding up scientific programs by cross-fertilization of ideas, hastening the transition of basic research to practical applications, and training students in cross-disciplinary approaches to science and engineering research of importance to DoD. MURI is a five year program.


The increase in funding from FY 2015 to FY 2016 reflects the increased number of topics/awards in FY 2016.  The FY 2017 reduction reflects fewer topics/awards in coordination with OSD.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) superiority by providing new technological concepts for the maintenance of Naval power and national security, and by helping to avoid scientific surprise while exploiting scientific breakthroughs and providing options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs). The Department of Navy (DON) component responds to S&amp;T directions of the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan for long term Navy and Marine Corps improvements and is in consonance with future warfighting concepts and doctrine developed at the Naval Warfare Development Command and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command. It enables technologies that significantly improve the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Future Joint Warfighting Capabilities. The In-house Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program also adds increased emphasis to the revitalization of the scientist and engineer workforce component at the Navy's Warfare Centers and Laboratories by attracting superior candidates and retaining our best members through the provision of exciting and meaningful work.

This PE addresses DON Basic Research, which includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national-security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences, and is the core of Discovery and Invention. Basic research projects are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research in some hundred-plus technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated in thirteen research focus areas: Power and Energy; Operational Environments; Maritime Domain Awareness; Asymmetric and Irregular Warfare; Information, Analysis and Communication; Power Projection; Assure Access and Hold at Risk; Distributed Operations; Naval Warfighter Performance and Protection; Survivability and Self-Defense; Platform Mobility; Fleet/Force Sustainment; Affordability, Maintainability and Reliability.

This portion of the DON Basic Research Program provides participating Naval Warfare Centers and Laboratories with funding for: basic research to support the execution of their assigned missions; developing and maintaining a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems; promoting hiring and development of new scientists; and encouragement of collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories.

ILIR efforts are selected by Naval Warfare Centers/Lab Commanding Officers and Technical Directors near the start of each Fiscal Year through internal competition. Efforts typically last three years, and are generally designed to assess the promise of new lines of research. Successful efforts attract external, competitively awarded funding. Because the Warfare Centers and Labs encompass the full range of naval technology interests, the scope of ILIR topics roughly parallels that of PE 0601153N, Defense Research Science.

In FY15 the ILIR PE 06011652N was simplified from seven Naval technology interests (advanced materials, electronics sensor sciences, energy sciences, human performance sciences, information sciences, naval platform design sciences, and ocean/space sciences) into one encompassing ILIR program.  It is still possible to report which naval technology interest each project falls under.  Due to the number of efforts in PE 06011652N, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This effort will support both the Science and Engineering Apprenticeship Program (SEAP) and the Naval Research Enterprise Intern Program (NREIP) summer programs to encourage participating students to pursue science and engineering careers, to further their education via mentoring by laboratory personnel and their participation in research, and to make them aware of DoN research and technology efforts, which can lead to employment within the DoN.  Participating students will spend eight to ten weeks during the summer doing research at approximately 19 to 20 DoN laboratories.  Participants will receive a stipend distributed by the Contractor.  The stipend is a monthly allowance paid to interns for their participation in the research efforts.

This activity was separated from ILIR in FY 2013 to highlight Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) efforts at Navy labs previously funded within the Ocean/Space Sciences activity in this PE. Funding increase in FY 2015 results from temporary augmentation of STEM within the PE, but the FY 2016 decrease plan rebalances the PE to focus on the NREIP and SEAP programs, scaling back on other STEM efforts.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The ILIR initiative seeks to improve the quality of defense research conducted predominantly through the Naval Warfare Centers/Laboratories.  It also supports the development of technical intellect and education of engineers and scientists in disciplines critical to national defense needs through the development of new knowledge in a military laboratory environment.  Initial research focus is often conducted in an unfettered environment since it is basic research, but many projects focus on applying recently developed theoretical knowledge to real world military problems with the intention of developing new capabilities and improving the performance of existing systems.  Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs.  The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's Congressionally directed "Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) superiority, provides new technological concepts for the maintenance of naval power and national security, and helps avoid scientific surprise.  It is based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science &amp; Technology Strategy approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This new strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It exploits scientific breakthroughs and provides options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) and Innovative Naval Prototypes (INPs).  

This PE addresses basic research efforts including scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental and life sciences.  Basic research efforts are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research on the order of a hundred technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated into about fifteen research areas.  These in turn support the major research areas of the Navy and Marine Corps: Autonomous Systems; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Marine as a System; Information Analysis and Decision Support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Logistics; Materials; Operational Environments; Platforms; Power and Energy Technology; Sensors and Electronics; Warrior Performance and Protection; Weapons and Support (Education and Outreach).

S&amp;T investment in basic research also includes the National Naval Responsibilities (NNRs), fields upon which a wide range of fundamental Naval capabilities depend.  There are currently five NNRs.

S&amp;T investment in basic research also includes the Basic Research Challenge Program which was established to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program.  The Basic Research Challenge Program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multi-disciplinary and departmental collaborative efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science and attracts new principal investigators and organizations.  Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Funding increase in FY16 is the result of changing S&amp;T investment priorities within the Department of the Navy, resulting from increased funding across the PE each year resulting in higher investment levels in each major category of Air, Ground and Sea Vehicles.

Funding decrease in FY 2017 results from decreased PE level funding availability resulting in lower investment levels in each major category of AIR, GROUND AND SEA VEHICLES.

                                <r2:Description>Science and Engineering Education and Career Development activities include DON participation in science fairs, summer research interns/fellows at Navy laboratories, graduate fellowships for individuals expected to become members of the engineering faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MIs), and curricular enrichment programs. It is centered on Naval S&amp;T efforts supporting Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). Outreach includes the encouragement, promotion, planning, coordination and administration of Naval Science and Technology. 

Funding also supports ONRG International Science Program whose mission is to search the globe for emerging scientific research and advanced technologies to enable the Office of Naval Research and the Naval Research Enterprise to effectively address current needs of the Fleet/Forces, and investigate and assess revolutionary, high-payoff technologies for future naval missions and capabilities. This is accomplished through PHD-level Associate Director scientists located in Asia, Europe and South America collaborating with international organizations and researchers through grants in innovative basic research, and establishing quality, relevant connections between international science and technology (S&amp;T) centers of excellence and DON, DOD, and other US Government organizations. The direct impact of this investment is to capitalize on international basic research during unprecedented and dynamic global interdependence, increasing the ability to solve DON S&amp;T challenges through shared knowledge and technologies with partners during a time of budget constraints. Additionally, this investment builds global S&amp;T awareness to reduce the risk of potential technological surprise, and supports theater security cooperation goals to sustain cooperative relationships with an expanding set of international partners to enhance global security.

The funding increase in 2016 is the result of significant emphasis in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), HBCU and YIP initiatives.

Funding decrease in FY 2017 results from decreased PE level funding availability resulting in lower investment levels in each major category of SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING EDUCATION, CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND OUTREACH.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The ONR Basic Research Challenge (BRC) program was established in 2008 to competitively select and fund promising research programs in new areas not addressed by the current basic research program. In the past, the Basic Research Challenge Program has been integrated into the legacy R2 Activities to illustrate its alignment with the mainstream Naval research disciplines, but with this update BRC is being identified as its own R2 Activity to call attention to the significance it provides to new areas of Naval importance. The program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multidisciplinary and departmental collaborative efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science and attract new principal investigators and organizations. Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years. Topics are submitted by ONR program officers and are selected for BRC awards by ONR's director of research. Basic Research Challenge award topics are then issued as a broad agency announcement.

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Defense Basic Research seeks to improve the quality of defense research conducted predominantly through universities and government laboratories.  It also supports the education of engineers and scientists in disciplines critical to national defense needs through the development of new knowledge in an academic environment.  Initial research focus is generally conducted in an unfettered environment because of the nature of basic research, but as more is learned and applications emerge, individual research projects take on a more applied focus.  Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs.  Example metrics include a biporous wick structure for thermal management of power electric modules capable of removing 900 watts per square centimeter which was recently developed by an academia/industry team.  The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's congressionally directed "Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE supports both advanced technology research and near to mid-term transition opportunities.  The advanced research focus is primarily on high energy lasers, Electromagnetic Railgun (EMRG) development, Hyper Velocity Projectiles (HVP), high speed weapon propulsion, and electro-optic/infrared (EO/IR) sensor technologies. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The DE program addresses the requirements of future Navy combatants to provide ship defense against the emerging threats that are proliferating throughout the Navies of the world. The Directed Energy portion of this activity consists of two elements. The first element involves applied research and development of technologies supporting advanced accelerators with applications to directed energy weapons. 


FY 2015 to FY 2016 decrease in funding is due to completion of the Solid State Laser - QRC program as well as a continued realignment of Free Electron Laser (FEL) activities. 

FY 2016 to FY 2017 decrease in funding is due to Solid State Technology Maturation Program (SSL-TM) program entering its fabrication and testing phase.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>Directed Energy and Accelerator Research:

-Continued to develop the most promising component technologies such as normal conducting and super conducting RF electron beam injectors, advanced high power cathode technologies, high power compact amplifiers, and advanced mirrors, coatings and optical components capable of handling the significantly higher energies for potential alignment in a Free Electron Laser. 

Solid State Laser - Technology Maturation (SSL-TM): 

-Continued the development of technologies suitable for a solid state laser weapon system, including technologies for maritime beam director, targeting and laser subsystems, which are capable of supporting future Navy missions to defeat small boat swarms, UAV swarms, and provide potential ISR disruption and/or defeat. This work supports future prototype developments and will include laser subsystem (potentially both slab and fiber solid state systems) and required beam director scientific studies. The focus of the effort will be to support the development and advancement of future Navy Solid State Laser prototypes, including the development of lethality studies and atmospheric characterization. These scientific studies are critical to understand and support missions identified for a layered defensive capability, in the maritime environment, which shall include robust modeling and simulation of atmospheric absorption and turbulence. 
-Conducted lethality testing for notional solid state laser designs. This will include scientific studies of laser erosion, pitting, and ablation of various target materials for improved modeling and simulation that will support development of the governing technical requirements for a beam director and targeting system capable of performing Navy surface ship self-defense missions. 
-Continued studies of atmospheric absorption and turbulence, suitable to evaluate notional maritime beam director subsystems, and including studies in adaptive optics for improved lethality performance in low altitude, maritime surface conditions. These scientific studies are critical to understanding the impact of boundary layer and sea-water-air turbulent mechanics on future laser weapons systems and interfaces. 
-Continued trade studies on innovative solid state laser subsystems designs, based off industry available technologies or those technologies identified by the High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office (HEL JTO). These investments will be considered "break through" type of investments, which require additional scientific study to determine their potential for near term capability improvements in a future naval prototype system. 
-Continued scientific studies on laser subcomponents, including laser pump diodes and laser gain media, which have the potential to support future acquisition programs, but are based on solid state laser technologies. Efforts in this area will focus on emerging commercial technologies and government sponsored research, which are suitable for use in a maritime domain. Research and technology developments will include advancements suitable for use by either solid state slab or solid state fiber optic laser subsystems - and which if matured, would enable rapid scientific advancements and improve specific systems performance against key performance parameters. 
-Continued scientific trade studies of notional predictive avoidance systems, which examine the control interfaces between sensors and future prototypical naval laser weapons, which would provide an inherent "safe-arm" function for the projecting of laser power at long range (potentially beyond typical visible, line of sight distances.) Of particular concern is the designs for safety in future laser weapons to halt laser energy propagation, while performing Navy surface ship self- defense missions, and avoid inadvertent illumination of non-threat forces (e.g. friendly sensors or platforms.)
- Conducted component and subcomponent laboratory tests.

Applied Electromagnetics for High Power Weapons
-Completed the development of Gallium Nitride as an advanced nonlinear optic material.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This PE develops early components technologies that can be integrated into weapon systems that meet warfighter requirements.  Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).  The metrics used to evaluate 6.2 programs are necessarily less precise than those used in 6.3 programs. 

The metrics for this PE can be divided into two categories:  technological and organizational/functional.  Technological metrics address the success of the work performed.  The primary technological metrics used in this PE involve laboratory experiments/tests demonstrating proof of the concept for the technology.  This demonstration is frequently a hand-assembled functioning breadboard of the concept.  The organizational/functional metrics applied to this PE include:  transition of the technology to advanced development in a 6.3 PE and applicability of the technology to documented warfighter problems or requirements.  Successful implementation of these categories would result in the application of a pass/fail metric and further evaluation for possible transition to a 6.3 development/demonstration program.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this program element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE addresses applied research associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy.  It supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial, and air) and the protection of those platforms.  The goal is to provide the ability to win or avoid engagements with other platforms or weapons and, in the event of engagement, to resist and control damage while preserving operational capability.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment directly supports the Theater Air and Missile Defense transformational capability required by Sea Shield and the Ship to Objective Maneuver key transformational capability.  This is accomplished by improvements in platform offensive performance, stealth, and self-defense.  

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project addresses applied research associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy.  It supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial, and air) and the protection of those platforms.  The goal is to provide the ability to win or avoid engagements with other platforms or weapons and, in the event of engagement, to resist and control damage while preserving operational capability.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment directly supports the Theater Air and Missile Defense transformational capability required by Sea Shield and the Ship to Objective Maneuver key transformational capability by virtue of improvements in platform offensive performance, stealth, and self-defense.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>AIRCRAFT TECHNOLOGY</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Aircraft Technology activity develops technologies for reduced observables technology and enhanced capability of naval aviation aircraft platforms in terms of mission effectiveness, platform range, responsiveness, survivability, observability, readiness, safety and life cycle cost. It also develops new Naval air vehicle concepts and high impact, saleable naval air vehicle technologies, such as - autonomous air vehicle command and control, helicopter and tilt rotorsystems, aerodynamics, propulsion systems, materials, structures and flight controls for future and legacy air vehicles. 

Variable Cycle Advanced Technology (VCAT) will identify and mature critical, relevant variable/adaptive cycle propulsion system technologies for the next generation carrier-based Tactical Aircraft (TACAIR)/Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance(ISR) systems. Autonomous Aerial Cargo/Utility System (AACUS) will develop advanced autonomous capabilities to enable rapid resupply of distributed forces in the short term. The Sea-Based Aviation National Naval Responsibility (SBA NNR) Structures and Materials program will develop the next generation structural capability and material response science for aircraft technology in fixed and rotary wing, manned and unmanned airframe technology to achieve reduced weight, increased durability, strength, streamlined manufacturability, reduced life-cycle cost and maintenance/readiness gaps improvements. Program payoffs include increased availability/readiness, reduced sustainment requirements, fatigue/loads life enhancement, reduced weight and improved range, and advanced prognostics design tools. 

These efforts addresses unique attributes to propulsion and power technologies for Naval Aviation, as well as those having higher importance to Naval Aviation and some that are more pervasive to all of military aviation. Related basic research efforts are addressed under 0601153N. 

The funding increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the initiation of the joint Tern program and an increase in AACUS activities as the program enters phase 3.  

The funding decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to maturation of AACUS technology applied research effort.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Fleet Force Protection and Defense against Undersea Threats efforts include applied research for complementary sensor and processing technologies for platform protection.  Current small platforms (both surface and airborne) have little to no situational awareness (SA) or self-protection against air, surface, and asymmetric threats.  A goal of this activity is to provide these platforms with effective self-protection.  The technology areas specific to platform protection will develop individual, multispectral electro-optical (EO), infrared (IR), radio frequency (RF), electro-magnetic (EM), visual and acoustic or chemical sensors/biosensors and associated processing.  To defend platforms from current and advanced threats in at-sea littoral environments and in port, these technologies must improve multispectral detection and distribution of specific threat information.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Efforts include: signature reduction, hull life assurance, hydromechanics, distributed control for automated survivability (includes damage control), and advanced naval power systems. 

Signature reduction addresses electromagnetic, infrared, and acoustic signature tailoring, both topside and underwater.

Hull life assurance addresses development of new structural system approaches for surface ships and submarines, including the management of weapons effects to control structural damage and the improvement of structural materials.

Hydromechanics addresses hydrodynamic technologies, including the signature aspects of the hull-propulsor interaction and maneuvering. 

Distributed intelligence for automated survivability addresses both the basic technology of automating machinery control systems, as well as, distributed control of systems utilizing autonomy for mission context based reconfiguration. 

Unmanned Sea Surface Vehicle applied research includes short-term motion forecasting for recovery of USSVs on a host ship in higher sea states and determination of slamming loads on high-speed planing hulls for structural weight reduction.   

Advanced naval power systems efforts address electrical and auxiliary system and component technology to provide improvement in energy and power density, operating efficiency and recoverability from casualties. Advanced Naval Power efforts include: developing technologies to improve warfighting capability with more energy efficient systems;  mitigate adverse impacts of alternative fuel on Naval platforms and equipment; and utilizing the Electric Ship Research and Development Consortium (ESRDC) efforts to develop modeling and simulation tools to provide critical design &amp; operational capabilities for the all-electric ship program, accelerate development and demonstration of technologies, reduce risk of new technology insertion and address the national shortage of electrical power engineers.

                                <r2:Description>The IAR R2 activity was stood up in FY 2013 as the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) to consolidate all NRE related IAR investments. Projects funded in this R2 Activity are intended to be approximately 2-3 years in length.  Based on historical trends approximately 30% of these projects will turn over each year.  The Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) encompasses the Independent Applied Research (IAR) efforts focused on solving a wide range of Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) fleet issues utilizing unique Naval Warfare Center (WC) laboratory capabilities. Efforts under this activity address the full spectrum of the DON S&amp;T Strategic Plan technology using focus areas which engage Naval aviation, sea surface, undersea, space, weapons, communication, information, and human systems. The IAR Program provides participating WCs with in-house funding for applied research to support the execution of their assigned missions by: 
-Developing and maintaining a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems.
-Promoting the hiring and development of talented new scientists and engineers (S&amp;E) with the insurance of proper mentoring with senior personnel.
-Encouraging collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories. 

Funded projects are chosen through rigorous internal competition by each WC's selection committee and typically last two to three years.  IAR projects are generally designed to promote investment in high-risk/high-payoff research and also allow young S&amp;Es to manage Navy relevant research projects. A limited number of successful efforts developed under the In-House Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) basic research Program Element 0601152N are matured and further developed under the IAR program with the goal of transitioning these technologies to the warfighter.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This PE supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial and air) and the protection of those platforms.  Each PE Activity has unique goals and metrics, some of which include classified quantitative measurements.  Overall metric goals are focused on achieving sufficient improvement in component or system capability such that the 6.2 applied research projects meet the need of or produce a demand for inclusion in advanced technology that may lead to incorporation into acquisition programs or industry products available to acquisition programs.  Efforts funded in this PE also include energy programs in support of SECNAV energy goals and efforts in support of the Ohio Replacement program.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. This PE also directly supports Expeditionary Force 21 (EF 21), which  is now the Marine Corps' capstone concept that establishes  the vision and goals for USMC S&amp;T over the next 10 years and provides a plan for guiding the design and development of the future force.  One third of the Marine Corps operating forces will be forward  deployed.  These forces will be task-organized into a greater variety of formations, capable of operating from a more diverse array of ships dispersed over wider areas, in order to meet the Combatant Commanders' security cooperation and partner engagement requirements.  In the event of crises, those forces will be able to composite these distributed formations into larger, cohesive naval formations.  This presents both challenges and opportunities for USMC S&amp;T. Expeditionary Force 21 will inform future decisions regarding how the Marine Corps will adjust organizational structure to exploit the value of regionally focused forces.  A fixed geographic orientation will facilitate Marine Commanders and their staffs with more frequent interactions with theater- and component-level organizations, establishing professional bonds and a shared sense of the area's challenges and opportunities.  Expeditionary Force 21 provides the basis for future Navy and Marine Corps capability development to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.  The vision for Expeditionary Force 21 is to provide guidance for how the Marine Corps will be postured, organized, trained, and equipped to fulfill the responsibilities and missions required around the world.  Through Expeditionary Force 21, the Marine Corps intends to operate from the sea and provide the right sized force in the right place, at the right time.

This PE is organized into nine activities which are represented as seven Expeditionary Warfighting Capability Areas, as well as Future Concepts, Technology Assessment and Roadmapping, and the Littoral Combat/Power Projection (LC/PP) FNC.  The primary objective of this PE is to develop and demonstrate the technologies needed to meet the Marine Corps unique responsibility of training and equipping the Marine Air/Ground Task Force (MAGTF) for Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  In the post-September 11 world, irregular warfare (IW) has emerged as the dominant form of warfare confronting the United States, its allies and its partners; accordingly, this PE has been structured to account for distributed, long-duration operations, including unconventional warfare, counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and stabilization and reconstruction operations.  IW emphasizes the use of indirect, non-conventional methods and means to subvert, attrite, and exhaust an adversary, or render irrelevant, rather than defeat him through direct conventional military confrontation.   IW is now institutionalized in Marine Corps planning, investment, and capability development.  This PE provides the knowledge base to support Advanced Technology Development (6.3) and is the technology base for future expeditionary warfare capabilities.  This PE supports the Expeditionary Force Development System of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) and responds directly to the Marine Corps Science and Technology (S&amp;T) process as well as supporting related Littoral and Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare capabilities developed by the Navy's Mission Capability Program.  The Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly.  The FNC program explores and demonstrates technologies that enable Sea Strike, Sea Shield, Sea Basing, FORCEnet and Force Health Protection pillars, Space, Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and the Enterprise and Platform Enablers.  The FNC program comprises Enabling Capabilities (ECs) which develop and deliver quantifiable products (i.e., prototype systems, knowledge products, and technology improvements) in response to validated requirements for insertion into acquisition programs of record after meeting agreed upon exit criteria within five years. The core 6.2 program also supports Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) and Innovation and Transformation (I&amp;T).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve key transformational capabilities required by the Sea Power 21 Pillars, as well as enable Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM), Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  The Marine Corps Service Campaign Plan (MCSCP, guided by the Commandant's Planning Guidance, is the lens through which USMC S&amp;T priorities are acted upon to guide the future development of the Total Force.
Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This activity addresses the applied research associated with the Marine Corps participation in the Department of the Navy's (DoN) Science and Technology Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the DoN Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&amp;T Gaps that are generated by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders.  The funding is aligned with the Naval challenges associated with projecting power despite anti-access and area denial, specifically the Sea Shield, Power and Energy, FORCEnet, and the Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare warfighting capability gaps. The funding profile reflects the alignment of the FNC program investments into Enabling Capabilities (ECs); ECs respond to priority Naval warfighting capability gaps.  Funding for each EC is aligned to a 6.2 or 6.3 Budget Activity (BA) as appropriate.

The FY2015 to FY2016 decrease in the Littoral Combat/Power Projection activity is due to a FY2016 Congressional reduction.  Accordingly, the Future Naval Capabilities within the activity will be re-phased and amended appropriately to accommodate the delta. The FY2016 to FY2017 increase in the FNC Activity is due to the FY2016 Congressional reduction and will realign the activity to its original programming levels in FY2017.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>This activity supports Marine Corps Expeditionary Logistics which is the practical discipline and real world application of the deployment, sustainment, reconstitution, and re-deployment of forces engaged in expeditionary operations.  Expeditionary Logistics replaces mass with assured knowledge and speed, is equally capable ashore or afloat in austere environments, and is fully scalable to meet uncertain requirements.  Expeditionary Logistics logically divides into four pillars:  efficient and responsive force sustainment, planning and directing logistics operations, logistics demand reduction, and fleet maintenance.  These pillars are thoroughly integrated and perpetually related in execution

The FY 2015 to FY 2016 funding increase is due to the acceleration and early completion of the logistics C2 systems for optimizing the transportation of materiel across multiple intra and inter-theater connector vehicles (aka: Transportation Exploitation Tool).</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Maneuver thrust area focuses on the development of technologies that will increase the warfighting capabilities and effectiveness of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF). This thrust aims at capturing emerging and "leap ahead" technologies in the areas of mobility, materials, propulsion, survivability, durability, signature reduction, modularity, and unmanned systems.  Emphasis on survivability technologies includes defeat of small arms, IEDs, mine blast, and RPGs.  Efforts also continue in the development of modeling and simulation tools that integrate many different physics based modeling systems with rigorous operational analysis simulations to accurately define a system's performance characteristics. These tools will aid in defining the trade space for emerging technologies and assist in providing the program manager insight and guidance into pursuing future technologies. Finally, this technology thrust area also seeks to develop technologies to enhance combat vehicle crewman effectiveness and situational awareness through the incorporation of advanced autonomous vehicle functions.


The FY2016 to FY2017 increase in funding is due to a FY2016 Congressional reduction (-$1.293M).  The reduction in FY2016 requires re-phasing of the initiation of technology development programs to address expeditionary maneuver capability gaps.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>This activity supports S&amp;T investment in Command and Control and is focused in three main areas:  (1) Implementing the FORCEnet concept; (2) Developing decision support systems that enable warfighters to take advantage of the FORCEnet and MAGTF C2, and tactically extend Net-Enabled Command and Control (NECC) for shared situational awareness; and (3) Providing effective combat identification of enemy combatants, friendly forces, and non-combatants.  FORCEnet is the operational construct and architectural framework for naval warfare in the information age that integrates warriors, networks, command and control, and weapons into a networked, distributed, combat force that is scalable across all levels of conflict from the seabed to space, and from sea to land. The Marine Corps instantiation of FORCEnet is Marine Air Ground Task Force Command and Control (MAGTF C2), with technologies to exchange data and information with, and among, distributed tactical forces. Activities in this program area provide technologies for secure, robust, self-forming, mobile communications networks and distributed computing to support information dissemination to all echelons; and sensors, software and data processing to support formation of an appropriate common picture.  Marine Corps specific efforts include power management, low detectability, size and weight constraints, and interoperability within the joint environment.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKS</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop high throughput dynamic wireless communications and network technologies critical to the mission performance and robustness of naval communications for widely dispersed, mobile air, land, surface and submerged platforms.  These platforms are often size, weight and power (SWaP) limited, and will operate under constraints of cluttered RF spectrum, harsh electro-magnetic interference (EMI) and Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) conditions.  The technical payoff is increased network data rates, interoperability across heterogeneous radios, dynamic bandwidth management, and greater mobile network connectivity.  The operational payoff is that warfighters from the operational command to the tactical edge have near real-time access to information, knowledge and decision-making necessary to perform their tasks, including coalition and allied forces.  Emphasis is on tactical edge communications and networks to fully realize net-centric warfare, bridging the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the 'disadvantaged user', e.g., small-deck combatants, submarines, unmanned vehicles, distributed sensors and ground units in urban and radio frequency (RF) challenged environments.  

The current specific objectives are:
a) Radios and Apertures: Develop technologies for high band radio, electrically-small and actively scanned antennas, addressing critical issue of radio spectrum bandwidth efficiency, spectrum contention and clutter, agile frequency communications with dynamic spectrum access, all-digital front-end with wide dynamic range, power amplifier efficiency, multipath effects, saltwater propagation and BLOS communications. Develop algorithms and signal processing for space-time-frequency diversity communications, including measures for electronic protection, such as low-intercept, antijam waveforms and modulation.  Develop affordable antenna technologies for small size and weight, high radiation efficiency, and wideband operation with rapid beam-steering.  Develop alternatives to RF communications in airborne and terrestrial environments as well as high data rate underwater communications for undersea warfare (distributed sensor netting, unmanned underwater vehicle data exfiltration, submarine Communications at Speed and Depth) using electro-optic/infra-red (EO/IR) technologies.  Develop secure, high bandwidth communications systems and the exploitation of existing and emerging network protocols that will avail development of new, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) based data transport mechanisms.

b) Tactical Networking and Network Control/Management: 
Develop advanced networking techniques for robust, highly dynamic environments; interoperable networks for secure communications and protocols, bandwidth and network management techniques that manage and allocate bandwidth across tactical and theater levels in support of net-centric operations. Develop rapidly auto-configuring and self-organizing networks with efficient and survivable routing, secure authentication, mobility management and Quality-of-Service guarantee, while optimizing network resources.  Address low bandwidth, synchronization and reliability for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)/middleware architecture in both mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) and infrastructure-based Internet Protocol (IP) backbone networks. Develop cognitive network planning and operations engines whose criteria are based directly on mission objectives, while self-adapting and managing the spectrum allocation and radio resources in such a way that network operations, SOA community of interest, and computer network defense are integrated to form a single common tactical network picture that requires a minimum of human intervention and skill.  Develop technology for improving tactical edge networking and for improving voice communications.

                                <r2:Title>APPLIED INFORMATION SCIENCES FOR DECISION MAKING</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The goal of this activity is to develop enablers for decision making and mission execution, to achieve battlespace superiority.  It focuses on the development of algorithms and software technologies that identify and integrate informational content from multiple sources, leading to decision aids that support user-cognitive processes.  Because persistent sensors are generating massive amounts of data, the focus is on technologies that not only integrate information from diverse sources, but also provide indications of information significance in ways that support the user's decision needs, regardless of location and operational situation.  To achieve this, it must be possible to automate understanding of the battlespace by identifying objects, determining relationships among the objects, assessing intent, and automatically generating courses of action with associated risks and uncertainty.  Effort will also be devoted to developing technology for increasing assurance and security for C3 information systems and technology for improving information discovery and information presentation in such systems.  The Nano Electronics Technology activity is focused on developing ultra-low power, higher performance computing devices and components that are based on novel functionalities of nanometer scale materials and are enabled by improved understanding of nanomaterials, new devices and circuit design concepts, as well as new architectures uniquely suited for nanoscale systems.  

The current specific objectives are:

a) Data Understanding: Develop automated, image and signal intelligence understanding tools based on rigorous mathematical and statistical methods that lead to improved change detection, improve object and activity detection and recognition capabilities, context and scene understanding, and inferring of the threat levels to support decision making and persistent and adaptive surveillance.

b) Information Integration: Develop innovative methods for combining traditional and non-traditional data from sensors and disparate sources to provide the best estimate of objects, events, and conditions in the battlespace, in terms of their identity, associated error or uncertainty, context, impact, while inferring relationships and their intentions.

c) Data Analytics (Formerly titled: Mission Focused Autonomy (MFA)): Develop proactive situational awareness and rapid decision making applications and analytics with information PUSH as well as PULL, where joint human controlled and automated analytic processes can collaboratively work together to solve tactical and strategic problems within a multi-level, secure environment.  Areas addressed include the following elements: a) access to enterprise level structured and unstructured data repositories and automated search and discovery of evidence collected across these heterogeneous databases; b) analytics that automate the ability to infer the meaning of evidence that is discovered; c) structured process (hypothesis or argument) that provides context in order to constrain and guide the search and analytic techniques toward goals that are focused on proving the hypothesis right or wrong; d) knowledge repository that maintains pedigree and state of hypothesis satisfaction or refutation; e) Collaborative environment wherein all analytic participants can share the state of hypothesis satisfaction and collectively contribute evidence data to solve the common problem. Develop rigorous and efficient methods for building sophisticated situational models, and develop automated reasoning techniques to categorize and recognize situations under a variety of conditions leading to methods that predict situations under different settings including capabilities to address growing cyber-related threats.

d) Resource Optimization: Develop automated decision tools based on mathematically rigorous techniques (e.g., mathematical optimization) that support decision-making to ensure the best use of scarce and/or expensive resources, achieving optimal allocations for large complex scenarios, including ones that contain uncertainty, in drastically reduced amounts of time.  Develop methods that support decision making in networked sensor management and allocation to ensure sensor assets are deployed in an optimal, or near optimal, manner.

e) Cyber Defense (Formerly titled Trusted Systems &amp; Networks): Develop tools and methods to securely handle information without exposing intelligence information about the networks or systems to adversaries. 

f) Nanoscale Electronics: To develop novel nanometer scale (feature size near or below 10nm) logic/memory devices and related circuits and architectures to deliver ultra-low power, light weight and high performance computational capability for autonomous vehicles and individual warfighters. 

g) Quantum Information Sciences: Conduct research supporting the efficacy of a free space optical quantum key distribution that would operate in a maritime environment. Understand the implications of imperfect hardware implementations upon the vulnerability of the known protocols. Develop new protocols and encoding schemes that lead to robust performance with high throughput. Conduct research that leads to an understanding of, and develop methods that compensate for atmospheric effects. 

Funding increase from FY16 to FY17 is a result of increased research in Cyber Defense.

                                        <r2:Text>Robotics Platform Research:
This addresses development of autonomous robotic systems capability to interact with and service other platforms and
autonomous vehicles.

Micro-Robotic Servicing - advanced highly dexterous control of extremely lightweight and flexible robotic arms, with
specific application to EOD, surveillance and on-orbit servicing robotic communities. This research would extend ongoing
research in lightweight robotic arms.

Autonomous Refueling - development of hardware, algorithms, and sensors for hybrid rigid-compliant robotic arms in
rapidly changing environments, with specific application to autonomous refueling of USVs, UAVs and UGVs while
moving in their environments, advancing beyond the DARPA-sponsored "Rapid Autonomous Fuel Transfer Project".

Low Power Micro-robotics - development of onboard sensors, control electronics, and actuators requiring very low power,
with specific application to robotic missions over long durations.

Advanced Manipulators and Tool-Changers - development of innovative robotic manipulators, tool changers, and
associated sensors for challenging robotic manipulation tasks, with specific application to EOD and other robotic missions in difficult environments. This research would extend previous research by providing robust end effector technology and tool changing capability. The overall research outcomes will enhance DoD capability in the areas of explosive ordnance disposal, autonomous vehicle refueling, and innovative robotic arm control. Research deliverables will include hardware development in the areas of lightweight robotic arms, end effector tools and tool changers, and low power electronics and actuators.

Autonomous Vehicles:- This effort will draw from current research and push the technology development to the next level to provide a leap-ahead capability in long endurance, deployable, autonomous, robotic air vehicle using fuel cell electric propulsion systems for high efficiency, even in small vehicles, which can provide robust airborne sensor capabilities for submarines, UUVs, small naval platforms and small dismounted units.

Undersea Vehicles:
- Funding would be used to acquire a medium sized (12.5 inch diameter) Autonomous Underwater Vehicle as an at sea test
platform to advance the state of art of onboard intelligent autonomy. This medium sized UUV is readily amenable to vehicle and sensor testing in the wave pool in the Laboratory for Autonomous Systems Research facility. Subsequently, this would allow at sea testing of State of the art autonomy algorithms (e.g. goal driven autonomy, human cognitive models, Markov decision processes) that allow Navy underwater vehicles to carry out complex mission in denied areas by understanding the environment and adapting mission goals in the context of the commander's intent, with
little or no human operator intervention.

Autonomous Systems Integration:
- To support the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) (ASD(R&amp;E)) priorities in autonomous systems,
and specifically to advance the state of the art in heterogeneous teams of autonomous platforms, (including sensor networks and mobile communication nodes) that can work seamlessly with the warfighter, funding will be applied to small air platforms and militarily relevant unmanned ground vehicles to integrate sensors and advanced power sources, and to
develop the autonomy software that allows the individual platforms to work together, as well as to work at a peer-to-peer level with the warfighter. This includes advanced human-robot interaction techniques and information
processing and presentation techniques that reduce the warfighter's cognitive load and allows him to work with a team of
autonomous systems.</r2:Text>

It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE supports innovation-based efforts that will provide technology options for future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities.  Efforts focus on advanced Naval materials; biocentric technologies; environmental quality; human factors and organizational design; medical technologies; and Naval training technologies. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment maps to future transformational capabilities and the FORCEnet pillar of the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps vision for the future -- Naval Power 21. 

The ONRG International Science Program mission is to search the globe for emerging scientific research and advanced technologies to enable the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the NRE to address effectively the current needs of the Fleet/Forces, and investigate and assess revolutionary, high-payoff technologies for future Naval missions and capabilities. Within this Global mission, funding for the Naval Science Advisor Program ensures the Fleet/Force (F/F) helps shape the Department of the Navy (DoN) investment in Science and Technology (S&amp;T), develops teaming relationships to rapidly demonstrate and transition technology, supports development of technology-based capability options for naval forces, and enables warfighting innovations based on technical and conceptual possibilities. Science Advisors provide insight into issues associated with Naval Warfighting Capabilities that influence S&amp;T program decision making. The program develops leaders among civilian scientists and engineers in the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE). Upon completion of their tours, Science Advisors return to the NRE with first hand knowledge of the F/F, warfighting issues, and strategic decision making. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) Science Advisor program enables continuous communication and collaboration between the warfighters, the technical community, and strategic development commands. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>HUMAN FACTORS AND ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is the achievement of FORCEnet and Sea Power 21 goals by developing human factors principles and cognitive models for human centric design, decision support systems for collaborative decision making, and adaptive command and control structures. The CNO's new Maritime Strategy and the Commander Fleet Forces Command complementary plan to revise organization of Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) place high priority on the aforementioned FORCEnet and Sea Power 21 goals. Specific objectives focus on improving small team, platform, task force, and battle group operations by developing advanced human factors technologies for incorporation into operational systems. The goals and payoffs are to enhance human performance effectiveness; improve the timeliness and quality of decision making; develop strategies to mitigate high workload and ambiguity; reduce manning; improve situational awareness and speed of command through a deeper understanding of human capabilities and limitations; and improvement of team decision making in ad-hoc, complex problem solving scenarios. The current specific objectives are:

a) Human Computer Interaction/Visualization: Develop an understanding of the limitations of human perceptual and attentional systems in relation to maximizing user performance when interacting with complex Naval displays. A combination of computational cognitive modeling and psychological studies are employed to determine the capacity limitations on human performance that will undoubtedly have impact in reduced manning requirements, including information-rich weapons platforms. Develop technology for improving human interaction with autonomous systems and for improving virtual reality systems for training purposes.

b) Command Decision Making (CDM): This sub-project consolidates the previous Collaboration and Knowledge Interoperability (CKI) and Organizational Design and Decision Support Systems sub-projects. The CDM subproject is focused at the development of dynamic decision support systems that use automation and expert systems technology to recognize and respond to changing mission and task demands, and will therefor dynamically adapt to present appropriate information, dynamically based on planned and emergent mission requirements. This focus is explicitly intended to deliver decision support that will be more timely and responsive to rapidly evolving operational information needs. Current thrusts within the sub-project are to: 1) Conduct research on the application of cognitive theory to exploit relevant information for effective decision making; 2) Develop models that are operationally context and task sensitive, serving as the basis for a science of context driven decision making; 3) Study and apply research for the effective management of highly complex &amp; time critical decision making; 4) Develop and demonstrate decision support tools that address the timely management of risk and uncertainty in Navy Command and Control.

c) Social Network Analysis:  Develop computational models, algorithms and technologies for the analysis of conflict and crisis environments and the development of strategies against novel threats, such as terrorism, information warfare, and deception operations.  Develop computational approaches to handling very large, social and socio-cultural information and datasets. Develop computational social science approaches to the study of factionalism in social movements and the novel approaches to crowd calming and peacebuilding for civil affairs operations and disaster response. The following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>This program supports the development of field medical equipment, diagnostic capabilities and treatments; technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions; and systems to prevent occupational injury and disease in hazardous, deployment environments; including regenerative medicine technologies and therapeutic/restorative practices for the treatment of combat-related traumatic injuries. Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. For example, civilian emergency medicine does not address casualty stabilization during long transit times to definitive care. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) focuses on the basic science of disease processes and not applied research related to development. Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee, and Joint Technical Coordinating Group (JTCG) process, to prevent duplication of effort.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan, approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 January 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

The Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research Program addresses technology needs associated with Naval platforms for new capabilities in EO/IR Sensors, Surveillance, Electronic Warfare, Navigation, Solid State Electronics, Vacuum Electronics Power Amplifiers, and Nanoelectronics. The program supports development of technologies to enable capabilities in Missile Defense, Directed Energy, Platform Protection, Time Critical Strike, and Information Distribution. This program directly supports the Department of Defense Joint Warfighter Plan and the Defense Technology Area Plans. Activities and efforts within this Program have attributes that focus on enhancing the affordability of warfighting systems. The program also provides for technology efforts to maintain proactive connectivity and collaboration between Department of the Navy (DON) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and Joint, Navy, and Marine Corps commands worldwide.  

Also included in this PE is the Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signatures against Integrated Sensors (NEMESIS) Innovative Naval Prototype (INP).  NEMESIS technology addresses the need to generate the appearance of a realistic naval force to multiple adversarial surveillance and targeting sensors simultaneously. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>ELECTRONIC WARFARE TECHNOLOGY</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop technologies that enable the development of affordable, effective and robust Electronic Warfare (EW) systems across the entire electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) that will increase the operational effectiveness and survivability of U.S. Naval units.  Emphasis is placed on passive sensors and active and passive countermeasure (CM) systems that exploit and counter a broad range of electromagnetic threats.  The focus is on maintaining near perfect, real-time knowledge of the enemy; countering the threat of missiles against deployed Naval forces; precision identification and location of threat emitters; and development of technologies that have broad application across multiple disciplines within the EW mission area.  This activity also includes developments to protect these technologies from external interference, and modeling and simulation required to support the development of these technologies.  Also included is technology development in support of the Integrated Distributed Electronic Warfare System (IDEWS) concept.  

The objectives reported in prior years under this R-2 Activity have been consolidated into the current objectives described below.

The current objectives are:

- EW RF Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies in the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum (covering frequencies from kilohertz to terahertz) that include developments in detection, signal processing and passive/active techniques for wideband Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Protection (EP) and the Electronic Support (ES) mission areas. 

- EW EO/IR Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies in the Electro-Optic and Infrared (EO/IR) spectral domain (extending from the ultraviolet to the far infrared spectral bands) that include advances in multispectral sensors, multiband sources, beam forming/steering, and signal processing and transmission. 

- EW Integrated and Networked Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies that will enable an increased situational awareness and response across the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) with broad spatial coverage using all available EW assets to provide coordinated, adaptive and networked EW sensing, protection and attack.

- Advanced EW Enabling Technologies (Formerly Titled: Electronic Warfare (EW) Roadmap): Develop classified advanced electronic warfare technology in support of current and predicted capability requirements.

- Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command &amp; Control (EMC2) (FY16-FY20): Enable a battle group to work cooperatively in the EM Spectrum (EMS) to optimize Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO), Communications (Comms) and Radar performance.  EMC2 will build upon the Resource Allocation Manager (RAM) that was previously developed for single multifunction systems under the InTop program to optimize spectrum and functional use across a platform and an entire battle group.

Increase in funding from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to added new INP Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command &amp; Control. (EMC2)

                                <r2:Title>SOLID STATE ELECTRONICS</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop higher performance components and subsystems for all classes of military RF systems that are based on solid state physics phenomena and are enabled by improved understanding of these phenomena, new circuit design concepts and devices, and improvements in the properties of electronic materials.  An important subclass are the very high frequency (VHF), ultra-high frequency (UHF), microwave (MW), and millimeter wave (MMW) power amplifiers for Navy all-weather radar, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic attack, communications, and smart weapon systems.  Another subclass are the analog and high speed, mixed signal components that connect the electromagnetic signal environment into and out of digitally realized, specific function systems.  These improved components are based on both silicon (Si) and compound semiconductors (especially the wide bandgap materials and narrow bandgap materials), low and high temperature superconductors, novel nanometer scale structures and materials.  Components addressed by this activity emphasize the MMW and submillimeter wave (SMMW) regions with an increasing emphasis on devices capable of operating in the range from 50 gigahertz (GHz) to 10 terahertz (THz).  The functionality of the technology developed cannot be obtained through Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, linearity, operational and instantaneous bandwidth, weight, and size.  Effort will involve understanding the properties of engineered semiconductors as they apply to quantum information science and technology. 

This activity also includes Anti-Tamper development of innovative techniques and technologies to deter the reverse engineering and exploitation of our military's critical technology and critical program information in order to impede technology transfer and alteration of system capability and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems. The current specific objectives are:

d) Control, Reception, Transmission, and Processing of Signals: Develop electronics and photonics technology that provides for the control, reception, transmission and processing of signals.

e) Novel Nanometer Scale Logic/Memory Devices and Related Circuits and Architectures: Develop novel nanometer scale (feature size at or below 10nm) logic/memory devices and related circuits and architectures to deliver ultra-low power, light weight and high performance computational capability for autonomous vehicles and individual warfighters.

                                <r2:Title>VACUUM ELECTRONICS POWER AMPLIFIERS</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop millimeter wave (MMW) and sub-MMW power amplifiers for use in Naval all-weather radar, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic attack, and communications systems.  The technology developed cannot, for the most part, be obtained through commercial off the shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, bandwidth, weight, and size.  Responding to strong interests from the various user communities, efforts are focused on the development of technologies for high-data-rate communications, electronic warfare and high-power radar applications at MMW and upper-MMW regime.  The emphasis is placed on achieving high power at high frequency in a compact form factor.  Technologies include utilization of spatially distributed electron beams in amplifiers, such as sheet electron beams and multiple-beams, and creation of simulation based design methodologies based on physics-based and geometry driven design codes.

The current specific objectives are:

a) High Power Millimeter and Upper Millimeter Wave Amplifiers: Develop science and technology for high power millimeter and upper millimeter wave amplifiers including high current density diamond cathodes, sheet and multiple electron beam formation and mode suppression techniques in overmoded structures.

b) Lithographic Fabrication Techniques: Develop lithographic fabrication techniques for upper-millimeter wave amplifiers.

c) Accurate and Computationally Effective Device-Specific Multi-Dimensional Models for Electron Beams: Develop accurate and computationally effective device-specific multi-dimensional models for electron beam generation, large-signal and stability analysis to simulate device performance and improve the device characteristics.

Funding decrease from FY16 to FY17 is a result of the completion of amplifier activities.

a) Develop reconfigurable and modular EW payloads, Distributed Decoy and Jammer Swarms (DDJS), effective multi-spectral countermeasures (CM), and Multiple Input/Multiple Output Sensor/CM (MIMO S/CM) for platform protection across operational domains.

The increase from FY16 to FY17 in the Nemesis program is due to hardware procurement and conducting field experiments of Nemesis technologies.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE provides the unique, fundamental programmatic instrument by which basic research on the natural environment is transformed into technological developments that provide new or enhanced warfare capabilities for the Battlespace Environment (BSE).  The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and applying environmental factors affecting naval material and operations in the BSE.  This program provides for BSE technological developments that contribute to meeting top joint warfare capabilities established by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with primary emphasis on Joint Littoral Warfare and Joint Strike Warfare. 

This PE fully supports the Director of Defense Research and Engineering's Science and Technology Strategy and is coordinated with other DoD Components through the Defense Science and Technology Reliance process.  Work in this program is related to and fully coordinated with efforts in accordance with the on-going Reliance joint planning process.  There is close coordination with the US Air Force and US Army under the Reliance program in the BSE categories of Lower Atmosphere, Ocean Environments, Space &amp; Upper Atmosphere, and Terrestrial Environments.  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, the investment will contribute toward achieving each of the "key transformational capabilities" required by Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing.  Moreover, environmental information, environmental models, and environmental tactical decision aids that emerge from this investment will form one of the essential components of FORCEnet (which is the architecture for a highly adaptive, human-centric, comprehensive maritime system that operates from seabed to space).  The Navy program includes efforts that focus on, or have attributes that enhance, the affordability of warfighting systems.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides technologies that form the natural environment technical base on which all systems development and advanced technology depend.  Furthermore, this technical base provides developments that may be utilized in the Future Naval Capabilities programs: Organic Mine Countermeasures (MCM) and Autonomous Operations. This project contains the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) (Title II, subtitle E, of Public Law 104-201) and efforts aimed
at understanding and predicting the impacts of underwater sound on marine mammals.

Major efforts of this project are devoted to: gaining real-time knowledge of the BSE, determining the natural environment needs of regional warfare, providing the on-scene commander with the capability to exploit the environment to tactical advantage and, developing atmospheric research related to detection of sea-skimming missiles and strike warfare. This project provides natural environment applied research for all fleet operations and for current or emerging systems. Major developments are routinely transitioned to the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center and to the Naval Oceanographic Office where they are used to provide timely information about the natural environment for all fleet operations.

Joint Littoral Warfare efforts address issues in undersea, surface, and air battlespace. Efforts include ocean and atmospheric analysis and prediction for real-time description of the operational environment, shallow water acoustics, multiple-influence sensors for undersea surveillance and weapon systems, and influences of the natural environment on MCM and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) systems. Joint Strike Warfare efforts address issues in air battlespace dominance. Efforts include influences of the natural environment on air operations, electromagnetic (EM)/electro-optic (EO) systems used in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, bomb damage assessment, and detection of missile weapon systems. They also include improvements in tactical information management about the BSE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The marine atmosphere affects most aspects of naval operations. This activity develops observing technologies, models, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems and Tactical Decision Aids (TDA) that describe the atmospheric environment and its impacts on naval sensors and operations. This activity focuses on uniquely marine aspects of atmospheric science such as air-sea interaction, coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling, EM and EO propagation, coastal meteorology, Tropical Cyclone (TC) prediction, and the use of remote sensing to obtain quantitative observations of atmospheric properties. Aspects of the atmospheric environment of particular interest include near-surface phenomena that affect refractivity, marine boundary layer dynamics that affect clouds, rain, visibility and fog, and processes that control TC structure, track, and intensity. Objectives of this activity are improved NWP systems and TDAs that provide NOWCAST and forecast skill at global, regional, and tactical scales for operational support, sensor and system development, and performance prediction.

                                <r2:Description>This activity is dedicated to the determination of the impact of the natural ocean environment on acoustic wave phenomena in support of naval undersea warfare and underwater force protection operations. This activity studies underwater acoustic propagation, scattering from ocean boundaries, and ambient noise issues that impact the development and employment of acoustic systems. The Littoral Zone (LZ) has been the ocean environment of greatest interest. Aspects of this environment, that greatly impact underwater acoustic systems, are the shallow water included in the Littoral Zone, the consequent closeness and physical significance of the ocean bottom, and the complexities inherent to rapid changes of the ocean structure. The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and exploiting ocean acoustic factors to gain advantage over potential adversaries using undersea acoustic systems. Results of this activity support acoustic sensor and system development, performance prediction, and tactical decision aids.

Funding decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the completion of efforts associated with acoustic performance predictions.</r2:Description>

This is achieved through the development of predictive models of the water mass structure, waves, currents, and air-sea interactions and developing measurement/observation technology. Other applications utilize knowledge of the interaction of the water column hydrodynamics and the acoustics to predict the undersea transmission characteristics and sources of uncertainty in these statistics. Utilizing knowledge of the ocean surface physics, the physical oceanography program seeks to exploit the combination of remotely sensed data, in-situ data, and adaptively sampled data to optimize predictions of ocean currents and water column structure. These predictions, custom databases, adaptive sampling schemes and data programs serve ASW, Naval Special Warfare (NSW), Sea-Basing, and mine warfare needs.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DOD Non-Lethal Weapons Program was established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, which designated the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) as the DoD NLW Executive Agent (EA). The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP).  The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.

The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&amp;T) investment decisions provided by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that provides executive oversight and management for the JNLWP for the CMC. This direction is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document. This coordinated joint S&amp;T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies, capabilities and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&amp;T investment.  These applied research initiatives feed non-lethal capabilities which directly support the three pillars of the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review and comprise a fundamental part of DoD's security cooperation efforts to build partner capacity.  The resulting capabilities will facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for short-of-lethal scenarios.  

This program funds the applied research, study, assessment, and demonstration of technologies that could provide a non-lethal capability or target effect. Investment areas include applied research related to: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal acoustic and optical technologies; advanced non-lethal materials (including materials for vehicle/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications); associated human effects and effectiveness for new non-lethal stimuli; injury potential and effectiveness of directed energy, electric stun, ocular, and acoustic based non-lethal technologies; and developing models of crowd behavior and dynamics. This program transitioned from PE 0602114N, Power Projection Applied Research, by order of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, to this separate PE for Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Applied Research. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE funds applied research efforts in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking, and neutralization.  Technologies being developed within this PE are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking, and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  Related efforts are aimed at leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship, and air ASW assets. Research focused on understanding the impacts on marine mammals of manmade underwater sound is also conducted in the Program Element.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE (ASW) DISTRIBUTED SEARCH</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>ASW Distributed Search focuses on the development of technologies for the non-covert tactical search for undersea targets ranging from hours to weeks, using automated sensor systems deployed around operating areas, including along key transit routes to protect naval/maritime forces, around temporarily fixed sea base regions and naval force operating areas, or around fixed defensive regions and areas of interest, such as key US/Allied ports. "Non-covert" implies availability of airborne assets for sensor deployment (although other means may also be used), and the ability to employ active sonar along with passive and non-acoustic methods. "Search" is conducted in concentrated areas, typically exploiting cues received from surveillance systems. The submarine target must be detected beyond its weapons release range. The objective is to develop rapidly deployable systems employing automated detection and classification capabilities for use in both shallow and deep water operating environments. Distributed Search supports the ASW protected passage Maritime Shield operational constructs. Related efforts include the development of distributed systems employing optimization as well as active acoustic sensing and processing techniques, navy-unique transduction and underwater networking technology. Efforts also include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing persistent detection concepts and components. These efforts provide an extended reach of organic platform-based systems through the use of new sensor concepts, improved materials for advanced sensors, optimized deployment, employment, and automated operation of distributed sensor fields. The cornerstone of Distributed Search is the development of rapidly deployable, long-endurance active sensors with automated processing suitable for use in a wide variety of operational environments. 

Funding increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to 3 new programs funded in this PE: The Virtual Acoustic Sensing Array (VASA),  Forward Deployed Energy &amp; Communications Outpost (FDECO) (FY16-FY19) INP, and the Anti Submarine Warfare Mission Packages (ASW MP) (FY16-FY20).  

Funding increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the increase in the number of objective experiments and the demonstration at the end of FY17 for the FDECO program and the associated integration events associated with the FDECO program.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Precision Localization focuses on the development and demonstration of technologies which use information from surveillance or search systems to determine an area of uncertainty (AOU) relative to target range, bearing, and depth adequate to handoff to an attack system. Precision Localization employs non-acoustic techniques such as magnetic and optical sensing to highly localize submerged threats. The objective is to increase magnetic sensor range and robustness, enable deployment on Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), and increase optical sensing search rates. Efforts include the development of non-traditional tracking and advanced magnetic and electric field sensors and processing. These technologies will provide a decreased AOU size thus enabling the effective use of smaller, more versatile torpedoes as well as increased performance gain in detection, targeting, tracking/trailing, and homing via target acquisition and covert prosecution.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE (ASW) SURVEILLANCE</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>ASW Surveillance focuses on dramatically improving detection, classification, and localization capabilities in large ocean areas relative to the capabilities of legacy ASW surveillance systems. The related technologies support the conduct of covert, wide-area surveillance ranging from one day to six months. The objectives are to develop and demonstrate technologies that provide clandestine indications and warnings in far forward and contested operating areas, and in complex operational environments against all submarine threats, including new threats with unknown target signatures and tactics. Covertness implies use of non-observable platforms and/or deployed automated sensors employing passive sonar, or other non-detectable methods. The surveillance process includes initial detection and classification. Efforts include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable, off-board deployable sensing systems employing a wide variety of surveillance concepts and components. These efforts focus on alternative detection phenomena, vector/tensor sensors, automated acoustic processing, more compact and longer lasting power sources, and high bandwidth, acoustic communications links.

FY 2015 to FY 2016 increase is due to the development of technology for the integration of large UUVs on Navy platforms.
The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 due to the completion of a portion of the INP-Large Displacement Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (LDUUV) effort to development an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)-deployable bottom surveillance array networked by low complexity acoustic modems.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Undersea Weaponry focuses on the development of enabling technologies to counter threat submarines and surface vessels by increasing Probability of Kill and platform survivability. Weapon technology focus areas include: Explosives and Warheads, Guidance and Control (G&amp;C), Simulation Based Design, Propulsion, Power Sources, Supercavitation, and Counter Weapons/Counter Measures. The ultimate goal of this activity is to provide revolutionary capabilities needed to fill Sea Shield and Sea Strike Warfighter Capability Gaps, to accommodate unique payload limitations through the development of modular and reduced sized undersea weapons based on common technology enablers (where possible), to provide improved platform pre-engagement positioning and fire-control solutions for effective weapon-to-target engagement, and provide countermeasures and counterweapons against current and next-generation undersea weapons.</r2:Description>

The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the Navy Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&amp;T Gaps that are identified by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders. The Enabling Capabilities (ECs) and associated technology product investments of the FNC Program are competitively selected by a 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG), chartered by the S&amp;T Corporate Board and representing the requirements, acquisition, research and fleet/forces communities of the Navy and the Marine Corps.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>FNC investments are typically 3-5 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 to a TRL of 6.  All FNC products require BA2 and BA3 funded technology development, which is coordinated to ensure tangible technology products are delivered upon completion of each investment.  Each year the TOG refreshes the FNC Program by approving new ECs and technology products as older ones get delivered.  After transition to an acquisition program, FNC products are further engineered, integrated and, ultimately, delivered to the warfighter. The development and delivery of each FNC product is guided by a Technology Transition Agreement (TTA) that is signed by the requirements and acquisition sponsors, as well as the S&amp;T developer.

This project supports the naval pillars of Capable Manpower, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Force Health Protection, Forcenet, Power and Energy, Sea Basing, Sea Shield and Sea Strike.  Each of these pillars is listed as a separate R-2 Activity, as is FNC Management.  Under each R-2 Activity, the BA 6.2 accomplishments and plans for every Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product in the FNC Program are listed.  ECs are composed of one or more interrelated technology products, so for clarity, each product is shown under its EC.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE provides technologies for Naval Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare, U.S. Naval sea mining, Naval Special Warfare (NSW), and Joint Tri-Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). This program is strongly aligned with the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives through the development of technologies to achieve military objectives with minimal casualties and collateral damage. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three "key transformational capabilities" required by "Sea Shield" as well as technically enable the Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within "Sea Strike" by focusing on technologies that will provide the Naval Force with the capability to dominate the battlespace, project power from the sea, and support forces ashore with particular emphasis on rapid MCM operations. These efforts concentrate on the development and transition of technologies for the MCM-related and Urban Asymmetric/Expeditionary Warfare Operations (UAEO)-related Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (ECs). The Mine and Obstacle Detection/Neutralization efforts include technologies for clandestine and overt minefield reconnaissance, organic ship self-protection, organic minehunting and neutralization/breaching.

                                <r2:Description>This activity focuses on applied research to enable longer detection ranges and precise mine location with fewer false alarms in a variety of challenging environments. It supports Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) and MCM-related FNC ECs. Efforts in Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) technologies for longer range detection and classification of mine-like targets and magnetic gradiometer sensing and electro-optic (EO) technology for buried mine identification, and sensor integration onto Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are being addressed. EO sensor research develops algorithms to enable image processing for rapid overt reconnaissance from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Other processing, classification and data fusion techniques to reduce operator workload, and a mine burial prediction "expert system" are also being developed. Efforts also support development of MCM Mission Modules for Littoral Combat Ships (LCS).

Funding increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 will support improvements for the Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS).

Funding decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the completion of the Airborne Laser Mine Detection Systems Improvement effort that was part of the Speed to Fleet Initiatives that was a 2 year effort that started in FY 2015.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of this effort is to develop technologies to extend stand-off of special operations and EOD forces in clandestine hydrography, mine clearance and port security missions while increasing the range and effectiveness of divers. Advanced technologies are needed to gain access to areas contaminated by area-denial sensors and/or booby traps. Developed technologies will transition to the Joint Service EOD Program, the Naval EOD Program, or the DOD Technical Response Group. This activity includes applied research in sensor technology for NSW and EOD autonomous and handheld sonar systems to increase detection range and accuracy in harsh environments. Other efforts include mission support technology improvements for AUVs and human divers - such as communications, navigation and life support.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015). This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. 

This PE addresses advanced technology development associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy. This program supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial and air) and the protection of those platforms. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 January 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. 

Activities and efforts in this Program Element (PE) address technologies critical to enabling the transformation of discrete functions to network centric warfare capabilities, which simultaneously perform Radar, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Communications and Network functions across platforms through multiple, simultaneous and continuous communications/data links.  The Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology program addresses Radio Frequency (RF) technology for Surface and Aerospace Surveillance sensors and systems, EW sensors and systems, RF Communication Systems, Multi-Function sensor systems, and Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment offers affordable options for the transformational capabilities required by the Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense), Sea Strike (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance), and ForceNet (Communications and Networking) SeaPower 21 Naval Warfighting Pillars. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This activity also includes development of affordable wideband, high performance Advanced Multifunction Radio Frequency (AMRF) apertures.  A portion of this PE is devoted to mid-term technology development in close concert with acquisition programs of record.  The products of these efforts are expected to transition at the end of their schedule into the associated acquisition program of record.

a) Advanced EW Enabling Technologies (Formerly Titled: Electronic Warfare (EW) Roadmap) - Develop classified advanced electronic warfare technology in support of current and predicted capability requirements. 

b) Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command &amp; Control (EMC2) (FY16-FY20)- Enable a battle group to work cooperatively in the EM Spectrum (EMS) to optimize Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO), Communications (Comms) and Radar performance.  EMC2 will build upon the Resource Allocation Manager (RAM) that was previously developed for single multifunction systems under the InTop program to optimize spectrum and functional use across a platform and an entire battle group.

The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the initiation of a new INP Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command &amp; Control (EMC2) Project.

The increase from FY16 to FY17 reflects an increase in the level of effort for the new Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command &amp; Control (EMC2) INP Program.

                                <r2:Description>The overarching objective of the INTOP INP is to develop and demonstrate a set of prototypes that integrate RF functionality (EW, Radar, Communications, Navigation) into a common set of multi-function apertures electronics and software through an architecture that is modular, scalable across all platforms, and open at the RF as well as computer and software level.  The apertures are capable of providing multiple simultaneous, independent beams which can together perform any of the above functions.

The major objectives of this activity are:

a) Submarine SATCOM Array - Develop wide-band SATCOM array capable of supporting EW for submarines.

b) Electronic Warfare (EW)/Information Operations (IO)/Line of Sight (LOS) Communications (Comms) for Surface Combatants - Develop wide-band array to support EW capability and other functions, including but not limited to IO and LOS Comms, for surface combatants with potential application to other platforms.

c) Architecture, Standards and Devices - Develop architecture and standards for wide-band multi-beam, multi-band arrays and below deck systems and the technology and electronic devices needed to make integrated array systems affordable.

d) Surface Combatant Communication Array - Develop wide-band surface combatant communication array capable of supporting other RF functions.

e) Resource Allocation Manager - Develop enterprise common Resource Allocation Manager.

f) Digital Radar - Develop an all digital radar to demonstrate advanced concepts for coherent radar networking and control, which will increase radar coverage and provide new levels of electronic protection (EP), while maximizing radar resources and reducing cost.

g) Low Band Communications, IO and EW - Develop low band technology development and concept studies leading to development of an Advanced Development Model (ADM).

The decrease between FY 2015 and FY 2016 is representative of the InTop program coming to an end. The funding provided in FY 2016 is to complete all efforts under the InTop program originally scheduled to be completed in FY 2015.

                                <r2:Title>NETTED EMULATION OF MULTI-ELEMENT SIGNATURES AGAINST INTEGRATED SENSORS (NEMESIS)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The objective is to develop a System of Systems (SoS) able to coordinate distribute EW resources against many adversary surveillance and targeting sensors simultaneously. It will benefit the warfighter by providing platform protection across the battlespace against many sensors, creating seamless cross-domain countermeasure coordination, and enabling rapid advanced technology/capability insertion to counter emerging threats. 

a) Develop reconfigurable and modular EW payloads, Distributed Decoy and Jammer Swarms (DDJS), effective multi-spectral countermeasures (CM), and Multiple Input/Multiple Output Sensor/CM (MIMO S/CM) for platform protection across operational domains.

This R2 activity was initiated in PE 0602271N and expanded in FY 2015 to PE 0603271N.

The decrease from FY16 to FY17 reflects the transition toward the integration and demonstration of the new technologies.  The first 3 years FY14-FY16 are dedicated toward the design, development and procurement of new technologies.  Years FY17 and FY18 are dedicated toward the integration and demonstration of these new technologies.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 January 2015). This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps)to include specific Marine Corps objectives defined by the USMC S&amp;T Strategic Plan. It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential S&amp;T efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of United States Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. It also directly supports Expeditionary Force 21 (EF 21), which is now the Marine Corps' capstone concept that establishes  the vision and goals for USMC S&amp;T over the next 10 years and provides a plan for guiding the design and development of the future force.  One third of the Marine Corps operating forces will be forward  deployed.  These forces will be task-organized into a greater variety of formations, capable of operating from a more diverse array of ships dispersed over wider areas, in order to meet the Combatant Commanders' security cooperation and partner engagement requirements.  In the event of crises, those forces will be able to composite these distributed formations into larger, cohesive naval formations.  This presents both challenges and opportunities for USMC S&amp;T. Expeditionary Force 21 will inform future decisions regarding how the Marine Corps will adjust organizational structure to exploit the value of regionally focused forces.  A fixed geographic orientation will facilitate Marine Commanders and their staffs with more frequent interactions with theater- and component-level organizations, establishing professional bonds and a shared sense of the area's challenges and opportunities.  Expeditionary Force 21 provides the basis for future Navy and Marine Corps capability development to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.  The vision for Expeditionary Force 21 is to provide guidance for how the Marine Corps will be postured, organized, trained, and equipped to fulfill the responsibilities and missions required around the world.  Through Expeditionary Force 21, the Marine Corps intends to operate from the sea and provide the right sized force in the right place, at the right time.

As a key component of naval expeditionary forces, the Marine Corps has unique and technologically stressing requirements because of its expeditionary mission and intensive operational tempo, Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) structure, and conduct of maneuver warfare. Critical requirements in this PE are: Command, Control, Communications, Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); maneuver techniques and means; force protection; logistic sustainment; human performance, training and education; and firepower. There are ongoing actions to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and concepts in operational environments. Joint service efforts are aligned with Defense Technology Objectives and Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives. In addition, there is funding for experimentation in warfighting concepts as well as operational assessment of emerging technologies, to include technical support of operating forces to assess military utility of selected technologies. This PE specifically supports: continued development of enhanced warfighting capabilities through field experiments with Marine operating forces; rapid response to low-, mid-, and high-intensity conflicts as well as methods for countering irregular threats; and expansion of seabasing and naval force packaging capabilities. The investment directly assists in fulfilling the forward presence requirements of Sea Shield and the transformational capabilities prescribed by Sea Strike. The Future Naval Capability (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly. This PE is largely focused on demonstration of products and capabilities from the knowledge base and Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) phases of Naval S&amp;T. As Naval partners, the Navy and Marine Corps S&amp;T Team strive to transition technologies that will implement objectives outlined in the Naval Operations Concept. This PE also funds technical solutions designed to increase Naval force capability, such as the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command. Investments in S&amp;T provide the opportunities for future capabilities and will prevent technological surprise. The PE as a whole will advance the amphibious and expeditionary capabilities for the Combatant Commanders. The Marine Corps Service Campaign Plan (MCSCP, guided by the Commandant's Planning Guidance, is the lens through which USMC S&amp;T priorities are acted upon in order to support the future development of the Total Force.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Critical Marine Corps requirements/imperatives addressed in this Project are: Maneuver; Force Protection; Human Performance, Training and Education; Logistics; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Firepower.   These are ongoing efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts in an operational environment.  Multiple transitions into the Sub-system/Component Advanced Development Phase are planned, as well as fieldable prototyped to reduce risk in System Concept Development and Demonstration.  A tactically effective Mine Countermeasures (MCM) capability is vital to Force Protection and necessary if Maneuver on land is to become a functional component of Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  Maneuver, supported by MCM provides synchronization and speed of detection, breaching, clearance, proofing, and marking operations.  This project supports: 1) engaging regional forces in decisive combat on a global basis; 2) responding to all other contingencies and missions in the full spectrum of combat operations (high, middle, and low intensity), in Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), and in Operations other than War (OOTW); and 3)  warfighting experimentation.  By providing the technologies to enable these capabilities, this project supports the goals and objectives of the Strike, Littoral Warfare and Surveillance Joint Mission Areas.  These are ongoing efforts to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts in an operational environment. 

In addition, this project supports the goals and objectives of the Littoral Combat/Power Projection related Enabling Capability (EC) within the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) portfolio.  The focus of the EC within this PE is technology related to Urban, Asymmetric, and Expeditionary Operations (UAEO).  The UAEO Capability Gap is a science and technology developmental area that is of the highest importance to Marine Corps operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and is one of the highest ranked Capability Gaps prioritized by the Chief of Naval Operations and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC).  The UAEO technology gap is being pursued as part of an overall effort that addresses the Sea Strike Capability Gap.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This activity addresses the advanced technology development associated with associated with the Marine Corps participation in the Department of the Navy's (DoN) Science and Technology Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the DoN Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&amp;T Gaps that are generated by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders.  The funding is aligned with the Naval challenges associated with projecting power despite anti-access and area denial, specifically the Sea Shield, Power and Energy, FORCEnet, and the Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare warfighting capability gaps. The funding profile reflects the alignment of the FNC program investments into Enabling Capabilities (ECs); ECs respond to priority Naval warfighting capability gaps.  Funding for each EC is aligned to a 6.2 or 6.3 Budget Activity (BA) as appropriate.

The FY2016 to FY2017 increase in the Littoral Combat/Power Projection activity is due to a FY2016 Congressional reduction and will realign the activity to its original programming levels in FY2017.  Accordingly, the Future Naval Capabilities within the activity will be re-phased and amended appropriately to accommodate the delta.</r2:Description>

Expeditionary Logistics replaces mass with assured knowledge and speed, is equally capable ashore or afloat in austere environments, and is fully scalable to meet uncertain requirements.  Expeditionary Logistics logically divides into four pillars:  efficient and responsive force sustainment, planning and directing logistics operations, logistics demand reduction, and fleet maintenance.  These pillars are thoroughly integrated and perpetually related in execution.


The FY 2015 to FY 2016 increase in the Logistics Thrust Activity is due to the initiation of the intelligent microgrid systems effort in support of Expeditionary Force-21.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As a subordinate organization under the Deputy Commandant, Combat Development and Integration (DC, CD&amp;I), the mission of the Futures Directorate (FD) is to identify plausible future security environments and develop and explore warfighting concepts and Concepts of Operations (CONOPS).  It does this in order to identify potential future capability gaps and opportunities in order to inform future force development.  DC, CD&amp;I is designated as the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Advocate for Science and Technology (S&amp;T).  As Director FD, the Commanding General (CG) of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) is the DC, CD&amp;I designated Proponent of USMC S&amp;T and serves as the USMC Executive Agent for Marine Corps S&amp;T.  The FD also serves as the Marine Corps' liaison to the Joint Staff for Joint Concept Development and Experimentation; thereby facilitating service-specific experiments as well as participation in joint service experimentation.  

The current Futures Directorate Campaign Plan (FDCP) addresses how the Naval Services must reshape their capabilities in order to meet the concepts and CONOPS called for in the Secretary of the Navy's "Cooperative Strategy 21" and the Marine Corps' capstone "Expeditionary Force 21 (EF21)" concept.  Execution of the FDCP results in recommendations to Marine Corps advocates and proponents so that they may more cohesively and logically structure the future Navy and Marine Corps team.  In support of the Marine Corps' role to provide an ever-ready quick strike force to protect US interests, FDCP pursues concepts and new capabilities focused on the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  The MAGTF is the Marine Corps' doctrinal, task organized, force deployment package.  It consists of four elements:  the Command Element that provides overarching command and control (C2) of the entire force; the Ground Combat Element normally built around a core infantry unit with supporting armor, artillery, and other ground units; the Aviation Combat Element which provides aircraft, air defense, and other aviation functions; and the Logistics Combat Element which consists of combat service support (CSS) elements including medical, supply, and transportation.  FDCP also examines future enhancements in training, organization, and equipment.  FD accomplishes its mission through five subordinate Divisions:  

Futures Assessment Division's (FAD's) mission is to:  research, examine, and describe plausible future security environments 15 to 30 years into the future.  Knowledge of these future security environments will provide an estimate of possible future threats, challenges, and opportunities, to include:  the rise of possible partners and adversaries, emerging disruptive technologies, and likely sources of conflict.  This work is largely accomplished through research, seminar participation, and coordination with various experts in academia, the intelligence community, and think tanks. 

Emergent Force Development's (EFD's) mission is to:  explore select future security environments, emerging warfighting opportunities and challenges in order to guide development of Marine Corps Service concepts and CONOPS.  EFD is responsible for the production of formally published concepts, CONOPS, and options for future force organization and posture that describe how the Marine Corps will operate and fight.

Three Divisions fall under CG, MCWL to conduct concept-based experimentation.  MCWL's mission is to:  explore and analyze Marine Corps service concepts using an integrated combination of research; modeling and simulation (M&amp;S); wargaming; live force experimentation; S&amp;T discovery, assessment, and integration; and analysis in order to better understand how these concepts expose gaps and create opportunities for future force development. 

Wargaming Division conducts formal wargames to frame emerging warfighting concepts, establish the Joint context for the Marine Corps Force Development System, and establish priorities for development of experimental and non-experimental capabilities. 

Experiment Division conducts live force concept-based experimentation to facilitate exploration of prototype and surrogate technologies, as well as Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), in order to better refine equipment requirements and to identify Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) initiatives needed to produce future capabilities.  

Science and Technology Division conducts investigations and assessments to identify, modify where appropriate, and evaluate technological capabilities that support advanced warfighting concepts, and to explore the military utility of promising new commercial or government technologies in support of urgent and compelling needs.  MCWL investigates the relevance to EF21 capabilities and gaps of advanced technologies according to the following EF21 derived Thrust Areas:  Command, Control, Communications, and Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Autonomy and Robotics; MAGTF Fires; Maneuver; Expeditionary Logistics (to include Expeditionary Energy); Expeditionary Medicine; Cyber and Electronic Warfare (EW); and Force Protection. 

FD/MCWL investments encompass inquiries into multiple warfighting areas, including:  CSS and Force Protection; MAGTF C4; MAGTF ISR; Fires, Targeting, and Maneuver; and Warfighting Excellence.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>COMBAT SERVICE SUPPORT (CSS) AND FORCE PROTECTION</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>This activity includes FD/MCWL CSS and force protection experimentation efforts including assessment of equipment, new TTPs, training programs, and proposed organizational changes associated with enhanced capabilities. Although this category covers several small (less than $500K per FY) efforts being pursued by FD/MCWL, most programs listed below are considered major (valued at $500K or more) or have near real-time operational impact.  Investments in this activity may be conducted under the Thrust Areas of Expeditionary Logistics, Expeditionary Medicine, Force Protection, or Autonomy and Robotics. 

The FY 2016 to FY 2017 increase in category funding is attributable to a shift in radar technology use (due to lack of technological advances as well as availability), while investigating systems that can identify, neutralize, or destroy unmanned systems.  This realization led to increased costs due to exploring additional/alternative radar capabilities.  In addition, efforts related to automating ship to shore surface connectors as well as placing an increased emphasis on providing enhanced medical care over a distributed battlefield (afloat as well as ashore) caused funding to increase.  These efforts are being pursued to provide additional MAGTF support.</r2:Description>

The FY 2015 to FY 2016 decrease in category funding is attributable to reducing investments in the weaponization portion of exploring both airborne and ground weaponized autonomous systems.

The FY 2016 to FY 2017 increase in category funding is mainly due to increased levels of investment into autonomous swarming technologies to capitalize on identified academia opportunities.</r2:Description>

This activity encompasses all FD/MCWL C4 related experimentation efforts including assessment of equipment, new TTPs, training programs, and proposed organizational changes associated with enhanced C4 capabilities. Although this category covers several small (less than $500K per FY) efforts being pursued by FD/MCWL, most programs listed below are considered major (valued at $500K or more) or have near real-time operational impact.  Investments in this activity will be conducted under the Thrust Areas of C4ISR and Cyber/EW.

The FY 2015 to FY 2016 increase in category funding is attributable to focusing on EF21, with development and testing of a configurable C2 suite that enhances operations from aviation platforms and evaluation and experimentation with emerging technologies that support future maritime C2 capabilities.  

The FY 2016 to FY 2017 decrease in category funding is mainly due to a culmination of experimentation with modified commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) waveforms; thereby allowing a shift into using existing POR-based waveforms to conduct further experimentation.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>WARFIGHTING EXCELLENCE</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>This activity includes FD/MCWL efforts in the development and assessment of joint and service warfighting concepts, joint and service missions, analysis of emerging threats and opportunities, and joint capability experimentation.  It also includes FD/MCWL service experimentation in areas that impact multiple warfighting functions.  Although this category covers several small (less than $500K per FY) efforts being pursued by FD/MCWL, most programs listed below are considered major (valued at $500K or more) or have near-real-time operational impact.

The FY 2015 to FY 2016 increase in category funding is mainly due to increased focus on M&amp;S-based hardware, software, and training capabilities that support planning/experimentation processes, as well as investments to improve Wargaming abilities.

The FY 2016 to FY 2017 decrease in category funding is attributable to reduced levels of investment in broad-based technical and analytical support at the component, Service, and Joint levels.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DOD Non-Lethal Weapons Program was established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, which designated the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) as the DoD NLW Executive Agent (EA). The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP).  The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.

The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&amp;T) investment decisions provided by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that provides executive oversight and management for the JNLWP for the CMC. This direction is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document. This coordinated joint S&amp;T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies, capabilities and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&amp;T investment. These advanced technology development initiatives feed non-lethal capabilities which directly support the three pillars of the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review and comprise a fundamental part of DoD's security cooperation efforts to build partner capacity.  The resulting capabilities will facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for short-of-lethal scenarios.
  
This program funds Advanced Technology Development of next-generation non-lethal capabilities and includes performing analysis, technology development efforts, and modeling and simulation necessary to ensure optimum weaponization and use of these capabilities.  Investment areas include research and development of next-generation NLWs such as: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal counter-personnel technologies (acoustic, optical, and human electro-muscular disruption technologies), and advanced non-lethal materials (including materials for vehicle/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications). Next-generation non-lethal systems focus on long-range localized non-lethal effects to identified threat individuals (or groups of individuals) and/or their threat weapons systems operating in complicated environments such as urban areas, crowds, buildings, vehicles, vessels, and also in close proximity to high-value civilian facilities. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The primary objective of this Program Element is the development of technologies that lead to the next-generation of Non-Lethal Weapons which address identified and prioritized joint NLW capability gaps.  The program consists of a collection of projects for the development and evaluation of feasibility demonstration models.  Individual project metrics reflect the technical goals of each specific project.  Typical metrics include both the effectiveness of the technology, human effects and effectiveness, mitigation of high priority joint NLW capability gaps, and potential for compliance with policy and legislation.  Overarching considerations include the advancement of related Technology Readiness Levels and Human Effects Readiness Levels, the degree to which project investments are leveraged with other performers, reduction in life cycle cost upon application of the technology, and the identification of opportunities to transition technology to higher categories of development.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>FNC investments are typically 3-5 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 to a TRL of 6.  All FNC products require BA2 and BA3 funded technology development, which is coordinated to ensure tangible technology products are delivered upon completion of each investment.  Each year the TOG refreshes the FNC Program by approving new ECs and technology products as older ones get delivered.  After transition to an acquisition program, FNC products are further engineered, integrated and ultimately, delivered to the warfighter. The development and delivery of each FNC product is guided by a Technology Transition Agreement (TTA) that is signed by the requirements and acquisition sponsors, as well as the S&amp;T developer.

This project supports the naval pillars of Capable Manpower, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Force Health Protection, Forcenet, Power and Energy, Sea Basing, Sea Shield and Sea Strike.  Each of these pillars is listed as a separate R-2 Activity.  Under each R-2 Activity, the BA 6.3 accomplishments and plans for every Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product in the FNC Program are listed.  ECs are composed of one or more interrelated technology products, so for clarity, each product is shown under its EC.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>As discussed in Section A, there are a significant number of FNC technology products within this PE.  In all cases, these technology products support the Department of the Navy's FNC Program and are managed at the Office of Naval Research.  All FNC investments in this PE are subjected to management oversight by 2-star chaired Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) that control the naval pillars of Sea Shield, Sea Strike, Sea Basing, Forcenet, Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Power and Energy, Capable Manpower, and Force Health Protection.  Each EC is aligned to a pillar and each technology product is aligned to an EC.  At the lowest level, each technology product is measured against both technical and financial milestones on a monthly basis.  Annually, each technology product is reviewed in depth for technical performance and development status by the Chief of Naval Research against goals that have been approved by the Navy's 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG).  Also annually, each technology product is reviewed by its 2-star chaired pillar IPT for transition planning and adequacy and transition commitment level.   Products must meet TOG required transition commitment levels for S&amp;T development to continue.  Transition issues and required adjustments are reported annually by the Chief of Naval Research to the TOG, which establishes investment priorities for the FNC Program.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

All FNC investments in this PE are subjected to management oversight by 2-star chaired Integrated Product Teams (IPTs).  Each EC is aligned to a pillar and each technology product is aligned to an EC.  At the lowest level, each technology product is measured against both technical and financial milestones on a monthly basis.  Annually, each technology product is reviewed in depth for technical performance and development status by the Chief of Naval Research against goals that have been approved by the Navy's 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG).  Also annually, each technology product is reviewed by its 2-star chaired pillar IPT for transition planning and adequacy and transition commitment level.   Products must meet TOG required transition commitment levels for S&amp;T development to continue.  Transition issues and required adjustments are reported annually by the Chief of Naval Research to the TOG, which establishes investment priorities for the FNC Program.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This program supports the development and demonstration of field medical equipment and technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions. Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. These projects support future capabilities within the Force Health Protection Program, a Future Naval Capability (FNC) that will provide technology options for the future Navy and Marine Corps by reducing morbidity and mortality when casualties occur.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports the development and demonstration of field medical equipment, diagnostic capabilities and treatments; technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions; and systems to prevent occupational injury and disease in hazardous, deployment environments.  Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies.  For example, civilian emergency medicine does not address casualty stabilization during long transit times to definitive care.  The National Institutes for Health (NIH) focuses on the basic science of disease processes and not product development.  Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee to prevent duplication of effort.  This project funds the Force Health Protection program a Future Naval Capability (FNC) that will provide technology options for future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities and supports the "Sea Warrior" component of the Naval Transformation Roadmap, medical logistics aspects of "Sea Basing" and expeditionary force medical support associated with "Sea Strike".</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The effort with Marine Corps Special Operations Command (MARSOC) continued.

Expansion of SPEAR database:  This database will help consolidate research done by the University of Pittsburgh and enable efficient and consistent data collection across the USSOCOM Enterprise Human Performance Program.  This data collection on each individual type of SOF Operator will allow the Human Performance Program to effectively provide consistent and valid research-based injury prevention and performance optimization solutions that will enable the design of training programs uniquely tailored to the needs of special operators in the most productive and cost effective manner possible.  Completion of this work for each SOF Component will also fill in the gaps of previously funded scientific research.

Close Quarters Combat Performance Metrics (CQC):  Development of cognitive and physiological metrics to measure performance in a specific USSOCOM Operators task: Close Quarters Combat (CQC).  Further, this work will improve the operational effectiveness of the Human Performance Program by developing measures of physiological and tactical individual and team performance in order to mitigate errors and improve cognitive performance in a CQC task using Navy Special Warfare (NSW) Operators.

SOF Operator Availability &amp; Performance Optimization: For research to maximize SOF Operator readiness and availability:  This work will identify strategies to maximize mean time between injuries and minimize mean time to repair, so as to maximize SOF Operator availability and performance.  Analyses of Operator injury history and Human Performance Program participation will attempt to identify ways to increase individual Operator availability so as to contribute to increase readiness for SOF units.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

All Navy advanced technology development in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking and neutralization is funded through this PE.  The related technologies being developed are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the three core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  The focus is on leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship and air ASW assets.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Improve target detection, localization, and tracking and increase attack capabilities by providing the following capabilities:
- Localization of 85% or more of enemy submarines in far forward or contested waters with false locations of less than 10% of total calls.
- Effective cueing of an attack from a distance of up to 200nm.
- Improvement of the Lightweight Torpedo (Mk 54). Specific improvements are classified.
- Extending deep water active distributed system lifetime to a few months with a probability of detection (Pd) of 90% within 4 hours (field configuration) or 90% per crossing (barrier configuration), with a False Alarm Rate (FAR) of no more than 4/day.
- Delivery from a Vertical Takeoff Unmanned Air Vehicle (VTUAV) and/or a long-range, high-speed Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) a compact undersea weapon capable of a high Probability of Kill (PK) given precise target localization.
- Detection and localization performance with a single-line vector sensor array nominally equivalent or superior to that of two coherently processed TB-29A arrays. Acquisition costs to be competitive with the cost of a current TB-29A and at least 30% less than the cost of two arrays. Sensor and telemetry packaging will be adequate to achieve neutral buoyancy in an existing TB-29A form factor with array power efficiency greater than 75%. Array handling will be compatible with the existing TB-29 handling system.

Increase sensor to shooter performance and the effective lifetime of distributed ASW search systems by:
- Achieving a drifting active distributed system lifetime of at least two days in areas of tactical significance while maintaining required system performance with a minimum number of sensor nodes.
- Maintaining an effective lifetime of a month for mobile active distributed systems when subjected to the action of eddies from a major ocean current.
- Predicting reseed 6 hours before performance degrades.
- Holding the Area of Uncertainty (AOU) to no larger than 10 nm2 for an hour after initial detection through the control of the coherent sources.

Through a combination of better Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) command-level training and improved operator training provide the following:
- Improve the ability of active sonar operators to detect targets and reject potential false alarms compared to current simulation based training.
- Increase Pd by 50%.
- Provide a decrease in FAR by a factor of two.
- Provide a reduction in the probability of a hit on a High Value Unit (HVU) by a factor of two.
- Improve the ability of the ASW Commander to position assets to increase coverage, reduce active system interference and deal effectively with competing missions.
- Reduce training cost by greater than 80% and increase the frequency of training opportunities by greater than 600% relative to live training.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the development of recent technology breakthroughs to meet current operational needs from a subscale proof-of-principle into a full-scale prototype for warfighter experimentation during laboratory and operational demonstrations, Fleet Battle Experiments (FBE), Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs) and sea trial exercises.  The key aspects of this PE are divided into four areas: (1) SwampWorks develops and demonstrates newly invented or recently discovered technologies that address emergent and enduring operational problems in an accelerated timeframe; (2) Naval Warfare Experimentation develops rapid prototypes and provides them to the warfighter for experimentation during laboratory and operational demonstrations; (3) TechSolutions develops rapid response science and technology prototypes addressing Fleet/Force needs identified by Sailors and Marines at the deckplate level; (4) Operations Analysis provides the Navy and Marine Corps the means to identify capability needs that can be addressed with science and technology solutions, and (5) Manufacturing Technology Science and Technology (S&amp;T) to accelerate recently discovered manufacturing technologies to reduce the acquisition and ownership costs of current and future platforms.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE. 

Funding increased in FY2016 in order to accommodate increased Naval Warfare Experimentation to support emergent opportunities to meet fleet needs with potential technology solutions and SwampWorks due to the increased research and fleet interest in the areas of Autonomy, Electromagnetic Warfare and the exploitation of unmanned systems.  

Note: For Manufacturing Technology S&amp;T, the funds in FY2016 ($7.495M) and beyond have moved to new PE 0603680N Manufacturing Technology Program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>SwampWorks seeks to develop and demonstrate technologies that address emergent and enduring operational problems in an accelerated timeframe.  The general nature of these efforts are high risk/high reward and constitute a leap ahead in capability or technology.  Some of these technologies may become part of a follow-on technology development, may end up in the hands of the warfighter for Fleet/Force experimentation, or may culminate in a significant Fleet/Force exercise that demonstrates capability then transitions into the Acquisition Program of Record (POR).

Funding increase in FY2016 is due to the increased research in Directed Energy (Solid State Laser - Technology Maturation, or SSL-TM). This investment was a single year investment and thus the decrease from FY2016 to FY2017.</r2:Description>

The performance of the work funded in this PE is reviewed at several levels to ensure that the investment is relevant and productive.  At the macroscopic level, the investment is coordinated with Navy Warfare Development Command and Commander, Fleet Forces Command to address the goals and objectives identified for sea trials and Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs).  At the microscopic level, the work funded in this PE is reviewed periodically by the Program Manager to ensure the investment is meeting the goals defined for each project. This review includes feedback collected from the warfighter community on all sea trials and LOEs to support the Program Manager's assessment of the value and relevance of each investment. Furthermore, the entire program is reviewed yearly by the Chief of Naval Research.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015) and investment directions as defined by Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5160.62 "Single Manager Responsibility for Military Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology and Training (EODT&amp;T)" and approved by the DoD Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Program Board (Sep 2012).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance, input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). The strategy is also based on the unique needs and capabilities identified by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) and the DoD EOD Program Board. It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval and Joint EOD forces in the 21st century.  The strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions, DoD EOD S&amp;T with Joint EOD missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE primarily develops and demonstrates prototype Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare and Joint EOD system components that support capabilities enabling Naval and Joint EOD Forces to influence operations ashore.  Adversarial nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics, throughout the littorals. They also have the capability to develop or modify explosive devices such as mines and unexploded ordnance to construct Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) for the purpose of targeting Joint Forces.  Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat.  Current operations have also demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the threat from explosive hazards and IEDs during DoD operations.  Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective.  Advanced technologies must enable Joint EOD forces to detect/locate, gain access, diagnose, render safe, neutralize, recover, exploit and dispose of a broad spectrum of explosive hazards including unexploded ordnance and IEDs.  This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads, and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities. It supports the advanced development and integration of sensors and tools for standoff capabilities such as detection and location of IEDs (particularly in dismounted operations), dismounted diagnosis of buried munitions and other explosive hazards, precision render safe and neutralization of surface munitions and other explosive hazards, and enhanced access to IEDs.  It supports the MCM-related FNC Enabling Capabilities (ECs).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three key transformational capabilities required by Sea Shield as well as technically enable the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within Sea Strike.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This PE develops and demonstrates prototype technology for Mine Countermeasures (MCM), US Naval sea mining, and Expeditionary Warfare and Joint EOD system components that support capabilities enabling Naval and Joint EOD Forces to influence operations ashore. Adversarial nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics, throughout the littorals. They also have the capability to develop or modify explosive devices such as mines and unexploded ordnance to construct Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) for the purpose of targeting Joint Forces. Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat. Current operations have also demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the threat from explosive hazards and IEDs during DoD operations. Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective. Advanced technologies must enable Joint EOD forces to detect/locate, gain access, diagnose, render safe, neutralize, recover, exploit and dispose of a broad spectrum of explosive hazards including unexploded ordnance and IEDs. This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads, and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities. It supports the advanced development and integration of sensors and tools for standoff capabilities such as detection and location of IEDs (particularly in dismounted operations), dismounted diagnosis of buried munitions and other explosive hazards, precision render safe and neutralization of surface munitions and other explosive hazards, and enhanced access to IEDs.  It supports advanced development for battlespace shaping weapons including advanced undersea weapons.  It supports the MCM related FNC Enabling Capabilities (ECs). Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three key transformational capabilities required by Sea Shield as well as technically enable the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within Sea Strike.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
