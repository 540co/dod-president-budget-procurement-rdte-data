                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) was created by Congress in 1983.  The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&amp;E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&amp;E of the program is complete.  DOT&amp;E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&amp;E's oversight authority include: 

-	The approval of component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS).
-	The approval of component OT&amp;E Test Plans.
-	Oversight of Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.
-	Reporting results of OT&amp;E that support BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&amp;E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.

DOT&amp;E also oversees and resources OT&amp;E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (COCOM) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report.  As a result of the Department's recognition of the importance of enhanced cyber assessment capabilities, additional resources were added in fiscal year 2013.  These enhancements will include expanded threat assessments of the advanced cyber adversary, more representative portrayal of the cyber adversary by Red Teams, and improvements to the Joint Information Operations Range that will support more operationally realistic and threat representative assessment and training events.

This Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support in performing the described tasks, travel funds to carry out oversight of the OT&amp;E program, funds for Service teams performing information assurance and interoperability assessments during exercises, administrative and financial support services, and engineering and technical support services related to the conduct of operational test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>Operational Test and Evaluation Oversight

This effort is in direct support of the Director’s Title 10 responsibilities to conduct independent, rigorous, and comprehensive evaluation of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the Department’s weapons programs.  Funding for FY 2011 provided Operational Test and Evaluation inputs for Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary Reports for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&amp;E and OUSD(AT&amp;L).  Key elements of DOT&amp;E oversight authority  were identified in Calendar Year 2011 Office of the Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List.  

Information Assurance and Interoperability Evaluations
 
Information assurance and interoperability assessments were performed during 23 FY 2011 COCOM and Service exercises, or during real-world operations.  Warfighter responses to computer network attack (ability to protect, detect, react, and restore) were captured in all information assurance events.  Portrayal of advanced threats were included in several events.  Interoperability assessments were guided by a more rigorous process that includes expanded research and linkage to warfighter mission threads.  In partnership with Joint Staff J8 (previously the Joint Forces Command J8), two interoperability assessments were planned and executed with emphasis on the systems and capabilities contained in the Joint Forces Command C2 Optimum Capability Mix Study.  Assessment support to units deploying to theaters of operation was completed for four assessments, resulting in enhancements to their network defense postures.  Fiscal year 2011 information assurance and interoperability evaluations included trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across COCOMs.  Critical findings were transmitted to Service and DoD leadership for their awareness and remediation actions, as appropriate.  The Joint Information Operations Range supported two assessment events for added operational realism and required higher-level security during exercise assessments.

This is a continuing effort and is in direct support of the Director’s Title 10 responsibilities.  FY 2012 funds will provide Operational Test and Evaluation inputs for Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary Reports for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&amp;E and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD(AT&amp;L)).  Key elements of DOT&amp;E oversight authority are identified in Calendar Year 2012 Office of the Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List.

Information Assurance and Interoperability Evaluations

	Approximately 25 information assurance and interoperability assessments will be planned and executed during FY 2012 COCOM and Service exercises.  Full assessment of warfighter responses to computer network attack (ability to protect, detect, react, and restore) will be captured in all information assurance events.  Portrayal of selected advanced-cyber threats will be included in most events, in accordance with the CJCS Red Team EXORD, and interoperability and mission accomplishment in representative threat environments will be examined.  In partnership with US CYBER Command, DoD Red Team capabilities will be enhanced to reflect DIA assessments, and application of these teams will be synchronized across Cyber Command and DOT&amp;E assessment priorities.  In partnership with the Joint Staff J8, focused interoperability assessments will be planned and executed in two events with emphasis on the systems and capabilities contained in the C2 Optimum Capability Mix Study.  Assessment support to units deploying to theaters of operation will continue as needed.  Fiscal year 2012 information assurance and interoperability evaluations will include trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across COCOMs.  Critical findings will be transmitted to Service and DoD leadership for their awareness and remediation actions, as appropriate.  The Joint Information Operations Range will support events across multiple COCOMS for added threat realism and required security during exercise assessments.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Starting in FY 2013 the increase in funding is the result of the realignment of the JASP and JTCG/ME programs from the Operational Test Activities and Analyses program (0605814OTE) to the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program (0605131OTE).  

</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element consists of three programs:  Live Fire Test and Evaluation, Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP) and Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME).  Starting in FY 2013 the JASP and JTCG/ME programs are realigned from the Operational Test Activities and Analyses program (0605814OTE) to the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program element (0605131OTE).  The JASP and JTCG/ME programs focus on the survivability of currently fielded systems; therefore, the two programs are more appropriately funded within the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program element.

This Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E).  The primary objective of LFT&amp;E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&amp;E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&amp;E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&amp;E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.

This Program Element also supports DoD’s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&amp;E related initiatives.  JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethalities against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.  

The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD’s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Aeronautical Systems Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&amp;E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT), is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&amp;E and is also an Executive Agent for the Survivability Vulnerability Information Analysis Center (SURVIAC), the repository for aircraft survivability information.

The Joint Logistics Commanders Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME) was chartered more than 40 years ago to serve as DoD’s focal point for munitions effectiveness information.  This has taken the form of widely used Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) which address all major non-nuclear U.S. weapons.  JTCG/ME authenticates weapons effectiveness data for use in training, systems acquisition, weapon procurement, and combat modeling and simulation.  JMEMs are used by the Armed Forces of the U.S., NATO, and other allies to plan operational missions, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses.  JTCG/ME also develops and standardizes methodologies for evaluation of munitions effectiveness and maintains databases for target vulnerability, munitions lethality, and weapon system accuracy.  The JMEM requirements and development processes continues to be driven by operational lessons learned (Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and Odyssey Dawn) and the needs of Combatant Commands, Services, Military Targeting Committee, and Operational Users Working Groups input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. 

This program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks, as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&amp;E programs.

This program element is budgeted in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, to support LFT&amp;E management activities for the oversight of RDT&amp;E of new systems, as well as RDT&amp;E of fielded systems.

The FY 2011 budget provided Live Fire Test and Evaluation input for Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary reports, and Beyond Low Rate Initial Production (BLRIP) reports for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&amp;E and OUSD(AT&amp;L).  The oversight list is developed and published annually.

JLF Programs and LFT&amp;E Initiatives  

Conducted tests of fielded systems not previously tested under Air, Land, or Sea Joint Live Fire programs to support DOT&amp;E and warfighter needs.  The need for these tests results from systems being exposed to new threats, used in new unanticipated tactics, or being operated in new combat environments, and the subsequent need for an assessment of their performance.  Provided support and continued to partner with the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization.  Urgent requests directly supporting deployed operators and issues of importance to the Congress in the areas of personnel body armor and combat helmets were addressed.  Supported helicopter survivability efforts of the Department to recommend quickly fielded survivability improvements to the combat theater.  An initiative to investigate aortic injuries was completed.  This initiative was in partnership with OUSD (Personnel and Readiness) and NASA as part of Occupant Casualty initiatives. 

JLF projects continued to be performed to provide survivability data on currently fielded U.S. systems.  JLF Air projects investigated vulnerabilities of aircraft to man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS).  Projects are updating models and simulation to more accurately take into account vulnerabilities to MANPADS fragments and debris as well as blast.  JLF Air continued work on large engine vulnerability to MANPADS, including hit point analyses and miss distance measurements.  JLF Land projects continued investigating the vulnerability of vehicles to new threats from theater and the lethality of U.S. weapons against typical in-theater targets, as well as improving modeling and simulation tools by providing validation data.  JLF Sea projects continued developing key components of alternatives to traditional shock trials of ships and submarines and began investigating ship vulnerabilities in the areas of commercial standards and specific designs, equipment and component damage, and compartment fires.

JLF Programs and LFT&amp;E Initiatives

Conduct tests of fielded systems not previously tested under Air, Land, or Sea Joint Live Fire programs to support DOT&amp;E and operator needs.  The need for these tests results from systems being exposed to new threats, used in new unanticipated tactics, or being operated in new combat environments, and the subsequent need for an assessment of their performance.  As necessary, continue to support and partner with the Joint Trauma Analysis and Prevention of Injury in Combat (JTAPIC) program.  Continue efforts in support of Personnel Protection Equipment, including combat helmets and body armor.  Continue to address urgent requests that directly support deployed operators and issues of importance to the Congress as they arise. 

Continue to perform JLF projects to provide survivability data on currently fielded U.S. systems.  JLF Air projects will continue the investigation of an emerging threat first seen in a CH 47 combat incident, test the vulnerability of sponsons to RPGs, evaluate engine nacelle vulnerability reduction techniques, as well as generic vulnerabilities to all aircraft, such as to MANPADS, small arms, and the performance of self sealing fuel tanks using bio-fuels.  New projects will investigate the effect of yawed projectiles and missile debris on aircraft vulnerability, the vulnerability of turboprop engines, and a comparison of commonly used test threats.  JLF Land projects will continue to investigate the vulnerability of vehicles to underbody blast and the lethality of U.S. weapons against typical in-theater targets, as well as improving modeling and simulation tools by providing validation data.  New projects will study the use and validity of manikins, helmets, and improvements to material characteristics used in modeling and simulation.  JLF Sea projects will continue to develop key components of alternatives to traditional shock trials of ships and submarines, will continue to investigate ship vulnerabilities in the areas of commercial standards, equipment and component damage, and will investigate vulnerabilities of designs and components for new ships.

Address urgent requests that directly support deployed warfighters and issues of importance to the Congress. 

Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP) 

In FY 2013 the JASP will continue work on at least 29 multi-year RDT&amp;E projects and initiate new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E.  The JASP will apply resources to address aircraft occupant casualties and rotorcraft combat survivability.  In the area of susceptibility reduction, the JASP will address improving directed energy infrared countermeasures, electronic countermeasures technology and techniques, aircrew situational awareness and urgent operator needs.  In the area of vulnerability reduction, the JASP will continue to address requirements for lighter and more effective vulnerability reduction technology (e.g., armor, fuel containment, fire suppression, and aircrew and passenger protection).  In aircraft survivability M&amp;S, the JASP will continue to improve survivability M&amp;S credibility, address operator requirements for survivability data, integrate DIA threat missile models into threat engagement codes, improve the assessment of aircrew and passenger injuries, and address M&amp;S requirements identified by the joint aircraft survivability community.  

The JCAT will continue to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities.  The JASP will continue supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors.  The JASP will initiate, continue and complete other projects as approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E.

Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME)

In support of operational commanders, DoD targeteers, weaponeers, and planners, the JTCG/ME will develop and release JMEM Weaponeering System (JWS) v2.x in September 2013 and Joint-Antiair Combat Effectiveness System (J-ACE) Air Superiority (AS) v5.2 in September 2013.  

JWS v2.x will provide new COCOM high priority targets and weapons data; updates to Boat Estimation Tool (BET), Fast Integrated Structural Tool (FIST), and Passive Vehicle Target Model (PVTM); and a capability to drop-in critical data and modules.  J-ACE v5.2 will add Browse descriptive material to support new weapons in Joint Anti-air Model (JAAM); expand Suite of Anti-air Kill-chain Models and Data (SAK-MD) capability; and update existing weapons and aircraft in JAAM.

JTCG/ME will continue to; (i) develop a predictive capability to assess blast effects, body-on-body penetration, and blast-fragment synergism and incorporate these mechanisms in the JTCG/ME estimation process for small, precision weapons; and (ii) expand the use of computational physics to improve test design and data analysis to support both analytical model development and the characterization of weapons addressing blast interactions with structures, weapon fragmentation, and penetration mechanics; 

JMEMs will continue to be evolved.  Fast running operational tools will be created from the existing detailed analytical models typically used to support system acquisition decisions.  Necessary investment will be made in those models for the development, configuration management and validation required to insure their applicability in support of warfighting operations.  This investment will allow more effective and efficient use of DoD resources; build on a record of success in supporting Warfighter application of conventional weapons; and will increase operational capability in areas such as: (i) precision application of firepower in an environment where zero collateral casualties is the expectation; (ii) optimal use of scarce and/or high value resources, preferred and prepositioned munitions; (iii) reduced uncertainties and delays in strike planning and Battle Damage Assessment (BDA); (iv) weapon effects in a CM environment; and (v) reduced risk to personnel, materiel and mission accomplishment.

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Performance Measure:  Percentage of required live fire test planning documents, assessments, and reports applicable to acquisition programs on the OSD Test and Evaluation Oversight List and other special interest programs/legacy systems that are completed and delivered to the appropriate decision makers on time.  Percentage of required products, such as test planning documents, munitions effectiveness manuals, tactic-techniques and reports that are developed and delivered to program managers and customers on time.

Actual Performance and Goals:

Live Fire Test and Evaluation 	FY 2011 Actual	       FY 2012 Goal	          FY 2013 Goal
On-Time Completion Rate	          90%	                               93%	                               95%

The on-time completion rate was computed on the basis of the number required reports that were submitted within established time standards relative to the total number of such products that fell due during the fiscal year.  DOT&amp;E plans to achieve its goals for FY 2012 and FY 2013 through continued management emphasis on timely delivery of required reports to customer activities.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Starting in FY 2013 the decreases in funding are the result of the realignment of the JASP and JTCG/ME programs from the Operational Test Activities and Analyses program (0605814OTE) to the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program (0605131OTE) and a reduction to the Joint Live Fire Program as part of the overall DoD budget reduction effort. 
</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Test and Evaluation programs are continuing efforts that provide management and oversight of test and evaluation functions and expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD).  The T&amp;E programs consist of five activities:  Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E); Threat Systems (TS); Center for Countermeasures (CCM); Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME); and Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP).  Starting in FY 2013 the JTCG/ME and JASP programs are realigned from the Operational Test Activities and Analyses program element (0605814OTE) to the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program element (0605131OTE).  Since the JTCG/ME and JASP programs focus on the survivability of currently fielded systems the two programs are more appropriately funded within the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program element.  

Joint Test and Evaluation projects are test and evaluation activities conducted in a joint military environment that develop process improvements.  These multi-Service projects, chartered by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and coordinated with the Joint Staff, appropriate combatant commanders, and the Services, provide non-materiel solutions that improve:  joint interoperability of Service systems, technical and operational concepts, joint operational issues, development and validation of joint test methodologies, and test data for validating models, simulations, and test beds.  The JT&amp;E projects address relevant joint war fighting issues in a joint test and evaluation environment by developing and providing new tactics, techniques, and procedures to improve joint test capabilities and methodologies.

Threat Systems, based on a memorandum of agreement between the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) and the Defense Intelligence Agency, provides DOT&amp;E support in the areas of threat resource analysis, intelligence support and threat systems investments.  Threat Systems provides threat resource analyses on the availability, capabilities and limitations of threat representations (threat simulators, targets, models, U.S. surrogates and foreign materiel) and analysis of test resources used for operational testing to support DOT&amp;E’s assessment of the adequacy of testing for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&amp;E and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD(AT&amp;L)).  Threat Systems provides DOT&amp;E assessment officers and other DOT&amp;E activities with program specific threat intelligence support.  Threat Systems also funds management, oversight, and development of common-use threat specifications for threat simulators, threat representative targets, and digital threat models used for test and evaluation. 

The Center, a Joint Service Countermeasure (CM) Test and Evaluation Center, serves as DoD’s independent evaluator for electro-optical systems with emphasis on rotary wing survivability, precision guided weapons (PGWs), CMs/ counter-countermeasures (CCMs) employment, and warning devices.  The Center conducts tests, analyzes test results and provides CM expertise that benefits the Services, Joint activities, T&amp;E Agencies, DoD Acquisition Community, the Intelligence Community, Homeland Defense and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  Data collected during Center test activities provides valuable information to OSD assessment officers for select oversight programs.  The Center assesses current and developing systems, using carefully developed test and evaluation methodologies to provide the basis for understanding how CMs might affect systems used in current and future battlefields.  Additionally, the Center develops CM specific test equipment that can be used for both Title 10 programs and OCO urgent operational needs.

The Joint Logistics Commanders Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME) was chartered more than 40 years ago to serve as DoD’s focal point for munitions effectiveness information.  This has taken the form of widely used Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) which address all major non-nuclear U.S. weapons.  JTCG/ME authenticates weapons effectiveness data for use in training, systems acquisition, weapon procurement, and combat modeling and simulation.  JMEMs are used by the Armed Forces of the U.S., NATO, and other allies to plan operational missions, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses.  JTCG/ME also develops and standardizes methodologies for evaluation of munitions effectiveness and maintains databases for target vulnerability, munitions lethality, and weapon system accuracy.  The JMEM requirements and development processes continues to be driven by operational lessons learned (Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and Odyssey Dawn) and the needs of Combatant Commands, Services, Military Targeting Committee, and Operational Users Working Groups input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies.

The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD’s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Aeronautical Systems Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&amp;E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT), is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&amp;E and is also an Executive Agent for the Survivability Vulnerability Information Analysis Center (SURVIAC), the repository for aircraft survivability information.

This Program Element was reduced in FY 2013 and the outyears as part of the overall DoD budget reduction effort. 

This Program Element is budgeted in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, to support management activities for the DOTE oversight responsbilities of test and evaluation functions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E)

In FY 2011, JT&amp;E had three projects close and four projects ongoing from FYs 2009 and 2010.  The Joint Civil Information Management Joint Test, closed June 2011, developed joint tactics, techniques, and procedures to collect, consolidate, and share civil information at the tactical and operational levels so that the joint task force commander will have better information to plan operations.  Another project that closed in FY 2011 was Joint Data Integration.  This project researched, tested, and evaluated the tactics, techniques, and procedures for use in standardizing the common tactical picture by addressing the quality of:  duplicate tracks, time latency, common operational picture synchronization, channel disruptions, position/location discrepancies, and naming schema discrepancies.  On a continual basis, JT&amp;E reviews nominations for new projects, manages ongoing projects, and ensures that closing projects transition products to their customers are debriefed, and that their final reports are distributed to the appropriate Service organizations.  Two projects were initiated in FY 2011.

Threat Systems 

During FY 2011, Threat Systems completed development of standard, DIA-validated airborne jammer models for use throughout the Department to evaluate effects on U.S. aircraft; evaluated proposals to develop and implement a more robust open-air threat environment to make operational testing more realistic; continued to address testing against advanced threats that may be encountered from adversarial nations; and initiated a project to obtain data to support fielding of upgraded hostile fire indicator systems for use in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Threat Systems continued test planning working group participation to identify threat shortfalls; conducted special studies and provided current intelligence support tailored to specific U.S. weapon systems acquisition; and demonstrated test facility connectivity for enhanced weapons systems testing and improving end-to-end testing of U.S. threat warning and countermeasures systems.  These efforts continued to develop threat test assets used for testing in a joint test environment; continued with the third year of a four-year project to integrate current intelligence community-based missile models into all DoD Hardware-In-The-Loop countermeasure test facilities; successfully demonstrated the ability of recently developed standards for target control interfaces to control sub-scale aerial targets; completed the design and analysis phase to develop a set of prototype designs for a cost effective full-scale aerial target that embodies the critical attributes of future 5th generation threat fighter aircraft; and performed a comprehensive requirements analysis for a new full-scale rotary wing target.

These activities help DOT&amp;E carry out its Title 10 responsibilities to assess test adequacy and determine whether testing is realistic and suitable and promotes common solutions to Service threat representation needs.

Center for Countermeasures (the Center) 

The Center tested, analyzed, and reported on more than 40 electro-optical systems with special emphasis on rotary wing survivability, countermeasures (CM)/ counter-countermeasures (CCMs) employment, warning and targeting systems and precision guided weapons (PGWs).  Each program supported received an independent assessment of our findings and test support for CM/ CCM evaluations.  Approximately 66% of the Center efforts were spent on Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) testing; the majority of these efforts in support of rotary wing aircraft and Hostile Fire Indication (HFI) capabilities.  Approximately 18% of the Center effort was dedicated to overseas contingency operations (OCO) support with emphasis on CM based pre-deployment training for rotary wing units.  About 4% of Center effort was spent on PGW testing.  Thirteen percent of the Center efforts were spent on internal programs to improve test capabilities and to develop test methodologies for new types of T&amp;E activities.  The Center continued development of the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program sponsored, Joint IRCM Threat System, Towed Aerial Plume Simulator and Multi-Spectral Sea and Land Target Simulator that will be used in support of testing for both Title 10 programs and OCO aircraft survivability equipment urgent operational needs.  Our support was distributed across all the Services as well as intelligence agencies and research and development activities.

The Center provided expertise to many organizations and was actively involved in the following panels:  Joint Expendable Countermeasures (JECM) Integrated Product Team, Joint , Infrared Countermeasures Multi Sensing Symposia Working Group (MSS IRCM WG), Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), Foreign Material Exploitation Working Group, Foreign Material Program Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Subcommittee, Joint Project Mallari Working Group, Joint Countermeasures T&amp;E Working Group (JCMT&amp;E WG), and JCMT&amp;E WG Hostile Fire Indicator (HFI) subgroup lead. 

Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME)

JWS v2.0.1 and the JTCG/ME generated Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3160.01 Collateral Effects
Radii (CER) tables were used for operational weaponeering and collateral damage estimation calls in direct support of Operation Odyssey Dawn Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) and Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) strikes.  In continued support of operational commanders, DoD targeteers, weaponeers, and planners, the JTCG/ME developed and released JMEM Weaponeering System (JWS) v2.1 beta version in June 2011.  In addition, development of JWS v2.1 continued throughout FY 2011.  Joint-Antiair Combat Effectiveness System (J-ACE) Air Superiority (AS) v4.1 was released in October 2010.  J-ACE v5.0 was released in September 2011.  

JWS v2.1 beta version contained the Fast Integrated Structural Tool (FIST).  FIST is the future JMEM operational-level tool that incorporates the integral modules from Building Analysis Module (BAM) and Hardened Target Module (HTM) to create a merged tool that generates weapon effectiveness and damage assessments against infrastructure targets to include buildings, bunkers, and tunnels.  In addition, JWS v2.1 release will contain approximately 180 new/updated targets, 15 new/updated munitions, new Explosive Equivalent Weights based on blast testing and an improved 3-D viewer.  

J-ACE v4.1 contained additional threat Surface-to-Air (SAM) Flyout Models (FOMs), additional threat Air-to-Air missile FOMs and improved Blue Air-to-Air missile FOMs.  J-ACE 4.1 was released in October 2010.  Weapon Engagement Zone (WEZ) software, consistent with Operational Flight Programs in the currently fielded fighter fleet was provided for U.S. missiles; NASIC “FrankenWEZ” software was used for threat aircraft missile engagement zone determination.  New or updated air-to-air missile simulations were added for the US AIM-7, AIM-9, and AIM-120 and NASIC threat AA-12, Magic 2, and PL-12.  Sixteen new or improved MSIC threat surface-to-air missiles (SAM) were also added.  Software changes continued to better support operational user requirements; and, interface with other models, simulations, training range telemetry and mission planning system software.  J-ACE v5.0 provided the initial release of the Suite of Antiair Killchain Models and Data (SAK-MD).  SAK-MD software and data is a significant increase in J-ACE capability.  The faster than real time calculations address missile fly out, target evasive maneuver, miss distance, effects of countermeasures, fuze performance, missile lethality and target vulnerability.  These key “kill chain” elements are provided for RED and BLUE weapons.  To more effectively support operational mission planning, particularly at USSTRATCOM, the JAAM 5.0 release also provides a direct interface to force level simulations.  This initial SAK-MD capability expansion was provided only to specific users for extended testing, while JAAM v5.0 without the SAK-MD capabilities is available to all users.

In support of the Combatant Commands and the CJCSI 3160.01, JTCG/ME provided updates for CER values for newly fielded systems.  In addition, the JTCG/ME accredited the Digital Precision Strike Suite (DPSS) Collateral Damage Estimation (DCiDE) tool version 1.0.0 in July 2011 for operational use.  This tool displays accredited Collateral Damage Estimate Level 1-5 A-C series effective radii reference tables.  Additionally, JTCG/ME trained nearly 150 users at 10 different Commands.

FY 2011 continued development and refinement of the Joint Blast Analysis Model (JBAM).  Additional damage modules were implemented in JBAM software, the user interface and documentation.  Additionally, JTCG/ME developed a strategy for implementation of the Operational Requirement-based Casualty Assessment (ORCA) methodology in evaluating the capability of weapon systems to inflict varying levels of personnel incapacitation to include complete and immediate loss of function.  

The JTCG/ME assessed fielded and emerging Information Operations (IO), Directed Energy (DE) and Non-lethal (NL) systems as part of early efforts to create an Effects Based Operations (EBO) evaluation capability set.  The scope includes weapon characterization, coordinating test data development and providing operational tools for the IO elements of Computer Network Attack and Electronic Warfare; Laser and Radio Frequency DE; and, NL systems against materiel and personnel targets.  This weapon effectiveness and associated confidence level data are critical enablers for application of these weapons as it will provide senior leaders and warfighters with information to develop policy and concepts of operations for their use.  

Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP)  

In FY 2011 the JASP continued work on 28 multi-year RDT&amp;E projects and initiated 28 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E.  In the area of susceptibility reduction, the JASP addressed improving directed energy infrared countermeasures, electronic countermeasures technology and techniques, aircrew situational awareness and immediate operator needs.  In the area of vulnerability reduction, the JASP continued to address requirements for lighter and more effective armor, fuel containment, fire suppression; and aircrew and passenger protection.  In aircraft survivability Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S), the JASP continued to improve survivability M&amp;S credibility, address operator requirements for survivability data, integrate DIA threat missile models into threat engagement codes, improve the assessment of aircrew and passenger injuries, and address M&amp;S requirements identified by the joint aircraft survivability community.  The JASP published 43 reports documenting projects completed in FY 2011.

The JCAT continued to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities.  The JASP continued supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors.

                                            <r2:Text>Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E) 

In FY 2012 JT&amp;E has two projects slated for closing and an estimated four projects ongoing from FY 2010 and FY 2011.  The Joint Integration of Maritime Domain Awareness Joint Test, expected to close in FY 2012, is looking to develop joint tactics, techniques, and procedures to synchronize maritime domain information for key decision markers across operations centers for homeland defense.  The other project closing in FY 2012 is Joint Jamming Assessment and Mitigation Joint Test.  This project will develop joint tactics, techniques, and procedures to sustain operations in the presence of purposeful interference on the ultra- and super-high frequencies of the satellite communication bands.  This will allow commanders and operators to execute operations when satellite communications are degraded.  On a continual basis, JT&amp;E reviews nominations for new projects, manages ongoing projects, and ensures that closing projects transition products to their customers are debriefed, and that their final reports are distributed to the appropriate Service organizations.

Threat Systems

As part of the Secretary of Defense FY 2012 efficiency initiatives, the Target Management Initiative (TMI) was eliminated and funding for investments in advanced threat surrogate developments was reduced.  TMI elimination will make the Services solely responsible for the development and acquisition of new threat representative targets and target control systems.  Reducing threat surrogate investments will slow but not eliminate development of advanced threat surrogates used in operational test and evaluation.

Threat Systems will complete the four-year project to integrate current intelligence community-based missile models into all DoD Hardware-In-The-Loop countermeasure test facilities, continue test planning working group participation to identify threat shortfalls; conduct special studies and provide current intelligence support tailored to specific U.S. weapon systems acquisition.  In addition, Threat Systems will develop an unmanned aerial vehicle Global Positioning Satellite jamming capability using micro jammers to increase threat realism at test ranges, and use existing live fire data to verify and compare MANPAD laboratory and hardware-in-the-loop facility testing capabilities to increase confidence in using other than open air live fire events for operational testing.  Initiatives for FY 2012 include development of a modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) roadmap to identify projects that support effective testing of US and Allied countermeasure systems; integration of authoritative, DIA-approved models into simulations used for testing advanced systems in an integrated air defense network; data collection to support the development of a hostile fire signature model for use in testing new hostile fire indicator technologies being developed by the Army and Navy; investigations into digital radio frequency memory use against threat air defense systems; assessments of next generation GPS jammers and their potential impact of US weapon systems; and translation of all source technical intelligence on a battle management and command, control, communications and computer system into a model to support test and evaluation.

These activities help DOT&amp;E carry out its Title 10 responsibilities to assess test adequacy and determine whether testing is realistic and suitable and promotes common solutions to Service threat representation needs.

Center for Countermeasures (the Center)

The Center will test, analyze, and report on more than 30 systems with emphasis on rotary wing survivability,  Counter measures (CM)/counter-countermeasures (CCMs) employment, warning and targeting systems and  precision guided weapons (PGWs).  Each program supported will receive an independent assessment of our findings and test support for CM/CCM evaluations.  The Center will continue to emphasize support of the DOT&amp;E enterprise with a clear focus on Title 10 weapons systems, aircraft survivability and hostile fire initiatives.  Additionally, a large percentage of on-going efforts will focus on aircraft survivability testing in support of current OCO.  Furthermore, the Center will continue providing CM expertise in pre-deployment events and training, as well as CM/CCM focused tactics and procedures development.  The Center will continue to develop, the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program sponsored, Towed Aerial Plume Simulator and Multi-Spectral Sea and Land Target Simulator that will be used in support of testing for both Title 10 programs and OCO aircraft survivability equipment urgent operational needs.  The Center will be developing the Threat Simulator Working Group sponsored Hostile Fire Signature model.  The Center’s support will be distributed across all the Services as well as intelligence agencies and research and development activities.
 
The Center provided expertise to many organizations and was actively involved in the following panels:  Joint Expendable Countermeasures (JECM) Integrated Product Team, Joint , Infrared Countermeasures Multi Sensing Symposia Working Group (MSS IRCM WG), Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), Foreign Material Exploitation Working Group, Foreign Material Program Test and Evaluation (T &amp; E) Subcommittee, Joint Project Mallari Working Group, Joint Countermeasures T&amp;E Working Group (JCMT&amp;E WG), and JCMT&amp;E WG Hostile Fire Indicator (HFI) subgroup lead. 

Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME)

In support of operational commanders, DoD targeteers, weaponeers, and planners, the JTCG/ME will release JMEM Weaponeering System (JWS) v2.1 in December 2011, JWS v2.1.1 in September 2012 and the Joint-Antiair Combat Effectiveness System (J-ACE) Air Superiority (AS) v5.1 in September 2012.  

JWS v2.1 will provide a major capability increase to include Fast Integrated Structural Tool (FIST), Enhanced Penetration Cratering Effeects (PCEffects), Precision Munitions Planning Tool (PMPT), Joint Smart Weapons Model (JSWM), Improved Ship Weaponeering and Estimation Tool, Mine methodology, and Hellfire weaponeering data.  JWS v2.1.1 will provide additional Combatant Command targets, other critical data and methodology fixes to warfighters.  In addition, the JTCG/ME will plan to develop releasable versions of JWS v2.1 in support of combined warfare with allies.  

J-ACE v5.1 will contain Joint Antiair Model (JAAM) v5.1 and additional Blue and Red effectiveness data (e.g., B-2, A-10, C-130H, F-18 C/E, MiG-29 Fulcrum, Su-27 Flanker, Rafale, Jian-10/F-10, MiG-19 Farmer, and F-1 Mirage) and architectural/modularity/GUI improvements.  J-ACE v5.1 will also include distribution of the SAK-MD capability introduced in J-ACE v5.0.

In support of Combatant Commands and the CJCSI 3160.01, JTCG/ME will continue to provide updates for CER values for newly fielded systems.  JTCG/ME will continue to monitor the DCiDE tool version 1.0.0 configuration management process to ensure that subsequent versions of DCiDE accurately reflect the latest JTCG/ME accredited tables; Combatant Command specified population density factors and associated user input.  The DCiDE tool will evolve to be the foundation for collateral damage estimation on JWS.

Advanced Joint Effectiveness Model (AJEM) updates will focus on supporting JTCG/ME and acquisition offices by continuing to respond to shortfalls within existing methodology and expanding to support the ongoing paradigm shift from overmatching weapons to more precise weapons.  The precision of these new weapons requires a better understanding of target response.  Specific methodology tasks will be to (i) add partial impact to prevent under-prediction of JWS lethality; (ii) develop understating of ORCA for use in JTCG/ME studies with AJEM; (iii) expand the suite of penetration methodology modules as standalone analysis tools and as plug-in for higher level codes; and (iv) improve blast data for JWS. 

JTCG/ME will continue to: (i) develop JMEM data for most critical Combatant Commander identified systems; (ii) reduce CD-ROM update cycles through incremental updates; (iii) accredit tri-Service JMEM operational tools; (iv) expand existing databases to incorporate newly fielded weapons (i.e., Air-to-Surface, Surface-to-Surface Direct/Indirect Fire, and Antiair); (v) enhance collateral damage and hardened target structure methodology; and, (vi) provide connectivity to real time planning systems assessing time sensitive targets.

                                            <r2:Text>Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E) 

In FY 2013 JT&amp;E has two projects slated for closing and an estimated four projects ongoing from FY 2011 and FY 2012.  The Joint Cyber Operations Joint Test, anticipated to close in January 2013, looks to develop, test, and evaluate tactics, techniques, and procedures to enable the joint task force commander to employ a virtual secure enclave strategy to improve defense of critical command and control services from cyber threats across the DoD Global Information Grid.  The Joint UAS Digital Information Exchange Joint Test is scheduled to close in September 2013.  

In FY 2013, the JT&amp;E Program will begin to experience the impact of its significant budget cuts.  The program will significantly digress from its business model of funding three Joint Feasibility Studies (JFS), two Joint Tests, and three Quick Reaction Tests (QRTs) annually.  FY 2013 will have no new JFS and one additional QRT funded for the year.  With no new JFS, there will not be any Joint Tests chartered in FY 2013.

As part of the Secretary of Defense FY 2012 efficiency initiatives, JT&amp;E Program’s business model was reengineered to meet the requirements of its stakeholders with the reduction in budget.  The new model reduces the life span of a project while maintaining rigorous Test and Evaluation methods to produce effective solutions to joint military operational problems.  The new business model will be implemented and refined starting in FY 2013.

Threat Systems

Threat Systems will continue integration of current intelligence community-based models into test and evaluation facilities, continue test planning working group participation to identify threat shortfalls; conduct special studies and provide current intelligence support tailored to specific U.S. weapon systems acquisition; develop Global Positioning Satellite jamming capability to increase threat realism at our test ranges, and complete the development of an ammunition and rocket propelled grenade signature model for use in hostile fire indicator systems.  Threat Systems will propose candidate threat systems from the various intelligence agencies and develop models for use in test and evaluation.  Threat Systems will investigate the integration of digital radio frequency memory technology to develop modern threat jammers.  

New initiatives for FY 2013 include implementation of M&amp;S roadmap projects to ensure threats to US and Allied infrared countermeasure systems are available for testing, development of next generation threat GPS jammers and their potential impact on US weapon systems, providing representative cyber warfare threats for testing, and identify and provide alternative test resources that represent land and sea threats.

These activities help DOT&amp;E carry out its Title 10 responsibilities to assess test adequacy and determine whether testing is realistic and suitable, and promotes common solutions to Service threat representation needs.

Center for Countermeasures (CCM)

The Center will test, analyze, and report on more than 30 electro-optical systems with special emphasis on rotary wing survivability, counter measures (CM)/counter-countermeasures (CCMs) employment, warning and targeting systems and precision guided weapons.  Each program supported will receive an independent assessment of our findings and test support for CM/CCM evaluations.  We will continue to emphasize support of the DOT&amp;E enterprise with a clear focus on Title 10 weapons systems, aircraft survivability and hostile fire initiatives.  Additionally, a large percentage of on-going efforts will focus on aircraft survivability testing in support of current OCO.  Furthermore, the Center will continue providing CM expertise in pre-deployment events and training, as well as CM/CCM focused tactics and procedures development.  The Center will continue to develop, the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program sponsored Multi-Spectral Sea and Land Target Simulator that will be used in support of testing for both Title 10 programs and OCO aircraft survivability equipment urgent operational needs.  The Center will continue to develop the Threat Simulator Working Group sponsored Hostile Fire Signature model.  Our support will be distributed across all the Services as well as intelligence agencies and research and development activities.
 
The Center will continue to be actively engaged, to include attending various conferences, with a number of organizations providing advice on CM/CMS.
