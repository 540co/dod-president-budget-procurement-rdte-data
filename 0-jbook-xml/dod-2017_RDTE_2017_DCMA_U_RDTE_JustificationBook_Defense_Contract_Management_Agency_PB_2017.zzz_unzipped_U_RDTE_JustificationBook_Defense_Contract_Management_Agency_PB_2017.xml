            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DCMA RDT&amp;E program enables several critical initiatives across the Department supporting DoD audit readiness, Better Buying Power 3.0 (BBP 3.0), NDAA and Federal Acquisition Regulation/Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR/DFAR) changes, and enabling acquisition insight that matters. DCMA uses the RDT&amp;E Appropriation to respond to the changes by utilizing existing and emerging developmental technologies that maximize the return on the appropriated investment.   These outcomes are dependent on DCMA’s ability to obtain and maintain funding consistent with the changes throughout the Department of Defense in six key areas: 1) Supply Chain and Industrial Based Analysis; 2) Contract Surveillance; 3) Contract Cost and Pricing; 4) Contract Property Shipment and Delivery; 5) Contract Entitlement and Payment; 6) Contract Modifications and Delivery Order Administration. 

The Systems Modifications and Development program develops and delivers capabilities that address needs and requirements to unique sets of problems that slow down or hinder performance-based contract management for DCMA and other DoD support components.  Projects are distributed among six IT and business Mission Area platforms: Electronic Contract Administration, Personnel Management, Collaboration, Asset &amp; Service Management, Acquisition Insight, and Access Management.  This program is utilized for both IT Enterprise Capability and DCMA Business Mission Area Systems.  It includes technology capability development, proof-of-concept demonstrations in field applications, coordination to transition from development to operational use, and testing of capability.

DCMA utilizes an agile incremental approach for system development, modernization, and sustainment which consistently allows DCMA to deploy needed systems and major business process changes leading to overall Contract Administration Services (CAS) cost savings.  Through major initiatives like Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS), Integrated Workflow Management System (IWMS), and Talent Management System (TMS) the DCMA will achieve efficiencies, improve performance, and even improve the competency of the acquisition workforce, enabling us to support congressionally-mandated, emerging missions such as Mission Assurance and Commercial Item Pricing.  Furthermore, we are invigorating our efforts to adjust to the changing environment by achieving and sustaining audit readiness, creating an agile and flexible learning organization/culture, responding to future customer programs, initiating and strengthening acquisition processes, and optimizing mission execution to support the acquisition enterprise through agile business practices.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>IWMS
DCMA replaced the Electronic Document Workflow (EDW) System with a modern Business Process Management Suite (BPMS) platform, Integrated Workflow management System (IWMS).  DCMA deployed IWMS to 7000+ users resulting in the efficient receipt and acceptance of over 500,000 DoD contracts and modifications from DLA’s Electronic Document Access System (EDA).  DCMA Integrated IWMS with a new MIL-STD 5015.2 compliant Electronic Documents Records Management System (eDRMS) and migrated 14 million contract documents from the EDW system into eDRMS.  As part of this migration, DCMA achieved a 41% reduction in the number of documents stored in DCMA’s electronic contract files.  The significant reduction in the number of stored contract documents, coupled with IWMS performance improvements, resulted in productivity gains associated with user document searches and uploads.

EVAS
In conjunction with DPAP, DCMA engaged in the Performance Assessments and Root Cause Analyses (PARCA) effort which improved the quality of analytical and predictive information by standardizing business processes and capabilities.  The Analytics and Information Management System (AIMS), now titled Earned Value Analytics System (EVAS), standardized compliance assessment methodologies, tools, processes, and technologies; established a guideline assessment wizard to ensure these attributes are examined in a repeatable process and return consistent results; implemented business intelligence, analytics, and a single data repository to improve insight into operations performance across the Acquisition enterprise; improved detection of Earned Value Management System (EVMS) non-compliance; and established a consolidated view of all compliance and performance data from the same source system.

TMS
The DCMA Talent Management System completed development on Increment 1.  The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Acquisition) previewed and endorsed the system in June of 2015. By FY-end, the system was fully tested and achieved operational readiness for a roll out in FY 2016.  

Supply Chain Risk Assessment System
DCMA rolled out new capability on the existing framework for industrial based analysis and supplier risk.

Modifications &amp; Delivery Orders
DCMA continued to make modifications in support of the Procurement Data Standard and Mass Modifications Regulations.

Other Programs
DCMA’s other programs supported WAWF modifications for industry, changes to CBAR, and the infrastructure backbone that supports multiple DCMA web capabilities.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>IWMS
Integrated Workflow Management System (IWMS) will deploy a new capability to safeguard documents from destruction by systematically placing them in a legal hold status within eDRMS.  This capability will enable DCMA to automatically purge contract documents that have exceeded their retention periods in the Agency’s National Archives &amp; Records Administration (NARA)- approved file plan, thus maintaining system performance and reducing future document storage costs.

EVAS
Continue work with DPAP on PARCA to improve the quality of analytical and predictive information by reducing direct impact to programs and fully implementing AT&amp;L BBP 3.0 tasks to DCMA: "Eliminate unproductive processes and Bureaucracy" to expand data-driven Earned Value Management Systems’ (EVMS), streamline and centralize EVM operations, and improve efficiency and consistency of EVMS implementation-providing acquisition insight that matters. 

TMS
TMS Increment 1 will be deployed to 12,000 plus DCMA users.  DCMA is currently finalizing Increment 2 requirements, and beginning development.  TMS was previously previewed and endorsed by the ASD (ACQ) as this single system replaces a proliferation of localized systems, streamlining civilian workforce career lifecycle management through integrating competency assessment and policy compliance; enhancing ability to identify, schedule, and track training and certifications; and providing robust, enterprise-wide reporting capabilities.

MOCAS
MOCAS supports the Contract Management functions of the Military services throughout DoD.  The MOCAS Joint Program Office between DCMA and DFAS is being established to address prototype technologies to achieve Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA) compliance, Procurement Instrument Identifiers (PIID) compliance, direct support of Procurement Defense Standards (PDS), the introduction of DD250 and EDI 850 error processing/enhancements, and Treasury reporting/disbursement processing that will significantly reduce DoD interest payments.

Asset and Service Management
DCMA will modernize its IT Asset and Service Management capabilities to fall in line with recent NDAA software asset and assurance changes.  In addition, the effort aligns DCMA’s Information Technology processes with systems that can execute Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) best practices.  This includes the development of configuration management capabilities to increase DCMA’s cyber security posture.

Supply Chain risk Assessment System
DCMA will be making additional modifications to provide industrial based analysis capability to DCMA and DoD.

Modifications &amp; Delivery Orders
DCMA will continue to make modifications in support of the Procurement Data Standard.

Other Programs
DCMA’s other programs supports WAWF modifications for industry and the infrastructure backbone that support multiple DCMA web capabilities.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>DCMA will continue investing in requirements, development, testing, and deployment of MOCAS, IWMS, TMS, EVAS, and the IT Asset and Service Management capabilities.  By focusing on these efforts, efficiencies gained can be reinvested to implement a line of business approach for integrating business enterprise architecture, executing requirements from Better Buying Power 3.0, and continued deployment of IT systems aimed at aligning and streamlining the identification of operational requirements against actual workload accomplishments.  Aligned spiral development will allow DCMA to provide actionable and measurable data for a more comprehensive assessment capability of operational workload requirements, workload performance gaps, and requirements analysis. The ongoing development of these systems will provide future definitive quantitative and qualitative workforce and workload measures leading to more accurate resourcing determinations.

In FY2017 MOCAS becomes a  joint program effort with DFAS moving from the requirements collection phase to the development phase, which is aimed at allowing DFAS and DCMA to achieve Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA) compliance, Procurement Instrument Identifiers (PIID) compliance, and direct support of Procurement Defense Standards (PDS). This effort will lead to significant reductions in contract interest payments across DoD.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DCMA is invigorating efforts to adjust to the changing environment through achieving and sustaining audit readiness, creating an agile and flexible learning organization/culture to support future customer programs, initiating and strengthening acquisition processes and optimizing mission execution to support the acquisition enterprise through agile business practices.  

As a part of our strategy and business practices, DCMA directly supports Better Buying Power (BBP) 3.0 initiatives, such as controlling costs throughout the product lifecycle, incentivizing productivity, and improving tradecraft in acquisition of services.  Critical among BBP initiatives are should-cost and affordability.  DCMA’s expertise in these areas has enabled unprecedented savings and cost avoidance.  In an environment of declining resources, this pricing talent will be a valuable asset in ensuring the Government only pays its fair share of company costs. 

Additionally, in pursuing these business practices we are continuing to utilize contractors to perform specialized functions such as software development and testing.  A number of mini-competitions are held with Federal Supply Schedule, Government-wide Acquisition Contracts, and DCMA Basic Purchasing Agreement Vendors.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>To deliver on our mission and vision, the Agency is focused on four primary goals:  1) inform and contribute to cost control and affordability decisions; 2) develop agile business practices which optimize mission execution and support to the acquisition enterprise; 3) create and maintain an agile learning organization and culture that strives to exceed customer expectations; and 4) expect of ourselves what we expect of our contractors:  good fiscal stewardship.  All four of the strategic goals go directly to the heart of the DCMA mission.  The Agency helps our partners spend their finite dollars wisely, ultimately ensuring the front line Warfighters get the equipment and services they need when they need them.  Adherence to executing and ultimately attaining these goals will posture DCMA to positively support current and future BBP initiatives, QDR priorities, SECDEF’s six focus areas, and the PMA including initiatives in services acquisition, innovative science and technology, and efforts to ensure greater acquisition affordability and better cost control throughout the acquisition life cycle.  Agency focus will not solely rest on qualitative contract administration functions, but will also focus on quantitative factors as well – those factors that will clearly emphasize the Agency’s return on investment (ROI) to the Department and to our other customers and the taxpayers at large.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>
