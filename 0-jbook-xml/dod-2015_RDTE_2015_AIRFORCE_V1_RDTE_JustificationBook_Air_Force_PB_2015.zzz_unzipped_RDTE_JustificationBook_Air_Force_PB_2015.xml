                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Basic research in the Physics and Electronics Project seeks to enable revolutionary advances and expand the fundamental knowledge supporting technologies critical to the future of the Air Force. Research stresses high-risk, far-term, game-changing capability breakthroughs essential for future leaps in warfighter system performance, functionality, reliability, and survivability while simultaneously reducing component and system power, size, mass, and life cycle costs. Major thrust areas being investigated in this project are complex electronics and fundamental quantum processes; plasma physics and high energy density non-equilibrium processes; and lasers and optics, electromagnetics, communication, and signal processing. Although the major thrust descriptions that follow are specific sub-areas of focus within this project, there is interest in exploring novel ideas that may bridge these major thrusts as well as those in the other projects within this program element.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The major thrust areas in the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Education and Outreach Project are to facilitate interactions between the international and domestic research communities and Air Force researchers, and to support and develop scientists and engineers with an awareness of Air Force basic research priorities. These professional interactions and collaborations benefit the Air Force by increasing awareness of Air Force basic research priorities in the research community as a whole, and attracting talented scientists and engineers to address Air Force needs. International interactions facilitate future interoperability of coalition systems and foster relationships with future coalition partners. This project also seeks to enhance interactions with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic serving institutions, and other minority institutions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports defense-related basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines relevant to maintaining U.S. military technology superiority. Research topics include, but are not limited to, transformational and high priority technologies such as nanotechnology, sensor networks, intelligence information fusion, smart materials and structures, efficient energy and power conversion, and high-energy materials for propulsion and control. The program also enhances and promotes the education of U.S. scientists and engineers in disciplines critical to maintaining, advancing, and enabling future U.S. defense technologies. For example, the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) program awards fellowships to train U.S citizens in science and engineering disciplines of military importance under a joint tri-Service and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering competition. Finally, this program assists universities in establishing superior instrumentation capabilities needed to improve the quality of defense-related research and education. A fundamental component of this program is the recognition that future technologies and technology exploitations require highly coordinated and concerted multi- and inter-disciplinary efforts. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research, because it funds basic scientific study and experimentation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports defense-related basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines relevant to maintaining U.S. military technology superiority. Research topics include, but are not limited to, transformational and high priority technologies such as nanotechnology, sensor networks, intelligence information fusion, smart materials and structures, efficient energy and power conversion, and high-energy materials for propulsion and control. The program also enhances and promotes the education of U.S. scientists and engineers in disciplines critical to maintaining, advancing, and enabling future U.S. defense technologies. For example, the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) program awards fellowships to train U.S citizens in science and engineering disciplines of military importance under a joint tri-Service and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering competition. Finally, this program assists universities in establishing superior instrumentation capabilities needed to improve the quality of defense-related research and education. A fundamental component of this program is the recognition that future technologies and technology exploitations require highly coordinated and concerted multi- and inter-disciplinary efforts. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research, because it funds basic scientific study and experimentation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Materials for protection of aircrews, sensors, and aircraft from laser and high-power microwave directed energy threats are also developed.  Electronic and optical materials are being developed to enable surveillance and situational awareness with faster operating speeds, greater tunability, higher power output, improved thermal management (including higher operating temperatures), greater sensitivity, and extended dynamic range.  New materials are being developed to counter the most prominent laser threats and to respond to emerging and agile threat wavelengths without impairing mission effectiveness. The project develops nanostructured and biological materials for aircraft structures, munitions, air vehicle subsystems, and personnel. The project develops novel materials for electromagnetic interactions with matter for electromagnetic pulse, high power microwave, and lightning strike protection.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops materials and processing technologies to support operational Air Force mission areas by providing the ability to inspect the quality of delivered systems, transitioning more reliable and maintainable materials, establishing a capability to detect and characterize performance threatening defects, characterizing materials processes and properties necessary for materials transition, and providing quick reaction support and failure analysis to the operational commands and repair centers.  Repair techniques and nondestructive inspection/evaluation (NDI/E) methods are developed that are needed for metallic and non-metallic structures, coatings, corrosion control processes, and to support integration of composite structures for aerospace systems.  Various NDI/E methods are essential to ensure optimum quality in the design and production of aircraft, propulsion, and missile systems.  These NDI/E methods are also essential to monitor and detect the onset of any service-initiated damage and/or deterioration due to aging of operational systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program investigates, develops, and analyzes aerospace vehicle technologies in the three primary areas of structures, controls, and aerodynamics for legacy and future aerospace vehicles. Advanced structures concepts are explored and developed to exploit new materials, fabrication processes, and design techniques. Flight control technologies are developed and simulated for aerospace vehicles. Advanced aerodynamic vehicle configurations are developed and analyzed through simulations, experiments, and multi-disciplinary analyses. Resulting technologies improve performance of existing and future manned and remotely piloted air vehicles, sustained high speed, and space access vehicles. Improvements include, but are not limited to, reduced energy use by efficient air platform designs, use of lightweight composite structures and improved sustainment methods based on the condition of the platform and sub-systems. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research, since it develops and determines the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary aerospace vehicle technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts applied research to advance machine intelligence, information operations, and operator-aiding technologies for advanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.  It develops and applies science and technology to detect and exploit a variety of human-centered signatures, including behavioral, nano-, bio-, and molecular aspects of existing and emerging adversaries.  Research is focused in the following areas:  human analyst augmentation, human trust and interaction, and human signatures.  The human analyst augmentation area develops, integrates, and evaluates human-centric analyst technology solutions, such as adversarial modeling and cross-cultural communication, leading to more operationally effective ISR for the Air Force.  The human trust and interaction area studies relevant human threat and vulnerability patterns in the context of everyday life and seeks to understand human interaction with autonomous systems.  The human signatures area discovers, characterizes, and integrates signature information to enable rapid and accurate human Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts applied research on the effects of human exposure to nanomaterials, electromagnetic (EM) energy (radio frequency to optical), scalable directed energy weapons, and non-lethal weapons.  This research addresses fundamental physical principles, as well as the psychophysical interaction between directed energy and the individual or groups of individuals.  Research is divided into three core focus areas:  optical radiation bioeffects; radio frequency radiation (RFR) bioeffects; and molecular bioeffects.  Optical radiation bioeffects research enhances combat survivability and systems effectiveness through technologies that enable deployed forces to counter optical threats and exploit optical systems for offensive applications.  The RFR bioeffects research investigates basic biological mechanisms of RFR, conducts theoretical and empirical dosimetry, conducts research of bioeffects from short- and long-term exposures, develops methods to counter RFR threats, and performs research for exploitation of directed energy systems for offensive capabilities.  Molecular bioeffects research is conducted to protect airmen from the effects of toxic chemicals and materials and to monitor and enhance cognitive and physiological performance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project evaluates lubricants, mechanical systems, and combustion concepts for advanced turbine engines, pulse detonation engines, and combined cycle engines. This project also develops technologies to increase turbine engine operational reliability, durability, mission flexibility, maintainability, and performance while reducing weight, fuel consumption, and cost of ownership. Applications include missiles, aircraft, and sustained high-speed vehicles. Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis include lubricants, bearings, mechanical systems diagnostics, mechanical systems prognostics, rotor dynamics, oil-less engine technology, optical diagnostics, fundamental combustion, detonations, combustors, and afterburners. Lubricants for these engines must be thermally stable, cost-effective, and operate over a broad range of conditions. Advanced combustion concepts must be cost-effective, durable, and reduce pollutant emissions. A portion of this project supports adaptive cycle technologies. This effort develops component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance/fuel efficiency for widely varying mission needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops rocket propulsion technologies for space access, space maneuver, the sustainment of strategic systems (including solid boost/missile propulsion, post boost control, aging and surveillance efforts), and tactical missiles. Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis are propellants, propellant management, combustion, rocket material applications, technology for sustainment of strategic systems, and innovative space propulsion concepts. Technologies of interest will improve reliability, performance, survivability, affordability, and environmental compatibility of these systems. Technologies are developed to reduce the weight and cost of components using new materials and improved designs and manufacturing techniques. All efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion industry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire DoD. Technologies developed under this program enable capabilities of interest to both DoD and NASA. Efforts include modeling and simulation, proof of concept tests of critical components, advanced component development, and ground-based tests. Aging and surveillance efforts could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by 50%, enabling motor replacement for cause.  All efforts are part of the Rocket Propulsion 21 (RP21) program and reviewed by a DoD level steering committee yearly for relevance to DoD missions and achievement of RP21 Goals.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This project also considers fuel related concepts that can increase turbine engine operational reliability, durability, mission flexibility, energy efficiency, and performance while reducing weight, fuel consumption, and cost of ownership. Applications include missiles, aircraft, sustained high-speed vehicles, and responsive space launch. Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis include evaluations of fuel properties and characteristics of alternative fuels developed from unconventional sources (such as coal, natural gas, biomass, and combinations thereof), unique/alternate fuels and components used in integrated thermal and energy management systems including high heat sink fuel capability, fuels logistics and associated vulnerabilities, and combustion diagnostics and engine emissions measurements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops the technology base for Air Force aerospace sensors and electronic combat.  Advances in aerospace sensors are required to increase combat effectiveness by providing anytime, anywhere surveillance, reconnaissance, precision targeting, and electronic warfare capabilities.  To achieve this progress, this program pursues simultaneous advances in:  1) generating, controlling, receiving, and processing electronic and photonic signals for radio frequency (RF) sensor aerospace applications; 2) electro-optical (EO) aerospace sensor technologies for a variety of offensive and defensive uses; 3) RF antennas and associated electronics for airborne and space surveillance, together with active and passive EO sensors; 4) technologies to manage and fuse on-board sensor information for timely, comprehensive situational awareness; and 5) technology for reliable, all-weather surveillance, reconnaissance, and precision strike RF sensors and electronic combat systems.  This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research, since it develops and determines the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary sensor, electronics, and electronic combat technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops the technologies required to perform management and fusion of sensor information for timely, comprehensive situational awareness, automatic target recognition, integrated fire control, and bomb damage assessment.  This project determines the feasibility of technologies and concepts for fire control that help to precisely locate, identify, and target airborne and surface targets.  The project emphasizes finding reduced signature targets and targets of opportunity.  It will enable new covert tactics for successful air-to-air and air-to-surface strikes.  This project also develops the technologies required to create trusted autonomic, distributed, collaborative, and self-organizing sensor systems that provide anticipatory and persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), situational awareness, and decision support for multi-layered sensing.  This program provides the technologies for:  1) trusted sensors and trusted sensor systems that will deter reverse engineering and exploitation of our critical hardware and software technology and impede unwanted technology transfer, alteration of system capability, and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems; 2) collaborative tasking of our own distributed heterogeneous sensor networks across a region and co-opted tasking of both traditional and non-traditional adversary sensors; 3) secure sensor web backbone technologies, sensor web physical topologies, and related protocols to assure reliable trusted sensor interactions; and 4) defining architectures for distributed trusted collaborative heterogeneous sensor systems and semantic sensor networks, developing new methodologies for system of systems sensor engineering and analysis, and new techniques for sensor network situation awareness and predictive analytics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and assesses affordable, reliable all weather radio frequency (RF) sensing and countermeasure concepts for aerospace applications covering the range of RF sensors including communications, navigation, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), and radar, both active and passive, across the air, land, sea, space and cyber domains.  This project also develops and evaluates technology for ISR sensors, fire control radars, electronic warfare, integrated radar and electronic warfare systems, and offensive information operations systems.  It emphasizes the detection and tracking of surface and airborne targets with RF signatures that are difficult to detect due to reduced radar cross sections, concealment and camouflage measures, severe clutter, or heavy jamming.  Techniques exploited include the use of multiple RF phenomenologies, multi-dimensional adaptive processing, advanced waveforms and knowledge-aided processing techniques.  This project also develops the RF warning and countermeasure technology for advanced electronic warfare and information operations applications. Specifically, it develops techniques and technologies to detect and counter the communications links and sensors of threat air defense systems and hostile command and control networks.  The project also exploits emerging technologies and components to provide increased capability for offensive and defensive RF sensors, including radar warning, RF electronic warfare, and electronic intelligence applications.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element focuses on four major areas.  First, space survivability and surveillance develops technologies to understand space weather and the geophysics environment for mitigation and exploitation of these effects to Air Force systems.  Second, spacecraft payload technologies improve satellite payload operations by developing advanced component and subsystem capabilities.  Third, spacecraft protection develops technologies for protecting U.S. space assets in potential hostile settings.  The last major area, spacecraft vehicles, focuses on spacecraft platform and control technologies, and their interactions.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research, since it develops and determines the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary space technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Laser research includes moderate to high power laser devices that are applicable to a wide range of applications, optical technologies to propagate lasers beams from a device, and integration of these technologies.  In SSA, this research uses the Starfire Optical Range and the Maui Space Surveillance System to develop and implement technologies to identify visual characteristics such as status and health of orbiting space objects.  In HPEM, this research examines technologies for applications such as counter-electronics and non-lethal weapons.  Research into other novel DE applications will be conducted.  DE vulnerability/lethality assessments are conducted and protection technologies are developed.  Research into other advanced non-conventional/innovative weapons will be conducted.  Tools are developed and used to compare solutions and to determine the most effective and efficient DE technologies to meet Air Force needs.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research, since it develops and determines the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops enterprise-centric information technology for the Air Force. Advances in enterprise-centric information technologies are required to increase warfighter readiness and effectiveness by providing the right information, at the right time, in the right format, anytime, anywhere in the world. The Connectivity and Protection Tech project provides the technologies for multi-level, secure, seamless networks; advanced communications processors; anti-jam and low probability of intercept techniques, as well as technologies that deter any adversary from attacking computer systems while allowing access to, presence on, manipulation of, and operational effects on adversary computer systems. This project also develops the technology base for the next generation of ultra-wide-bandwidth, multi-channeled, air- and space-based communications networks. The Information Management and Computational Tech project provides advances in information management and dissemination technologies to ensure the delivery of high-quality, timely, secure information to the warfighter, and develop technologies to produce both advanced on-demand computational processing and computer architectures with greater capacity and sophistication for addressing dynamic mission objectives under constraints imposed by Air Force systems.  The Information Decision Making Tech project develops the technology to support the commander and staff's ability to command all viable options to achieve desired effects across the full spectrum of operations. The Operational Awareness Tech project develops technologies that improve their capability to generate, process, manage, fuse, exploit, interpret, and disseminate timely and accurate information. The Research Site Support project provides the Rome Research Site infrastructure at Rome, NY and provides for the continued operations of all Rome Research Site properties, buildings, and services necessary for the research mission.  This program has been coordinated through the the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. This program is in Budget Activity 2, since it develops and demonstrates the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires technologies that enable assured, worldwide communications among all elements of the force.  These communication technologies will provide en-route and deployed reachback communications for distributed collaborative military operations. This project provides the technologies for secure, self-configuring, self-healing, seamless networks; advanced communications processors; anti-jam and low probability of intercept communications techniques; agile, dynamic policy based network management capabilities; and modular, programmable, low-cost software radios.  This project also develops both the technology base for ultra-wide bandwidth, multi-channeled air- and space-based communications networks on and between platforms.  In addition, the Air Force requires technologies to deliver a full range of options in cyberspace on par with air and space dominance in each of the areas of cyber attack, cyber defense, and cyber support to achieve the strategic capability of cyber dominance.  This project provides the technologies required to successfully deter any adversary from attacking computer systems anytime, anywhere by ensuring the Air Force's ability to: access, maintain presence on, and deliver effects to adversary systems;  detect, defend, and respond to attacks on friendly computer systems as well as provide forensic analysis concerning those attack attempts; and provide cyber situational awareness to Air Force commanders.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires the capability to maximize the value, sharing, management, and use of its information and information assets in achieving its mission objectives as the importance of information grows in the current net-centric environment.  Technology development in this project must be capable of taking advantage of future net-centric environments including new structured and ad hoc processes in response to rapidly changing warfare challenges.  Advances in robust information management focus on quality of service and flow of information within the enterprise, information transformation and brokering, secure information sharing across and among domains, and collaboration of workflow within the enterprise.  Technologies addressed in this project include the ability to globally share, discover, and access information across organizational, functional, and coalition boundaries and between and among domains, the timely delivery of information to tactical assets, the tailoring and prioritization of  information based on mission needs and importance, and the scaling, robustness, and collaboration features required of the Air Force net-centric information management environment.  In addition, the Air Force requires the development of superior, intelligent, on-demand computing to enable information superiority.  Technology development in this project focuses on producing: computer architectures with greater capacity and sophistication for addressing constrained, dynamic mission objectives; "game-changing" computing power to the warfighter; disruptive computing power at the tactical edge and for federated grid services; and interactive and real-time computing improving the usability of high-performance computing to the Air Force.  It includes technologies in computational sciences and engineering, computer architectures, and software intensive systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires technologies that improve and automate the capability to generate, process, manage, fuse, exploit, interpret, and disseminate timely and accurate information.  This project provides not only a network-centric, collaborative intelligence analysis capability that enables the fusion of multi-intelligence and sensor sources to provide timely situational awareness, understanding, and anticipation of the threats in the battlespace, but also the advanced, novel exploitation technologies needed to intercept, collect, locate, and process both covert and overt raw data from intelligence and sensor sources.  It leads the research, discovery, and development of technology that enables the fusion of multi-intelligence sources to provide accurate object tracking and identification (ID), situational awareness, understanding, and anticipation of the threats in the battlespace (air, ground, space, and cyber).  It also leads in the development of advanced exploitation technologies to maximize the intelligence gained from our adversaries in the areas of spectral detection and geolocation, signal recognition and analysis, and the data tagging, tracking, and tracing via the insertion of secure, imperceptible signal embedding for future fusion and understanding of the information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program funds Department of Defense (DoD) high energy laser (HEL) applied research through the HEL Joint Technology Office (JTO).  This program is part of an overall DoD HEL Science and Technology (S&amp;T) program.  HEL weapon systems have many potential advantages including speed-of-light delivery, precision target engagement, significant magazine depth, low-cost per kill, and reduced logistics requirements.  HELs have the potential to perform a wide variety of military missions including defeat of high-speed, maneuvering anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles and the ultra-precision negation of targets in urban environments with minimal collateral damage.  Efforts funded under this program are generally chosen for their potential to have an impact on multiple HEL systems and multiple Service missions while complimenting Service/Agency programs that are directed at specific Service needs.  A broad range of technologies are addressed in key areas such as electrically powered lasers, laser beam control, and laser lethality mechanisms.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the DoD S&amp;T Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research, since it develops and determines the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops and demonstrates materials technology for transition into Air Force systems.  The program has four projects which develop: hardened materials technologies for the protection of aircrews and sensors; non-destructive inspection and evaluation technologies; transition data on structural and non-structural materials for aerospace applications; and airbase operations technologies including deployable base infrastructure, force protection, and fire fighting capabilities. Efforts in the program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops and demonstrates technologies for existing system upgrades and/or new system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates mature Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) sustainment technologies such as: materials, corrosion, maintenance/repair techniques, state awareness/non-destructive inspection, health management, life prediction, composite certification and logistics for transition into fielded Air Force systems to reduce life cycle sustainment costs and increase readiness. Technologies matured and demonstrated impact affordability and availability of fielded aerospace weapon systems by reducing sustainment costs, extending service life, and maintaining mission readiness and capability. This project develops and demonstrates maintenance, life cycle management, and system/ fleet decision making technologies that can be implemented to address operational sustainment issues and could influence future system sustainability decisions via risk reduction to support inclusion into new systems. Studies are conducted to analyze processes and methodologies for application of technologies to address sustainment issues across the force, identifying cross cutting applications for fielded systems, and opportunities for building in sustainability into future applications. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops, demonstrates and transitions technologies for sustaining aerospace systems that have military utility and address warfighter needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Divided into two broad project areas, this program develops technologies to enable the continued superiority of sensors from aerospace platforms. The first project area develops and demonstrates advanced technologies for electro-optical sensors, radar sensors and electronic counter-countermeasures, and components and algorithms. The second project area develops and demonstrates radio frequency (RF) and electro-optical (EO) sensors for detecting, locating, and targeting airborne, fixed, and time-critical mobile ground targets obscured by natural or man-made means. Together, the projects in this program develop the means to find, fix, target, track, and engage air and ground targets anytime, anywhere, and in any weather. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops and demonstrates technologies for existing system upgrades and/or new sensor and electronic combat system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project area develops and demonstrates advanced technologies for attack management, fire control, and target identification and recognition.  This includes developing and demonstrating integrated and cooperative fire control techniques to provide for adverse-weather precision air strikes against multiple targets per pass and at maximum weapon launch ranges.  Specific fire control technologies under development include attack management, sensor fusion, automated decision aids, advanced tracking for low radar cross section threats, and targeting using both on-board and off-board sensor information.  This project area also evaluates targeting techniques to support theater missile defense efforts in surveillance and attack.  These fire control technologies will provide force multiplication and reduce warfighter exposure to hostile fire.  This project area also develops and demonstrates target identification and recognition technologies for positive, high confidence cueing, recognition, and identification of airborne and ground-based, high-value, time-critical targets at longer ranges than are currently possible.  The goal is to apply these technologies to tactical air-to-air and air-to-surface weapon systems so they are able to operate in all weather conditions, during day or night, and in high-threat, multiple target environments.  Model-based vision algorithms and target signature development techniques are the key to target identification and recognition.  This project is maturing these technologies in partnership with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and evaluating the techniques to support theater missile defense efforts in surveillance and attack.  Fire control and recognition technologies developed and demonstrated in this project area are high leverage efforts, providing for significant advancements in operational capabilities largely through software improvements readily transitionable to new and existing weapon systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In FY 2015, this program has two new projects, High Speed/Hypersonic Integration and Demonstration and Flight Systems Control.  These projects support Department of Defense (DoD) priorities for demonstrations in hypersonics and unmanned systems, respectively.

This program integrates and demonstrates advanced flight vehicle technologies that improve the performance and supportability of existing and future aerospace vehicles.  System level integration brings together aerospace vehicle technologies along with avionics, propulsion, and weapon systems for demonstration in a near- realistic operational environment. Integration and technology demonstrations reduce the risk and time required to transition technologies into operational aircraft. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. This program is in Budget activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it enables and demonstrates technologies for existing aerospace system upgrades and/or new and future aerospace system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Portions of the Aerospace Fuels, Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator, and Aerospace Propulsion Subsystems Integration projects support adaptive cycle technology demonstrations, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it enables and demonstrates technologies for existing system upgrades and/or new system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates technology to increase turbine engine operational reliability, durability, mission flexibility, and performance while reducing weight, fuel consumption, and cost of ownership. The Aerospace Propulsion Subsystems Integration (APSI) project includes demonstrator engines for manned systems and concept and efficient small-scale propulsion for remotely piloted aircraft and cruise missile applications. The demonstrator engines integrate the core (high-pressure spool) technology developed under the Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator (ATEGG) project with the engine (low-pressure spool) technology such as fans, turbines, engine controls, mechanical systems, exhaust nozzles, and augmentors. Additionally, this project includes activities to improve propulsion safety and readiness. This project also focuses on integration of inlets, nozzles, engine-to-airframe compatibility, and power and thermal management subsystems technologies. The APSI project provides aircraft with potential for longer range and higher cruise speeds with lower specific fuel consumption, surge power for successful engagements, high sortie rates with reduced maintenance, reduced life cycle cost, and improved survivability, resulting in increased mission effectiveness. Technologies developed are applicable to sustained high-speed vehicles and responsive space launch. The APSI project is focused on improving propulsion capabilities while at the same time reducing the cost of ownership. Anticipated technology advances include turbine engine improvements providing approximately twice the range for a sustained supersonic combat aircraft, doubling the time on station with ten times the power output for surveillance aircraft and propulsion for a high speed supersonic missile with double the range for time sensitive targets. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates advanced and innovative low-cost rocket turbo-machinery and components, and low-cost space launch propulsion technologies.  Additionally, this project develops technologies for the sustainment of strategic systems (including solid rocket motor boosters and missile propulsion, post boost control, and aging and surveillance efforts) and tactical rockets.  Characteristics such as environmental acceptability, affordability, reliability, responsiveness, reduced weight, and reduced operation and launch costs are emphasized.  Increased life and performance of propulsion systems are key goals.  Technology areas investigated include ground demonstrations of compact, lightweight, advanced propulsion technologies, higher efficiency energy conversion systems (derived from an improved understanding of combustion fundamentals), and high-energy propellants. Technological advances developed in this program could improve the performance of expendable payload capabilities by approximately twenty to fifty percent and reduce launch, operations, and support costs by approximately thirty percent. Responsiveness and operability of propulsion systems will be enhanced for reusable launch systems.  Aging and surveillance efforts for solid rocket motors could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by fifty percent, enabling motor replacement for cause.  The efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion industry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire Department of Defense and NASA.  The project efforts are part of the Rocket Propulsion 21 (RP21) program.  The project efforts are reviewed by a DoD level steering committee annually for relevance to DoD missions and achievement of technical goals defined by the RP21 program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates, via ground and flight tests, the scramjet propulsion cycle to a technology readiness level appropriate for full integration with other engine cycles (including turbine and rocket-based) to provide the Air Force with transformational military capabilities. The primary focus is on the hydrocarbon-fueled, scramjet engine. Multi-cycle engines will provide the propulsion systems for possible application to support aircraft and weapon platforms operating up to Mach 7.0. Efforts include scramjet flow-path optimization to enable operation over the widest possible range of Mach numbers, active combustion control to assure continuous positive thrust (even during mode transition), robust flame-holding to maintain stability through flow distortions, and maximized volume-to-surface area to minimize the thermal load imposed by the high-speed engine. Thermal management plays a vital role in scramjet and combined cycle engines, including considerations for protecting low speed propulsion systems (e.g., turbine engines) during hypersonic flight.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates technology to increase turbine engine operational reliability, durability, mission flexibility, and performance while reducing weight, fuel consumption, and cost of ownership. The objective is to provide the continued evolution of technologies into an advanced gas generator in which the performance, cost, durability, repairability, and maintainability can be assessed in a realistic engine environment. The gas generator, or core, is the basic building block of the engine and nominally consists of a compressor, a combustor, a high-pressure turbine, mechanical systems, and core subsystems. Experimental core engine demonstration validates engineering design tools and enhances rapid, low-risk transition of key engine technologies into engineering development, where they can be applied to derivative and/or new systems. These technologies are applicable to a wide range of military and commercial systems including aircraft, missiles, land combat vehicles, ships, and responsive space launch. Component technologies are demonstrated in a core (sub-engine). This project also assesses the impact of low spool components (such as inlet systems, fans, low pressure turbines, and exhaust systems) and system level technologies (such as integrated power generators and thermal management systems) on core engine performance and durability in "core-centric engine" demonstration. The core performances of this project are validated on demonstrator engines in the Aerospace Propulsion Subsystems Integration Project of this Program Element. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the development, demonstration, and evaluation of radiation-hardened space electronic hardware, satellite control hardware, and software for advanced satellite surveillance operations.  Future improved space-qualifiable electronics and software for data and signal processing will be more interchangeable, interoperable, and standardized.  In the near-term, this project's work concentrates on converting (i.e., radiation-hardening) commercial data and signal processor technologies for use in Air Force space systems.  For mid-term applications, this project merges advanced, radiation-hardened space processor, memory, and interconnect technologies with commercially-derived, open system architectures to develop and demonstrate robust, on-board processing capabilities for 21st century Department of Defense (DoD) satellites.  In the long-term, this project area focuses on developing low-cost, easily modifiable software and hardware architectures for fully autonomous constellations of intelligent satellites capable of performing all mission related functions without operator intervention.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and demonstrates tools, instruments, and mitigation techniques required to assure operation of U.S. space assets in hostile warfighting environments.  The project performs assessments of critical components and subsystems, and evaluates susceptibility and vulnerability to radio frequency (RF) and laser threats.  This project also develops technologies that mitigate identified vulnerabilities.  Technologies are developed and demonstrated to support balanced satellite protection strategies for detecting and avoiding threats and operating in a hostile space environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops and demonstrates Air Force enterprise-centric information technologies for the warfighter.  The Global Battlespace Awareness project develops, integrates, and demonstrates advanced technologies to achieve comprehensive net-centric operations and total battlespace awareness by using and exploiting information from all sources.  The Assured Worldwide Connectivity project provides advanced net-enabled architectures and communications technologies in support of global military operations, including a secure information grid for worldwide information exchange of near-real-time multimedia (i.e., voice, data, video, and imagery) information.  In addition, this project develops and demonstrates advanced optical networking and communications for Air Force air- and space-based information exchange on and between platforms.   These optical networks will be rapidly deployable, mobile, interoperable, and seamless between Air and Space Operations Centers (AOCs) and air- and space- based platforms either en route or in theater.  This project also provides tools and applications leading to the development and integration of cyber deterrence technologies resulting in a strategic capability of cyber dominance within the secure information grid.  The Knowledge Management and Computing project develops the technology applications that will provide for a secure, tailored, seamless exchange of information among producers, consumers, and managers of information relevant to a particular community of interest (COI).  The project also provides the development of interactive and real-time computing technologies that greatly improve the usability of high performance computing for the exchange, utilization, and management of information in the enterprise.  The Anticipatory Operations Intent and Response project develops the technologies for dynamic planning and execution with the accuracy, fidelity, and timeliness needed to dominate the battlespace. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops and demonstrates technologies for existing upgrades and/or new system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In order to achieve information dominance, the Air Force must be able to monitor, assess, plan, and execute missions rapidly across the full spectrum of operations (air, space, and cyberspace) at all levels of war (strategic, operational, and tactical) and during all phases of conflict (pre-conflict, conflict through stability operations).  This project develops and integrates decision support technologies that will enhance the commander's ability to anticipate and dominate the future battlespace by more effectively forecasting the evolution of the battlespace and by more rapidly generating options to "virtually checkmate" the adversary.  It develops the decision aid technologies and processes to plan the use of various assets and assess their effects in the battlespace.  It provides a tailorable information environment to effectively portray complex data sets accurately in real-time.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires advanced net-enabled architectures and communications technologies in support of global kinetic and non-kinetic military operations including a secure information grid for worldwide information delivery and exchange of near-real-time information including voice, data, video, and imagery.  This secure environment will be rapidly deployable, mobile, interoperable, and seamless between AOC and aircraft, either en route or in theater.  This project provides secure information transmission capabilities for a persistent, global, survivable communications backbone network accessible for warfighters operating in all domains. It provides self-healing, self-configuration, anti-jam communication networking capabilities, and provides enterprise networking capabilities for agile, policy-based network management.  In addition, this project develops and demonstrates flight ready systems consisting of high capacity radio frequency (RF) and optical components and architectures for next generation communications.  The Air Force also requires the ability to deliver sovereign options in cyberspace through the development and integration of cyber attack, cyber defense, and cyber support technologies for a strategic capability of cyber dominance.  This project develops the ability to deliver cyber attack capabilities (access, stealth and persistence, cyber intelligence, and weapons delivery), cyber defense capabilities (attack detection, attack attribution, and response automation), and cyber support capability (situational awareness and war gaming.)</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This project develops, integrates, and demonstrates advanced technologies to achieve comprehensive net-centric operations and Predictive Battlespace Awareness using information from all sources.  Technology development includes:  tasking information collectors, such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, national intelligence sources, etc; correlating and geo-registering the collected data; exploiting the data to extract information of military significance; fusing information from multiple sources to create a digital-and-dimensional representation of the battlespace; assessing the situation; predicting adversary COA; and archiving the results for ready use by decision-makers.  This is a dynamic, complex process that involves technologies for information exploitation, fusion, processing, storage, and retrieval, as well as technologies for machine reasoning, pattern recognition, and timeline analysis.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force requires technologies that will provide the decision maker and staff with seamless access to tailored information within a mobile, dynamic, and scalable, globally distributed AOC, as well as among other producers, consumers, and managers of information relevant to other particular communities of interest (COI).  This project demonstrates the enterprise management capabilities needed for the rapid distribution of actionable information, as well as the needed advances in high performance computing to ensure this complex capability.  This project develops an agile information environment that focuses on quality of service, transformation and brokering, a federated information environment focusing the relationship among the members of the environment, a secure cross-domain information sharing capability that focuses on the security layer and inter-COI information exchange in different security domains, and a collaboration environment focusing on the information workflow layer of the enterprise.  This project will also develop:  1) a computational science and engineering capability demonstrating new models of computation; 2) novel approaches for high performance, interactive, net-centric, distributed, and embedded computing systems; and 3) the technological tools enabling affordable, large-scale, complex, software intensive systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
