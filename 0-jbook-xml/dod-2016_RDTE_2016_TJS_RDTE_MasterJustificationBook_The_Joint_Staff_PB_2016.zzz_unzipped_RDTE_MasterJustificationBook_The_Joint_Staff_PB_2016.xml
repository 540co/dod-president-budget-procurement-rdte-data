                                        <r2:SummaryExplanation>In FY2013, the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff directed the transformation of the Joint Experimentation program to an assessment focus.  The Joint Staff no longer supports experimentation functions originally outlined in the Joint Experimentation R-2.  While JS J7 divested this piece, other portions such as concept development and wargaming were retained. The shift in focus aligns more closely with those functions under BA6 RDT&amp;E Management Support.  As a result, this line was zeroed out and the remaining requirement was realigned to Joint Staff Analytical Support, PE 0204571J, BA6.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

C4AD conducts interoperability assessments and develops solutions/recommendations to improve integration of Service, Defense Agency, and coalition systems. 

C4AD's Persistent Command and Control Environment replicates an operational environment and provides Combatant Commands, Services, Agencies and Coalition partners at the joint force headquarters level, a laboratory and assessment venue for the warfighter and capability developer to identify and solve interoperability and integration issues with current and near-term joint and coalition capabilities. With this capability, C4AD assesses system of systems interoperability, operational capability, procedural compliance and technical suitability of emerging and existing systems and programs to confirm readiness for deployment.  

By establishing ground truth for interoperability and suggesting remedies for demonstrated shortfalls, C4AD is an enabler for the Chairman’s priorities to: pioneer new ways to combine and employ emergent capabilities, drive Jointness deeper, sooner in capability development, move quickly toward Joint information and simulation networks that support secure and agile command and control, expand the envelope of interagency and international cooperation, and promote multilateral security approaches and architectures.  In FY 2016, this legacy USJFCOM PE will be consolidated along with PE 0604828J (JFIIT) and PE 0607828J (JII) into a single new Joint Staff PE 0604826J – Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Cyber Integration (JC5I). 

In FY2016 this program element will be consolidated with PE 0604826J - Joint C5 (Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Cyber) Capability Development, Integration, and Interoperability Assessments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

FY 2016 focus areas include:  Command and Control, Mission Partner Environment, and operations in Cyberspace Capability Development.  This includes the impact of technology advances in wireless devices, modem technology, and small secure digital capabilities on warfighter command and control capabilities to match emerging requirements with near-term technology solutions.  A comprehensive Joint Task Force (JTF) environment will support the integration and operational assessment process and support cyber training, capability development and assessments, separately and in coordination with the Department of Defense Cyber Range Environment (DECRE). This is achieved by maintaining a persistent C5 laboratory environment that allows for a rapidly reconfigurable joint, coalition, and inter-agency interoperability assessments, including participation in the Coalition Interoperability and Assurance Validation (CIAV) which supports on-going war efforts.  In a live setting, a deployable capability allows for range instrumentation and both the collection and analysis of decision quality data for cyber and command and control operations. This objective, joint analysis provides the data and analysis from which Director, Operational Testing and Evaluation decisions are made.</r2:Text>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The JFIIT mission is to employ scientific methods to research, investigate, test, assess, and evaluate current and emergent Joint command and control (C2) information systems and associated procedures. These activities measure capabilities and limitations, identify shortfalls and root cause, recommend and verify solutions, and validate joint capabilities. The resultant empirical outcomes influence Joint Capability development in areas such as Policy; Joint Doctrine; Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP); integration and interoperability of capabilities. JDAT provides decision-quality data and cogent solutions to customers and stakeholders responsible for improving Joint C2 information systems integration and interoperability, informing acquisition decisions, and ensuring that Services and Agencies field integrated and interoperable systems.  The emphasis of JFIIT efforts is the analysis of C2 information systems and supporting procedures to provide Services and Agencies findings and recommendations based on quantifiable data to improve Joint C2 integration and interoperability. Evaluations range from small, single-focus events to large, multi-event/venue exercises.  In FY 2016, this legacy USJFCOM PE will be consolidated along with PE 0604787J (JSIC) and PE 0607828J (JII) into a single new Joint Staff PE 0604826J – Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Cyber Integration (JC5I).

In FY2016 this program element will be consolidated with PE 0604826J - Joint C5 (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Cyber) Capability Development, Integration, and Interoperability Assessments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

JSAS encompasses the developmental tools and infrastructure required to conduct analyses and formulates the results to best assist the Chairman in fulfilling his statutory responsibilities.   Under the umbrella of analytical support tools are the Automated Global Force Management Tool (AGT) and the Collaborative Issue Resolution Tool (CIRT), both which will meet requirements set forth in Title 10 U.S.C. and the Unified Command Plan (UCP) for automating the Global Force Management Implementation Guidance Forces For (Assignment and Apportionment) tables.  Additionally, the Joint Organizational Server (JOS) will be the enabler system for Joint Staff personnel to be entered, near-real-time, into the automated Forces For Process.

The development of the Secretary of Defense's "Forces for Unified Commands" Memorandum Assignment Tables has historically been a labor intensive staffing process conducted annually.  The automated GFM Toolset is the first downstream consumer of force structure data resident in the seven organization (org) servers that are made available by the GFM Data Initiative (DI) effort.  CIRT has streamlined force management, increased common understanding of force assignment, and supported timely force management decisions.  The objective is to automate the generation of the Global Force Management Implementation Guidance (GFMIG) and Forces For Unified Commands (Forces For) Assignment, Apportionment, and Allocation tables.  These efforts will flatten, streamline, and automate the current process while providing high fidelity data and transparency, and enhance Combatant Commander risk assessment to operational plans.  The Joint Organizational Server (JOS) will be the enabler system for Joint Staff personnel to be entered, near-real-time, into the automated Forces For Process.  Failure to fund for this effort negatively impacts the ability of the Services, CCMDs, Joint Staff (JS) and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to efficiently manage force structure resources.</r2:Description>

                                                <r2:PerformanceMetrics>RDT&amp;E development efforts are evaluated based on the performance metrics.  This ensures the JIOR capacity and capability development funding is synchronized against prioritized training and testing requirements, based on designs derived and tested against synchronized requirements, and result in deployed capabilities that are within the enterprise’s capacity to deliver.  Performance metrics include, but are not limited to; cost, time, relevancy, and analytics and as defined below:
• Cost – Does the effort enable the most cost effective cyber training?
• Time – Will the effort enable trainers/ testers to more quickly create and synchronize testing, and more rapidly plan and execute cyber training and test events?
• Relevance – Will the effort enable cyber mission forces certification and re-certification, and training?  Does the capability enable cyber range practitioners to more rapidly reconfigure networks?  Does the capability increase range availability to conduct relevant training based upon realistic design of cyber environments? 
• Analytics – Will the effort enable cyber practitioners to better assess how well individuals, staff and/or units operate under cyber-induced degraded, denied or compromised network conditions?

Measures:
(1) Meet capacity needs to train and certify Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) teams through FY2016.
(2) Complete all planned lifecycle modernization upgrades for FY2016.
