                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) evaluates materials for lighter weight and more survivable armor and for more lethal armaments.  Project H7G researches and explores nanostructure materials properties and exploits the strength and durability of these materials to enable lighter weight, increased performance in Soldier weapons and protection applications.  Project H84, researches a variety of materials and designs, fabricates and evaluates performance of components for lighter weight Soldier and vehicle armors, armaments, and electronics.

Work in this PE builds on the materials research transitioned from PE 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences), project H42 (Materials and Mechanics) and PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), project J12 (Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies).  This work complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology), PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology), and PE 0708045A (Manufacturing Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work is performed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD and Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project designs, investigates and evaluates advanced sensor components, signal processing, and information fusion algorithms that will provide the future Soldier decisive new capabilities to locate, identify, decide and engage battlefield targets in tactical environments.  The ultimate impact and utility of this work will be to greatly increase the lethality, range, and speed of engagement of the Soldier.  Emphasis is on solving critical Army-specific battlefield sensing and information management problems such as false targets, complex terrain (including urban applications), movement of sensors on military vehicles, and exploitation of multimodal sensors.  Significant areas of research include: low cost sensors designed to be employed in large numbers of networked sensors for force protection, hostile fire defeat, homeland defense, counter terrorism operations, and munitions; fusion of disparate sensors such as non-imaging acoustic, seismic, electric-field (E-field), magnetic, radar; imaging infrared (IR), forward looking IR (FLIR), laser detection and ranging (LADAR), visible imagers; low cost acoustic, seismic, and magnetic sensors that can passively detect, classify, and track battlefield targets such as personnel, heavy/light vehicles, and helicopters.  Other areas of research include sensing technologies for tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) non-traditional targets as well as the location of direct and indirect fires and other hostile threats.  Further areas of research include ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronics for battlefield sensors, networked compact radar for vehicle and dismount identification and tracking; ultra wideband radar for buried and concealed threat detection, enhanced robotic mobility, stand-off characterization of infrastructure; and the detection, classification, and tracking of humans in urban terrain.  Additional areas of research are aided/automatic target recognition (ATR) allowing sensors to autonomously locate and identify targets; advanced battlefield sensor and information processing to conduct a dynamic and real time situational assessment to present a common picture of the battlespace focused on low echelon commanders; protection of sensors (including Soldier's eyes) from battlefield laser threats; and advanced information processing methods to provide automatic information technologies that utilize widely dispersed sensor and legacy information sources.

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command Control and Communications, Ground and Soldier portfolios.  The work in this project complements efforts funded in PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technologies), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology).

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) designs and validates electronic warfare (EW) components that deny, disrupt, or degrade the enemy's use of the electromagnetic spectrum for offensive or defensive operations. This is accomplished through the investigation of electronic support measures (ESM); countermeasures against communications systems and networks; the design and fabrication of sensors used to identify and locate threat forces in an asymmetric environment; and threat warning and electronic countermeasures (ECM) against munitions sensors, missile guidance systems, targeting systems, and booby traps. Project 906 supports protection of high-value ground platforms, aircraft and the Soldier from threat surveillance and tracking systems, imaging systems, and advanced radio frequency (RF)/electro-optical (EO)/infrared (IR) missiles, artillery, and smart munitions. Information fusion research addresses sensor correlation and fusion, relationship discovery, and management services through use of automated processing, as well as software that applies higher level reasoning techniques to support automated combat assessment. Project 906 also supports research and application of key EW sensors, direction finders and jammers to intercept, locate, and disrupt current and emerging communications and non-communications threat emitters to provide vital quality combat information directly to users in a timely and actionable manner. Specifically, it focuses on detection of threat sensors and emitters associated with weapon systems, targeting systems and command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems and networks. 

Work in this PE is complimentary of PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology); and fully coordinated with PE 0603008A (Command, Control, Communications Advanced Technology) and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work is performed by the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC),  Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project designs, fabricates, evaluates, and applies key electronic warfare (EW)/information operations technologies to enhance platform survivability (to include ground combat vehicles, aircraft, and the dismounted Soldier) and to intercept, track and locate current and emerging threat munitions, communications and non-communications threat emitters. This project applies recent advances in radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR), and electro-optical (EO) sensors and jamming sources to detect, locate, deceive, and jam threats (to include radar directed target acquisition systems, target-tracking sensors, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), air-to-air missiles (AAMs), top attack weapons, and electronically fuzed munitions). This project also pursues the ability to neutralize booby traps. This project designs information systems to provide vital, quality combat information directly to users in a timely, actionable manner in accordance with concepts for future force intelligence operations. This project investigates RF collection and mapping technologies to offer real time emitter detection, location, and identification. In addition, this project enables a remote capability to disrupt, deny, or destroy threat communication signals and enables fusion (automated assimilation and synthesis) of battlefield intelligence data to enable interpretation of current threats and future enemy activities. This allows commanders to develop operational courses of action in time to act decisively and in a pre-emptive manner.

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Ground Maneuver, Soldier/Squad and Air portfolios.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this project is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates and develops advanced technologies for High Energy Laser (HEL) weapon systems to enable more efficient lasers with greater power output. This includes technologies to support development of alternate laser sources, precision optical pointing and tracking components, adaptive optics to overcome laser degradation due to atmospheric effects, and thermal management systems to remove excess heat.  In addition, this effort conducts laser lethality demonstrations and analysis against a variety of targets and investigates the impact of low-cost laser countermeasures.  Solid State Laser (SSL) efforts continue to leverage other funds provided by the HEL Joint Technology Office (JTO), the Air Force, and the Navy to develop multiple technical approaches that reduce program risk and maintain competition.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the research, development, and evaluation of high-power electronic components, materials, and related technologies.  These technologies have application in compact and efficient power conversion, conditioning, and management sub-systems; energy storage and conversion devices; radio frequency (RF)/microwave and solid-state laser directed energy weapons (DEW); and traditional and non-traditional RF and laser electronic attack. All project elements are coordinated with and, as appropriate, leveraged by DEW and power/energy programs in the Air Force, Navy, High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, national labs, university consortia, and relevant industry and foreign partners.   The products of this research are required by developers of Army (DoD) systems to evolve traditional (mechanical-based) sub-systems such as geared transmissions, plate armor, and kinetic projectiles to electrically-based ones.  These products will provide the Soldier enhanced survivability and lethality through increased power management and energy savings as well as new fighting capabilities offered only by electrical power.

This project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground and Soldier portfolio.

The work in this project is coordinated with the U.S. Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC); Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC); the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC); and the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC).  These efforts were previously funded in PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work on this project is performed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) conducts applied research and investigates core night vision and electronic sensor components and software to improve the Army's capability to operate in all battlefield conditions. Technologies pursued in this PE have the potential to provide the Army with new, or enhanced, capabilities to detect and identify targets farther on the battlefield, operate in obscured conditions, and maintain a higher degree of situational awareness (SA). Project H95 advances infrared (IR) Focal Plane Array (FPA) technologies, assesses and evaluates sensor materials, designs advanced multi-function lasers for designation and range finding, and develops modeling and simulation for validating advanced sensor technologies. In FY11 through FY16 the Army investment in advanced IR FPA technologies is augmented to ensure a world-wide technological and competitive IR sensor advantage for the United States. 

Work in this PE is fully coordinated with PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), PE 0602712A (Countermine Technology) and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. 

Work in this PE is performed by the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC)/Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, VA.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts applied research and develops component technologies that enable improved Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition (RSTA) and situational awareness (SA) at an affordable price. Component technologies include novel focal plane arrays (FPAs), processing and electronics improvements, and modeling and simulation to predict performance and to determine operational effectiveness. This research focuses on dual band infrared (IR) FPAs necessary to search, identify and track mobile targets in all day/night visibility and battlefield conditions and to improve standoff detection in ground-to-ground and air-to-ground operations. This project designs, fabricates and validates very large format IR FPAs needed for sensors to simultaneously provide wide area coverage and the high resolution for situational awareness, persistent surveillance and plume/gunflash detection. In addition this project develops multispectral and hyperspectral algorithms for on-chip hyperspectral functionality, which offer the ability to perform detection, identification and signature identification at extended ranges as well as the ability to detect targets in "deep hide". Reducing size, weight and power (SWaP) is a key research objective for all efforts. In FY11 through FY16 the Army investment in advanced IR FPA technologies is augmented to ensure a world-wide technological and competitive IR sensor advantage for the United States. 

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Soldier, Ground and Air portfolios.  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. 

Work in this PE is performed by the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC)/Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, VA.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This effort investigates and designs new Digital Readout Integrated Circuit (DROIC) technology (digital-in-pixel) enabling the affordable very large format and multiband IR FPAs. The digital-in-pixel results in increased signal storage available to collect incoming signal information from the scene, compared to traditional analog techniques. DROIC is an important component in reducing the overall IR sensor cost and SWaP by allowing much smaller FPA pitch. The increased storage improves dynamic range for targeting, situational awareness and persistent surveillance applications.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) investigates, designs, and evaluates technologies to improve countermine, signature management and counter-sensors capabilities. The focus is on sensor components, sub-components and software algorithms to improve detection of mines, explosive threats and directed energy; ballistic methods to defeat mines and explosive threats; and signature management technologies to reduce reconnaissance capabilities of the enemies. This PE also supports DoD's Center of Excellence for Unexploded Ordnance, which coordinates and standardizes land mine signature models, maintains a catalogue of mine signatures, supports the evaluation of mine detection sensors and algorithms, and working in conjunction with the US Army Engineer, Research and Development Center (ERDC), examines countermine phenomenology of surface and buried mines, and explosive threats. Project H24 advances state of the art Countermine technologies to accurately detect threats with a high probability, reduce false alarms, and enable an increased operational tempo. Project H35 evaluates and develops advanced signature management and deception techniques for masking friendly force capabilities and intentions.  

Work in this PE is related to and fully coordinated with PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602622A (Chemical, Smoke and Equipment Defeating Technology), PE 0602624A (Weapons and Munitions Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology).

                                    <r2:Description>Novel technologies and their implementation in Army systems may result in demands on Soldiers that exceed their knowledge, skill, or memory capacity.  When demands cannot be remediated by human systems integration, training may enable the demands to be met.  This effort will identify human operator tasks in complex, intelligent, and emerging systems critical to mission employment of new technologies.  The aspects (particularly knowledge and skill) of those tasks will be determined through experimentation and analysis to inform development of training and simulation technologies, fundamental research on the effectiveness of training regimes, and simultaneous task combinations that must be trained.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) investigates and evaluates enabling tools and methodologies that support the long-term sustainment of Army training and testing activities.  Specific focus is on maintaining regulatory compliance while limiting future Army liability in operations and training, and maintaining resilient and adaptive ranges. Project 048 improves the Army's ability to comply with requirements mandated by federal, state and local environmental/health laws and reducing the cost of this compliance. Project 835 develops enabling technologies for advanced life cycle analysis, advanced sensing, and advanced remediation of Army unique hazardous and toxic wastes at sites containing waste ammunition, explosives, heavy metals, propellants, smokes, chemical munitions, and other organic contaminants. Project 895 focuses on reducing hazardous waste generation through process modification and control, materials recycling and substitution and developing technologies to predict and mitigate range and maneuver constraints associated with current and emerging weapon systems, doctrine, and regulations.  Project 896 investigates technologies for ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, monitoring, modeling and mitigation to support sustainable use of Army lands and airspace to reduce or eliminate environmental constraints to military missions.   

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  

Technologies developed in this PE are transitioned to PE 0603728A (Environmental Quality Technology Demonstrations).  

Work in this PE is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project designs and develops tools and methods to enable the Army to reduce or eliminate environmental impacts both in the United States and abroad.  These technologies reduce the impact of legal and regulatory environmental restrictions on installation facilities, training and testing lands and ranges, as well as provide a means to avoid fines and facility shutdowns within the United States and reduce environmental impacts to the Warfighter abroad.  New and innovative technologies are essential for the effective control and reduction of military unique hazardous and non-hazardous wastes on military installations and associated with contingency operations bases worldwide.  Efforts focus on the impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond.  This project focuses on developing sustainable environmental protection technologies that help the Army maintain environmental compliance for sources of pollution such as production facilities, facility contamination and other waste streams.  Efforts abroad include a focus on designing and developing technologies for deployed forces with environmentally safe, operationally enhanced and cost effective technologies and/or processes to achieve maximum diversion, minimization, or volume reduction of base camp and field waste.  This project focuses on Army-unique ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, modeling, adaptation and mitigation technologies for installations associated with air quality and endangered species management and their impacts on training and testing mission.

The work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates a quantitative means to determine the environmental effects resulting from exposure to Army-unique explosives, propellants, smokes and products containing nanomaterials and new and emerging compounds and materials across the Army training and operations. This research provides the basis for tools and methods to respond to regulatory constraints, and to protect the health of the Soldier and the extended Army community. Results of this research will be integrated into the life cycle analysis of all new Army materials and chemicals. The specific results of this research include: determination of acceptable contaminant concentration levels for residual Army-unique chemicals and materials of concern that minimize adverse effects on the environment and human health. This includes development of methods that guide the design of nanomaterials and other new and emerging materials such that adverse effects on the environment are minimized in their designed state and when they enter the environment where they may break down. Example areas of research include genomics analysis, cutting edge nanomaterial analysis, and computational/molecular modeling.  Interim projects are used by PEO Ammo and IEW&amp;S for use in life cycle analysis, risk assessment, and cleanup. Interim products are also US Environmental Protection Agency approved criteria documents to be used in risk assessment procedures and establishing regulatory limits. The Army uses these criteria during negotiations with regulatory officials to set scientifically and economically appropriate cleanup and discharge limits on Army lands.

This project researches and develops revolutionary technologies to eliminate or significantly reduce the environmental impacts that threaten the sustainment of production and maintenance facilities, training ranges and operational areas. The project supports the transformation of the Army by ensuring that advanced energetic materials required for high-performance munitions (gun, rocket, missile propulsion systems, and warhead explosives) are devised to meet weapons lethality/survivability stretch goals in parallel with, and in compliance to, foreseeable sustainment requirements. Specific technology thrusts include environmentally-benign explosives developed with computer modeling using Department of Defense high-performance computing resources; novel energetics that capitalize on the unique behavior of nano-scale structures; chemically engineered explosive and propellant formulations produced with minimal environmental waste, long-storage lifetime, rapid/benign environmental degradation properties, and efficient extraction and reuse; and fuses, pyrotechnics, and initiators that are free from toxic chemicals. Other focus areas include base camp energy reduction initiatives, elimination of waste streams in contingency operations and toxic metal reductions from surface finishing processes. 

Work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project designs and develops tools and identification and assesment methodologies for ecosystem vulnerability assessment, analysis, monitoring, modeling and mitigation to support sustainable use of Army facilities, training lands, firing ranges and airspace to reduce or eliminate environmental constraints to military missions.  This project provides the Army the technical capability to manage, protect and improve the biophysical characteristics of training and testing areas needed for realistic and sustainable ranges and training lands.  Technologies within this project enable users to match mission events and training schedules with the resource capabilities of specific land areas and understand how the use of those resources effect mission support and environmental compliance.  The project investigates, designs, and develops novel methods and technologies to adapt and restore lands damaged during training activities and allow sustained use of Army resources.  The project supports readiness and full use of training lands through development of invasive, threatened, and endangered species monitoring technology and management technologies for species at risk.  The project also designs and develops tools and technologies to avoid training restrictions and reduce constraints on training lands associated with potential impacts from climate change. 

Work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.

This project focuses development in wireless transport (e.g. mobile radio based communications systems) to develop new techniques for improving communications in high radio frequency (RF) interference environments and to increase the communications capacity of terrestrial and satellite communications (SATCOM) systems. This project also investigates enabling antenna components, materials, designs and configurations to reduce the visual signature of antennas on Soldier, vehicular and airborne platforms and reduce co-site interference on platforms with multiple transceivers such as radios and jammers. Additionally this project investigates cyber security devices, software and techniques to harden narrow band, wireless communications networks against cyber attacks; new mobile networking protocols to make wireless, on-the-move (OTM) communications networks more responsive to user needs. This project also investigates network operations software and techniques that improve the ability of the Soldier to manage and maintain complex, dynamic networks; and improved spectrum management software tools to make more efficient use of over-subscribed RF spectrum.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) investigates, evaluates, and advances technologies, techniques and tools for depiction and representation of the physical and human environment for use in military planning and operations; for characterizing geospatial, atmospheric and weather conditions and impacts on systems and military missions; for conducting mobility, counter-mobility, survivability and force protection; and for enabling secure, sustainable, energy efficient facilities.  Research focuses on special requirements for battlefield visualization, tactical decision aids, weather intelligence products, and capabilities to exploit space assets.  Project 855 conducts geospatial research and development supporting a standard sharable geospatial foundation enabling a common operating environment across mission and command systems. Project H71 supports the materiel development, testing, and operations communities in evaluating the impacts of weather and atmospheric obscurants on military materiel and operations. Project T40 advances technologies for adaptive and expedient force protection across the range of military operations (includes Deployable Force Protection).  This project also designs and evaluates software and hardware to identify and mitigate positive and negative ground obstacles; characterizes austere navigation environments and designs/evaluates materiel solutions including rapidly emplacable bridging, ground stabilization and breakwater structures; and builds and uses modeling and simulation tools to advance understanding of the interactions of weapons/munitions and novel defeat methodologies with buildings, shelters, bunkers, berms and bridges.  Project T41 investigates and evaluates application of technologies to enable garrison/post commanders to plan, monitor and operate facilities more efficiently, cost-effectively, securely and sustainably; and creates tools (including advanced models and simulation) that provide a framework for making trades and decisions, and also supports research to evaluate non-combat population characteristics and status from social and cultural perspectives to achieve mission objectives.  Project T42 develops and validates models and simulations to understand the impacts of the physical environment on the performance of forces, ground and air vehicles, and sensors; as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on military operations.  Project T45 investigates and evaluates materials, components and systems that have potential to reduce energy losses in buildings and shelters; and potential to detect and mitigate consequences of contaminants such as bacteria and molds in air handling equipment and building materials.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates and advances capabilities for collection, processing, and creation of data and information depicting physical and human terrain, environmental conditions, and relationships in time and space; for digital map creation, transmission, and dissemination; and for map-based analytics for planning, decision making and execution.  This project uses non-traditional methods that exploit existing open source text, multi-media and cartographic materials addressing social, cultural and economic geography to advance the capability to produce and transmit high fidelity digital maps depicting the physical terrain, human terrain and environmental conditions. This project also develops software tools and methods for map-based analytics that allow deeper insights into the effects of the physical terrain, human terrain and environmental conditions on military operations, to include tactics and effects upon equipment and Soldier's performance.  This project explores and advances components and methods that optimize the utility of the Army Geospatial Enterprise (AGE) to the total Army which provides map and geospatial data, information, and software services to the total force.

Work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) Portfolio.

                                    <r2:Description>This effort develops means to collect, process, and visualize very high-fidelity data and information to capture the dynamic effects of the physical and human terrain impacting military ground operations.  The research focuses on tactical, rather than national or commercial, remote sensing of physical terrain to achieve the fidelity required for current and future operations.  Research includes methods for radical, effective sensor systems and materials to 'tag' features, items and people of interest; these capabilities are based upon novel and emerging light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor systems and an array of other sensor systems for intermittent and persistent optimal data collection, object identification, and classification for ground operations.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops tactical weather and atmospheric effects/impacts algorithms for their integration into battlefield information products.  Efforts include high-resolution, local assessments and forecasts of meteorological conditions in near real time including effects of urban and mountainous terrain; analytical tools to assess the impact of the atmosphere to optimize system performance and operations planning and advanced atmospheric sensing applications to characterize and mitigate wind and turbulence in complex terrain.  It provides detailed model applications for various effects of the atmosphere on electro-optical and acoustic target detection, location, and identification.  This project develops both physics-based decision aids and rule-based decision support systems for assessing the impacts of weather/atmosphere across a spectrum of friendly and threat weapons systems, sensors, platforms, and operations.  Information can be applied to mission planning and execution, battlefield visualization, reconnaissance surveillance and target acquisition, route planning to maximize stealth and efficiency, web enabled tactical decision aids, and also modeling of environmental impacts for combat simulations and war games.  

This project supports the Army S&amp;T Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) Portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates, evaluates, and creates technologies for adaptive and expedient force protection across the range of military operations; for force projection and maneuver, including austere port entry and overcoming battlespace gaps (such as cliffs, ravines, mudflats, shallow rivers, and other natural obstacles) through prediction, definition, avoidance, or defeat of the gaps; for scalable weapons effects; and for high-resolution representation of near-surface terrain and environment for use with sensor models for things such as target detection and unmanned ground systems (UGS) navigation.  This research further provides physics-based representations of ground vehicle mobility, obstacle and barrier placement, survivability, and weapons effects in complex and urban terrain modeling and simulation.  Work in this project increases the survivability of critical assets from conventional, unconventional, and emerging weapons attacks and enables  maneuver support of deployed forces, while reducing their logistical footprint. This project supports Deployable force protection (DFP) efforts for overcoming critical capability gaps for protecting troops operating at smaller bases that are remote or integrated in with local communities.      

Work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Ground, and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I), and Soldier Portfolios.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this project is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS. Deployable force protection activities are coordinated with research, development and engineering centers and laboratories across the US Army, Navy and Air Force.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This effort researches, designs, and creates rapidly deployable detection, assessment, passive protection and active defensive technology-enabled capabilities to meet critical capability gaps for troops operating remotely at smaller bases or integrated with local communities. The needs at these smaller bases (less than 300 persons, not all U.S. troops) are unique based on constraints in transportability, manpower, organic resources, lack of hardening of structures, resupply, and training for example. Moreover, lack of interoperability and scalability consume manpower and take away from time needed to perform missions. Threats include bases being overrun by hostiles; direct fire; rockets, artillery and mortars; and improvised explosive devices. Force protection challenges at these remote, smaller bases include providing increased standoff detection, blast and ballistic protection, and kinetic technologies subject to the constraints mentioned above.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates and evaluates technologies and techniques to ensure sustainable, cost efficient and effective facilities and to achieve resilient and sustainable installation and base operations.  The project focuses on facilities and operations technologies directly supporting training, readiness, force projection, force protection, homeland security, and forward base operations.  Facility enhancement technologies contribute to cost reductions in the Army facility life cycle process (infrastructure planning, assessment, design, construction, revitalization, sustainment, and disposal), and the supporting installation operations.  This work improves the ability of installations to support forces to meet transformation goals, improves designs for close battle training facilities, and enhances security of Soldiers, families, and civilians.  Technologies evolving from this work include integrated planning and design tools for US facilities and forward bases, models predicting water dispersed contaminant effects on facilities and occupants; sustainable facility and base management; collaborative decision support tools; and advanced materials.  In addition, technologies from this work will support analysis of socio-cultural and facility issues in forward base operations, including urban environments.  

Work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) Portfolios.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates and advances technologies to characterize and respond to impacts of the terrestrial environment on the performance of emerging and deployed Army systems, as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on all phases of unified land operations.  Research efforts model the dynamics of electromagnetic, acoustic, and seismic propagation in response to changing terrain state and complex terrain features and geometry and their depiction in geospatial information and mission command systems.  Numerical modeling of terrain properties as impacted by weather supports intelligence preparation of the battlefield products including mobility estimates and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance planning. This effort integrates terrain knowledge and weather forecast in a mission context to provide geospatial information and mission command delivered solutions to the Soldier.  The understanding gained and products developed improve the ability to predict signature (emitter) behavior and sensor performance in complex operational environments, and support materiel development, sensor performance products for tactical decision-making, and visualization for mission command.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) conducts applied behavioral and social science research that provides non-materiel solutions to ensure that Soldiers can adapt and excel and improve the Army's capability to fully leverage advances in networks, systems, and technologies as they evolve. This research provides the scientific basis to recruit, select, assign, promote, educate, train, and retain Soldiers and leaders that comprise a ready and relevant Landpower capability.  The human science applied research conducted in this program element provides knowledge-products, methods, techniques, and tools that will enable the Army to: select Soldiers who are predicted to perform well in future jobs; assign Soldiers to Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) and jobs that better match their skills and abilities; retain an effective career force through improved strategies and behavioral incentives to influence Soldiers to stay in the Army for longer periods of time; accelerate the development of leader critical thinking and interpersonal skills through virtual practice so that junior leaders are more adaptable and prepared for uncertain, rapidly changing missions; develop innovative training strategies for complex battle command skills in network-enabled environments; and design training tools for dismounted squad leadership and team maneuver with ground Soldier systems technologies.  Additional research is focused on training techniques and procedures that make it easier for trainers and training developers to rapidly respond to changes in mission or operational requirements and provide a more synergistic training and education process (e.g., automated and improved diagnostics, coaching and mentoring, performance measures, and feedback methods.

Work in this PE complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0603007A (Manpower/Personnel/Training Technology.)

The cited work is consistent with the Director, Defense Research and Engineering Strategic Plan, the Army Modernization Strategy, and the Army Science and Technology Master Plan.

This project is managed by the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI), Arlington, VA.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element (PE) conducts applied behavioral and social science research to enhance the Soldier Lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, leader development) and human relations (e.g., culture of dignity, respect, and inclusion). These technologies provide advanced personnel measures that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective training and mentoring methods to ensure Soldiers, leaders, and units have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to sustain positive unit climates and meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE evaluates new selection measures, refines performance metrics, assesses innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs.  Research in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.

Efforts in this program element support the Army Science and Technology Soldier portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Human Capital Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project investigates and evaluates components and materials focused on enhancing Soldier survivability from combat threats (flame and thermal threats, blast and ballistic threats, and lasers) and environmental threats (e.g., cold, heat, wet) to increase operational effectiveness while decreasing the Soldier's physical and cognitive burden. Included are technologies and novel materials related to personnel armor, helmets, hearing protection, and eyewear. In addition, this project supports the development and refinement of essential analytic tools needed to predict and/or assess the combat effectiveness of next generation Soldier systems with a focus on human science investigation to identify and develop methods to assess human responses to sensory, physical, cognitive, and affective stimuli and stressors.

Efforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) supports application of knowledge gained through basic research to refine drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, medical practices/procedures, and other preventive measures essential to the protection and sustainment of Warfighter health. Research is conducted in five principal areas: Combat Casualty Care; Military Operational Medicine; Military Relevant Infectious Diseases Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine; and Systems Biology/Network Sciences. Research is funded in six projects.  

Project 869 refines knowledge and technologies on screening tools and preventive measures for post-traumatic stress disorder and mild traumatic brain injuries, physiological monitors, and interventions to protect Soldiers from injuries resulting from operational stress, and exposure to hazardous environments and materials. Also conducts research on medically valid testing devices and predictive models used for the refinement of Soldier protective equipment. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.  

Project 870 designs and refines medical diagnostic devices, drugs, and vaccines for protection and treatment against naturally occurring diseases and wound infections of military importance, as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.  

Project 873 conducts research on HIV, which causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Work in this area includes refining improved identification methods to determine genetic diversity of the virus, preclinical work in laboratory animals including non-human primates to identify candidates for future vaccine refinement, and evaluating and preparing overseas sites for future vaccine trials. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program, (DHP). This effort and associated funding was transferred to DHP starting FY14.

Project 874 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics (products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and diagnostics for resuscitation, life support, and post-evacuation restorative and rehabilitative care, as well as trauma care systems for use by field medics and surgeons. Research focus is on identifying more effective critical care technologies and protocols to treat severe bleeding, traumatic brain injury and other blast related injuries, and treatments for ocular injury and visual system dysfunction, as well as laboratory and animal studies of regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, and bone tissue for the care and treatment of battle-injured casualties. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. 

Project FH2 conducts applied research directed toward the sustainment of a healthy force of Warfighters through the entire deployment life cycle.  

Project VB4 conducts applied research in systems biology to provide a highly effective mechanism to integrate iterative biological tests, computer simulations, and animal studies.  Such refinement efforts using systems biology could ultimately reduce the time and effort invested in medical product refinement. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.

Project VJ4 examines the mental and behavioral health of Soldiers to counter suicidal behavior. This work focuses on advancing the understanding of the multiple determinants of suicidal behavior, psychopathology (study of the causes and nature of abnormal behavior), psychological resilience, and role functioning. Work on this project is being performed by the National Institute of Mental Health through extramural cooperative research grants in collaboration with the Department of the Army. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

All medical applied research is conducted in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA requires thorough testing in animals (referred to as preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon transition to 6.3 Advanced Technology Development). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and assay refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves preclinical testing in animals. The EPA also requires thorough testing of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for use.

Program refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee. The ASBREM Committee serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses (DoD) biomedical research and refinement community, as well as their associated enabling research areas.

Work funded in this project PE is fully coordinated with efforts undertaken in PE 0603002A and the Defense Health Program.

Work in this PE is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD and its overseas laboratories; U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM), Fort Detrick, MD; U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA; the U.S. Army Dental Trauma Research Detachment and the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR), Fort Sam Houston, TX; U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), Fort Rucker, AL; and the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts research to prevent and protect Soldiers from training and operational injuries, refine mechanisms for detection of physiological and psychological health problems, evaluate hazards to head, neck, spine, eyes, and ears, set the standards for rapid return-to-duty, and determine new methods to sustain and enhance performance across the operational spectrum. This research provides medical information important to the design and operational use of military systems, and this work forms the basis for behavioral, training, pharmacological (drug actions), and nutritional interventions. 

The four main areas of study are: 
(1) Environmental Health and Protection 
(2) Physiological Health
(3) Injury Prevention and Reduction
(4) Psychological Health and Resilience

Additionally the Soldier Systems Engineering Architecture task advances medical S&amp;T in the areas of injury prevention and performance sustainment in the context of human interaction with new Soldier systems and provide greater insight into informing new research in development of Soldier systems and the interactions between Soldiers and the systems they employ.  

Promising efforts identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project MM3.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

These results lead to interventions designed to protect Warfighters from environmental hazards; defined the effects of metabolic energy availability on cognitive performance; determined whether nutritional interventions can facilitate bone remodeling in response to military training; incorporated a mathematical model of caffeine effects during chronic sleep restriction into the sleep performance model; and refined a cognitive (mental processing) model to predict differential rates of recovery following various chronic sleep restriction operational scenarios.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts applied research for medical countermeasures to naturally occurring infectious diseases that pose a significant threat to the operational effectiveness of forces deployed outside the United States. Effective preventive countermeasures (protective/therapeutic drugs and vaccines and insect repellents and traps) protect the Force from disease and sustain operations by avoiding the need for evacuations from the theater of operations. Diseases of military importance are malaria, bacterial diarrhea, and viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever and hantavirus). In addition to countermeasures, this project funds refinement of improved diagnostic tools to facilitate early identification of infectious disease threats in an operational environment, informing Commanders of the need to institute preventive actions and improve medical care. Major goals are to integrate genomics (DNA-based) and proteomics (protein-based) as well as other new biotechnologies into the refinement of new concepts for new vaccine, drug, and diagnostics candidates.

Research conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas:

(1) Drugs to Prevent/Treat Parasitic (organisms living in or on another organisms) Diseases
(2) Vaccines for Prevention of Malaria
(3) Diagnostics and Disease Transmission Control
(4) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)
(5) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)

For the refinement of drugs and biological products, studies in the laboratory and in animal models provide a proof-of-concept for these candidate products, including safety, toxicity (degree to which a substance can damage an organism), and effectiveness, and are necessary to provide evidence to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to justify approval for a product to enter into future human subject testing. Additional non-clinical studies are often needed in applied research even after candidate products enter into human testing during advanced technology development, usually at the direction of the FDA, to assess potential safety issues. Drug and vaccine refinement bears high technical risk. Of those candidates identified as promising in initial screens, the vast majority are eliminated after additional safety, toxicity, and/or effectiveness testing. Similarly, vaccine candidates have a high failure rate, because animal testing may not be a good predictor of human response, and therefore candidate technologies/products are often eliminated after going into human trials. Because of this high failure rate, a continuing effort to identify other potential candidates to sustain a working pipeline of countermeasures is critical for replacing those products that fail in testing.  

Work is managed by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.   

Promising medical countermeasures identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project 810.
 
The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts research on Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Work in this area includes refining improved identification methods to determine genetic diversity of the virus and evaluating and preparing overseas sites for future vaccine trials. Additional activities include refining candidate vaccines for preventing HIV and undertaking preclinical studies (studies required before testing in humans) to assess vaccine for potential to protect and/or manage the disease in infected individuals.

Combat casualty care research addresses control of severe bleeding, revival and stabilization, prognostics and diagnostics for life support systems (predictive indicators and decision aids), treatment of burns, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Clinical and rehabilitative medicine research addresses tissue repair including transplant technologies, orthopedic injuries, eye injuries, and face trauma.

Research involves extensive collaboration with multiple academic institutions to refine treatments for combat wounds through AFIRM. This project is coordinated with the Military Departments and other government organizations to avoid duplication.

Research conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas:
(1) Damage Control Resuscitation
(2) Combat Trauma Therapies
(3) Combat Critical Care Engineering
(4) Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine
(5) Traumatic Brain Injury

All drugs, biological products, and medical devices are refined in accordance with FDA regulations, which govern testing in animals to assess safety, toxicity, and effectiveness and subsequent human subject clinical trials.  

Promising efforts identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project 840.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts research to support applied research directed toward the sustainment of a healthy force of Warfighters from accession through retirement.  This research focuses on enhanced protection of Soldiers against health threats in military operations and training. Stressors that adversely affect individual Soldier health readiness are identified and studied to refine interventions that will protect Soldiers and improve their health and performance in stressful environments. This is follow-on research that extends and applies findings from over a decade of research on Gulf War Illnesses and other chronic multi-symptom illnesses that have suspected nerve and behavioral alterations caused by environmental contaminants and deployment stressors. Key databases include the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow us to evaluate interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.

Force Health Protection applied research is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services working on Army projects.

Research conducted in this project focuses on the following three areas:
(1) Millennium Cohort Research
(2) Biomarkers of Exposure and Environmental Biomonitoring
(3) Physiological Response and Blast and Blunt Trauma Models of Thoracic (Chest) and Pulmonary (Lung) Injuries
 
Promising efforts identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project FH4.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.    
 
Work in this project is performed by the U.S. Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, CA; and the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA. 

Efforts in this project support the Soldier Portfolio and the principal area of Combat Casualty Care.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

(A) The core capability for multidisciplinary applied research in systems biology enables integration and analysis of complex data from human and animal studies, development of in silico (via computer simulation) network models, allowing us to differentiate molecular signatures of disease, and supports transition of research to clinical applications. This core capability applies integrative and systemic biological approaches to trace progression of illnesses and diseases of military relevance and has already shown that the approach significantly reduces time, funds and effort invested in medical product development and refinement. (B) Applied research is to identify toxicity-altered pathways (scientists can infer human harm from chemicals on the basis of how they change the activity of biochemical steps in cells and animals) enabling us to understand the mechanisms of toxic environmental chemicals and to develop molecular markers of toxicity for a next generation diagnostic system to support early exposure medical decisions. 

These examples of more complex, yet integrated approaches to projects studying biological systems (PTSD project) has been shown to reduce both the time and expense of medical product development for the Army

                                    <r2:Description>This project encompasses two efforts to support applied research and impact medical research relevant to the Soldier. (A) The core capability for multidisciplinary applied research in systems biology enables integration and analysis of complex data from human and animal studies and development of in silico (via computer simulation) network models, allowing us to differentiate between molecular signatures of psychological illness, diseases, and other medical conditions for the Soldier, such as heat injury. This core capability has supported transition of research to clinical applications faster, cheaper and better than standard approaches because many forms of data from numerous studies are integrated into a consolidated personalized clinical environment used to treat Soldiers more effectively. (B) Applied research is to identify toxicity-altered pathways (scientists can infer human harm from chemicals on the basis of how they change the activity of biochemical steps in cells and animals) enabling us to identify toxic environmental chemicals and materials as well as understand the injury mechanisms of toxic environmental chemicals and to develop molecular and physiological markers of toxicity for a next generation diagnostic system to support early exposure medical decisions.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) have jointly initiated the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) to examine how psychosocial (related to both the psychological and social aspects), biological (related to living organisms), and genetic factors affect risk/resilience for suicide, as well as related conditions. This study funds research to examine the mental and behavioral health of Soldiers and related suicidal behavior. Army STARRS component studies (Historical Data Study, New Soldier Study, All Army Study, Soldier Health Outcomes Study, and Pre/Post Deployment Study) examine historical and administrative data collected by the Army from Soldiers in all phases of Army service. As of July 2013, more than 100,000 Soldiers volunteered to participate in Army STARRS.
