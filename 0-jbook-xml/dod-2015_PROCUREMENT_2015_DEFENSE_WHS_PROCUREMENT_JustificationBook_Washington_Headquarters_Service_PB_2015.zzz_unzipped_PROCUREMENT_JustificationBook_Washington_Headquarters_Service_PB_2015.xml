            <proc:Description>The total WHS request of $46.759 million in FY 2014 includes $15.000 million for the Indian Financing Act.  The DOD Indian Incentive Program (IIP) is authorized by Section 504 of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (U.S.C 1544).  In 1989, Congress began providing annual funds through the DOD Appropriation Act for the DOD Indian Incentive Program.  The program motivates prime contractors to utilize Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises by providing a 5% rebate on subcontracted work performed by those companies that fall into the following categories:  Federally Recognized American Indian Organizations, Indian-Owned economics enterprises and small businesses owned by members of recognized tribes, Alaskan Natives or Native Hawaiians.  Through the generation of subcontracts to the above mentioned entities, the IIP fulfills its purpose as an economic multiplier for Native American communities.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The total WHS request of $46.759 million in FY 2014 includes $15.000 million for the Indian Financing Act.  The Office of Small Business Programs expects to issue in excess of 120 rebates to prime contractors for utilizing native American firms in 2014.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The WHS procurement FY 2015 funding request of $29.599 million is for the modernization and life-cycle refresh of office automation and IT infrastructure requirements for the WHS/OSD, the DoD CAF, White House Military Office (WHMO), the US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and 14 organizational components of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  

The budget funds approximately 20 to 50 office automation and IT infrastructure modernization and life-cycle refresh projects annually.  The FY 2015 funding includes continued upgrade and support of the network infrastructure, and office automation systems that are at the end of their life-cycle.  Special emphasis is placed on continuing to implement enterprise-wide common applications and systems resulting in efficient, cost-effective and interoperable IT solutions for the WHS and OSD organizations.  The budget also supports telecommunication equipment, equipment for OSD business systems, and AV/VTC components.

The budget request also reflects the continued support of the DoD CAF, a consolidation to promote and enhance greater consistency, standardization, and efficiency throughout the adjudicative process. The program also funds Continuity of Operations IT requirements that support the sustainment of critical business operations in the event of an emergency.  Additionally, there is the life-cycle refresh program that supports the Secretary, Deputy, and Senior DoD officials and replaces one (1) Commercial Heavy Armored Vehicle (CHAV).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Funding in FY 2015 has been requested for the modernization and life-cycle refresh of major information technology (IT) systems, infrastructure, and office automation capabilities which are required to support the business needs of the WHS/OSD White House Military Office (WHMO), the US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (USCAAF), 14 organizational components of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and the DoD Central Adjudications Facilities (CAF).

The funding supports the continued life-cycle refresh of equipment that enables the DoD CAF’s mission. The DoD CAF is the consolidation of the Department's Personnel Security adjudication, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), and Suitability adjudicative functions, exclusive of Intelligence Agency adjudicative functions, into a single DoD organization under the direction and control of the Director, Administration and Management.  The purpose of the consolidation is to promote and enhance greater consistency, standardization, and efficiency throughout the adjudicative process. 
 
The funding supports the life-cycle refresh of one Commercially Heavy Armored Vehicle (CHAV).  The average life-cycle for these vehicles is about 5 years and a CHAV needs to be replaced in FY 2015. The CHAVS are used by senior OSD DoD officials and this funding ensures reliable and protective vehicles are available to those senior DoD officials.  

The funding continues the support for VTC upgrades that enable the planning, and procurement of infrastructure technology hardware and software (to include licensing) for an integrated, robust, unclassified and classified VTC system to support all Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Washington Headquarters Services (WHS), Pentagon Force Protection Agency (PFPA) needs and currently planned organizational changes.  This includes the refresh and integration of all endpoints as well as associated installation and integration costs with a goal to modernize the VTC capability of all OSD and WHS, and supported components.  It will consolidate and modernize the infrastructure SIPR and NIPR environment and increase the number of clients that connect concurrently.

Special emphasis is being placed on implementing enterprise-wide common applications and systems resulting in efficient, cost-effective and interoperable IT solutions.  Funding for Continuity of Operations (COOP) IT requirements is vital to support the sustainment of critical business operations in the event of an emergency.</proc:Justification>
