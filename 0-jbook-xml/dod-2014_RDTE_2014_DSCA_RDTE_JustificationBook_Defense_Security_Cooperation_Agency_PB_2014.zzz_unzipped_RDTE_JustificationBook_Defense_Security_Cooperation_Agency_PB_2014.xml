                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Regional International Outreach (RIO) - Partnership for Peace (PfP) Information Management System (PIMS) is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative.  The primary focus of the program is a common information technology platform (GlobalNET) to improve international partner outreach and collaboration efforts in a federated environment. A federated environment – characterized by the capacity of DoD institutions to directly share participants and content across proprietary community websites - fosters networks of partner influencers and enables better use of DoD resources through collaboration among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, PfP and international partners, other DoD educational institutions and communities as required. The program uses a spiral methodology (making available capabilities as developed), to speed the delivery of open source collaboration technologies the user community. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) oversees execution of the research and development of the GlobalNET effort and its operations, and ensures that the program addresses DoD security cooperation requirements in the context of defense, interagency, and international information sharing and collaboration needs.

The GlobalNET effort focuses on improving collaboration, supporting outreach efforts, and enabling communication among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, the Combatant Commanders, the DSCA, OUSD (Policy), North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) Military Cooperation Division (MCD), the PfP Consortium of Defense Academies, PfP Partner countries, and other designated DoD institutions and communities. It provides DoD and international partner security practitioners a platform to share information, communicate and collaborate, and improve administrative activities. It also provides the ability to form collaborative communities of interest around security issues. GlobalNET facilitates information sharing and knowledge management concepts in accordance with U.S. policy. PIMS, as a part of the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996, implements the Congressional endorsement for the modernization of Defense capabilities in eligible PfP countries relative to their telecommunications infrastructure.  RIO-PIMS provides allies and partner countries the ability to collaborate in critical cooperative activities that underpin the spirit of the PfP program.  The program supports PfP coalition initiatives through development of distributive collaboration tools to support aspects of U.S. and NATO-approved PfP cooperative activities.  This support is important to achieve the interoperability/integration outlined in the Guidance for the Employment of the Force.  RIO-PIMS supports internet-based education and collaboration, exercise simulations, and training center requirements.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Regional International Outreach (RIO) - Partnership for Peace (PfP) Information Management System (PIMS) is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative.  The primary focus of the program is a common information technology platform (GlobalNET) to improve international partner outreach and collaboration efforts in a federated environment. A federated environment – characterized by the capacity of DoD institutions to directly share participants and content across websites - fosters networks of partner influencers and enables better use of DoD resources through collaboration among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, PfP and international partners, other DoD educational institutions and communities as required. The program uses a spiral methodology (making available capabilities as developed), to speed the delivery of open source collaboration technologies the user community. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) oversees execution of the research and development of the GlobalNET effort and its operations, and ensures that the program addresses DoD security cooperation requirements in the context of defense, interagency, and international information sharing and collaboration needs.

The GlobalNET effort focuses on improving collaboration, supporting outreach efforts, and enabling communication among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, the Combatant Commanders, the DSCA, OUSD (Policy), North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) Military Cooperation Division (MCD), the PfP Consortium of Defense Academies, PfP Partner countries, and other designated DoD institutions and communities. It provides DoD and international partner security practitioners a platform to share information, communicate and collaborate, and improve administrative activities. It also provides the ability to form collaborative communities of interest around security issues. GlobalNET facilitates information sharing and knowledge management concepts in accordance with U.S. policy. PIMS, as a part of the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996, implements the Congressional endorsement for the modernization of Defense capabilities in eligible PfP countries relative to their telecommunications infrastructure.  RIO-PIMS provides allies and partner countries the ability to collaborate in critical cooperative activities that underpin the spirit of the PfP program.  The program supports PfP coalition initiatives through development of distributive collaboration tools to support aspects of U.S. and NATO-approved PfP cooperative activities.  This support is important to achieve the interoperability/integration outlined in the Guidance for the Employment of the Force.  RIO-PIMS supports internet-based education and collaboration, exercise simulations, and training center requirements. 

The Regional Centers Person/Activity Management System (RCPAMS) provides an integrated student and activities management framework that was designed to complement the capabilities of the Security Assistance Network (SAN).  The interface between the SAN, RCPAMS, and GlobalNET provides faculty and students an effective information service to ensure student, activity, and alumni management.

Begin development of direct data exchange links with relevant information systems to remove the technical limitations to information sharing between GlobalNET and other learning management systems (LMS) implementations.  

Refined, tested and deployed the chat capability.  In addition, provided a framework for chat that included the replacement for the capabilities for Adobe connect to minimize the recurring costs of the VTC capabilities and whiteboarding.

Worked with DSCA and OSD-P leaders to identify additional institutions which require a similar capability.  Worked to extend the platform for those institution specific requirements, allowing existing members to avail themselves of the newly developed feature sets.

Worked with the integrators of the RCPAMS system to ensure that information exchange between RCPAMS and GlobalNET is mapped.  This includes: 1) an automatic provision module allowing information from RCPAMS to populate and provision accounts for eligible participants, 2) participant nomination form, and 3) automatic group enrollment based on course participation.  

Worked with the exiting platform managers to update the GlobalNET implementation to the newest platform stable release - allowing greater functionality and better security across all members of the platform.

Completed FY 2012 recertification of security accreditation process that also reflects the new and updated software capabilities as well newly integrated educational organizations. Conduct developmental and operational testing of latest software release.  Release latest validated software release into production.

Work to extend the email functionality support to the system users such that plain language support for common tasks is provided through email. This extends the exiting capability of responding to system generated notifications by allowing user initiated tasks through plain language submitted in an email.  The system will post all of the content correctly and in a structured format for knowledge management.  It begins to turn email into a client for limited functionality.

Validate the existing requirements are still applicable to the aggregate user community across the platform.  Research the effectiveness of the CHI and ensure that it meets all mission objectives and goals and modify where necessary.  Perform user research to validate the new changes and implement the CHI to the platform.

Work with DSCA and OSD-P leaders to identify institutions which need a similar capability.  Work to extend the platform for those institution specific requirements, allowing existing members to avail themselves of the newly developed feature sets.

Deploy a native video teleconference (VTC) capability to replace the existing hosted service.  GlobalNET is currently bundled with a loosely coupled Adobe connect system outside of the GlobalNET stack and hosting environment.  The capability would create a native VTC capability inside of the platform allowing much tighter integrations with messaging, file sharing, white boarding, and chatting and reduce the operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) expense of leasing this service.
Work with the existing platform managers to update the GlobalNET implementation to the newest platform stable release - allowing greater functionality and better security across all members of the platform.

Test, and implement the RCPAMS information exchange between the SAN and GlobalNET.

Complete FY 2013 recertification of security accreditation process that also reflects the new and updated software capabilities as well newly integrated educational organizations.   Conduct the research and define the requirements for the gaming and exercise simulation module.

Develop a much more robust public facing interface such that community leaders can collapse the public facing web presences into the GlobalNET platform and drive content for public consumption through structured workflow. This will allow communities to reduce costs and improve public access to information.

Enhance the user experience for browsing courses and groups to allow a much more robust experience, including tighter coupling of events and groups on the GlobalNET platform with courses operated on the Ilias Learning Management System (LMS) deployed in 2013.

Provide a much more structured and granular reporting and goal tracking environment.  This will include the abiulity to offload the reporting data from the transaction servers to a dedicated reporting service and define goals for each member community. 


Work to extend the service that shares data between RCPAMS and GlobalNET to a generic service so that other communities can exploit the service for their internal business systems. 

Upgrade the core platform to be in alignment with the community versioning.  This will include ensuring that  previously identified issues not addressed is due to required effort being on the older versions, are addressed.


Continue to optimize both the code and the underlying hardware to improve performance due to additional communities and provisioned accounts.

Work with users to define their evolutionary needs and functionality and ensure that those needs are in alignment with the program goals. When validated, make system changes and ensure the changes meet anticipated needs.

Review RCPAMS requirements and implement upgrades to the software.

Complete recertification of security accreditation process that also reflects the new and updated software capabilities as well newly integrated communities.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The GlobalNET effort employs a spiral acquisition strategy to ensure a well-defined model for each institution/community that can be exported globally.  The program uses a regional approach to ensure sustainable, leave-behind technology and information sharing procedures.  By partnering with other U.S. Government agencies, existing assets are leveraged to preserve U.S. investments, avoid duplication of effort between agencies, and offer economically prudent solutions to improve information sharing and achieve U.S. security cooperation goals.  Independent Operational Test teams were brought on to ensure that GlobalNET and bears independent validation of the development team’s effort.  GlobalNET has regional based personnel to assist in the adoption of the platform with partners who are not familiar with social collaboration and networking media.  RCPAMS uses a similar spiral approach, testing and fielding approach.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Shared Information System (OHASIS) provides Humanitarian Assistance (HA) offices, including embassy staff, country team members, Combatant Command leads, and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) the capability to manage and visualize Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid (OHDACA) funded projects on a web-based map display, automate report generation, coordinate with Inter-Agency and Partner Nation stakeholders, as well as perform a variety of analysis.  

Under the direction of DSCA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Army Geospatial Center (AGC) is responsible for the entire lifecycle--from system definition to development, support, training, and product improvement of OHASIS. The AGC has been responsible for the OHASIS system since 2005 and has evolved it to the present 2.1 system which contains more than 13,000 projects valued at more than $1 billion, with a community of over 1,200 users.  The OHASIS system is a critical and mission essential means for thousands of military and civilian users to develop, staff, coordinate, approve, fund, implement, and manage projects intended to assist the Combatant Commands in accomplishing theater campaign plan objectives and achieve strategic ends states in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Shared Information System (OHASIS) enables Humanitarian Assistance (HA) offices, including embassy staff, country team members, Combatant Command leads, and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) to manage and visualize Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid (OHDACA) projects on a web-based map display, automate report generation, and perform a variety of analysis.  

Under the direction of DSCA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Army Geospatial Center (AGC) is responsible for the entire lifecycle--from system definition to development, support, training and product improvement of OHASIS. The AGC has been responsible for the OHASIS system since 2005 and has evolved it to the present 2.1 system which contains more than 13,000 projects valued at more than $1 billion that are managed by over 1,200 users.  The OHASIS system is a critical and mission essential means for thousands of military and civilian users to develop, staff, approve and manage projects intended to assist the Combatant Commands in accomplishing theater campaign plan objectives and achieve strategic ends states in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>Implemented After Action Reporting 30 day process and forms for collecting initial Measures of Performance data, including integrated functions to assist in assuring timely and accurate completion.  

Integrated live data on worldwide hazards from the Pacific Disaster Center as well as cultural and geographic data from the AGC, USGS and other agencies to provide users with a highly detailed sense of a region’s geography in relation to their projects.  Additionally, OHASIS was integrated with the Civil Affairs Operating System (CAOS) for U.S. Army Civil Affairs teams to further provide a comprehensive picture.

Implemented updates and improvements to the Denton Funded Transportation system as well as the Excess Property (EP) module.

Added the OHASIS budget wizard for COCOMs to created detailed plans and budgets for broad DoD coordination and DSCA approval each fiscal year.

Expanded search capabilities and include searching by status and date range in which status change occurred, by project execution timeframe and by date in which comments or documents were added.  Searches also now feature combining OHASIS 1 and OHASIS 2 projects in search results; adding a saved search capability; adding additional fields such as “is construction” to queries; and including ability to search for coordination tasks based on tasker/taskee and organization.

Added project nomination modules for six project types to OHASIS 2:  HMA-Humanitarian Mine Action and HCA-Humanitarian Civic Assistance, APRI-Asia Pacific Regional Initiative, DCCEP, PE-Personnel Expense, and PI-Pandemic Influenza.

Deployed drill down reports that can be exported in PDF or Excel format OHASIS 1 and 2 projects in a combined report.

Added ability to drag-and-drop projects in priority order within a COCOM or a country.

Enhanced coordination requests by adding one-click reminder emails for late or ignored tasks.

Changed home page so that logged in user’s tasks are visible immediately from the main system page.

Added project management functionality to allow for tracking of funding information (funds committed, obligated and dispersed).

Launched a report of nearby projects that displays a list of all nearby projects on the project details page.

Added an initial disaster response page to record funding data associated with disaster response activities and provide the ability to link projects together that address the same disaster event.

Included option to relate projects together.

Implemented News Log to document and email system changes, tips and tricks and notifications.

Develop management pages to make data entry into the system more efficient

Develop a low bandwidth data capture functionality

Integrate with other systems as required and approved by DSCA to potentially include Pacific Disaster Center, REDi, Cooperation Security JCTD, GTSCMIS, CAOS, Foreign Assistance Dashboard, MARCIMs, etc.

Refine handheld scanner technology at the EP Warehouses

Refactor the Denton and Funded Transportation Programs as required

Complete system accreditation through the DSCA CIO and keep accreditation and information assurance up to date

Refine and implement the “Umbrella Project” concept within the system

Launch analytical capability – aggregate AAR reports into regional data, country level data, and COCOM-wide levels

Project evaluation synopsis – ability to rate a project against a defined criteria.  There will be two levels for this COCOM and DSCA

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The program employs an incremental technology development and implementation strategy to ensure a desired capability is delivered in a relevant timeframe. This strategy also will continue to leverage industry standard technologies for web development, database technology, database modeling, geographic information systems, reporting, and documentation.  As additional users require the system, it will continue to be developed with scalability and maintainability as key considerations.  Additionally, this capability will help DoD better collaborate and support external agencies and their programs by leveraging the web services that have been designed in the initial baseline.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Theater Security Cooperation Management information Systems (G-TSCMIS) Program is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative to develop and deploy a common web-based, centrally hosted Management Information System (MIS) that will serve as the information focus point for the Nation’s Security Cooperation (SC) efforts by providing decision makers, SC planners and other users with the ability to view, manage, assess, and report SC activities and events.  G-TSCMIS will consolidate, improve upon and is intended to replace all existing TSCMIS solutions hosted at and supporting more than 20 Department of Defense (DoD) Services, Agencies and Combatant Commands (CCDRs).  It will provide a comprehensive picture of whole-of-government SC activities, and will contribute to planning more effective cooperative security activities to align or meet desired outcomes in support of SC end states.  The program is an evolutionary rapid Information Technology (IT) acquisition pilot program, as described in FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act  (NDAA) Section 804 that provides users at every user command with greater capability through several iterations and releases that are developed and implemented over time.  The Department of Navy (DoN) was assigned acquisition lead for the effort by Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF). 

G-TSCMIS is a fully interoperable component of Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) and the DoD Joint C2 (JC2) Capability.  The effort will support the strategic planning of CCDRs by providing access to reports of programs, activities, events, funding, assessments, and status of achieving defined end states.  G-TSCMIS will provide visualization, assessment, reporting, and data management throughout the conduct of SC activities planning and execution phases. Information from the SC activities will be binned by separate SC programs, budget lines/funding streams, equipment drawdown, etc.  This will enable users at the tactical level to focus on specific programs, participating forces, events, and activities, while users at the strategic level will be able to access summary reports of geographic regions, resource requirements, or total expenditure of funds by source. G-TSCMIS support to DoD's SC reporting requirements is mandated by federal law for many SC programs and activities.  To adhere to U.S. regulations, G-TSCMIS reports will be tailored to include programs, events, and activities by category, geographical areas, assessments, U.S. staffing levels, and sources of funding. 

G-TSCMIS interfaces with other systems, such as Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS), Joint Capability Requirements Manager (JCRM) and Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS).  G-TSCMIS must also be interoperable with the other United States Government (USG) foreign assistance and international cooperation information systems.  G-TSCMIS will allow decision makers and analysts to identify redundant investments, plan more effective engagements, and find gaps and opportunities for building more capable partners. The program uses multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Milestone B equivalent initial build decision held in Quarter 1 FY 2012, which resulted in approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase.  The initial releases require defined objectives and mature technology.  Based on analysis of required capabilities and resources, the Program Office is planning on executing G-TSCMIS in five major releases, each with three or four sub-iterations, across the period of FY 2012-FY 2020.

                            <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>G-TSCMIS is not a new start.   FY 2012 &amp; 2013 funding was in Office of Secretary of Defense AT&amp;L Budget  in Program Element 0605104D8Z- Technical Studies.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>G-TSCMIS will follow the Rapid IT Acquisition approach as detailed in Section 804 of the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). G-TSCMIS will initiate an evolutionary and iterative development process for a software-only solution using multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Build Decision in FY 2012 and enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase. Once fielded and operational on both NIPR and SIPR, users will access G-TSCMIS over a web browser with information on a centralized server. The development period is planned for FY 2012 through FY 2018. G-TSCMIS contracting used fair opportunity competitive procedures on the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) MAC for Releases 1 and 2. Barriers to competition were minimized by using performance and functional specifications and equivalent commercial standards.  Releases 3 through 5 will be completed by separate contract(s).   Either another IDIQ MAC or MACs will be used or a new contract or contracts will be created for the final 3 releases.
</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>G-TSCMIS performance is measured in several outcome-based methods.  The JC2 Capability Definition Package produced by JS J6 defines the Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and Key System Attributes (KSA) to be met.  JS J6 also approved specific Measures of Effectiveness and Measures of Performance (MOE/MOP), establishing thresholds and objectives for G-TSCMIS software to meet.  Successful meeting of stated performance objectives in the statement of work, and meeting cost, schedule and performance targets as defined in the G-TSCMIS Acquisition Program Baseline are key metrics for the program.   The use of participating Service Operational Test Agencies to perform operational testing ensures G-TSCMIS meets the performance metrics prior to making the software operational.  Additional statistics based metrics, trouble tickets logged by the Service Desk, operational user feedback and IV&amp;V and Developmental tests validate system performance.
