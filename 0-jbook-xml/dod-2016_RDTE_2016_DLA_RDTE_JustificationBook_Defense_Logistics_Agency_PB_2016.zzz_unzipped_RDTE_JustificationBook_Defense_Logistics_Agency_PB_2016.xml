                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Through the Theater Enterprise Deployment and Distribution (TED2) analysis, the Geographic Combatant Commanders identified several gaps between United
States Transportation Commands strategic lift processes and Geographic Combatant Commander's distribution processes. Highlighted is a lack of capability to (1.) manage transportation planning and execution processes for cargo and passenger movement within their respective theaters of operation or (2.) match global movement requirements against available lift assets to produce an optimized transportation schedule that meets delivery requirements.  AT21 Theater Capability, through the implementation of process improvements, integration of commercial transportation management and optimization tools, and development of additional deployment and distribution supporting technology, will provide the capability for combatant commanders to manage theater operations with improved visibility and control for those transportation movements originating from the port of debarkation and delivered to the point of need.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency is responsible for providing the Military Services, other Federal Agencies, along with the combined and allied forces the full spectrum of logistics, acquisition and technical services. DLA sources and provides nearly 100 percent of the consumable items the military forces need to operate – including food, fuel and energy, uniforms, medical supplies, as well as construction and barrier equipment. DLA supplies more than 85 percent of the military’s spare parts, provides logistics information data and products, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and offers document automation and production services. DLA’s Research and Development (R&amp;D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are available in order to accomplish the Agency’s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure, using the best commercial and government sources, and applying most effective business processes.  The Logistics R&amp;D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at lower costs, than would be otherwise attainable.  The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits.  

In December 2013, the DLA Director called for greater flexibility within the R&amp;D program in support of the Agency’s efforts to achieve its’ mission.  As a result, the R&amp;D program is evolving from single supply chain efforts to   Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs) that will support DLA’s efforts to achieve the improvements needed to maintain mission readiness and continue fiscal stewardship while supporting the Department’s transition to peacetime operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The Medical On-line Business Analytics capability will be delayed depriving DLA of the ability to properly plan and monitor orders to critical medical customers.  The Supply Chain management project reductions means additional anti-counterfeiting technology will not be fully developed and implemented, increasing the risk that counterfeit parts will enter the DOD supply system. In addition, emerging additive manufacturing technology will not be available for low volume parts.  The Strategic Distribution and Reutilization reductions mean that DLA support to the COCOM’s deployments will be more costly because they will not be able to access regional suppliers through the IBEX2 system.  Reductions to the Energy readiness program mean cost increases to the Services for fuel because fewer alternative fuel additives will be available.  Finally, the reductions to the Defense Logistics Information project means DLA will not be capable of taking advantage of major advancements in Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing.   

FY2016 – FY2020 Restructuring: In December 2013, the DLA Director called for changes to the R&amp;D program that would allow greater flexibility to support the Agency’s mission.  As a result, the R&amp;D program is evolving from single supply chain efforts to a few overarching Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs) that will support its efforts to achieve the needed improvements in order to maintain mission readiness and fiscal stewardship as the Department continues transition to peacetime operations. The three Strategic Focus Areas are: 

1. Analytic and Decision Support:  R&amp;D efforts undertaken to develop and implement advanced analytical tools, modeling, and simulation of logistics and supply chain processes.  These tools will improve DLA forecasting and procurement strategy decisions and lead to faster and more flexible response to emerging market and customer requirements. 
2. Logistics Processes: R&amp;D efforts undertaken to develop and implement advanced technology in the internal DLA logistics processes. To qualify for R&amp;D funding, the R&amp;D effort must develop and apply technology and processes over and above current baseline IT systems and continuous improvements efforts. 
3. Innovative Products and Services for Customers: R&amp;D efforts undertaken to develop new products and services for DLA customers including helping to achieve the operational energy strategy goals of increasing sources of supply, developing and implementing alternative fuels and emerging,  out of cycle requirements that always occur and new products and services developed by DLA.  

FY2016 – FY2020  Reprogramming to Industrial Preparedness – Manufacturing Technology Program (P.E. 0708011S) 
This change will better align the technical work with the OSD Manufacturing Technology Program initiative for the Model Based Enterprise (MBE).  The MBE will help DOD move to a completely digital environment for design and engineering data needed to conceive, design, build and support weapon systems.  The MBE is important because much of the data currently developed during the design and production weapon system life cycle is lost and has to be recreated.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

Phase 1 of the Exchange Sale of Economic Retention Stock (ESERS) project was successfully complete by selling a sample of NIINs through the GSA.  Financial and Inventory Simulation (FINISIM) upgrades requested by DLA were successfully completed, and efforts to transition FINISIM through the J6 Front Door process were initiated by J34 and likely will continue in FY 2015.  Some enhancements to Peak/Next Gen requested by DLA were completed, and others initiated which will be completed in FY 2015.  An assessment of the Returns process was initiated and scheduled for completion in early FY 2015.  Several Challenges from the Planning community were received, and efforts were begun to structure projects based on them.

Technical/Quality Process Improvements:  Completed an analysis of the potential benefits of changing the definition of Critical Application Items (CAI) to “critical in engineering design or manufacturing requirements” that showed the potential of saving millions of dollars and substantial Administrative Lead Time by avoiding unnecessary Engineering Support Activity reviews.  Completed an analysis of new results-based metrics for the Technical/Quality process, and worked with the Technical/quality team to transition them.  Several Challenges from the Technical/Quality community were received, and efforts were begun to structure projects based on them

Procurement Process Improvements:  The Matching Acquisition Strategies to Industry Capabilities (MASIC) project was successfully completed and transitioned to J7.  WSS successfully completed an assessment of the ship recycling industry and DLA’s potential future role, and reported the results to the DLA Director as input to his decision whether or not to get back into the ship recycling business.</r2:Text>

A Collaborative Planning with Military Service Industrial Maintenance Sites project will be initiated that promises to substantially improve the accuracy of demand forecasts and greatly improve support to warfighters.  New projects will be initiated based on the Challenges in the Planning area that were received in FY 2014.  In addition, collaborative efforts will be continued with the Planning Process team to develop additional new projects targeting FY 2016 awards.

Technical/Quality Process Improvements:  A follow-on project to the CAI effort completed in FY 2014 will be initiated to work with DLA experts to develop a set of recommendation for the joint DLA/Military Service Engineering Support Working Group to match engineering support / risk reduction with item criticality and procurement risk.  New projects will be initiated based on the Challenges in the Technical/Quality area that were received in FY 2014.  In addition, collaborative efforts will be continued with the Technical/Quality Process team to develop additional new projects targeting FY 2016 awards.

Procurement Process Improvements:  A Low Demand Parts project will be initiated to improve support to items seeing low demand by identifying and assessing approaches to group such parts and recommending methods to implement approaches to acquire parts in the groups, with a goal of reducing backorders while increasing participation by small businesses.  A concerted effort will be made to identify additional projects for FY 2015 or FY 2016 starts by working with J7 personnel.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>FY2016-FY2020 funding for this DLIR have been reprogrammed to the DLA Manufacturing Technology Program (P.E. 0708011S). This change will better align the technical work with the OSD Manufacturing Technology Program initiative for the Model Based Enterprise (MBE).  The MBE will help DOD move to a completely digital environment for design and engineering data needed to conceive, design, build and support weapon systems. 

The Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) program objective is to research, identify, and implement potential or existing technologies using high-risk, high-payoff tools, methods, techniques, and products.  The DLIR program partners with commercial industry to perform short-term projects (STPs) in various logistics business areas which align with the Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA’s) strategic vision. DLIR improves functional and business processes using the latest technologies available, which support the nation’s warfighter. The technical areas of interest are: 1.) Development of Logistics Data Interoperability &amp; Availability. Enhances the functionality and compatibility of data in a complex data environment using supply chain relationships and lifecycle management to allow flexible visibility.  2.)  Next Generation Automated Electronic Commerce and Sourcing.  The Next Generation Automated Electronic Commerce and Sourcing technical area of interest focuses on employing the best of breed processes, practices, and technology to enable and/or streamline electronic commerce from the customer’s point-of-need to point-of-satisfaction.

DLIR is working several short term projects in the first area of interest only. They are positioning DLA to move towards a model-based enterprise (MBE), using and acquiring 3-Dimensional model-based data instead of 2-Dimensional hardcopy for weapon system sustainment and support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>R&amp;D efforts undertaken to develop and implement advanced analytical tools, modeling, and simulation of logistics and supply chain processes.  These tools will improve DLA forecasting and procurement strategy decisions and lead to faster and more flexible response to emerging market and customer requirements. Currently there are three major analytical thrusts: Planning Processes, Medical Supply Chain, and Distribution/Disposition.  Planning processes model and simulate item and customer demand patterns to improve customer support, lower inventories and acquisition costs, and acquisition lead-times for hardware (Class IX items).  Medical Supply Chain Modeling will provide DLA the capability to integrate DLA logistics data and commercial data with satellite and political maps; it will automate for DLA Medical planners the ability to identify entities such as suppliers, customers and vendor distribution centers to enhance spatial awareness of incidents such as catastrophic events and military contingencies.  The Distribution/Disposition thrust will develop, and implement analytical tools, models, and simulations of logistics and supply chain processes related to distribution and disposition.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>E-Mall Access for TENTNET:  This project will make it possible for MilSpec Tent information to be available to all EMALL users.  It will expand the number of tent and shelter products that have rich technical and performance information available on DOD EMALL. The project is structured to benefit the entire tent manufacturing community by making their product more visible and, more importantly, it will improve the quality of product information available to the warfighter.  Plans include completing data collection and web design for three additional MILSPEC tents, complete modifications, and develop web-based training capability.  

Extension of Supply Chain Simulation project:  This represents additional tasking for an existing project.  The project will simulate the capability of the tent supply chain to surge production under varying conditions and requirements.  We expect this project to produce an effective decision making tool for DLA’s Industrial Capabilities Programs allowing program management to evaluate the effect of placing buffer stocks at various levels within the supply chain.  Anticipate completion by Sept 2011.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Logistics Processes are R&amp;D efforts undertaken to develop and implement advanced technology in the internal DLA logistics processes. To qualify for R&amp;D funding, the R&amp;D effort must develop and apply technology and processes over and above current baseline IT systems and continuous improvements efforts. 
This strategic focus area has 4 thrusts: Technical/Quality Process Improvements, Selected Process Improvements, Medical Processes, and Distribution/Disposition Processes.  

T/Q process improvements to reduce material and internal costs and improve support to warfighters.  Specifically, Cost of Quality processes, increasing use of DOD organic manufacturing capabilities, reduction of ESA reviews caused by Critical Item Reviews.

Selected process improvements cover processes outside the scope of the Technical/Quality (T/Q) Function including identifying improved methods for improving support for Low demand parts, accurate material receipt processes and eCommerce and catalog items as an alternative to stocking items.  

Medical Processes will expand work in critical mechanisms to guarantee product quality of temperature-sensitive medical materiel distributed to our customers, and identify the most efficient and cost-effective means to deliver those medical products in accordance with FDA-labeled and other regulatory requirements.  

Distribution and Disposition logistics processes deal with improving distribution and disposition capabilities, operational effectiveness, and efficiency. While numerous technologies and applications have been developed and exploited, DLA has not kept pace with the commercial industry in regards to modernizing its technology systems infrastructure, processes, or mobilizing information for personnel, customers, and processes.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Innovative Products and Services for Customers Strategic Focus Area includes R&amp;D efforts to develop new products and services for DLA customers.  The Energy Roadmap helps to achieve the operational energy strategy goals of increasing sources of supply, developing and implementing alternative fuels.  The Supply Chain Management Roadmap addresses emerging and out of cycle requirements that always occur and new products and services developed by DLA.   


Included in the budget ($1.250M) is the Print on Demand (POD) project for Mapping Enterprise Business System (MEBS) enhancements.
DLA Headquarters/CC mandated the POD process to establish a web-based tool for DLA Document Services to receive, order and print maps on demand.  

The enhancements improve system capabilities by implementing new and improved program data, user interface, and rules to integrate the POD business process.  These enhancements will greatly improve map services to the warfighter while significantly reducing lead times and lowering overhead costs attributed to printing, storage and shipping.  The POD Project will require an RMD to transfer funds to a new program element prior to the PB16 submission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Supply Chain Management addresses the emerging technology opportunities that occur out of the budget cycle.  This allows DLA to get a head start undertaking new technological advances without disrupting ongoing programs.  In the past DLA R&amp;D has been able to cut 12 to 24 months off the project starting lead-times.  Saving the lead-time allows the Agency to begin to realize the benefits of implementing new technology sooner than would otherwise be the case and maintain continuity of funding and activity for baseline programs.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>USTRANSCOM is tasked to provide globally integrated, agile deployment and distribution solutions and related enabling capabilities to support national security, force readiness and sustainability within an increasingly constrained defense budget. Unpredictable and extended global distribution routes, limited visibility of sustainment requirements, force packaging limitations, lift constraints, anti-access/area denial concerns, complex supply chains, as well as non-networked battlefield command and control, planning, and decision support tools impede timely customer logistical support.  To project unimpeded global power and influence, USTRANSCOM must have access to relevant, real-time information and invest in enabling capabilities that contribute to mission success and help ensure the viability of our capabilities and implementation of a relevant transportation strategy.  Effective knowledge sharing, decision support and transparency across the joint logistics enterprise, facilitated by secure enterprise-wide visibility into logistical processes and the ability to effectively collaborate/operate in a contested cyberspace, is required to promote effective, efficient and responsive global management of force projection and sustainment resources.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This requires investigation into next generation Automated Information Technology (AIT)/Total Asset Visibility (TAV) technologies and/or container security to improve end-to-end distribution visibility and enhance planning/ execution and transform sustainment operations.  Includes the ability to determine immediate, reliable, and accurate shipment status through system access or event management.  Develop an over-arching process and system architecture which will automate and integrate existing and innovative new programs across the supply chain to provide complete In Transit Visibility (ITV) data, to include visibility of non-DOD cargo during humanitarian/disaster relief operations. The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Also need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DOD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Synchronizing strategic/theater delivery capabilities to meet increasingly dynamic customer needs.  Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by the disparity of systems, differing data standards, and insufficient interfaces.  Queries and retrieval of status and shipment information cannot be executed due to lack of connectivity between the various components of the supply chain.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct "what -if" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset’s course, speed or departure/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.  The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Also need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DOD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In some cases there are insufficient security assets to oversee convoy security in-country; therefore, all movement requirements are competing for the same limited resources.  Additionally need to explore new, portable methods of detecting hazardous/asymmetric materials in very small quantities to support safe logistics operations.  Also explore technologies to enhance the capability to deliver personnel/materiel to anti-access/austere airfields and seaports.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Capabilities which improve deployment, distribution and supply chain decision-making/collaboration (planning stage to real-time execution and retrograde operations) without need for highly specialized operators.  Projects in this area address the following: decision support tools, distribution process simulations/analytics, distribution demand forecasting/execution monitoring, training, automated decision-maker support (e.g., queuing, alerting, courses of action), automated status monitoring with information fusion and drilldown capability, and resilient C2 infrastructure capabilities.  Current planning, forecasting and collaboration capabilities do not permit full synchronization of people, processes and assets to execute planned operations.  Automated tools must be able to dynamically analyze/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems.  Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by disparate systems, multiple data standards and insufficient interfaces.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct "what -if" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset’s course, speed or departure/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.  This project addresses the required mission support to combatant commanders and other customers in the area of C2, Optimization, and Modeling and Simulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department has found it critical to National Security to maintain an ability to produce legacy microelectronics long after they are available from commercial foundries which move to more advanced technology levels based upon the global market. The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) uniquely accomplishes this mission for the Department by providing both a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics parts that are no longer available from, or bid by, commercial sources but are essential to combat operations. This is a critical capability in an atmosphere of increasing worldwide supply chain risks with threats to defense microelectronics. The threats include risks, such as, counterfeiting, Trojan horses, unreliability and rapid obsolescence coming from an unpredictable and unsecured supply chain. As fiscal pressures force the Department to maintain its weapon systems longer than originally planned and their extended combat use increases attrition, the need for DMEA’s unique capabilities increases.

Microelectronics is a crucial technology and central for all operations within the Department. Yet, as vital as this technology is to Department operations, the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market. The Department frequently requires legacy microelectronics long after commercial foundries have moved on to advanced technology levels. As such, the semiconductor industry does not respond to the Department’s particular needs of ultra-low volumes, long availability time frames, or its high-level security concerns. In these cases, DMEA procures a license to produce technologies in-house that are no longer commercially manufactured or are unavailable due to no-bids owing to low volume requirements. These licenses enable DMEA to be the Department’s microelectronics supplier of last resort, providing the Department with a long-term, trusted, and assured source.

DMEA provides increasingly rare microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides decisive, quick turn solutions for defense, intelligence, special operations, cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market. DMEA’s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions—along with its unique technical perspective—allows it to develop, manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability. DMEA then uses these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele. After many years of performing analogous efforts, the technical experience, mission knowledge, and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are often incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key tool in the intelligent and rapid development and application of advanced technologies to identified military needs.

Working alongside industry, DMEA has created a model partnership that provides this capability for the Department. DMEA’s uniquely flexible foundry supports the Department with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now assured to remain in one location for as long as they are needed. To obtain these processes, DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses. These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed intellectual property (IP) and the related processes for Department needs. These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry’s right to bid first on resulting production volumes. DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components. If not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production. A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners’ valuable IP and processes. DMEA is Government owned and operated, providing the structure and confidence that an industry partner’s IP is protected from potential competitors. This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring, installing, and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems, combat operations, and support needs. As such, DMEA serves the Department, other US Agencies, industry and Allied nations.

DMEA assists hundreds of Department programs every year. DMEA has provided its specialized engineering assistance and capabilities to older systems, current systems, and even to programs not yet in the production phase. This includes the F-18 Super Hornet, F-22 Raptor, F-35, RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-9 Reaper, AEGIS Advanced Surface Missile System, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), among many other programs. DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Ops, Cyber, Intelligence, and the Radiation-Hard communities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Technology Development funds provide DMEA with the core resources to execute its primary mission of providing an in-house ability to quickly develop and execute appropriate solutions to keep a weapon system operational, elevate its sophistication level or to meet new threats. These solutions use high mix, low volume, unique microelectronics that are endemic to military requirements but are not commercially available. These funds provide for the development and support necessary to ensure rapid prototyping, insertion, and support of microelectronics technologies into fielded systems, particularly as the technologies advance. DMEA maintains critical microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides an in-house capability to support these strategically important microelectronics technologies within the Department with distinctive resources to meet the Department’s requirements across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support. This includes producing components to meet the Department’s requirements for ultra-low volume, an extended availability timeframe, and a trusted, assured, and secure supply of microelectronics. These funds provide basic infrastructure upgrades as well as an in-house technical staff of skilled and experienced microelectronics personnel working in state-of-the-practice facilities providing technical and application engineering support for the implementation of advanced microelectronics research technologies from inspection and analysis through design, fabrication, test, assembly, integration and installation. These funds also provide for the recapitalization and modernization of aging microelectronic infrastructure, acquisition and implementation of design and test tools, the development of advanced techniques to inspect and analyze circuits, the adaptation of tools and processes to detect increasingly sophisticated counterfeit microelectronics in the defense supply chain, the development of trusted field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and the extension of the process technologies that are necessary to keep pace with the needs of the Department as weapon system support requirements migrate toward current state-of-the-art technologies. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key resource in the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements in response to the newest asymmetric threats and to modernize aging weapon systems. DMEA designs, develops, and supports vital classified assets for ongoing and time-sensitive specialized intelligence operations and missions of the Department and the Special Operations Commands.

Today’s weapon systems experience extended field operations and/or are required to remain in service beyond planned replacements, driving the need for growth in DMEA’s unique capabilities. This need, along with the continual contraction of commercial resources, makes DMEA the only available resource allowing these systems to remain operational. As such, DMEA and its capability are considered a National Critical Asset.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department and the National Security Agency (NSA) require uninterruptible access to state-of-the-art design and manufacturing processes to produce custom integrated circuits designed specifically for military purposes. Under DODI 5200.44, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical/essential systems must be procured from Trusted sources in order to avoid tampered or sabotaged parts. Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities continues to greatly reduce the number of U.S. semiconductor fabrication facilities that might be Trusted sources. The prevalence of sophisticated offshore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies have resulted in the outsourcing of electronics component and integrated circuit services to these offshore facilities. This trend threatens the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic suppliers and reducing access to Trusted fabrication sources for advanced technologies. This trend is of acute concern to the defense and intelligence communities. Secure communications and cryptographic applications, among other areas of defense interest, depend heavily upon high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement can translate into a significant force multiplier and capability advantage. Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors.

The Trusted Microelectronics program provides the Department and NSA with access to the Trusted state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities necessary to meet their confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs. The program also provides the Services with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components. The NSA Trusted Access Program Office has successfully contracted with commercial sources to satisfy their state-of-the-art semiconductor requirements. It is imperative for a wide range of technologies in ongoing and future Department/ and NSA systems that access to Trusted suppliers continues. Most importantly, Trusted Microelectronics access is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs requiring state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The BEIS utilized the mature, existing infrastructure of Defense Corporate Database/Defense Corporate Warehouse (DCD/DCW), Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS), and Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) to provide timely, accurate, and reliable business information from across the DoD to support auditable financial statements as well as provide detailed information visibility for management in support of the Warfighter.  The goals of BEIS are to ensure data compliance with Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) standards; provide security-defined, enterprise-level access to information for ad hoc management queries; and produce external financial management reports/statements based on standardized data.  BEIS provides solutions to these goals by:
- Establishing the authoritative source for SFIS values and providing for standardization by implementing SFIS and United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) compliant financial reporting capabilities for Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports.
- Providing an enterprise-wide information environment that will serve as the single source for enterprise-wide financial information.
- Serving as the DoD-wide system for Treasury Reporting.
- Providing decision makers with significantly greater access to financial information through data visibility and business intelligence (e.g., Executive Dashboard).
The BEIS functional baseline encompasses a family of services organized into six distinct lines of business, four of which have achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC).  The remaining two services, Financial Reporting Services and Cash Accountability Reporting Services, will provide DoD enterprise-wide financial visibility and will serve as the centralized financial data source and the single source for enterprise Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports, as well as Treasury Reporting.  The BEIS financial management capabilities will be used by the Military Services, Defense Agencies, and the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller).  These modernization efforts will complete deployment/implementation of BEIS capabilities and will serve the Department Auditability goals and objectives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>BEIS leveraged existing infrastructure in DoD’s investment in DCD/DCW, DDRS, and DCAS. BEIS formally implemented a portfolio management approach to program management that helped to ensure a management strategy was in place to better reallocate assets within the portfolio. BEIS has and will continue to deliver needed capabilities more rapidly and efficiently using a Family of Systems (FoS) concept providing a functional baseline organized into six distinct lines of business: General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, Enterprise Level Business Intelligence Services, Cash Accountability and Reporting Services, and Financial Reporting Services. These services are provided by individual IT systems that collectively, make up the BEIS FoS. The BEIS FoS program is composed of four core systems; Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS), Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI), and Defense Corporate Database/Defense Corporate Warehouse (DCD/DCW). Capabilities are being developed incrementally with multiple releases per year to meet the Enterprise Transition Plan milestones provided to Congress. BEIS has achieved FOC for the following system components/services: DCD/DCW, to include General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, and Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI) and transitioned these to DFAS for operations and sustainment.   Based on the list of remaining requirements for BEIS DDRS Financial Reporting Services and BEIS DCAS Cash Accountability and Reporting Services an overall schedule including integrated activities as well as identified products and milestones has been developed. Contracts are competitively awarded to keep costs down. Intra-governmental services are being used where possible for infrastructure support by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Technical Services Organization and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Information Processing Center.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Information System for Security (DISS) is a family of systems solution that specifically addresses the security clearance and suitability determinations requirements of Section 3001 of Public Law 108-458, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) which requires 90% of all clearances – whether Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential – to be completed within 60 days, as well as supports Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) compliance across the DOD.  The DISS will electronically collect, review, and share relevant data, government-wide, as mandated by the IRPTA and, guided by relevant Executive Orders, Congress, and GAO recommendations, deliver and maintain an appropriately vetted world-class workforce.  

As a secure, end-to-end IT system, the DISS will be the authoritative source for the management, storage, and timely dissemination of and access to personnel security, HSPD-12, and suitability information and will accelerate the clearance process, reduce security clearance vulnerabilities, decrease back-end processing timelines, and support simultaneous information sharing within various DOD entities as well as among a number of authorized federal agencies.  

The DISS family of systems is comprised of two components: the Case Adjudication Tracking System (CATS) and the Joint Verification System (JVS).  Once fully deployed, the DISS family of systems will replace the Joint Personnel Adjudication System, which contains approximately six million active security clearance records and supports over 80,000 users.  The DISS has also been designated as the repository for adjudicative results for Suitability and HSPD-12 determinations by the 13 July 2011 USD(I) memo “Storage of Adjudicative Results in the Defense Information System for Security.”</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The DISS CATS has been designated as the DoD non-Intelligence Community IT system for case management and adjudications by the 10 April 2009 USD(I) memo “Designation of the DoD Case Management and Adjudication Systems.”  Currently, CATS processes over 500,000 cases annually; electronically producing favorable adjudicative decisions for approximately 24% of Secret level cases.

Further, the 3 May 2012 Deputy Secretary of Defense Memo “DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Consolidation” consolidated all DoD CAF into one consolidated DoD CAF responsible for personnel security adjudicative functions as well as favorable Suitability and HSPD-12 adjudications.  The DISS (CATS) is the DOD CAF’s designated IT case management system.

Achieving the above goals will significantly enhance the operational readiness of the national security community and the Federal government.  It will decrease the time required to get an individual through the investigation process.  It will strengthen and reinforce reciprocity throughout the federal community by eliminating redundant or incomplete investigations by standardizing adjudicative decisions and by making available to all agencies adjudicative determinations of the Federal government.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Defense Information System for Security (DISS) is being fielded as a Family of Systems (FoS) employing an evolutionary acquisition approach by fielding incremental capabilities.  On May 09, 2013, the DISS CATS received a Full Deployment (FD) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which acknowledged that CATS was operationally fielded at the five adjudication facilities and authorized the DISS PMO to enhance and field a consolidated CATS (CATS v4) and its associated portal in order to improve the lifecycle management of the CATS by consolidating the existing CATS applications into a consolidated CATS application that uses a single database.  The July 11, 2014 “DISS Acquisition Strategy Revision Acquisition Decision Memorandum” revised the DISS acquisition strategy to field the remaining JVS capability not contained in the CATS.  The JVS Milestone B is scheduled for 2nd Quarter, Fiscal Year 2015. 

The DISS PMO is responsible for program execution and will employ contract types as directed by the agency contracts policies in order to support the delivery and sustainment of the DISS Capabilities. DISS development contractors employ an agile development methodology to allow for a flexible approach that incorporates user requirements and feedback throughout the development lifecycle while meeting delivery requirements as prescribed by the associated development contract. The Agile development methodology allows for the fielding of incremental capabilities IAW the program’s acquisition approach.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Travel System (DTS) is a fully integrated, electronic, end-to-end financial management system that automates temporary duty travel for the Department of Defense (DoD). DTS meets unique DoD mission, security and financial system requirements within the guidelines of Federal and DoD travel policies and regulations. DTS automates travel authorizations, reservations and arrangements, voucher processing, payment, reconciliation, accountability and archiving. DTS employs Digital Signature and Login/Authentication which requires users to provide a signed response using a valid DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate to gain access to the DTS application. Travel documents created in DTS are digitally signed with the user’s PKI certificate to provide a means of identifying the signer, verifying the document’s integrity, and enforcing non-repudiation of the signature by the signer.

DTS is a Major Automated Information System (MAIS), Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1AC program. DTS delivers capability by evolutionary acquisition utilizing incremental development; recognizing up front the need for future capability improvements. DTS has a flexible design so that each increment builds upon its core functionality, dependent on available, mature technology providing increasing capabilities to travelers, travel administrators, and process owners. Full Operational Capability (FOC) was declared in March 2010. Future capability improvements will be implemented as P3I beginning FY 2011.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The primary objective of Defense Retired and Annuitant Pay System 2 (DRAS 2) is to establish and maintain a modernized retired military pay accounts.  DRAS 2 will replace the current Defense Retiree and Annuitant Systems (DRAS) and selected manual processes with proven state of the market technology using Clinger-Cohen guidance for selection of the solution.  Rapid fielding techniques will be used to close business process gaps by delivering incremental capability that provides clear financial benefits.  This modernization will allow for the consolidation of disparate DRAS systems and processes, the reduction of system redundancies and inefficiencies, increased customer satisfaction and compliance to Department of Defense (DoD) and federally mandated Information Assurance (IA) requirements.  The DRAS2 modernization is in keeping with the DoD Strategic Management Plan for FY2014-2015 goals and the White House CIO Council 2.0 initiatives.  In FY2015, DRAS 2 has it's own PE 0605090S separate from the PE referenced in this submission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD) is a multi-service/multi-agency solution established as a key initiative to provide full visibility of funds distributed through echelon I and II for the Military Departments and at all levels for the Defense Agencies to improve and modernize the OUSD(C) funds distribution process.   Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place.  

Within the current DoD environment, progress has been made streamlining a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems.  Efforts continue to improve the visibility of funding information, eliminate manual efforts and  undue complexities to the management of budget authority, and to eliminate impediments in the flow of funding documents.  The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions.   This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous.  

The envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow.  Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data.  Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.

The operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment.  The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DAI mission is to deliver auditable Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliant business environments for Defense Agencies providing accurate, timely, authoritative financial data supporting the DoD goal of standardizing financial management practices improving financial decision support, and supporting audit readiness.  Currently, Defense Agencies use more than 10 different non-compliant financial management systems supporting diverse operational functions and the warfighter in decision making and financial reporting.  These disparate, non-integrated systems do not meet statutory requirements to produce timely, auditable reports.


The DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies’ financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of  agencies and field activities across the DoD.  DAI will support a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision making.   The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a “.mil” environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.


The DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), version 11i (R11).  DAI implemented an Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards.   The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative source).  


DAI supports the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Strategy 5, “Reform the business and support functions of the Defense enterprise”.  DAI is also aligned to the FY 2014/FY 2015 DOD Strategic Management Plan Business Goal 2: “Strengthen DoD financial management to respond to warfighter needs and sustain public confidence through auditable financial statements”. The objective of the Defense Agencies Initiative is to achieve auditable, CFO Act compliant business environments for the Defense Agencies with accurate, timely, authoritative financial data. 


The primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements. Common business functions within budget execution include  the Department’s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report; Procure to Pay;  Acquire to Retire (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (Time and Labor reporting only); and Order to Cash.  Future capabilities will support Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, Budget Formulation, Grants Financial Management, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA)) as well as a Contract Writing capability.


DAI is currently implemented at 11 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, (OUSD(C)) (Time and Labor only) and supporting over 9,200 users.  In addition, since Oracle is phasing out maintenance of Oracle EBS, Release 11i, the program is required to migrate to EBS Release 12 (R12). The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system.  Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, complete the R12 upgrade, initiate the annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE 16) assertion packages, and sustain the system.  


The benefits of DAI are:
- Common business processes and data standards;
- Access to real-time financial data transactions;
- Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;
- Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities; Standardized line of accounting with the use of SFIS; and
- Use of United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.


The DAI PMO will provide the R12 Upgrade system integration services that include: acquisition management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows (RICEFW) objects; testing (information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, security, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated enterprise resource planning system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The primary objective of Defense Retired and Annuitant Pay System 2 (DRAS 2) is to establish and maintain a modernized retired military pay accounts.  DRAS 2 will replace the current Defense Retiree and Annuitant Systems (DRAS) and selected manual processes with proven state of the market technology using Clinger-Cohen guidance for selection of the solution.  Rapid fielding techniques will be used to close business process gaps by delivering incremental capability that provides clear financial benefits.  This modernization will allow for the consolidation of disparate DRAS systems and processes, the reduction of system redundancies and inefficiencies, increased customer satisfaction and compliance to Department of Defense (DoD) and federally mandated Information Assurance (IA) requirements.  The DRAS2 modernization is in keeping with the DoD Strategic Management Plan for FY2014-2015 goals and the White House CIO Council 2.0 initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA's) ability to deliver Americans the right logistics solution in every transaction requires more than successful management of the Department's wholesale supplies and suppliers. It requires supply chain excellence. Our military's ability to generate and sustain combat readiness indefinitely, anywhere on the globe requires that DLA-managed materiel flow seamlessly and as needed from the nation's industrial base to where it is ultimately used.

DLA's Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program seeks to solicit high-risk research and development proposals from the small business community. All selections shall demonstrate and involve a degree of technical risk where the technical feasibility of the proposed work has not been fully established. Phase I proposals should demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology and the merit of a Phase II for a prototype or at least a proof-of-concept demonstration. Phase II selections will be strongly influenced on future market possibilities and commercialization potential demonstrated.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project explores innovative concepts pursuant to Public Law 106-554 (Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000) and Public Law 107-50 (Small Business Technology Transfer Program Reauthorization Act of 2001), which mandates a two-phase competition for small businesses with innovative technologies with a defense application as well as a commercial value.   The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technologies for possible future Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) needs.  Dual-use means the technologies will be judged on their potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new DLA technologies, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products. DLA will conduct the competition as well as award and manage the contracts.

The Defense Logistics Agency`s SBIR/STTR investments are divided into multiple Research Areas identified from within three DLA Elements:

J3 R&amp;D
- Advanced Battery Manufacturing (BATTNET): 
- Advanced Castings and Forgings (PRO-Fast):
- Anti Counterfeiting:

J6 R&amp;D

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The SBIR acquisition process seeks to match projects with DLA’s Strategic Focus Areas.  The goal is to align SBIR/STTR developed technology with current and future DLA requirements.   All new project execution work is solicited through the DoD SBIR Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  There are three separate solicitation periods throughout each year.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>SBIR /STTR programs measure performance in two separate metrics

- First in terms of progression from PhaseI to Phase II, to Phase III.  Each successive progression is deamed a success.   DLA Seeks to have a 50% progression from one Phase to the next as a minimum.
- Second in terms of the congressional definition of “commercialization,” as defined by Office of Secretary of Defense Office of Small Business Programs (OSD/OSBP) Re-Authorization Policy Directive:
-- (Investment) The process of developing products, processes, technologies, or services; and/or 
-- (Sales)  The production and delivery (whether by the originating party or by others) of products, processes, technologies, or services for sale to or use by the Federal Government or commercial markets.    

The Small Business Administration and OSD/OSBP assign a Commercialization Index based on progression within the Phases and reported sucesses</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding and technical work for the Combat Rations program has been reallocated to the Material Availability Strategic Focus Area.  Modern battlefield requirements demand subsistence support that adequately provides for the needs of our military personnel in extremely intense and highly mobile combat situations that can be easily adapted to the civilian sector for humanitarian feeding. In FY 2014, DLA Troop Support Subsistence sold $4 billion in subsistence goods and services to the Department of Defense and other customers. The Rations portion of this business was $702M in FY 2014. The Combat, Humanitarian and Disaster Relief Rations R&amp;D funding request is .002% of sales. The Combat Rations Program is focused on improving the manufacturing technologies related to the production and distribution of the combat rations that are at the forefront of these operations, including Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) as well as Unitized Group Rations (UGR). The objectives are increased readiness, improved quality, optimum sizing for transportation and storage; and better ration variety. CORANET research efforts also help control the cost of the combat rations. The CORANET program engages all elements of the supply chain including the producers, military Services, Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), US Army Veterinary Command, US Army Public Health Command, DLA Logistics R&amp;D, DLA Troop Support Subsistence and academia to research and transition improved technologies for Combat, Humanitarian and Disaster Relief Rations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense, through the Defense Logistics Agency, spends upwards of $2 billion per year on military uniforms and individual equipment. The lead-time is up to 15 months for these items. The CDUM program concluded in October 2014 and continuing CDUM projects have been transitioned into the Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) Program.   The Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) Program was initiated in 4th quarter 2014. The strategic objective of the DLA Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) Program is to identify, adapt, and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time from development to sustainment from years to months or weeks for the military uniforms and individual equipment.  The Program focuses on quick-reaction and technologies that will transform the military uniform supply chain from a two-dimensional (2D), manual environment into a three-dimensional (3D), digital environment.  The resulting knowledge based system will develop a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military uniform requirements to the military uniform industrial base.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders. Cast parts are ~2% of all hardware National Stock Numbered parts but represent ~4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  PRO-ACT develops methods and technologies to improve the supply of cast parts. We take a holistic view of the problem and attacks root causes inside DLA, at DLA’s engineering support activity partners in the Services, and at DLA casting suppliers.  This program includes tasks in developing new and improved metalcasting capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders.  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered parts but represent ~4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings. This program develops methods and technologies to improve the supply of forged parts.  This program takes a holistic view of the problem and attacks root causes inside DLA, at DLA’s engineering support activity partners in the Services, and at DLA forging suppliers.  The program has three thrusts: Business Enterprise Integration to improve supply support approaches; FORGE-IT to develop and improve technical problems; and R&amp;D which develops new technology for forging suppliers, including new methods for making forge dies (typically the longest lead time and expensive item) and for simulation of metal flow inside the forge die (to eliminate trial and error development of the die).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding and technical work for the Material Acquisition Electronics (MAE) program has been reallocated to the High Quality Sources Strategic Focus Area.  Develop a capability to emulate most obsolete digital integrated circuits (ICs) in the Federal catalog using a single, flexible manufacturing line.  DoD has estimated $2.9 billion is spent every five years redesigning circuit card assemblies.  Many of these circuit card redesigns are performed to mitigate IC obsolescence.  Commercial ICs have short Product Life Cycles (often only 18 months).  IC Manufacturers subsequently move on to later generations of ICs, leaving little to no sources for their previous IC products.  DoD maintains weapons systems much longer than IC lifecycles, resulting in an obsolescence problem.  In order to avoid costs and potential readiness issues associated with buying/carrying excess inventories acquired before commercial availability ceases, or redesigning the next higher assembly to mitigate the obsolete IC, DLA (as the manager of 88% of the IC Federal Stock Class) must have the capability to manufacture needed IC devices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The newly transitioned Emulation capability will address several discontinued device families and will increase the potential Emulation production envelope by several hundred NSNs.  MAE completed development of a flexible NMOS/PMOS Digital Microcircuit Emulation capability. MAE continued development of additional implementations including higher density Read-Only and Random-Access Memory, Advanced Emitter-Coupled Logic and Closed-Cell CMOS capabilities. MAE continued 350 and 250 nanometer Emulation fabrication process development, bringing new capabilities to the Customers and Agency.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The BATTNET R&amp;D partners were established by contract September 2009 through a competitive Broad Area Announcement (BAA) allowing for maximum competition. Partner Contracts were based upon proposals that demonstrated knowledge, experience, and expertise in the following areas of interest: Automation, Battery Maintenance, Competition &amp; Contracting Requirements, Diminishing Manufacturing &amp; Supply, Lithium Battery Safety, Reducing Acquisition Costs, Shelf Life, Supply Chain Logistics, Surge/Sustainment, and Technology Transition/Insertion. The BATTNET, which includes a Government Steering Group (GSG) of power source technical experts from the military services R&amp;D groups, is informed of general R&amp;D requirements for supply chain improvement. The partners develop among themselves related R&amp;D projects, which are then formally evaluated by the GSG. Selected projects are then chartered within DLA and planned for contract STP awards when funds are available.  Additional projects were awarded to BATTNET partners from FY12 Industrial Base Innovation Fund (IBIF).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>At least 30% of the completed projects will transition.   

OSD-C financial metrics (obligation and disbursement) will be achieved.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Material Availability (MA) Strategic Focus Area (SFA) are R&amp;D efforts undertaken with DLA’s industrial base to reduce material costs, reduce the length and variability of Production Lead-Times and assure the DLA managed products meet requirements, and continuously improve in the quality and reliability. Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable Customer Wait Times, fewer quality deficiencies and lower customer support costs.  This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Combat Rations Program, the Battery Program, the Castings and the Forgings programs.  

This SFA is comprised of five roadmaps for Batteries, Combat Rations, Castings, Forgings, and Additive Manufacturing.  

The Battery network objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. The network conducts R&amp;D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher MRLs for specific groups of batteries. For FY2013, DLA received 130,600 orders for 2.76 million batteries at $177M net value.

The Combat Rations network is focused on improving the manufacturing technologies related to the production and distribution of the combat rations that are at the forefront of operations, including Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) and Unitized Group Rations (UGR). The objectives are increased readiness, improved quality, optimum sizing for transportation and storage, and better ration variety. CORANET research efforts also help control the cost of the combat rations. The CORANET program engages all elements of the supply chain including the producers, military Services, Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), US Army Veterinary Command, US Army Public Health Command, DLA Logistics R&amp;D, DLA Troop Support Subsistence and academia to research and transition improved technologies for operational rations.    

The Castings consortium objective is to develop methods and technologies to improve the supply of cast parts; looking at root causes of supply issues inside DLA and at casting suppliers.  This program includes tasks to develop new and improved metalcasting capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders.  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered parts but represent ~4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  

The Forgings consortium objective is to develop methods and technologies to improve the supply of forged parts; looking at root causes of supply issues inside DLA and at forging suppliers. The program has three thrusts: Business Enterprise Integration to improve supply support approaches; FORGE-IT to develop and improve technical problems; and R&amp;D which develops new technology for forging suppliers, including new methods for making forge dies (typically the longest lead time and expensive item) and for simulation of metal flow inside the forge die to eliminate trial and error development of the die. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders.  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered parts but represent ~4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings. 

The Additive Manufacturing (AM) objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits.  DLA needs to exploit AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Additive Manufacturing plan is for DLA to partner with the Military Services to use AM to produce parts. DLA and the Services will identify candidate parts, convert technical data to 3D format to facilitate AM, procure the parts, and document the process for AM benefits. The Services will review newly created technical data packages (TDP), test the parts, and qualify AM as an acceptable process to produce the parts.

FY 16 – FY 20: Funding for Additive projects will be reallocated from other MA SFA thrusts and classified into the Additive  Manufacturing Thrust.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Battery network plan is to establish contract partners through a competitive Broad Area Announcement (BAA) based upon proposals that demonstrated knowledge, experience, and expertise in the following areas of interest: Automation, Diminishing Manufacturing &amp; Supply, Battery Safety, Reducing Acquisition Costs, Shelf Life, Supply Chain Logistics, Surge/Sustainment, and Technology Transition/Insertion. A Government Steering Group (GSG) of power source technical experts from the military services R&amp;D groups will inform general R&amp;D requirements for supply chain and technology improvement. The plan also includes awarding Phase 2 and 3 projects from DLA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) in advanced battery manufacturing technology. 

The Combat Rations network acquisition strategy is delivery orders against competitively awarded IDIQ R&amp;D contracts.  

The Castings consortium plan is a competitive Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Evaluations were completed and two contracts were awarded competitively September 2011.  The current contracts reach the end of their base period of performance September 30, 2014. Option extensions will be exercised to extend the base contracts.

The Forgings consortium plan is a competitive Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Evaluations are completed and contract(s) will be awarded soon.  The current contract ends September 30, 2014.  A Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) was issued on 20 August 2013, with proposals received by 07 October 2013.  Contract award(s) is expected 4th quarter FY14. The plan also includes awarding Phase 2 and 3 projects from DLA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) in advanced Forging manufacturing technology. 

The Additive Manufacturing plan will partner with the Military Services and use organic and commercial AM parts production capabilities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The High Quality Sources SFA are projects undertaken to assure that the industrial base can respond to DLA requirements and DLA can fill military customers’ material requirements reliably and consistently.  Benefits include eliminating cancelled requisitions returned to customers as “non-procurable.” This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Material Acquisition Electronics program.  

The Material Acquisition Electronics roadmap has four major thrusts: Advanced Schottky TTL, TTL Compatible CMOS, 512 Kilobit RAM/ROM and Mega Gate ASIC.  These are classes of microcircuits that are expected to become non-procurable in FY 17 and beyond.  Without the technologies planned on the MAE Roadmap, DLA will not be able to support DoD’s requirements for high quality spare parts for critical electronic systems and subsystems. 

The Strategic Materials roadmap is a new thrust for the DLA Mantech program.  It is designed to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently process or recover strategic materials. Domestic capabilities can enhance national security and potentially reduce Defense Stockpile requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

MAE will continue planning for the specific Emulation technology implementations to support specific device family groups in consonance with Customer and Agency requirements. MAE will transition flexible NMOS/PMOS Digital Microcircuit Emulation capability into full-scale production increasing DLA’s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs.  MAE will also complete development and transition higher density Read-Only and Random-Access Memory, Advanced Emitter-Coupled Logic and Closed-Cell CMOS capabilities into full-scale production further increasing DLA’s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs. The newly transitioned Emulation capabilities will address several discontinued device families and will increase the potential Emulation production envelope by several hundred NSNs.  MAE will also initiate several new implementations including development of Advanced Schottky TTL and TTL-Compatible CMOS Emulation Capabilities. It will continue prototyping 350 nanometer Emulation circuitry, bringing Emulation capability that re-establishes sources for additional NSNs.</r2:Text>

Strategic Materials: New Start in 2016. A request for white paper proposals was recently added to DLA’s Emerging R&amp;D Requirements BAA for critical initial manufacturing technology requirements in domestic high strength carbon fibers.  Additional targeted requirements will be determined with DLA Strategic Materials.  Targeted requests for proposals will be conducted to address specific needs and opportunities to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently produce strategic materials. Manufacturing technologies and capabilities are expected to transition to Title III or specific Weapon System Program funds for industrial base qualification.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Industry and Customer Collaboration Strategic Focus Area (SFA) projects improve and facilitate the communication of technical and logistics information among industry, DLA’s military customers and DLA. This SFA includes Military Uniform System Technology and the Defense Logistics Information Research (P.E. 0603712S) within its scope.  The movement of the DLIR related work from P.E. 0603712S to the DOD ManTech Program aligns the funding to the critical interface between DLA and industry and away from internal DLA operations.  

This Strategic Focus Area has 5 Roadmaps:  Military Uniform System Technology (MUST), Model Based Enterprise, Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability, Proactive Forecasting and Retail Support, and Supplier Operations Interface.  

The Military Uniform System Technology roadmap will address GAO Report 12-707 recommendations that DOD to establish a “knowledge based approach” to collaborate on define and communicate of military uniforms.  DLA has the responsibility to communicate and manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base.  Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders.  MUST will research enabling technologies and apply them to reengineering technical data requirement management process for the common environment recommended by the GAO.  

The Model Based Enterprise will develop capabilities operations to systematically accept, validate, store, item design information in 3D models.  There are two classes of data that must be addressed: newly designed parts for systems still in development and legacy parts for systems that are in sustainment.  The problem with newly designed parts is capturing the designs.  The problem with legacy part is that they do not have engineering models so a specific decision has to be made on the economics of recreating the design in contemporary engineering systems.  

The Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability will pioneer methods to capture data from military Services, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and suppliers to form a seamless thread of interoperable and linked data models.

The Proactive Forecasting and Retail Support will roadmap will identify ways to look ahead at military operations and budgets to systematically identify parts there demand changes can be expected.  The alternative is reactively waiting for forecasting to recognize trends which could be after the fact and too late to affect logistics support decisions.  
The Supplier Operations Interface Roadmap will work with DLA process owners, the DLA supply chains and the industrial base, to identify the relevant data sets and most desirable methods of providing DLA suppliers with NIIN inventory visibility where the supplier is contractually responsible for providing a specified level of support. Allowing suppliers to more effectively anticipate DLA’s requirements will improve both DLA and supplier efficiency.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) has been in operation since February 1996. The PDC is a public/private partnership managed by the University of Hawaii (UH) under a cooperative agreement with the Department of Defense.  The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) function, manpower, and budget resources transferred to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (OUSD(AT&amp;L)) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)in October 2011.
 The USD(P) will continue to be the Operational Sponsor and functional OSD Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for the program.  The PDC is a world-recognized authority and leader in science and information technology applications relating to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR). PDC’s applications and information products enhance preparedness, situational awareness, and civil-military communications for humanitarian missions worldwide, while its national-level socio-economic Risk and Vulnerability Assessments help inform strategies by measuring indicators for national resiliency using scientific methods.

The PDC Program Office’s (USD(P),  ASD(HD&amp;GS), and DASD(DC&amp;MA)) primary responsibility is for management and stewardship of governmental funds provided in Defense Department appropriations for DoD missions associated with DoD CrM, HA/DR, Theater Security Cooperation, and Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA). In doing this, the Program Office develops and provides policy, oversight and guidance, and jointly develops strategic guidelines, programmatic content and priorities with the UH and PDC. The PDC Program Office also serves as a support element of the Hawaii-based organization especially in the area of gaining Federal agency support and resources, as well as business opportunities.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:Text>In 2013-2014, the Center’s applications, services, and products were used around the clock by U.S. Agencies as well as by international partners involved in disaster preparedness and response, and those involved in HA/DR operations.  Domestically, the capabilities were used by Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency management Agency, state National Guards, and a host of other federal, state, and county emergency managers in the U.S. to better prepare for and respond to disasters. PDC’s application, for instance, was one of the primary tools used by the Hawaii State Governor and The Adjutant General for their decision-making as Hurricane Iselle approached the State in 2014. 
Internationally, the Center supported major partners globally, and in particular those in Southeast Asia and the Americas, regions frequently affected by significant earthquakes, storms, floods, and tsunami threats. In all, PDC’s public applications—providing hazard monitoring, alerting, and related information services—were accessed from at least from 120 countries worldwide, and its mobile (iOS and Android) applications exceeded 1.45 million downloads.

Emphasis areas in FY 2014 included:
•	Improved Situational Awareness and Decision Support Applications, including planned release of internet-based DisasterAWARE (1 major, 2 main, and 8 minor releases) and mobile DisasterALERT (2 iOS and Android releases) applications
•	Expanded national socio-economic risks and vulnerability assessment, and resilience indicators
•	Provided location-based notifications, information, and analytical support to DoD and other HA/DR stakeholders during at least 30 major disasters or events in the US and around the globe
•	Supported 15 exercises in 6 Partner Countries across 3 COCOM AORs
•	Maintained and expanded content and capabilities of global information services to increase situational awareness and to address humanitarian relief operational needs
•	Built capacity in stakeholder agencies through exercise and training, and enhance partnerships with USG agencies, their counterparts in key partner nations, and within I/NGOs to improve outcomes of HA/DR and related activities</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:Text>For the past 18 years, Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) has been at the forefront of improving disaster-reduction decision-support capabilities through the application of information, science and technology.  PDC's products and services enhance foundational and global services supporting civil-military humanitarian assistance operations by the US Military and US agencies, state agencies, United Nation agencies, ASEAN, national governments, and International/Non-Governmental Organizations (I/NGO).  Foundational and Global Services include projects supporting development, analysis, and delivery of relevant and actionable information.  These activities fall into three categories:  Global Information Services; Anticipatory Sciences and Socio-Economic Risk and Vulnerability Assessment; and Decision Support Platforms and Applications.

Emphasis areas in FY 2015 include:
•	Implement uniform communication, expanding operational utility of mobile applications
•	Improve automated damage and needs assessment and other analytical reports
•	Expand bio/health related monitoring capabilities (in partnership with OSD and U.S. Navy).
•	Continue to grow competitive grants and proposals as a mean to expand the center’s capabilities, and leverage these new capabilities in support of DoD missions.
•	Build capacity in stakeholder agencies through exercise and training, and enhance partnerships with USG agencies, their counterparts in key partner nations, and within I/NGOs to improve outcomes of HA/DR and related activities</r2:Text>

Emphasis areas in FY 2016 include:

•  Improve the simplified DisasterAWARE/RAPIDS user interface (a.k.a. "dashboard") for increased ease-of-use and situational awareness, while allowing the system to accommodate "low bandwidth" operational mode (enabling better support to mobile platforms, as well as, degraded communications) 
• Extend and enhance mobile computing and situational awareness platform for DisasterAWARE/RAPIDS to include:
   a) limited "down range" data collection &amp; sharing capabilities (e.g., damage photos, voice memos, etc.)
   b) investigate and implement degraded but functional/operational "off-grid" capabilities
   c) investigate and implement degraded but operational "low bandwidth" capabilities
• Enhance DisasterAWARE's social media/network visualization capabilities, in collaboration with partners such as ONR-funded research in the subject matter
•  Extend and enhance Bio Surveillance capabilities in collaboration with Navy and Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA)Bio Surveillance Portal (BSP) Joint Program Executive Office
•  Extend collaboration with DTRA &amp; other data providers in enhancing data fusion capabilities
•  Continue to emphasize and participate jointly- and externally-funded research and application programs to enhance the Center's capabilities and experiences which in turn can be operationalize and applied in direct support of DoD HA/DR and DSCA missions
•  Continue to grow competitive grants and proposals as a means to expand the center’s capabilities, and leverage these new capabilities in support of DoD missions</r2:Text>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>PDC projects beyond the baseline Situational Awareness &amp; Decision Support Applications/Tools architecture (Atlas/EMOPS/RAPIDS) undertaken in support of the DoD Cooperative Agreement (CA) with the University of Hawaii (UH) are from PDC customers (e.g., DoD, NGOs, other nations, academia, and industry). The PDC prepares the public, disaster managers, governments, and others to mitigate the effects of disasters.  The goal is to have people and technology work together to preserve life, safeguard livelihoods, protect property to foster disaster-resilient communicates. Projects obtained and funded from this customer base serve as a means to determine PDC product and services relevancy.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Projects objectives and tasks are designed to build upon the previous year’s successes and are consistent with the framework and direction provided by the 2012-2016 PDC Strategic Plan.  At the beginning of each calendar year, an Annual Plan is in-place to guide the program and enable a framework for performance feedback to the DoD PDC Program Manager, the PDC Executive Director, WHS CA Contracting Office, and the UH. At the end of each calendar year, these stakeholders meet to review the past year performance and finalize a new Annual Plan for the next calendar year.  This plan details a set of specific objectives to further capabilities and capacities supporting the PDC’s mission and increasing operational value to the stakeholders.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>
