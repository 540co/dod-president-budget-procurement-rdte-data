                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Provides Electronic Support (ES) for key find, fix, track, target, engage and assess (F2T2EA) requirements supporting Space Superiority activities.  Additionally, funding provides for developmental intelligence collection to support new capability acquisition and development.  This program element funds transportable intelligence collection and analysis capabilities that are modular (plug-and-play), and can keep pace with technological advances and emerging threats.  It provides intelligence support systems for Space Situational Awareness activities that provide the requisite current and predictive knowledge of space events and threat conditions and intelligence support to Space Protection Programs by providing architectural survivability analyses of critical mission assets for mission assurance.  Additionally, funding supports phased threat system analysis and studies (A&amp;S), test support, lab equipment, and Material Acquisition and Exploitation (MAE) for system development and vulnerability/susceptibility assessments to support tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development. Also funded are future threat technology studies necessary for mission area success and achievement of space superiority, helping preserve the US space advantage across all domains.   This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Nuclear Deterrence Operations (NDO) is an Air Force Core Function.  Within this core function, Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) is the exercise of authority and direction by the President, as Commander in Chief, through established command lines, over nuclear weapon operations of military forces.  The President's authority and direction are exercised through the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS).  The NCCS is the designated combination of flexible and enduring elements including facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, personnel, and the structure in which these elements are integrated, all of which are essential for planning, directing, and controlling nuclear weapon operations.

The Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) portfolio modernizes the systems necessary to effectively provide assured communications connectivity between the President and the strategic deterrence forces in stressed environments. 

MEECN System Improvements (MSI) is a long-range planning process with users (Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), and the Navy) to develop positions for current and future requirements/issues based on available technology. MSI is used to conduct technology testing, analyze technology strategies and build technology roadmaps as pro-active support to the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) community. 

Global Aircrew Strategic Network Terminal (Global ASNT) replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces, Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS), and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).  Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) and Force Management messages from NC2 nodes and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews.  Global ASNT will be fielded in separate capability increments; Increment 1 fields required EHF/AEHF capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals.  Subsequent increments will deliver:  an Aircrew Alerting System (AAS) consisting of pagers and klaxons; High Frequency (HF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) capabilities; and a Very Low Frequency (VLF)/Low Frequency (LF) receive capability.  Global ASNT will provide solutions to existing capability shortfalls for NC2 and is the last line of operational communications when all other peacetime links fail.  

This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal years.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MEECN System Improvements (MSI) is a long-range planning process with users (Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), and the Navy) to develop positions for current and future requirements/issues based on available technology.  MSI is used to conduct technology testing, analyze technology strategies, and build technology roadmaps as pro-active support to the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3)community. 

Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) receivers are currently used as one of the means for secure/survivable connectivity from the President to strategic forces. Over the years, the AF and Navy have pursued their own VLF products, which meet the unique application and environmental situations for each platform.  MSI is investigating the technical feasibility of a future common core of processing hardware and software that supports all VLF receiver platforms and associated waveforms. MSI will perform risk reduction, and analyze requirements and technologies for future replacement efforts.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Aircrew Strategic Network Terminal (Global ASNT) replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces, Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS), and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).  Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) and Force Management messages from NC2 nodes and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews.  Global ASNT will be fielded in separate capability increments; Increment 1 fields required EHF/AEHF capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals.  Subsequent increments will deliver:  an Aircrew Alerting System (AAS) consisting of pagers and klaxons; High Frequency (HF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) capabilities; and a Very Low Frequency (VLF)/Low Frequency (LF) receive capability.  Global ASNT will provide solutions to existing capability shortfalls for NC2 and is the last line of operational communications when all other peacetime links fail.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2014, Project 677820, Computer Security Firestarter efforts were transferred to PE 0208088F, Air Force Defensive Cyberspace Operations to better align efforts.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) Element provides cradle-to-grave research, development, acquisitions, supply, sustainment, depot maintenance, and demilitarization of the Air Force (AF) cryptographic and key distribution/management systems.  Additionally, ISSP funds the AF operation of one of two Department of Defense (DoD) Tier 1 key distribution centers, and a special computer security program, designated FIRESTARTER.  The AF and the DoD require the capability to secure, collect, process, store, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information, while denying an adversary the ability to intercept, collect, destroy, interpret, or manipulate our information flows. Secure communication allows the DoD to achieve and maintain decision superiority; the key to successful application of the military instrument of national power. AF COMSEC equipment protects information such as, warfighter positions, mission planning, target strikes, commanders' orders, intelligence, force strength, and force readiness. This COMSEC program ensures adversaries cannot interpret, manipulate, or destroy information. When an adversary is capable of interpretation, manipulation, or destruction of the information used by the warfighter, DoD military forces will suffer significant and/or devastating mission degradation that can result in loss of life and resources and/or cede information that could be used against the United States in a public forum.

The overall focus of the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts within this program is to transform electronic key delivery and cryptographic devices to meet the next generation warfighting requirements. These efforts are driven by the National Security Agency's (NSA) tenets calling for (1) a totally "man-out-of-the-loop" electronic crypto key distribution system from the actual generation of the key in the key processor all the way into the using End Crypto Unit (ECU) (eliminates the current key vulnerability to compromise/interruption by individuals transporting or loading the key); and (2) an inventory of cryptographic devices that are more robust, modular, scalable, capable, net-centric, and durable (allows more effective and efficient performance including reduced inventory, expanded data rates, simplified upgrades, and ensured global information grid-compatibility).  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, as these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or have approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Electronic Key Management System (AFEKMS) consists of multiple developments supporting the Air Force requirements portion of the DoD EKMS Program. (The National Security Agency [NSA] acts as the Executive Agency for the DoD EKMS Program.) AFEKMS, in concert with the overarching DoD EKMS program, provides a secure and flexible capability for the electronic generation, distribution, accounting, and management of key material, with users across DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) and all current AF weapon systems. Bases  and units, in garrison and deployed DoD EKMS replaced the previous manual distribution and management system providing cryptographic keying material for U.S. DoD Information Assurance. Information Assurance emphasizes confidentiality, access control, multi-level secure databases, trusted computing, and information integrity. DoD EKMS has a three-tier hierarchical structure. This tiered structure provides capability to distribute, manage, and account for COMSEC keying material. Tier 1 installations comprise the key material general and control capability. Tier 2 installations comprise the local distribution network (COMSEC accounts) and Tier 3 is where keying material is transferred from the EKMS infrastructure to the consumers End Cryptographic Units (ECUs). Additionally, AFEKMS resources provide maintenance/distribution of AF Communications Security (COMSEC) publications for all AF users. 

EKMS improved protection of national security-related information by substantially enhancing confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation characteristics over the legacy manual key management systems. EKMS has and continues to greatly accelerate availability of crypto key materials through electronic transmission through Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) versus the manual handling and shipping of materials. While the current EKMS level-of-effort is directed at enhancing current and developing systems, the ultimate goal is for it to seamlessly transition to the net-centric DoD Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). The AFEKMS Program continues to provide software development to support emerging requirements during the KMI transition period. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

NOTE:  Software development (e.g., Data Management Device - DMD, Common User Application Software - CUAS, and Simple Key Loader - SKL) is rolled up into Tier 2/Tier 3 Development. Software upgrades can be bundled and tracked as a unit, thereby allowing less management overhead and more focus on configuration management and control.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF Cryptographic Modernization Effort modernizes cryptographic devices protecting critical national security information across cyber domain operations. In September 2000, the Defense Review Board (DRB) tasked National Security Agency (NSA) to evaluate the security posture of the cryptographic inventory. Systems with aging algorithms, those approaching non-sustainability, and those generally incompatible with modern key management systems were also identified and have been replaced or are being fielded. Priority systems that required immediate replacement were also identified. In addition, NSA documented the need to modernize the cryptographic inventory with capabilities designed to enable network-centric operations. Replacements/Modernization of the near term vulnerable systems must occur within the timeframe specified by device and algorithm in Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Notice (CJCSN) 6510. The DoD Cryptographic Modernization Program was established to develop a modern cryptographic base that provides this assured security robustness, interoperability, advanced algorithms, releasability, programmability, and compatibility with the future Key Management Infrastructure (KMI).  This AF effort supports an integrated effort across the cyber domain to transform  to next generation cryptographic capabilities providing U.S. forces and multinational and interagency partners the security needed to protect the flow and exchange of operational decision making information in accordance with national and international policy/standards, the validated operational requirements of the warfighters, and the intelligence communities.  

The AF Cryptographic Modernization Effort is a collection of projects accomplished in three phases: replacement, modernization, and transformation. The replacement phase of the program focused on updating and/or replacing out-of-date algorithms along with unsustainable cryptographic products. The modernization phase provides crypto devices with common solutions that are more robust, modular, scalable, and provide the durability to existing cryptographic end items, as well as updating mid-term aging/unsupportable crypto equipment. Manpower and logistics requirements will be reduced and manpower efficiencies gained, while incremental capability enhancements and footprint reduction are provided. The third phase of the Cryptographic Modernization Program, transformation, provides common joint solutions which enable secure transparent network-centric capabilities across the cyber domain. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  FY14 funding increased to address pending crypto key/algorithm decertifications due to increased threats identified by NSA.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>AFKMI is listed on the AML. The Air Force Key Management Infrastructure (AF KMI) Program consists of multiple developments supporting the AF requirements/portion of the DoD Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). (The National Security Agency [NSA] acts as the Executive Agency for the DoD KMI Program.) AF KMI, in concert with this overarching DoD KMI Program, will provide a secure and flexible capability for the electronic generation, distribution, accounting, and management of key material and other communications security (COMSEC) materials for all DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) and for the Services' weapon systems. KMI represents a broad-scale replacement of the current Electronic Key Management System (EKMS). KMI will provide capabilities that will allow networked operation in consonance with the Global Information Grid (GIG) and other DoD, fellow Service, and AF enterprise objectives. It thereby will assure a viable support infrastructure for future weapons and C4I programs to incorporate key management into their system designs.

The DoD KMI will greatly improve protection of national, security-related information by substantially enhancing confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation characteristics over the legacy EKMS. KMI will greatly accelerate the availability of crypto key materials through electronic transmission versus shipping of materials, will enhance mission responsiveness and flexibility, and will eventually take the man "out-of-the-loop" in the distribution of crypto key materials.

The AF KMI Program in concert with the DoD KMI Program is transitioning the Air Force from the legacy EKMS to modern DoD KMI and building the AF KMI Last Mile architecture. This R&amp;D effort includes system engineering, development and testing to successfully accomplish the transition and defining and developing the AF KMI Last Mile architecture. AF KMI Transition is supporting the DoD KMI program as it progresses through the development, testing, and production and fielding phase of the DoD KMI Program. AF KMI efforts includes the transitioning of existing key management capabilities to KMI. Re-engineering of repair parts may be required. The AF KMI Last Mile program is a holistic solution integrating the legacy and new and evolving cryptographic programs, materials, products, sources and consumers. The AF KMI Last Mile capabilities include distribution, management, and load of cryptographic materials from the KMI (COMSEC account) to the End Crypto Units (ECUs). It builds the linkage interfaces that will allow KMI systems to communicate and integrates other related developments to meet operational needs. AF KMI Last Mile is currently in the Technology Development Phase. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

In parallel with AF KMI, DoD and the Services are developing a new generation of End Crypto Units (ECUs) under the Joint Crypto Modernization Initiative that will be capable of direct interaction with the DoD KMI. (PE0303140F, BPAC 675100, Cryptographic Modernization, supports this initiative). In some cases these new ECUs, although needing to be supported by KMI, will not be KMI network-connected. "Last mile" transport of black (aka benign, or encrypted) and red (unencrypted) keying
material from a KMI client to a new generation ECU or current legacy ECU will need to be handled in the early years by one of two data transfer devices. Initial early systems engineering must also be addressed to accommodate future connectivity between the DoD KMI and future KMI Aware/Enabled ECUs.  This enabling form factor functionally defined as a common ECU KMI aware/enabled key load module.  This is targeted to be a standardized module to be provided to ECU developers and, as such, it must precede any future ECU developments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Funding for Project 677820, Computer Security Firestarter efforts, were transferred to PE 0208088F, Air Force Defensive Cyberspace Operations in FY 2014.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Firestarter program provides technical transition opportunities for research in the area of Information Assurance (IA) technologies and tools needed to defend Air Force (AF) Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) systems from Information Warfare (IW) attacks, and ensure recovery in the event of an attack.  The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyber operations; computer and network systems security; damage assessment and recovery; cyber threat recognition, attribution, and mitigation; and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment.  These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development in the areas of: cyberspace surveillance; cyber indications and warning (CI&amp;W); high-speed and host-based network intrusion detection; fusion and correlation of cyber intelligence; decision support; recovery; digital forensics; active response, etc.  Current Air Force systems, such as the Combat Information Transport System/Base Information Protection (CITS/BIP) leverage this technology to meet their information assurance needs/requirements.  Additionally, this program utilizes IA and cyber technology investments by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force IA and cyber requirements.  

This program coordinates and cooperates with 24th AF (AF component to Cyber Command (CYBERCOM)), Joint Task Force - Global Network Operation (JTF-GNO), Strategic Command (STRATCOM), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA) and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) IA requirements are being met.  Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber technology into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In FY12, the government restructured the FAB-T development program to introduce competition into the acquisition strategy in order to reduce risk in delivering this capability as well as to drive down production costs. To ensure the best value to the government, the Air Force awarded production contracts in September 2013 to both contractors (Boeing and Raytheon).  The production contracts will begin with production planning for both contractors. The Air Force will then downselect in 2QFY14 and exercise production contract options on the selected vendor's contract after a successful Milestone C decision.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T) program replaces legacy Milstar terminals and will provide Extremely High Frequency (EHF), protected high data rate communication for nuclear and conventional forces to include Presidential National Voice Conferencing (PNVC).  FAB-T will provide this new, highly secure, state-of-the-art capability for DoD platforms to include strategic and tactical airborne and ground command posts via Milstar, AEHF, and Enhanced Polar System (EPS) satellites. FAB-T terminals will also support the critical command and control (C2) of the Milstar, AEHF, and EPS satellite constellations. In FY15, the Air Force will continue development of the FAB-T terminal.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The APAF BA05 (OTHACF) line includes spares funding from BP16</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In FY12, the government restructured the FAB-T development program to introduce competition into the acquisition strategy in order to reduce risk in delivering this capability as well as to drive down production costs. To ensure the best value to the government, the Air Force awarded production contracts in September 2013 to both contractors (Boeing and Raytheon).  The production contracts will begin with production planning for both contractors. The Air Force will then downselect in 2QFY14 and exercise production contract options on the selected vendor's contract after a successful Milestone C decision.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) This PE provides signals intelligence (SIGINT) development efforts for all USAF airborne platforms.  The funds in this PE are distributed among all Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (ASE) projects based on the development priorities established by the USAF SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG) in order to build a total SIGINT capability.  As a result, the USAF will move funds between projects periodically to develop the highest priority projects in response to urgent warfighter needs.  This PE will participate in the development, integration, testing, and implementation of international and Air Force standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.  Modernization efforts include sensors for the platforms and their appropriate interfaces with the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS).  This approach supports a synergistic development effort providing a true Air Force-wide capability.  

(U) This enterprise will use the Air Force Cryptologic Architecture (AFCA) for planning and decision-making and, in turn, employ open architecture standards whenever possible to allow maximum ease of future upgrades and system interoperability.  The primary goal of the ASE is to produce an architecture-based, capability-focused SIGINT investment strategy for the USAF.  Funds in any project may be used to fund initiatives in other projects within this PE at the discretion of the SCWG.  Funds in any project can also cover activities to include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. 

(U) This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) This project supports design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, and other efforts associated with the integration and modification of the RC-135 SIGINT sensors and their associated air and ground components. Through extensive utilization of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) based solutions to field needed capabilities, it also incurs a need for continuous Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and integration efforts consistent with the COTS technology cycle.  These efforts provide  required engineering for preliminary assessments of technical feasibility, operability, or military utility as well as specific engineering implementations integrated into the various baseline modifications.  These funds will be split between the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT, the RC-135U COMBAT SENT, and the RC-135S COBRA BALL programs.  Funding  reflects the SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG) priorities and the accomplishment of other Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (ASE) initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) This project will cover costs of SIGINT integration for high altitude intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) beginning in FY14.

(U) This project supports sensor integration and test, flight test, design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering and other efforts associated with the insertion of new capabilities integrated into the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) or other SIGINT sensors and their associated air and ground components for the High Altitude SIGINT platforms. The project also identifies suitable replacements for components affected by Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS).  This project provides the warfighter with a near-term, increased combat capability. Enhancements are implemented as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Capability improvements will be inserted into the sensors through individual development efforts that exploit signals of interest identified as service priorities by the Air Force SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG). Funding includes completion of developmental logistics tasks associated with the design, development, and integration of ASIP.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) This project supports design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, program management administration, and other efforts associated with the integration and modification of medium altitude platforms as required with SIGINT sensors and their associated air and ground components.  This RDT&amp;E effort integrates SIGINT capability on medium altitude platforms as required. The sensors will be capable of collecting technical data and geolocating signals of interest and providing sensor data to a workstation.  The design effort will include the use of existing sensor suites to the maximum extent possible to minimize design costs and reduce development timelines.  

(U) Design efforts specific to medium altitude systems may include, but not be limited to, antennas, electromagnetic interference reduction, encryption techniques, and changes to the aircraft, ground station, data link, and simulator necessary to accommodate a SIGINT payload and its data throughput.  Funding will support efforts to develop antennas, receivers, processors, software development, aircraft integration and ground station upgrades to allow a persistent reconnaissance, surveillance, targeting, and acquisition capability against mission specific threats.  Development of a networked capability for medium altitude systems will also be initiated.   These upgrades are designed to exploit signals of interest identified as service priorities by the Air Force SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG). These development activities will continue through future years, to include but not be limited to, integrating capabilities developed under separate efforts.  

(U) This project provides the warfighter with near term increased combat capability.  Enhancements are implemented as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels and exploit signals of interest identified as Service priorities by the AF SCWG.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) This project supports design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, program management administration and other efforts associated with the insertion of new capabilities integrated into ASIP and other sensors and their associated air and ground components that will be used on/by more than one platform.  The common development SIGINT project also supports development of new sensors capabilities, normalization of quick reaction capabilities, and identifies suitable replacements for components affected by Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS).  New capabilities are developed by separate projects. This project also supports the development of projects common to the Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (ASE) Program Element (PE) overall to include, but not limited to: the Air Force Cryptologic Architecture (AFCA) maintenance, modeling and simulation efforts, and NATO SIGINT efforts.

(U) Sensors development supports scalable Airborne Signals Intelligence Payloads (ASIPs) for medium altitude platforms and upgrades for ASIP high altitude payloads.  The systems' open architecture and Joint Airborne SIGINT Architecture (JASA)/ Unified Cryptologic System Technical View 1 (UCS StdY-1) compliant design supports streamlined integration of ASIP onto additional ISR platforms.  The ASIP Family of Sensors (FoS) will design and build a common/scalable SIGINT system designed for maximum coverage of the electromagnetic spectrum through the use of an integrated high and low band system.  

(U) Capability improvements will be inserted into the ASIP Family of Sensors through individual development efforts that exploit signals of interest identified as service priorities by the Air Force SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG).  This project provides the warfighter near term increased combat capability. Enhancements are implemented as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels.  Compatability improvements will be inserted into the ASIP FoS through individual development efforts that exploit signals of interest identified as Service priorities by the AF SCWG. Sensors will be integrated and tested on the various platforms as funding permits. 

(U) Some parts of ASIP Upgrades are funded within the Common Development project of this PE and some parts are funded within the High Altitude SIGINT project (675181).  Parts that have applicability to other platforms are funded in the Common Development project.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) The COMPASS BRIGHT program develops, demonstrates, and rapidly transitions advanced Air Force-specific SIGINT and Radio Frequency (RF) measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) capabilities against emerging and future target signals. It is the only USAF program that pursues SIGINT and RF MASINT technology transition. The COMPASS BRIGHT program objective is to develop technologies for application in SIGINT and RF MASINT systems/subsystems. Acquisition and production of these developed technologies will occur within the appropriate platform programs. COMPASS BRIGHT projects are selected through a data call process whereby the USAF evaluates proposals from the labs and industry to select those projects that are most promising. This program includes total government and contractor costs for these projects.

(U) FY15 will continue to enhance search and intercept capabilities, improve single aircraft geolocation, and improve real time communications systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Unfettered access to civil airspace is required for all Air Force (AF) platforms to perform their operational mission.
  
To meet that requirement, this program funds the AF Life Cycle Management Center (LCMC) Aerospace Management Systems Division (AMSD), a designated AF Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) engineering services support activity.  The AMSD provides expertise to the Air Staff, Major Command (MAJCOM), and platform program offices, manned and un-manned, on meeting civil CNS/ATM performance standards necessary to operate in the US National Airspace System (NAS) and international civil airspace.   This centralized capability supplements the MAJCOMs and over 50 AF platform program offices with resident technical CNS/ATM expertise.

The AMSD monitors and participates in government/industry technical forums responsible for international civil aviation standards for operations in sovereign airspace worldwide.  AMSD analyzes civil developing standards and works to protect AF interest.  Once documents are finalized, CNS/ATM experts identify specific technical and engineering criteria for AF stakeholders in Generic Performance Matrices (GPM).  The Air Staff and MAJCOMs determine how the AF will address these civil standards for each platform to best perform the specific AF mission.  When a material solution is required, CNS/ATM experts consider the platform design; and work with the platform program office to tailor the GPMs as needed to meet civil standards - saving time, reducing cost and risk.  Once the integration and testing is completed, the AMSD verifies and validates that CNS/ATM performance meets the standards necessary to operate in civil airspace.  This is an iterative process to address both changes in civil airspace standards and shifts in AF military operational requirements.

The AMSD manages Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for centralized procurement of CNS/ATM and Navigational Safety products.  These contracts are used by platform programs across the AF and Department of Defense (DoD), other federal agencies and in support of foreign military sales; they provide the benefits of quantity cost savings, industry-unique warranty clauses and reduced contracting actions by platforms.
 
The AMSD performs periodic audits on the processes and procedures used to develop and distribute the Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF).  This electronic navigation database, created by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), contains safety of flight critical information used by AF and DoD aircrews to fly instrument departure and arrival procedures worldwide.  AMSD's unique expertise is recognized and accepted by the NGA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), AF, and other agencies which use the DAFIF database in airborne systems.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Unfettered access to civil airspace is required for all Air Force (AF) platforms to perform their operational mission.
  
To meet that requirement, this program funds the AF Life Cycle Management Center (LCMC) Aerospace Management Systems Division (AMSD), a designated AF Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) engineering services support activity.  The AMSD provides expertise to the Air Staff, Major Command (MAJCOM), and platform program offices, manned and un-manned, on meeting civil CNS/ATM performance standards necessary to operate in the US National Airspace System (NAS) and international civil airspace.   This centralized capability supplements the MAJCOMs and over 50 AF platform program offices with resident technical CNS/ATM expertise.

The AMSD monitors and participates in government/industry technical forums responsible for international civil aviation standards for operations in sovereign airspace worldwide.  AMSD analyzes civil developing standards and works to protect AF interest.  Once documents are finalized, CNS/ATM experts identify specific technical and engineering criteria for AF stakeholders in Generic Performance Matrices (GPM).  The Air Staff and MAJCOMs determine how the AF will address these civil standards for each platform to best perform the specific AF mission.  When a material solution is required, CNS/ATM experts consider the platform design; and work with the platform program office to tailor the GPMs as needed to meet civil standards - saving time, reducing cost and risk.  Once the integration and testing is completed, the AMSD verifies and validates that CNS/ATM performance meets the standards necessary to operate in civil airspace.  This is an iterative process to address both changes in civil airspace standards and shifts in AF military operational requirements.

The AMSD manages Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for centralized procurement of CNS/ATM and Navigational Safety products.  These contracts are used by platform programs across the AF and Department of Defense (DoD), other federal agencies and in support of foreign military sales; they provide the benefits of quantity cost savings, industry-unique warranty clauses and reduced contracting actions by platforms.
 
The AMSD performs periodic audits on the processes and procedures used to develop and distribute the Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF).  This electronic navigation database, created by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), contains safety of flight critical information used by AF and DoD aircrews to fly instrument departure and arrival procedures worldwide.  AMSD's unique expertise is recognized and accepted by the NGA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), AF, and other agencies which use the DAFIF database in airborne systems.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) was created as a DoD Center of Excellence to efficiently organize, equip, train, and employ scarce resources to more effectively address the proliferation of computer crimes affecting the DoD.  DC3 has a digital forensics laboratory, training program, institute, and National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force Analytical Group.  To enable its operations, through the Defense Cyber Crime Institute (DCCI), DC3 will remain on the leading edge of computer technologies and techniques through research, development, testing and evaluation applied to digital evidence processing and computer forensic analysis; and by conducting liaison and by partnering with governmental, university, and private industry computer security officials.  DC3 will develop imaging tools, steganalysis and stegextraction tools, and password over-ride tools.  These software tools will enable DC3 to increase the probability of data recovery that would otherwise remain undetected.  The Intrusions/Intruders Signature Program (IISP) provides for the R&amp;D of products and technologies that detect trace and profile hostile cyber adversaries.  This capability provides network monitoring and the framework for sharing and automating reverse engineering techniques.   Computer Incident Batch Oriented Recursive Examination (CIBORE) is used to aid the counterintelligence and law enforcement communities to respond to computer intrusions.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) was created as a DoD Center of Excellence to efficiently organize, equip, train, and employ scarce resources to more effectively address the proliferation of computer crimes affecting the DoD.  DC3 has a digital forensics laboratory, training program, institute, and National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force Analytical Group.  To enable its operations, through the Defense Cyber Crime Institute (DCCI), DC3 will remain on the leading edge of computer technologies and techniques through research, development, testing and evaluation applied to digital evidence processing and computer forensic analysis; and by conducting liaison and by partnering with governmental, university, and private industry computer security officials.  DC3 will develop imaging tools, steganalysis and stegextraction tools, and password over-ride tools.  These software tools will enable DC3 to increase the probability of data recovery that would otherwise remain undetected.  The Intrusions/Intruders Signature Program (IISP) provides for the R&amp;D of products and technologies that detect trace and profile hostile cyber adversaries.  This capability provides network monitoring and the framework for sharing and automating reverse engineering techniques.   Computer Incident Batch Oriented Recursive Examination (CIBORE) is used to aid the counterintelligence and law enforcement communities to respond to computer intrusions.  It is also a data reduction tool that takes a large volume of data, identifies the known ?good? and ?bad? files and eliminates them from consideration, leaving several GBs of files as candidate malicious code files.    

Program ends in FY14 as funds are required to support higher Air Force priorities.

Tools are uniquely suited for consideration of both civilian generics and military specific purposes.  These software tools will enable the LE/CI community to increase the probability of data recovery that would otherwise remain undetected.  The On-Scene Triage Tool (OTT) provides special agents with the ability to obtain information immediately from a live computer at a crime scene in order to determine media relevancy to an investigation.  The TrueCrypt Detect tool  is a special purpose tool for 1st responders to rapidly search thousands of files from suspected media embedded in MP4 or MOV videos using the program TCSteg.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) is a satellite ground terminal network comprised of two communication nodes and 15 antenna systems.  The antennas are distributed around the globe at eight locations to ensure global coverage for 170 satellites in various orbits.  The AFSC conducts an average of 450 satellite contacts per day supporting Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT); Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); Missile Warning; Communications; Weather; Launch Vehicle Support; Research and Development (R&amp;D) in support of Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operations.  While most of the 450 satellite contacts/day are routine command and control activities, the AFSCN is also used for satellite emergencies (e.g. tumbling satellite) because its high power antennas are often the only earthbound assets that can contact a non-responsive satellite to re-establish command &amp; control.  In FY13 alone, the AFSCN supported 10 space vehicle emergencies resulting in the preservation of $6B worth of satellites.

In addition to routine and emergency satellite operations C2, the AFSCN provides support to launch vehicle and early orbit operations, ensuring worldwide antennas receive telemetry as the rocket travels through the atmosphere and and transmit commands to a newly orbiting satellite to initiate early orbit checkout.  Finally, the AFSCN provides Compatibility Testing (FCT) to eusuresatellites and rockets can communicate via the AFSCN before the satellite is launched.

These funds are used to develop next-generation tools to improve the AFSCN and ensure the capability is available to support DoD, Intelligence, and civil users through 2020.  

MISSION PLANNING UPGRADE: the Air Force will complete the Electronic Scheduling and Dissemination (ESD) 3.0 program, enabling worldwide antenna system scheduling to support all 170 satellites.  Satellite operators will be able to request contact time with their satellites via the shared AFSCN antennas and ESD 3.0 will de-conflict overlapping requests, create a schedule, and publish real-time to all users. FY15 funds support transition and operational turnover of ESD 3.0.

SATELLITE ANOMALY RECOVERY AND SUPPORT UPGRADE: The Air Force will complete development testing of the enhanced High Power Amplifier (eHPA) first article.  The AFSCN is in jeopardy of losing the emergency high power satellite contact capability due to obsolete parts used in the legacy AFSCN system.  The eHPA program will develop a new high power amplifier that resolves the obsolescence issue well into the 2020's.

UNIFIED S-BAND UPGRADE:  The Air Force is adjusting the AFSCN for spectrum-sharing with industry and preparing to migrate away from the current L-Band uplink/S-Band downlink spectrum to the Unified S-Band (USB) spectrum.  RDT&amp;E funds support a first article integration of USB into the AFSCN to begin supporting users that are migrating to USB.  The first article will complete the development, integration, test, and demonstration of USB on the AFSCN as a pathfinder for contemplated, future, AFSCN USB modifications.

This effort is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because it supports a fielded system.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) is a satellite ground terminal network comprised of two communication nodes and 15 antenna systems.  The antennas are distributed around the globe at eight locations to ensure global coverage for 170 satellites in various orbits.  The AFSC conducts an average of 450 satellite contacts per day supporting Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT); Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); Missile Warning; Communications; Weather; Launch Vehicle Support; Research and Development (R&amp;D) in support of Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operations.  While most of the 450 satellite contacts/day are routine command and control activities, the AFSCN is also used for satellite emergencies (e.g. tumbling satellite) because its high power antennas are often the only earthbound assets that can contact a non-responsive satellite to re-establish command &amp; control.  In FY13 alone, the AFSCN supported 10 space vehicle emergencies resulting in the preservation of $6B worth of satellites.

In addition to routine and emergency satellite operations C2, the AFSCN provides support to launch vehicle and early orbit operations, ensuring worldwide antennas receive telemetry as the rocket travels through the atmosphere and and transmit commands to a newly orbiting satellite to initiate early orbit checkout.  Finally, the AFSCN provides Compatibility Testing (FCT) to eusuresatellites and rockets can communicate via the AFSCN before the satellite is launched.

These funds are used to develop next-generation tools to improve the AFSCN and ensure the capability is available to support DoD, Intelligence, and civil users through 2020.  

MISSION PLANNING UPGRADE: the Air Force will complete the Electronic Scheduling and Dissemination (ESD) 3.0 program, enabling worldwide antenna system scheduling to support all 170 satellites.  Satellite operators will be able to request contact time with their satellites via the shared AFSCN antennas and ESD 3.0 will de-conflict overlapping requests, create a schedule, and publish real-time to all users. FY15 funds support transition and operational turnover of ESD 3.0.

SATELLITE ANOMALY RECOVERY AND SUPPORT UPGRADE: The Air Force will complete development testing of the enhanced High Power Amplifier (eHPA) first article.  The AFSCN is in jeopardy of losing the emergency high power satellite contact capability due to obsolete parts used in the legacy AFSCN system.  The eHPA program will develop a new high power amplifier that resolves the obsolescence issue well into the 2020's.

UNIFIED S-BAND UPGRADE:  The Air Force is adjusting the AFSCN for spectrum-sharing with industry and preparing to migrate away from the current L-Band uplink/S-Band downlink spectrum to the Unified S-Band (USB) spectrum.  RDT&amp;E funds support a first article integration of USB into the AFSCN to begin supporting users that are migrating to USB.  The first article will complete the development, integration, test, and demonstration of USB on the AFSCN as a pathfinder for contemplated, future, AFSCN USB modifications.

This effort is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because it supports a fielded system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This budget activity funds operational development necessary to acquire, sustain, and enhance segments of the Air Force Weather Weapon System (AFWWS).  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. Program Management Administration costs include Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, and Advisory and Assistance Service.  AFWWS provides timely, accurate, consistent and relevant space and terrestrial weather information for global battlespace situational awareness. AFWWS supports worldwide operations of Air Force and Army warfighters, Special Operation Forces, and other government agencies with weather observing and forecasting capabilities at home station and deployed locations as well as centralized, reach-back centers.  AFWWS activities align under four capability areas:  Weather Data Collection, Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination, Weather Forecasting, and Product Tailoring/Warfighter Applications.  This alignment ensures an integrated and systems-oriented approach to program management decisions.
  
Weather Data Collection provides automated terrestrial and space environmental sensing capabilities at fixed and deployed locations worldwide. Projects include Next Generation Radar and Upper Air Observing Follow-On.  FY15 funding will enhance computations based on dual-polarization technology for improved severe weather detection and rainfall amount forecasting and will begin operationalizing new upper air sounding capability using laser technology. 
 
Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination provides a net-centric infrastructure that assimilates worldwide sources of terrestrial and space weather data and produces decision-quality information for warfighters.  Improved analysis of real-time weather information supports DoD's Warfighting and Enterprise Information Environment Mission Areas as well as DoD's role in transformation of the National Airspace System through the Next Generation Air Transportation System and, finally, enhances Air Force energy security plans. In FY15 Air Force Weather-Web Services (AFW-WEBS) moves into this capability area from Weather Forecasting to better align its function of integration of net-centric capabilities. FY15 funding will continue development of incremental software enhancements and integration of improved analysis capabilities including processing of data from new environmental sensing satellite sources for DoD Data Center 14866.

Weather Forecasting provides advanced scientific numerical weather prediction capabilities for automated, high resolution forecast products for mission execution, rehearsal, and planning. Weather Forecasting includes projects for Numerical Weather Modeling, Environmental Data Cube Support System, and the Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System.  FY15 funding will continue development of software to integrate advanced terrestrial and space weather forecast capabilities to improve models for warfighter operations.  Additionally, Weather Forecasting capabilities will be expanded to integrate and exploit data from new environmental sensing satellite sources for DoD Data Center 14866. 
 
Product Tailoring/Warfighter Applications provides timely, local and regional target-scale weather information to operational commanders for a given Area of Responsibility, and at tactical levels provides front-line weather information to warfighters, including weather forces, in conduct of combat operations.  Supports the 'train as you fight' concept by assuring fixed and deployable systems have an equivalent operator look and feel via the Joint Environmental Toolkit.  FY15 funding will continue development of software for warfighter tailoring and exploitation products and integration of regional and tactical weather systems with warfighter Command and Control (C2) systems within DoD Data Centers 14866, 14861, 17037, and 17038.  These efforts will enhance the availability and integration of weather information in multiple Wings, Squadrons, Air and Space Operations Centers, Army decision processes, Air Traffic Control operations, and exploitation of weather at global, regional, and tactical levels.
  
This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>To support the Air Force worldwide flying mission, this program element funds research, development and management of new air traffic control communications, surveillance, positioning, and precision approach and landing systems.  When applicable, this includes joint efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  ATCALS funding focuses on three main efforts as follows: 

Deployable Instrument Landing System (D-ILS).  D-ILS is a deployable Category I (200ft decision height/2400ft runway visual range) ILS with remote monitoring and maintenance capabilities.  D-ILS will provide precision approach capability in adverse weather conditions for contingency operations and humanitarian or disaster relief operations.  D-ILS will replace the current Air Force mobile Precision Approach Radar (PAR) system used to support operations at deployed locations which were procured in the 1970s, are manpower intensive, and logistically unsupportable.  On average, only 18% (three of 17 systems) of the mobile PAR systems are operational on a daily basis.  D-ILS will support increased operations in the area of responsibility, allow phase out of the currently obsolete legacy systems and provide interoperability with the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF).  The D-ILS Capability Development Document (CDD) was approved by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) on 16 Sep 08.  No development funds are requested in FY15.  

As discussed under D-ILS accomplishments/plans in Section C, the D-ILS development contract was terminated on 6 Nov 13.  Using an updated Systems Requirements Document and lessons learned from the terminated effort, a restructured program is now planned and evaluation of responses to an industry request for information is on-going.  At least one production ready deployable system is available for evaluation.  Related OPAF funds are in program element (PE) 0305114F (Weapon System Code 833010).

Deployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON).  D-RAPCON will replace the 40 year old AN/MPN-14K and AN/TPN-19 Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and Operations Shelter (OPS) subsystems with state of the art digital systems.  Modification and overhaul of the existing systems has proven to be ineffective due to diminishing manufacturing sources.  The D-RAPCON will be used to provide both a terminal and enroute surveillance capability.  The D-RAPCON will also be used with the D-ILS and a fixed or mobile control tower to provide a complete air traffic control capability.  The D-RAPCON will support tactical military and worldwide humanitarian operations and also provide a capability to support domestic disaster relief.  The primary surveillance radar coverage (non-cooperative targets) is out to 60 nautical miles (nm) and the secondary surveillance radar coverage (cooperative targets) is out to 120 nm.  The D-RAPCON CDD was approved by the AFROC on 8 Feb 11.  FY15 funds continue engineering, manufacturing and development (EMD) efforts which include the contractor testing of the preproduction system and the start of developmental testing.  Related OPAF funds are in the PE 0305114F Weapon System Code 833010.  

Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  This is an interagency effort designed to enable the transition from a ground infrastructure dominated Air Traffic Management capability for the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) to a capability that leverages advances in Performance Based Navigation (PBN), non-radar based surveillance services, and transition from solid-state analogue voice communications to networked digital voice and data exchange.  Per Deputy Secretary of Defense direction (28 Dec 07 Memo), the Air Force is the DoD lead Service for NextGen implementation and architecture development.  NextGen will be built on key elements from existing programs and technologies and on new systems under development.  As these technologies and architectures mature, ground system upgrades will be coordinated and fielded concurrently with aircraft avionics capabilities that are acquired and integrated into Air Force aircraft (manned and unmanned).  These efforts will also run in close parallel with the Communication, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) program in PE 0305099F.  FY15 efforts continue proof of concept demonstrations and analysis leading to Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA).  The concept demonstration will explore development of a transportable/scalable sensor agnostic configuration to provide GBSAA Pilot-in-the-loop display services using fixed or deployable radar system inputs.  FY15 funding also continues development/test of new Instrument Procedures Development System (IPDS) software (joint effort with FAA and Services), NextGen Lead Service Office tasks which include preparation of NextGen Concept of Operations and Implementation Plans, PBN and ADS-B Benefits/Business Cases, a DoD Integrated Work Plan, RPA GBSAA Engagement Plan, and a DoD NextGen Enterprise Architecture Strategic Roadmap.  Other NextGen efforts include upgrade of surveillance radar and automation systems with new capabilities such as Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe, and evaluation of NAS Networked Digital Voice Switch and Next Generation Ground Communications (NEXCOMM) radios in USAF air traffic control facilities and RPA pilot control stations.  In total, these efforts will support the seamless integration of RPAs into the National Airspace System and the airspaces of other nations, improve the display of aircraft position to air traffic controllers, determine future requirements for digital communications with manned and unmanned aircraft, and enhance flight safety.   

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>RDT&amp;E articles are shown in year completed.  In FY15, one Deployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON) pre-produciton unit (PPU) is completed to support developmental and operational testing.  The D-RAPCON PPU is incrementally funded in FY14 and FY15.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>To support the Air Force worldwide flying mission, this program element funds research, development and management of new air traffic control communications, surveillance, positioning, and precision approach and landing systems.  When applicable, this includes joint efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  ATCALS funding focuses on three main efforts as follows: 

Deployable Instrument Landing System (D-ILS).  D-ILS is a deployable Category I (200ft decision height/2400ft runway visual range) ILS with remote monitoring and maintenance capabilities.  D-ILS will provide precision approach capability in adverse weather conditions for contingency operations and humanitarian or disaster relief operations.  D-ILS will replace the current Air Force mobile Precision Approach Radar (PAR) system used to support operations at deployed locations which were procured in the 1970s, are manpower intensive, and logistically unsupportable.  On average, only 18% (three of 17 systems) of the mobile PAR systems are operational on a daily basis.  D-ILS will support increased operations in the area of responsibility, allow phase out of the currently obsolete legacy systems and provide interoperability with the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF).  The D-ILS Capability Development Document (CDD) was approved by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) on 16 Sep 08.  No development funds are requested in FY15.  

As discussed under D-ILS accomplishments/plans in Section C, the D-ILS development contract was terminated on 6 Nov 13.  Using an updated Systems Requirements Document and lessons learned from the terminated effort, a restructured program is now planned and evaluation of responses to an industry request for information is on-going.  At least one production ready deployable system is available for evaluation.  Related OPAF funds are in program element (PE) 0305114F (Weapon System Code 833010).

Deployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON).  D-RAPCON will replace the 40 year old AN/MPN-14K and AN/TPN-19 Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and Operations Shelter (OPS) subsystems with state of the art digital systems.  Modification and overhaul of the existing systems has proven to be ineffective due to diminishing manufacturing sources.  The D-RAPCON will be used to provide both a terminal and enroute surveillance capability.  The D-RAPCON will also be used with the D-ILS and a fixed or mobile control tower to provide a complete air traffic control capability.  The D-RAPCON will support tactical military and worldwide humanitarian operations and also provide a capability to support domestic disaster relief.  The primary surveillance radar coverage (non-cooperative targets) is out to 60 nautical miles (nm) and the secondary surveillance radar coverage (cooperative targets) is out to 120 nm.  The D-RAPCON CDD was approved by the AFROC on 8 Feb 11.  FY15 funds continue engineering, manufacturing and development (EMD) efforts which include the contractor testing of the preproduction system and the start of developmental testing.  Related OPAF funds are in the PE 0305114F Weapon System Code 833010.  

Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  This is an interagency effort designed to enable the transition from a ground infrastructure dominated Air Traffic Management capability for the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) to a capability that leverages advances in Performance Based Navigation (PBN), non-radar based surveillance services, and transition from solid-state analogue voice communications to networked digital voice and data exchange.  Per Deputy Secretary of Defense direction (28 Dec 07 Memo), the Air Force is the DoD lead Service for NextGen implementation and architecture development.  NextGen will be built on key elements from existing programs and technologies and on new systems under development.  As these technologies and architectures mature, ground system upgrades will be coordinated and fielded concurrently with aircraft avionics capabilities that are acquired and integrated into Air Force aircraft (manned and unmanned).  These efforts will also run in close parallel with the Communication, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) program in PE 0305099F.  FY15 efforts continue proof of concept demonstrations and analysis leading to Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA).  The concept demonstration will explore development of a transportable/scalable sensor agnostic configuration to provide GBSAA Pilot-in-the-loop display services using fixed or deployable radar system inputs.  FY15 funding also continues development/test of new Instrument Procedures Development System (IPDS) software (joint effort with FAA and Services), NextGen Lead Service Office tasks which include preparation of NextGen Concept of Operations and Implementation Plans, PBN and ADS-B Benefits/Business Cases, a DoD Integrated Work Plan, RPA GBSAA Engagement Plan, and a DoD NextGen Enterprise Architecture Strategic Roadmap.  Other NextGen efforts include upgrade of surveillance radar and automation systems with new capabilities such as Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe, and evaluation of NAS Networked Digital Voice Switch and Next Generation Ground Communications (NEXCOMM) radios in USAF air traffic control facilities and RPA pilot control stations.  In total, these efforts will support the seamless integration of RPAs into the National Airspace System and the airspaces of other nations, improve the display of aircraft position to air traffic controllers, determine future requirements for digital communications with manned and unmanned aircraft, and enhance flight safety.   

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy for the D-ILS and D-RAPCON acquisitions included the award of competitive fixed price incentive firm contracts emphasizing off-the-shelf technology and maximizing the use of non-developmental items (NDIs).  Both contracts include a development phase with production options.  Note, the D-ILS development contract was terminated on 6 Nov 13.  

A restructured program to acquire D-ILS equipment is being developed based on procurement of an off-the-shelf system under a Foreign Comparative Test effort.

Procurement of a transportable 3D radar for ANG will be thru an existing Army contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Full-scale and subscale targets assure warfighters weapon systems will perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  Aerial Targets provide adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366 "Live Fire/Lethality" developmental/operational test requirements.  Target drones are used to validate operational missile/weapon system effectiveness and fighter Operational Flight Program (OFP) updates.  Target drones are essential for development testing/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, F-15, etc., aircraft.  The objective is to provide realistic targets for missile testing to enable the development of offensive counter-air systems (air-to-air and surface-to-air) capable of defeating changing enemy airborne threats.  This program element funds development, improvements, and updates of full-scale/subscale aerial targets and target control systems to ensure aerial targets represent enemy threat airborne systems.  Specialized target payload subsystems are developed for requirements to include but not limited to missile scoring, electronic attack, electronic countermeasures and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems.  

This program is in budget activity 7 - RDT&amp;E Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.  It provides aerial targets, target payloads, and target control systems in support of operational and developmental testing.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Full-scale aerial targets, subscale aerial targets, and companion Target Control Systems (TCS) assure the effectiveness and currency of warfighter weapon systems to combat real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  The BQM-167A Air Force Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT) is a jet powered drone aircraft measuring approximately 20 feet long with a mission to simulate threat aircraft for testing and evaluation of surface-to-air, ship-to-air, or air-to-air missiles.  The target accomplishes this mission through the use of optional payloads including chaff and flare, electronic attack, and infrared devices.  Funding supports continued improvement of launch phase performance and overall performance enhancement efforts.  Funding supports development, improvements, and updates of target control systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements to include but not limited to missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. Electronic Attack (EA) pod upgrade provides new techniques and capabilities critical to subscales to realistically emulate foreign threat systems.  TCS provides a myriad of systems that together delivers the capability to control and track mission aerial targets (full scale and subscale) and to track a mix of other critical mission participants (to include relay platforms, shooters, and the missile system under test).  In this role, TCS ensures an optimum integrated aerial target environment that enhances both weapon system assessments and companion aircrew skills, all the while assuring the full safety of mission participants throughout the conduct and fulfillment of T&amp;E objectives.  Funding supports continued improvement (modernization) of TCS capabilities to effectively meet the multi-service T&amp;E demands of current and future warfighter weapon systems.

This program is in budget activity 7 - RDT&amp;E Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.  It provides aerial targets, target payloads, and target control systems in support of operational and developmental testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Full-scale targets assure warfighters weapon systems perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  Aerial Targets support adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366, which requires major systems and munitions programs to conduct survivability and lethality testing before full-rate production.  The Aerial Targets program provides drones to satisfy "Live Fire/Lethality" developmental/operational test requirements.  Target drones are used to validate operational missile/weapon system effectiveness and fighter operational flight program (OFP) updates.  Target drones are required for developmental/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, F-15, etc., aircraft.   The United States Air Force's (USAF) Air Superiority Modernization/Mission Area Plan has identified aerial targets as a capability shortfall; the QF-16 program will fulfill this requirement.  Funding supports continued development of the follow-on full-scale aerial target (QF-16) and simulators, development, improvements, and updates of target control systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements such as: missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems.  Electronic Attack (EA) pod upgrade provides new techniques and capabilities critical to QF-16s to realistically emulate foreign threat systems.

This program is in budget activity 7 - RDT&amp;E Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.  It provides aerial targets, target payloads, and target control systems in support of operational and developmental testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) conducts specialized investigative activities and force protection support for Air Force (AF) commanders worldwide. This assists AF commanders in protecting their people and resources.  AFOSI's mission includes investigating criminal  matters affecting AF personnel, contract fraud and economic crimes involving AF weapons systems and spare parts, the investigation of environmental crime, counterdrugs, computer intrusion detection and forensic media analysis of computer crimes. This element supports Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM), Computer Crime Investigations (CCI), and technical support to criminal and counterintelligence investigations and operations conducted by AFOSI. AFOSI's TSCM mission conducts counterintelligence investigations for both AF and DoD facilities and programs in order to deter and detect technical surveillance operations conducted by Foreign Intelligence Services to compromise classified or sensitive information.   The purpose of CCI research is to improve AF and DoD Information Operations capability by enhancing AFOSI's ability to deter or prevent spies, hackers, or saboteurs from manipulating, damaging, or stealing sensitive war fighting data or systems.  Failing that, to investigate, identify, and prosecute those who do.  While most research to meet operational requirements is Operational System Development, there is also research in the category of Engineering and Manufacturing Development due to a need for modifications to present technology.  The equipment required to provide technical support to investigations is unique and complex. This equipment must be continually updated to provide state-of-the-art capabilities to detect and neutralize criminal activities targeted against the AF and DoD. In an era of advancing technology, reduced manning, and increasingly high level fraud, environmental crime and computer crime investigations, technical investigative equipment must be continuously updated to enable AFOSI special agents to have the most cost effective and best possible means of thwarting criminal acts. The evolution of a new wave of computer crimes has made AFOSI responsible for the collection, investigative analysis, national level law enforcement coordination, and dissemination of hacker activity and intrusion incidents for the Air Force. AFOSI's computer crime equipment must stay on the leading edge of technology to collect criminal information as well as pursue and apprehend criminals through a global medium. AFOSI must continually update its existing high tech computer surveillance equipment to support ongoing and future investigative operations to identify hackers and hacker groups, as well as potential hostile government activities targeting Air Force communication and control systems.    Critical Infrastructure Protection identifies weaknesses in the Air Force Critical infrastructure, highlights critical countermeasures and acquires and deploys cost-effective solutions.  The intent is to provide an Air Force-wide review of current infrastructure vulnerabilities; prioritize AF protection planning and integrate with existing programs; identify gaps based on AF needs; direct studies to refine AF requirements.     

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) conducts specialized investigative activities and force protection support for Air Force (AF) commanders worldwide. This assists AF commanders in protecting their people and resources.  AFOSI's mission includes investigating criminal  matters affecting AF personnel, contract fraud and economic crimes involving AF weapons systems and spare parts, the investigation of environmental crime, counterdrugs, computer intrusion detection and forensic media analysis of computer crimes. This element supports Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM), Computer Crime Investigations (CCI), and technical support to criminal and counterintelligence investigations and operations conducted by AFOSI. AFOSI's TSCM mission conducts counterintelligence investigations for both AF and DoD facilities and programs in order to deter and detect technical surveillance operations conducted by Foreign Intelligence Services to compromise classified or sensitive information.   The purpose of CCI research is to improve AF and DoD Information Operations capability by enhancing AFOSI's ability to deter or prevent spies, hackers, or saboteurs from manipulating, damaging, or stealing sensitive war fighting data or systems.  Failing that, to investigate, identify, and prosecute those who do.  While most research to meet operational requirements is Operational System Development, there is also research in the category of Engineering and Manufacturing Development due to a need for modifications to present technology.  The equipment required to provide technical support to investigations is unique and complex. This equipment must be continually updated to provide state-of-the-art capabilities to detect and neutralize criminal activities targeted against the AF and DoD. In an era of advancing technology, reduced manning, and increasingly high level fraud, environmental crime and computer crime investigations, technical investigative equipment must be continuously updated to enable AFOSI special agents to have the most cost effective and best possible means of thwarting criminal acts. The evolution of a new wave of computer crimes has made AFOSI responsible for the collection, investigative analysis, national level law enforcement coordination, and dissemination of hacker activity and intrusion incidents for the Air Force. AFOSI's computer crime equipment must stay on the leading edge of technology to collect criminal information as well as pursue and apprehend criminals through a global medium. AFOSI must continually update its existing high tech computer surveillance equipment to support ongoing and future investigative operations to identify hackers and hacker groups, as well as potential hostile government activities targeting Air Force communication and control systems.    Critical Infrastructure Protection identifies weaknesses in the Air Force Critical infrastructure, highlights critical countermeasures and acquires and deploys cost-effective solutions.  The intent is to provide an Air Force-wide review of current infrastructure vulnerabilities; prioritize AF protection planning and integrate with existing programs; identify gaps based on AF needs; direct studies to refine AF requirements.     

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Market Research is accomplished jointly within the DoD, Counterintelligence, and Law Enforcement communities with the various government laboratories and major defense contractors to identify locations with the ability to develop investigative tools unique to our mission needs.  These technologies, capabilities, and limitations of current and future investigative tools is sometimes highly sensitive or classified.  Market Research also allows inter-agency coordination and deconfliction to occur, reducing or eliminating duplicitous development efforts. Annually, stakeholders meet to discuss initiatives, challenges and organizational goals to coordinate or consolidate requirements to increase efficiency.  Once Market Research and any applicable coordination/deconfliction is completed, acquisition channels are analyzed and selected based on the ability to meet operational and technical security requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The Open Skies Treaty allows signatories to conduct observation flights over each other's territory using fixed-wing, unarmed observation aircraft. Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras. Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states," The United States shall begin budgeting no later than Fiscal Year 2014 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors. (U)" Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, frequently unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured.  In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Arms Control Activities activation under the New Start Treaty drives the need to modify approximately 28 B-52s to a conventional only role by removing the Nuclear Code Enable Switch and associated equipment. This requires a complete design to remove the equipment from the aircraft and install metal plates prohibiting reinstallation of removed equipment to comply with treaty protocols.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15).  The Open Skies Treaty allows signatories to conduct observation flights over each other's territory using fixed-wing, unarmed observation aircraft. The aircraft can use optical cameras, video cameras, sideways-looking synthetic aperture radar, and infrared line scanning devices.  There are 34 participating states to the Open Skies Treaty.  The Air Force is required to allow over flight of USAF bases per multilateral request; to acquire, operate, and maintain the aircraft and equipment utilized during over flights of partner countries; to provide required sensor media and initial media processing; and to provide airfield servicing, logistics, and maintenance for foreign over flights of the US.

Open Skies Sensors - Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras.  Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states," The United States shall begin budgeting no later than Fiscal Year 2014 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors. (U)" Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, frequently unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured.  In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock. Furthermore, the ultimate imagery product customer desires digital format products. This camera replacement program will replace the wet film cameras with modern, digital cameras. Modern, digital cameras will be more reliable, maintainable and cost effective. The customer will be able to more readily use the imagery products. Equipment service life will be extended significantly.

Test articles will be procured for the purpose of developental testing and to support Treaty certification of the sensors.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MUE program awarded three competitive MUE technology demonstration contracts to develop and produce Ground-Based GPS Receiver Application Module (GB-GRAM-M) (ground) and GRAM-S/M (aviation) receiver form factors to mature the five critical technology elements (CTEs), test and demonstrate these CTEs in a relevant environment to achieve Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, and subject the prototypes to the Government's pilot security certification and performance evaluation processes. To further reduce technology and manufacturing risk in MGUE Increment 1, the three contractors will continue risk reduction activities under the MUE completion effort.  This activity is a two part effort: (1) Refining software to resolve any deficiencies revealed during Functional Qualification Testing (FQT) and independent government test &amp; evaluation, and (2) Initiating ASIC modifications to accommodate new updates to GPS system ICDs. This effort will conclude shortly before MGUE Increment 1 PDR, ensuring each contractor has completed discovery and technology maturation in preparation for entry into the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development phase.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>GPS OCS upgrade was competitively awarded to a single contractor (Lockheed Martin) in July 1995. Block IIF satellite and IIF ground systems development contract was competitively awarded to a single contractor (Boeing) in April 1996.  The Single Prime Initiative (SPI) consolidated these efforts and was added to the Boeing IIF contract (with Lockheed Martin as a subcontractor) on 1 Oct 1999.  GPS Modernization efforts Block IIR were awarded sole-source to Lockheed Martin under a new contract in August 2000. Modernization efforts for Block IIF were added to the existing contract with Boeing in 2002 as Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) develops and acquires systems to:  operate experimental, demonstration, and operational satellites; operate a fixed and deployable satellite ground system enterprise; perform satellite compatibility testing; act as the focal point and center of expertise for DoD experimental and demonstration space and missile operations; support space and missile R&amp;D; and conduct/support experimental/demonstration space and missile Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) activities.  RDSMO consists of the Space Test and Operations organization at Kirtland AFB which is the focal point for (1) the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) installed in the RDT&amp;E Support Complex (RSC) at Kirtland AFB, NM which operates R&amp;D satellites, and the 1st Space Operations Squadron (1 SOPS) at Schriever AFB, CO which operates operational satellites; (2) satellite ground system enterprise development and integration and (3) deployable test systems which deploy mobile antennas worldwide to support space RDT&amp;E activities. 

FY15 funds include incremental development and establishment of new capabilities for the MMSOC, systems engineering, special studies, integration and test efforts in support of demonstrations and operational architectures designed to increase operations and maintenance efficiency and resiliency for global satellite command and control through military and commercial capabilities.  

The main objective of MMSOC is to develop the capability to rapidly support R&amp;D and operational systems and to transition R&amp;D space vehicle technology with residual military utility to operational status for immediate warfighter support. MMSOC is a multiple mission operation system that uses standard software to (1) perform satellite command and control (C2) in support of launch requirements; (2) develop and test tactics, techniques, procedures and concepts to conduct satellite operations; (3) provide a satellite C2 incremental block evolution resource for RDT&amp;E of new systems and concepts; and (4) deliver operational flexibility for new and currently flying assigned satellites.    

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) develops and acquires systems to:  operate experimental, demonstration, and operational satellites; operate a fixed and deployable satellite ground system enterprise; perform satellite compatibility testing; act as the focal point and center of expertise for DoD experimental and demonstration space and missile operations; support space and missile R&amp;D; and conduct/support experimental/demonstration space and missile Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) activities.  RDSMO consists of the Space Test and Operations organization at Kirtland AFB which is the focal point for (1) the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) installed in the RDT&amp;E Support Complex (RSC) at Kirtland AFB, NM which operates R&amp;D satellites, and the 1st Space Operations Squadron (1 SOPS) at Schriever AFB, CO which operates operational satellites; (2) satellite ground system enterprise development and integration and (3) deployable test systems which deploy mobile antennas worldwide to support space RDT&amp;E activities. 

FY15 funds include incremental development and establishment of new capabilities for the MMSOC, systems engineering, special studies, integration and test efforts in support of demonstrations and operational architectures designed to increase operations and maintenance efficiency and resiliency for global satellite command and control through military and commercial capabilities.  

The main objective of MMSOC is to develop the capability to rapidly support R&amp;D and operational systems and to transition R&amp;D space vehicle technology with residual military utility to operational status for immediate warfighter support. MMSOC is a multiple mission operation system that uses standard software to (1) perform satellite command and control (C2) in support of launch requirements; (2) develop and test tactics, techniques, procedures and concepts to conduct satellite operations; (3) provide a satellite C2 incremental block evolution resource for RDT&amp;E of new systems and concepts; and (4) deliver operational flexibility for new and currently flying assigned satellites.    

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) fulfills the warfighter's requirements for worldwide threat warning and situational awareness information with timely production and simultaneous dissemination of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) derived combat information. It also provides target tracking data to support threat avoidance, targeting, force protection, and situational awareness. This information is continually refined in near real time by strategic, operational and tactical sensors.

This PE funds IBS modernization programs as described below: 
- A Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) on UHF satellite channel using a Common Message Format (CMF) and a MIL-STD Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) compliant waveform and Line of Sight (LOS) using the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT). 

- IBS-Network Services (IBS-NS) includes two Global IBS Network Servers (GINS) and four Theater Interface Nodes (TINs) to support the geographic Combatant Commanders, all built to validated warfighter requirements.
 -- Two GINS receive data from each theater and integrate this data into a worldwide picture available to all network/broadcast users. 
-- Four regional TINs allow local and out-of-theater users (not directly receiving IBS broadcast) to receive the CIB information broadcast.  Additionally, the TIN will receive and inject data into the CIB for producers without access to the theater CIB. 

Funds modernization of evolving suite of interoperable planning and decision support capabilities comprised of software hardware and communication products.  This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Eastern Range (ER) at Patrick Air Force Base (AFB)/Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL, and the Western Range (WR) at Vandenberg AFB, CA, make up the Spacelift Range System (SLRS), also known as the Launch and Test Range System (LTRS).  The ER and WR provide tracking, telemetry, communications, flight safety, and other capabilities to enable: national security, civil, and commercial space launches, ballistic missile and missile defense test launches and aeronautical and guided weapons tests.  Decreasing reliability of aging range systems leads to higher operations and maintenance costs and increased risk of launch delays.  

RDT&amp;E funds are required to conduct architecture analysis to optimize investment planning to meet operational availability.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Eastern Range (ER) at Patrick Air Force Base (AFB)/Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL, and the Western Range (WR) at Vandenberg AFB, CA, make up the Spacelift Range System (SLRS), also known as the Launch and Test Range System (LTRS).  The ER and WR provide tracking, telemetry, communications, flight safety, and other capabilities to enable: national security, civil, and commercial space launches, ballistic missile and missile defense test launches and aeronautical and guided weapons tests.  Decreasing reliability of aging range systems leads to higher operations and maintenance costs and increased risk of launch delays.  

RDT&amp;E funds are required to conduct architecture analysis to optimize investment planning to meet operational availability.

The SE&amp;I contractor maintains the DoDAF architecture and requirements baseline for Government approval and may perform studies to determine Government options. Limited RDT&amp;E will be applied to the LISC contract when sustaining engineering expertise is needed to finalize Government-approved architectures.  The Air Force is increasing small business participation by expanding small business opportunities via the LISC contract.  FFRDC technical depth and breadth will be leveraged to ensure all twelve subsystems are compatible with mission rules and do not pose a risk to safe and cost-effective satellite launches.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2013, Project 674820, Sensor Development, includes new start efforts.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) established the Senior Year Program in 1955. The program has evolved to include the U-2 airframe, engines, sensors, cameras, recorders, data links, life support systems, test facilities and equipment. The U-2S model airframes were constructed in the late 1980s, with the last aircraft rolling off the assembly line in 1989. The U-2S provides global reconnaissance signals intelligence (SIGINT) and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) 24 hours a day, seven days a week in support of national and DoD worldwide missions. The U-2 is currently deployed to forward operating locations (FOL) around the world. Modifications to the aircraft are required to ensure continued operations.

In 2012, the Air Force decided to retain the U-2 weapon system capability instead of retiring it.  Prior to 2012, the U-2 weapon system fell under the "sunset clause" IAW Title 10 U.S.C 2244a, Equipment Scheduled For Retirement Or Disposal: Limitation On Expenditures For Modifications, stating that modifications to any aircraft (i.e., a given tail number), weapon, or other item of equipment that the SECAF plans to retire or otherwise dispose of within five years after the date on which the modification would be completed, are prohibited.  Therefore, many required modifications to address diminishing manufacturing sources or vanishing vendor items were not accomplished.

The U-2 Program will continue to address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues and support U-2 integration of other payload and capability development activities. Activities also include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution, and studies supporting analysis and investment in future U-2 program planning. In FY16, the AF may start divestiture.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) established the Senior Year Program in 1955. The program has evolved to include the U-2 airframe, engines, sensors, cameras, recorders, data links, life support systems, test facilities and equipment. The U-2S model airframes were constructed in the late 1980s, with the last aircraft rolling off the assembly line in 1989. The U-2S provides global reconnaissance signals intelligence (SIGINT) and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) 24 hours a day, seven days a week in support of national and DoD worldwide missions. The U-2 is currently deployed to forward operating locations (FOL) around the world. Modifications to the aircraft are required to ensure continued operations.

In 2012, the Air Force decided to retain the U-2 weapon system capability instead of retiring it.  Prior to 2012, the U-2 weapon system fell under the "sunset clause" IAW Title 10 U.S.C 2244a, Equipment Scheduled For Retirement Or Disposal: Limitation On Expenditures For Modifications, stating that modifications to any aircraft (i.e., a given tail number), weapon, or other item of equipment that the SECAF plans to retire or otherwise dispose of within five years after the date on which the modification would be completed, are prohibited.  Therefore, many required modifications to address diminishing manufacturing sources or vanishing vendor items were not accomplished.

The U-2 Program will continue to address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues and support U-2 integration of other payload and capability development activities. Activities also include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution, and studies supporting analysis and investment in future U-2 program planning. In FY16, the AF may start divestiture.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2015, 675372, Integrated Sensor is Structure, was completed.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE focuses USAF efforts on long endurance platforms that provide days, months, or years of endurance and their associated sensors and communications suites.  Efforts include, but are not limited to, optionally piloted airships, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPAs), or more standard aircraft platforms flown as manned or unmanned. 

The Integrated Sensor Is Structure (ISIS) project was planned to develop a radar that is fully integrated into a station-keeping, stratospheric airship. ISIS was intended to support the nation's need for persistent wide-area surveillance, tracking, and engagement of time-critical air and ground targets. Automated surveillance and tracking included air targets to the radar horizon of 600 km and all ground targets to a range of 300 km. The radar aperture was intended to provide track data directly to users in-theater.

The Medium Altitude Global ISR and Communications (MAGIC) project develops a multiple-day, medium altitude ISR unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to provide long endurance surveillance with a multiple sensor payload.  This concept was initiated by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) as a Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) in the 3rd Quarter FY 2010 with a competition between five defense industry partners.  Aurora Flight Sciences' Orion Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) concept was chosen as the JCTD candidate by OSD/Director of Defense, Research and Engineering (DDR&amp;E) per the recommendation of the Combatant Commands.  The MAGIC/Orion RPA initiative was subsequently released from the JCTD process and transitioned to the Air Force as the sponsor of this developmental initiative in the 3rd Quarter FY 2011.  The Air Force is scheduling the second flight series for Aurora Flight Sciences' Orion RPA after having completed a first flight at NAWS China Lake, CA on 24 Aug 2013.

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2015, 675372, Integrated Sensor Is Structure, was completed.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Integrated Sensor Is Structure (ISIS) Program intended to develop a radar fully integrated into a station-keeping stratospheric airship.  ISIS was intended to support the nation's need for persistent wide-area surveillance, tracking, and engagement of time-critical air and ground targets.  Automated surveillance and tracking objectives included air targets to the radar horizon of 600 km and all ground targets to a range of 300 km.  The radar aperture also was intended to provide track data directly to users in-theater.  The objective system was planned to launch from CONUS locations with a multi-year operational life.  

DARPA funded development of the prototype in FY09-12. Air Force contributed funding from FY10-FY14 to this joint DARPA/Air Force project. This project included completion of the designs for the radar, propulsion, power systems, and the airframe, but was focused on demonstrating the ability to manufacture and demonstrate performance objectives of the radar and material objectives of the airship. The radar elements and airship materials were scheduled to be demonstrated in FY 2014.

Funds also covered studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution and future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Medium Altitude Global ISR and Communications (MAGIC) project is an Air Force led technology and concept development to test the ability for a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) to stay aloft in the medium altitude structure for a multiple day duration mission with a minimum of 1,000 pounds payload capacity of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance sensor systems.  The MAGIC concept was initiated by OSD/DDR&amp;E in FY 2010 in response to the COCOMs ranking this type of initiative as the highest priority for a Joint Concept and Technology Demonstration (JCTD).   In FY 2011, the Air Force accepted this initiative as the sponsor and MAGIC was subsequently removed from consideration as a JCTD and transitioned into the Air Force as a developmental project.  

Data gathered from the development of the MAGIC project will support end-to-end long endurance ISR planning.  Persistent ISR supports both regular and irregular warfare.  The challenge to supporting regular and irregular warfare is the integration of legacy ISR architectures with emerging end-to-end infrastructures.  The MAGIC project will provide the USAF with critically needed data regarding sensor and aircraft performance parameters at a multiple day duration at medium altitude flight.  This data will augment the persistent ISR study completed by ACC and AFMC in 2nd Quarter FY 2011 and the AF/A9 Endurance UAV study completed in 3rd Quarter FY 2012.  This project is designed to address the requirement laid out in two separate Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONs) for long dwell and persistent ISR.  The objectives laid out in the JCTD competition and selection of Aurora Flight Sciences' Orion RPA is being honored by the Air Force.  The test objectives for the Orion RPA MAGIC project is for a flight duration of five days (120 hours) with a minimum sensor payload of 1,000 pounds flown at 20,000 feet altitude.

In FY 2010, OSD/DDR&amp;E (now ASD/R&amp;E) provided $5M of initial funding to AFRL to initiate the MAGIC project.  In FY 2011, ASD/R&amp;E provided an additional $5M to keep the MAGIC project development moving forward.  The Air Force followed suit and provided $10M of FY 2011 Below Threshold Reprogramming (BTR) to allow the Aurora Flight Sciences' Orion RPA development team to set up an operational endurance engine bench test and software integrations lab in preparation for a future five-day duration flight demonstration of the Orion RPA.  Congressional Adds of $19M in FY 2012 and $50M in FY 2013 provided the Endurance UAV program manager with the funding needed for the continuation of the Orion RPA development and flight testing through the 120-hour duration demonstration projected for mid to late FY 2014.    

In January 2012, Aurora Flight Sciences at their Manassas, VA facility performed a 123 hour duration endurance engine bench test.  In December 2012, Aurora Flight Sciences assembled the Orion RPA to begin a series of ground testing efforts in preparation for the first flight series of tests projected to be conducted at NAWS China Lake, CA in the 4th Quarter FY 2013.  All the electrical and avionics continuity checks, to include multiple engine runs and low speed taxi tests, were completed by May 2013.  The Orion RPA and associated ground systems were shipped to NAWS China Lake, CA in July 2013 for the first flight series testing; first flight was accomplished on 24 August 2013.  The Orion RPA reached an altitude of 8,000 feet altitude during the 3.5 hour inaugural sortie.  Additional flight testing continues with the long endurance objective flight demonstration of 120 hour duration carrying a payload of 1,000 pounds to 20,000 feet projected for June or July 2014.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Medium Altitude Global ISR and Communications (MAGIC) initiative is being executed by the 645 AESG (BIG SAFARI SPO) to develop a COCOM requested long endurance remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) to address urgent operational needs for long dwell, persistent ISR requirements.  The acquisition strategy for the Air Force to develop a long endurance, persistent ISR capability for the COCOMs was an outgrowth of a Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) started in FY 2010.  Efforts concerning this initiative, contracted with Aurora Flight Sciences and their Orion RPA, include:  completion of studies analysis, development of a prototype air vehicle, bench testing of engines and other aircraft components, ground continuity testing of select avionics, flight controls, and engine components, slow and high speed ground taxiing and first flight testing.  Next milestone for this initiative will be to complete a series of shorter duration flight tests to determine the full flight envelope airworthiness and capabilities of the Orion RPA with a culmination of a 120 hour duration flight demonstration projected for June or July of 2014.  Concurrent efforts will continue through FY 2014 between the Aurora Flight Sciences production and management teams and the BIG SAFARI SPO to identify best of breed sensor systems and the availability of government furnished equipment (GFE) to fulfill the proposed payload configurations for this developmental project.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Airborne Reconnaissance Systems program coordinates the development of advanced airborne reconnaissance system technologies (sensors, data links, targeting networks and products, and quick reaction capabilities) in support of multiple airborne reconnaissance platforms, both manned and unmanned.  Its objective is to develop, demonstrate, and rapidly transition advanced, interoperable, multi-platform solutions to reduce the find, fix, target, and track kill chain timeline.  In addition, it provides for modeling/simulation, training and systems engineering.  This program also coordinates the development of common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near-real time Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). 

Funds in any project can also cover activities to include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The purpose of the Imaging and Targeting Support (I&amp;TS) program is to develop and demonstrate next-generation, persistent, wide area surveillance, aircraft avoidance, and common imagery reconnaissance sensor capabilities (radar and electro-optical systems), including sensor data processing, for multiple airborne platforms, as well as sensor products to aid in rapid targeting (geolocation models, sensor-based exploitation tools, sensor networking capabilities).  

Developmental efforts pursued are improved sensor capabilities (such as hyperspectral imagery (HSI), measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT), polarimetric imaging, ground moving target indication, foliage penetration, and additional radar, electro-optical, and other modalities), increased geolocation accuracy, increased dismount detection capability, advanced sensor data correlation, automated target detection, network centric warfare, and other Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and associated Tasking Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities, to reduce both target search and kill chain timelines, as well as supporting traditional intelligence activities. This project will also increase interoperability among developed systems by developing common standards and tools. 

The funds in this project, less OCO and Congressional adds, are distributed in priority order for the goal of building a comprehensive Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities and requirements based on strategic roadmaps.  Projects advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year.  

Traditional focus areas include, but are not limited to: development and demonstration of common radar and electro-optical sensors (Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Low Frequency SAR, and antenna, Electo-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), HSI, Low Light, Laser Radar (LADAR), Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) and their operational modes (High Resolution Imagery, Moving Target Indication, Dismount Detection, Persistent Surveillance, Wide Area Motion Imagery, Spectral Identification) for multiple airborne platforms, including medium and high altitude platforms; development and demonstration of advanced tactical sensor and associated TPED processing algorithms and tools (automatic registration, automatic and assisted target detection, network centric warfare).  Development of integrated multi-sensor capabilities to detect and identify obscured targets (OT); development and implementation of imagery standards (Common Ground/Dismount Moving Target Indicator (GMTI/DMTI), National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF); and monitoring and enhancement of Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) product quality (radar and EO/IR imagery, GMTI data, and spectral information) and timeliness throughout the image chain (from sensor to user).  These efforts focus on reducing the find, fix and track elements of the time critical targeting kill-chain timeline while improving operator and decision-maker efficiency and effectiveness.     

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  Includes total government and contractor costs for this project.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a center of technical excellence to support Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) programs within the services.  The mission includes Service-specific and Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) programs throughout DoD. The JTC/SIL provides a Government testbed for interoperability, rapid prototyping, technology insertion and transition, systems engineering, modeling/simulation, training and C4ISR optimization. The cornerstone of JTC/SIL's diverse tool set is the Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE), which is the DoD simulation/training system of choice for many UAS and ISR systems. The MUSE is also known as the Air Force Synthetic Environment for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (AFSERS) in its Air Force application.  The MUSE/AFSERS simulates Air Vehicles, Sensors, Datalinks, Takeoff and Landing Systems, and to some degree, surrogate UAS ground stations, when actual UAS ground stations are unavailable. 

The Services and combatant commanders have a requirement for the capability to train with a system that provides a real-time simulation environment containing multiple intelligence systems that can be integrated with larger force-on-force simulations. The MUSE creates a realistic operational environment which supports the ability to assess military utility, architecture and concept of employment development, and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) refinement, conduct emerging concepts experimentation, and optimize C4ISR within warfighting exercises and experiments. It is the preferred simulation system used by the combatant commanders and Joint Services to support command and battle staff C4ISR training.

The MUSE/AFSERS also creates a realistic operational environment that supports: an embedded training capability for multiple Program Managers; tools to minimize acquisition and life cycle cost and schedule impacts; ability to conduct emerging concepts experimentation, future systems exploration, systems integration, and technology insertion; applications for Joint and Service-specific warfighting exercises; and C4ISR optimization.

MUSE/AFSERS is currently in use within all Services and most unified commands simulating Predator, Reaper, Global Hawk, Gray Eagle, Hunter, and Shadow, national and commercial satellite collectors, P-3, JSTARS, and the U-2. During warfighting exercises, the JTC/SIL integrates imagery simulations with associated C4ISR systems to support execution of critical imagery processes. For those assets normally not available for training, the JTC/SIL provides surrogate systems and interfaces. Distributed training environments, virtually linking participants from various locations worldwide, are routinely supported within the MUSE architecture. The MUSE/AFSERS is also used as a mission rehearsal tool for current, on-going military combat operations.

The JTC/SIL supports the OSD UAS Task Force staff and the Standards and Interoperability Integrated Product Team, as well as the joint team working the Ground Segment Interface (GSI).  The JTC/SIL is the primary custodian of this interface and in that role performs various supporting tasks including development of tools for helping the definition and execution of open architecture for joint service ground control systems, developing and maintaining standardization agreement (STANAG) 45 joint interoperability tasks to be defined on an annual basis.  

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and project execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Gorgon Stare Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) supports the Combatant Commander (COCOM) urgent operational need for wide area airborne surveillance capability and is managed in the Air Force through the BIG SAFARI Systems Program Office (645th Aeronautical Systems Group), Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance and Special Operations Forces (ISR&amp;SOF) Directorate, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Air Force Materiel Command.  Development of the Gorgon Stare QRC system provides a podded wide area airborne sensor suite integrated on dedicated MQ-9 Reaper Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) to provide a city-sized surveillance capability for the COCOMs.  The Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM 106-08, dated 27 May 2008) approved the Air Force concept for a program plan to address Service requirements for broad area airborne sensors capability on existing manned and unmanned aircraft system platforms.  This plan evolved into the current incremental delivery of ten pod sets of Gorgon Stare QRC carried on MQ-9 Reaper RPAs.  The acquisition strategy for this Air Force QRC podded sensor suite solution includes delivery of incremental capability upgrades, with development of each capability upgrade expanding the capabilities of the previous increment.  Provisions to consider integrating pre-planned product improvements (P3I) and/or multi-INT enhanced capabilities to address evolving and emerging technology advancements are within the scope of the acquisition strategy.

P3I efforts being conducted with FY14 Congressional Add funding includes merging capabilities such as Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Near Vertical Direction Finding (NVDF) with Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI).  Funds spent on NVDF will provide a ramp for follow-on actions.

Activities also include studies and anlysis to support both current program planning and execution as well as future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Partner with industry to procure improved, baseline deployable, supportable hyperspectral imaging (HSI) sensor systems.  The systems should support the joint warfighter and ensure evolutional upgrade capability.  Complete production sensor deliveries using the Advanced Technology Support Program process developed by Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)'s Defense MicroElectronics Activity (DMEA) at McClellan AFB, CA.  All future contracts will be awarded by Air Force Life Cycle Management Center.  The contractors should provide a disciplined design process that is the lowest risk solution (cost, schedule, and performance) and ensures logistics support with initial test spares and associated source data to support training and technical order (TO) development.  

ACES HY: The MQ-1 developers will be included for sensor technology efforts as they mature and for planning possible future integration on other platforms.  ACES HY utilizes a competitively selected, cost plus fixed fee prime contract to Raytheon (Mc Kinney, TX) for system production and a sole source Basic Ordering Agreement with Raytheon (McKinney, TX) for system modificaions. 

Acquisition strategy for high-altitude HSI remains TBD.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) capabilities paired with Near Vertical Direction Finding (NVDF) capabilities in support of Combatant Command (COCOM) requirements for end-to-end persistent surveillance to provide airborne sensor suites, data links, and associated ground support elements for city-sized and similar WAMI surveillance capabilities on manned and unmanned aircraft.  

This project was aligned to respond to COCOM's greater need for wide area surveillance.  Quick reaction capability (QRC) has been delivered in the near term while allowing time for DoD to incorporate lessons learned from previously initiated QRC activities into this WAMI project.  Continued development of critical wide area surveillance technologies will support existing QRCs supporting various aircraft size, weight, and power configurations, sensor performance attributes, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) architectures, and operational missions.  Pre-program planning activities will continue to support formal Air Combat Command (ACC) Program of Record (PoR) activities.  

Activities also include studies, analysis, and technology development, maturation, and demonstration to support current and future program planning and execution.  Includes total government and contractor costs for this project.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Dismount Detection Radar (DDR) project designs, develops, integrates, tests, fields, and sustains Ground Moving Target Indicator/Dismount Moving Target Indicator (GMTI/DMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) capability for improved dismount and moving target detection, identification, tracking, and classification. DDR is advancing Open Systems Architecture (OSA) in the area of sensors and mission systems.  DDR includes associated Tasking Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities, and will be applicable to other combatant command (COCOM) GMTI requirements.  DDR is designed to address COCOM and Central Command's dismount detection requirements. The DDR program also studies, develops, tests, and implements new concepts, hardware and software capabilities that can be leveraged by the OSA design in the radar and associated TPED for GMTI, and various technical analysis/studies to support future advanced radar development. 

Activities also include studies, analysis, and technology development, maturation, and demonstration to support current and future program planning and execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

After a ~100 day protest, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) denied all protest allegations allowing the Prime Contractor, Raytheon, to begin the design and development of the radar system in June 2012.  The radar design included an OSA approach, which will be demonstrated when MIT/LL develops and integrates an advanced mode into the radar system.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The RC-135 Operational Systems Development and enhancement activities project supports design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, and other efforts associated with the integration and modification of the RC-135 programs and their specialized mission systems, both air and ground.  Extensive utilization of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) based solutions allows rapid fielding of needed capabilities through continuous technology refresh cycles and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS)/vanishing vendor items (VVI) logistics mitigation efforts.  The results of these efforts provide for preliminary assessments of technical feasibility, operability, or military utility as well as specific engineering implementations for integration into the various systems baseline configurations.  

These activities are managed by the Air Force through the 645th Aeronautical System Group (645 AESG), BIG SAFARI Systems Program Office (SPO), Aeronautical Systems Center, Air Force Materiel Command, Wright Patterson AFB, OH.  BIG SAFARI manages engineering, ground and support systems modifications, integration, flight testing, product assurance, acceptance testing, logistics, and training activities.  

Aircraft, sensor systems, and associated ground support system engineering planned for FY 2015 include support for the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT Baseline 12, the RC-135U COMBAT SENT Baseline 5 and the RC-135S COBRA BALL Baseline 5 configurations.  The world-wide challenge of keeping pace against technologically agile targets used by both nation and non-nation-state adversaries and the rapid evolution of COTS technologies demands a responsive and adaptive acquisition strategy for fielding baseline capabilities that are logistically supportable at all locations.  BIG SAFARI uses an incremental baseline strategy to mitigate risk, find affordable solutions and field needed capabilities on the aircraft and ground support and training systems.  Obsolescence and diminished manufacturing sources/vanishing vendor items (DMS/VVI) are addressed with each baseline upgrade and annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.  

RIVET JOINT Baseline 12 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, increased digital signal exploitation, increased digital signal recorder bandwidth, enhanced spatial processing/exploitation, enhanced weather radar, AF-DCGS interoperability, operator work station 3-D map projection, and new steerable beam antenna.

COMBAT SENT Baseline 5 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, continued Communications, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Required Navigational Performance (RNP) compliant cockpit avionics enhancements, active ranging and geolocation capability, cooling duct improvements, precision electronic intelligence (ELINT) (CORVUS system) super wideband compressive receiver, RJ Baseline 11 COMINT, wideband global satellite (WGS) communications enhanced integration, and communications upgrade to include Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS-J).

COBRA BALL Baseline 5 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, RJ Baseline 11 COMINT, Medium-Wave Infra-Red Acquisition (MIRA) sensor/processor upgrade, MASINT Collection System (MCS) optical upgrade, WGS communications enhanced integration, communications upgrade to include MIDS-J, continued CNS/ATM and RNP compliant cockpit avionics enhancements.         

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fielding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RC-135 RIVET JOINT, COBRA BALL, and COMBAT SENT aircraft are maintained and kept technologically relevant through a baseline/incremental upgrade acquisition strategy.  Technology refresh and quick reaction capability (QRC) developments are acquired through the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group (AESG) (BIG SAFARI Systems Program Office) in accordance with the BIG SAFARI Program Management Directive (PMD), and the BIG SAFARI Class Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) document for acquisition of supplies and services using "other than full and open competition" criteria.  The supplies and services procured by 645 AESG under their standing J&amp;A to satisfy National Security (FAR 6.302-6) or individually prepared J&amp;A for Unusual and Compelling Urgency (FAR 6.302-2) requirements are supported by the BIG SAFARI Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) across the full spectrum of system life cycle management from developmental engineering to system retirement ("cradle to grave") support.  Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging Combatant Commander requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>AF Distributed Common Ground Systems (DCGS) is a network-centric weapon system capable of tasking Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors and receiving, and providing the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) capability for data, information and intelligence from airborne, national, and commercial platforms and sensors. The weapon system consists of numerous active duty, Air National Guard, and mission partner sites interconnected by a robust communications infrastructure that allows collaborative reach-back operations.  Operators correlate collected Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) data to provide decision-quality information to the Joint Task Force (JTF) and below, including significant support to time-critical targeting. AF DCGS is the primary PED capability for the U-2, Global Hawk, Predator, Reaper and Project Liberty.

AF DCGS is modernizing through sustainment by integrating the necessary technologies and tools to provide increased capabilities and meet emerging and urgent operational needs.  These efforts will also integrate commercial and government furnished equipment upgrades to provide current technologies and achieve necessary application services.  The next series of upgrades will meet the operational need to integrate new and/or improved sensor capabilities.  They will also enhance interoperability by migrating to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)and improving data sharing ability per DoD direction.

The DCGS Data Compression effort provides the warfighter a capability to efficiently compress and decompress airborne ISR sensor data and transmit near real-time to tactical users through current and future bandwidth limited commercial satellite communications (SATCOM) or military SATCOM.  The effort will develop, test and implement new sensor data compression and decompression algortihms for current and emerging airborne ISR sensors.  Additionally, the program develops compression and decompression capabilities for manned and unmanned airborne platforms, associated ground stations, and DCGS.   Outputs will meet standard certification for use within the DoD GEOINT and MASINT architectures.

Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>AF Distributed Common Ground Systems (DCGS) is a network-centric weapon system capable of tasking Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors and receiving and providing the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) capability for data, information and intelligence from airborne, national, and commercial platforms and sensors. The weapon system consists of numerous active duty, Air National Guard, and mission partner sites interconnected by a robust communications infrastructure that allows collaborative reach-back operations.  Operators correlate collected Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) data to provide decision-quality information to the Joint Task Force (JTF) and below, including significant support to time-critical targeting. AF DCGS is the primary PED capability for the U-2, Global Hawk, Predator, Reaper and Project Liberty.

AF DCGS is modernizing through sustainment by integrating the necessary technologies and tools to provide increased capabilities and meet emerging and urgent operational needs.  These efforts will also integrate commercial and government furnished equipment upgrades to provide current technologies and achieve necessary application services.  The next series of upgrades will meet the operational need to integrate new and/or improved sensor capabilities.  They will also enhance interoperability by migrating to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and improving data sharing ability per DoD direction.

Program actions are categorized by four distinct efforts. The GEOINT effort provides the capability for Planning, Collecting, Processing, Analysis and Dissemination (PCPAD) of imagery intelligence.  The Systems Release effort provides this capability for SIGINT. The Data Links effort provides Line-of-Site (LOS) and Satellite Communications (SATCOM) capabilities that allow AF DCGS to send and receive information between airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) assets and the AF DCGS weapon system. The Network Communications effort involves modernizing AF DCGS infrastructure to improve data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities while migrating the network toward a cloud architecture.
 
AF DCGS also participates in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Per direction of USD(AT&amp;L), the Global Hawk program was restructured from the original project 675144 (Baseline) into multiple projects: (1) Block 30, (2) Block 40, (3) Ground Segment/Communications System, and (4) Common Airborne Sense and Avoid (C-ABSAA).  Prior year funds in the amount of $2031.377M were accounted for in project 675144.

In FY15 and beyond, the RQ-4 Block 30 project 675145 includes budget necessary for enterprise management, test and evaluation, management services and fielding support for projects 675145, 675146 (Block 40) and 675147 (Ground Segment/Comm System).  This reflects contracting/acquisition strategy for these common elements within the Global Hawk program.  Projects 675148 (C-ABSAA) and 67RTIP (MP-RTIP) reflect separate costs as they are separately managed/supported programs.
 
The Cost to Complete and Total Cost for MDAP projects in this program element are documented in the R3. Total Cost on the R2 is not reflective of the total cost for MDAP projects since the R2 does not account for prior years funding for previous program element.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element funds six (6) related Air Force projects sharing the Global Hawk platform in common:  the Global Hawk Baseline (Block 10/20) sub-program, the RQ-4 Block 30 sub-program, the RQ-4 Block 40 sub-program, the RQ-4 Ground Segment/Communications System subprogram, the Common Airborne Sense &amp; Avoid (C-ABSAA) sub-program, and the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP).

Global Hawk:

The Global Hawk Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios.  This funding supports the development of Global Hawk aircraft, payloads, ground and support segments.  The RQ-4B Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) is the successor to the Block 10 RQ-4A, and is designed to employ 3,000 pounds of payload and enable multi-intelligence (multi-INT) collecting.  The Block 20 employs the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) payload. 

Block 30 (Project Number 675145) employs upgraded Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors known as the Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS) and the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) sensor. Activities include mission planning development and testing, adverse weather capability development and testing, airspace and interoperability updates, airframe/sensor upgrades and Next Generation Sensor integration. In FY15 and beyond, the RQ-4 Block 30 project 675145 includes budget necessary for enterprise management, test and evaluation, management services and fielding support for projects 675145, 675146 (Block 40) and 675147 (Ground Segment/Comm System) as well as program protection projects, studies and analysis supporting future system enhancements. This reflects contracting/acquisition strategy for these common elements within the Global Hawk program.  

The Block 40 (Project Number 675146) will integrate the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) radar sensor. In FY15 and beyond, the RQ-4 Block 40 project 675146 includes the Block 40 delta costs for the development of adverse weather capability development and testing, mission planning development and testing, airspace integration activities including IFF Mode 5 and ADS-B, airframe and sensor software and interoperability enhancements to the Block 40 fleet.  

The Ground Station Modernization (GSM)/Communication System Modernization (CSM) Project Number 675147 includes the GSM, CSM and Next Generation Communication System.  The ground segment includes the Mission Control Element (MCE) and the Launch and Recovery Element (LRE).  As a result of the reinstatement of the Block 30s in the FY15 PB, the operational need for ground stations increased and drives the need for a GSTR that is planned to be re-initiated with phase 2 in FY16 in support of 20 year operational lifecycle. CSM and Next Generation Communications are planned for development and testing in FY18 and out.

When judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.  Studies and activities may be initiated to explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF UAs Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS).  

The Global Hawk program will maintain capability and interoperability for Blocks 20/30/40 including efforts with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms such as  the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation &amp; Dissemination (PED) elements.

Common Airborne Sense &amp; Avoid (C-ABSAA): 
The C-ABSAA funding supports design, development, integration, and testing of an Airborne Sense and Avoid capability for Group 3-5 UAS on a yet to be determined Threshold Platform.  Ongoing activities include technology development and maturation, sub-system integration and risk reductions activities. C-ABSAA is a separate ACAT II program in the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase of the acquisition lifecycle, supports the "Worldwide Operations" Key Performance Parameter (KPP) found in larger UAS requirement documents, and provides the ability for UAS integration into the National Airspace System (NAS) and full worldwide UAS operations across all mission environments. This is a continuation of efforts which began in FY10 under OSD PEC, 64400D.  This project does not support platform specific integration or testing.

Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP):
The MP-RTIP sensor was designed as a family of modular, scalable sensors that provide next generation capabilities to support sustainable network centric operations with integrated Command and Control Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) capability. MP-RTIP provides the Global Hawk Block 40 aircraft with advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Moving Target Indicator (MTI) sensor capabilities.

This project includes all MP-RTIP design, development, test, and integration efforts onto the GH Block 40 platform. Integration activities include platform integration of the MP-RTIP sensor and sustainment logistics planning support. MP-RTIP studies and development insertion include the implementation of Maritime Modes (MM), High Range Resolution (HRR) modes, electronic protection, technical refresh, product improvements and other advanced capabilities.  

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and future modes development based on user requirements. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This funding also supports aircraft systems modernization to include continuing aircraft operations surety for information assurance and mission critical repair of test Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). 

The Global Hawk program will maintain capability and interoperability for Block 30 including efforts with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms, such as the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation &amp; Dissemination (PED) elements.

Activities include mission planning development and testing, adverse weather capability development and testing, airspace and interoperability updates, airframe and software upgrades and deficiency report resolution across Global Hawk fleet, ASIP and EISS sensor upgrades, integration activities associated with Next Generation Sensor capability including the comparison of how differences in flight performance would affect sensor performance, program protection projects, and studies and analysis supporting future system enhancements.  

When judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.  Likewise, studies and activities may be initiated to explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF UAS Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>1. The Global Hawk Block 40 Sub-Program was directed by an ADM signed 14 Jun 2011 by USD (AT&amp;L). At the time of the ADM signature, and subsequent designation of sub-program projects, the FY11 and FY12 budgets had already been finalized within DoD.  The FY11 and FY12 budgets for all sub-programs are captured under the Global Hawk Baseline sub-program, as its related Project (675144) was the core project for the Global Hawk program prior to the directed restructure.

2. Since the FY13 President's budget directed divesture of all Block 30 efforts, Block 40 activities were fully burdened with enterprise managment, flight test and management servies in FY13 and 14. The FY15 PB funds the Block 30s for their full planned lifecycle and includes budget necessary for enterprise management, test and evaluation, management services and fielding support for projects in Project Number 675145. The Block 40 Project Number 675146 contains delta costs specific to Block 40 development/modernization.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Hawk Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios.  

RDT&amp;E funding in this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of items needed to meet Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) for Block 40 aircraft, including integration and test of the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) sensor.  Associated Block 40 airworthiness certifications are included in this effort.  The Block 40 program provides critical Synthetic Aperture Radar and Ground Moving Target Indicator data to the warfighter.

This funding also supports continued aircraft/communications systems modernization to include Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5, Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADSB), mission planning upgrade development and testing, program protection projects, adverse weather capability, and reliability and maintainability improvements.  Funding continues MP-RTIP sensor integration and integration of upgraded radar SW and capabilities deferred to post Block 40 IOT&amp;E. 

In FY15 and beyond, the RQ-4 Block 40 project 675146 includes the delta costs only for the development of above capabilities with the RQ-4 Block 30 project, 675145.  The RQ-4 Block 30 project, 675145, also contains the budget necessary for enterprise management, test and evaluation, management services and fielding support for the fleet.  
 
When judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.  Likewise, studies and activities may be initiated to explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF UAS Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS).

The Global Hawk program will maintain capability and interoperability for Block 40 including efforts with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms, such as the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation &amp; Dissemination (PED) elements.

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting future system enhancements, current and future program planning, and project execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Northrop Grumman Corporation is the prime contractor. Development efforts are contracted on a legacy EMD contract which is being phased out with the completion of current efforts, and on the follow on IDIQ contract that was awarded May 2013 for future modernization efforts.  The next major planned programmatic event is a Milestone C decision (date TBD).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>1. The Global Hawk Ground Segment/Communications System Sub-Program was directed by an ADM signed 14 Jun 2011 by USD (AT&amp;L). At the time of the ADM signature, and subsequent designation of sub-program projects, the FY11 and FY12 budgets had already been finalized within DoD.  The FY11 and FY12 budgets for all sub-programs are captured under the Global Hawk Baseline sub-program, as its related Project (675144) was the core project for the Global Hawk program prior to the directed restructure.

2.  Ground Segment Modernization (GSM) was initiated to resolve significant obsolescence issues in the ground station in order to support a 20 year planned operational lifecycle for the Block 20/30/40 fleet; this effort was contracted in phases.  The FY13 PB proposed divestiture of the Block 30s and ACC resolved to divest of the Block 20 BACN aircraft within the FYDP leaving only the Block 40s.  As a result of the reduced ground segment requirements, the GSM effort was halted in favor of a Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) only approach which leveraged the equipment from Block 30 ground stations planned for divesture.  As a result of the reinstatement of the Block 30s in the FY15 PB, the operational need for ground stations increased making a DMS only strategy unfeasible; GSM will be re-initiated with phase 2 in FY16.
 
3.  The FY14 President's Budget (PB) reflected a continuation of the proposed Block 30 program divesture.  The FY15 PB funds the Block 30s in support of the full planned lifecycle and resumes funding of the GSM and Communications System Modernization (CSM) efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Hawk Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios.  

RDT&amp;E funding in this project supports design, development, integration and testing of the Ground Segment and the Communication System Modernization in support of the planned 20 year operational lifecycle and next generation communications system.  GSM solves fleet grounding DMS issues associated with legacy ground segment equipment and provides critical warfighter capabilities such as multi-aircraft control and net-ready KPP requirements.  CSM also resolves critical DMS issues in the GH communication infrastructure and provides communication enhancements across all five primary comm links.   

When judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.  Likewise, studies and activities may be initiated to explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF UAS Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS).

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting future system enhancements, current and future program planning and project execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In two related Acquisition Decision Memoranda signed by USD(AT&amp;L) in January and June 2011, the Global Hawk program was directed to restructure into four major sub-programs: (1) Global Hawk baseline, (2) Block 30, (3) Block 40, and (4) Ground Station Re-Architecture (GSRA)/Communications System Re-Architecture (CSRA). The AF created this Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) line item to accommodate inclusion of required capability to meet warfighter needs beyond those requirements satisfied in the directed sub-programs.  In April 2013 the AF transitioned this line item from a Global Hawk platform-specific program to a platform-agnostic capability for Group 4-5 Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), scalable to Group 3 UAS.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>RDT&amp;E funding in this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of a Common Airborne Sense and Avoid(C-ABSAA) capability for Group 3-5 Unmanned Aircraft Systems(UAS) on a yet to be determined Threshold Platform.  Ongoing activities include technology development and maturation, sub-system integration and risk reduction activities. C-ABSAA is a separate ACAT II program in the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase of the acquisition lifecycle, supports the "Worldwide Operations" Key Performance Parameter (KPP) found in larger UAS requirement documents, and provides the ability for UAS integration into the National Airspace System (NAS) and full worldwide UAS operations across all mission environments. Funding covers the Common Airborne Sense and Avoid development activities as well as program infrastructure and other government costs. Platform specific integration and testing is not included.

Activities also include C-ABSAA related studies and analysis supporting current and future C-ABSAA system capabilities, program planning and project execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The C-ABSAA program has integrated Better Buying Power 2.0 initiatives throughout its acquisition strategy and relies upon acquisition of government data rights to maximize contractor competition from Technology Development through Production.  The program uses an evolutionary acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with a capability for Group 3-5 UAS with increased, time-phased capability improvements as technology and risks achieve satisfactory levels.  Group 3-5 UAS platforms will be required to integrate the C-ABSAA provided capability into their unique systems.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>The Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) program was previously funded by program 0207450F (MP-RTIP) from FY05 through FY08.  Beginning in FY09 funding was transferred to program 0305220F (RQ-4) Global Hawk.  Therefore, the data in this package includes only FY09 and subsequent funding related to program 0305220F.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MP-RTIP sensor was designed as a family of modular, scalable sensors that provide next generation capabilities to support sustainable network centric operations with integrated Command and Control Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) capability. MP-RTIP provides the Global Hawk (GH) Block 40 aircraft advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Moving Target Indicator (MTI) sensor capabilities.

This project includes all MP-RTIP design, development, test, and integration efforts on the GH Block 40 Platform. Integration activities include platform integration of the MP-RTIP sensor and sustainment support including logistics planning support. MP-RTIP studies and development insertion include the implementation of Maritime Modes (MM), High Range Resolution (HRR) modes, electronic protection, technical refresh, product improvements and other advanced capabilities.

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and future modes development based on user requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) is the Air Force program of record responsible for developing core technologies and sub-nodal analysis tools to horizontally and/or vertically integrate network collaborative Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems within and across intelligence disciplines. Operational uses of core technologies would include, but are not be limited to, Signals Intelligence to Signals Intelligence (SIGINT-SIGINT) correlation and Ground Moving Target Indicator to Signals Intelligence (GMTI-SIGINT) correlation. Operational uses of sub-nodal analysis tools would include, but are not be limited to, determining which nodes of the adversary's Command,Control,Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects, and modeling execution plans to determine the need to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points in order to redirect activities based on changing battlefield conditions. NCCT software applications employ Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate sensor cross-cues and collection activities. NCCT correlation and fusion services ingest collection data to produce a single, composite track (geo-location and identification) for high-value targets. NCCT research and development funding supports evolutionary development of the NCCT message set and network management systems (Operations Interfaces, Network Controller, Fusion Engines, Data Guard, Interface to Command &amp; Control, and Interface to Overhead Intelligence Operations), the migration of the NCCT technologies to emerging network centric technologies (Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and web services), and satisfying DoD standards and Information Assurance requirements.  

NCCT Core Technology develops the hardware and software to horizontally integrate Joint and Coalition dissimilar Battle Management, Command &amp; Control (BMC2), and ISR assets and systems into integrated target tracks shared across networked platforms. NCCT Core Technology includes, but is not limited to, network management software, operator interfaces, standard network messages and formats, correlation software and data rules of interaction, NCCT multi-level security hardware and software items, and platform specific Platform Interface Modules (PIMs). Current NCCT-enabled systems include, but are not limited to, the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT, EC-130H, COMPASS CALL, Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) SIGINT components, Falconer Aerospace Operations Centers (AOC), MC-12W Liberty Project Aircraft (LPA), Forward Processing/Exploitation/Dissemination (FPED), Gorgon Stare, Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar (VADER), and Overhead Intelligence Operations (OIO). Prospective Coalition, Joint or Service systems are required to fund their respective integration, unique core technology improvements/upgrades to support system integration.

Information Operations Battle Management (IOBM) and the SUTER Program System (SPS) develop concepts, Tactics/Techniques/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network. SPS's planning, execution and assessment capability is implemented in a distributed operations architecture taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR, non-kinetic, and/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets. Impacting these target sets can be achieved by "attacking" or influencing/shaping links, nodes or end points in the network to include: RF and terrestrial links, switches, routers, hubs, servers, IP addresses, cell phones, antennas, radars, microwave relays, SATCOM receivers, transceivers, etc. The three main pieces of the SPS CONOPS include: first, the use of SPS's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second, the SPS's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs, JIOWC, etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third, via SPS's combined network Common Operating Picture (COP), all involved "players" monitor the plan's execution, provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities, provide continuous assessment/updates of the execution of the plan, and, within authorities (Rules of Engagement/ROEs), re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions. SPS is the technology that assists COCOMs and Components to exercise synchronized dynamic Command and Control (C2) of ISR, kinetic and non-kinetic Joint operations against conventional and terrorist threat networks. SPS provides decision makers and operators supporting airborne, ship-borne, cyber and land- based C2ISR platforms and at supporting locations continuous Predictive Battle-space Awareness (PBA) of the information superiority fight. It also incorporates the machine-to-machine capabilities that rapidly synchronize the employment of kinetic weapons, non-kinetic weapons and ISR assets to target challenging threat systems responsively. SPS depicts a dynamic, multi-security-level picture of current and predicted threat network status, capitalizing on data inputs from sources such as NCCT and Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS). SPS provides a COP that can be tailored to support the integration of ISR, kinetic, and non-kinetic composite target packages supporting COCOM and Component specified information superiority effects and objectives.

The NCCT program is categorized as Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) is the Air Force program of record responsible for developing core technologies and sub-nodal analysis tools to horizontally and/or vertically integrate network collaborative Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems within and across intelligence disciplines. Operational uses of core technologies would include, but are not be limited to, Signals Intelligence to Signals Intelligence (SIGINT-SIGINT) correlation and Ground Moving Target Indicator to Signals Intelligence (GMTI-SIGINT) correlation. Operational uses of sub-nodal analysis tools would include, but are not be limited to, determining which nodes of the adversary's Command,Control,Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects, and modeling execution plans to determine the need to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points in order to redirect activities based on changing battlefield conditions. NCCT software applications employ Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate sensor cross-cues and collection activities. NCCT correlation and fusion services ingest collection data to produce a single, composite track (geo-location and identification) for high-value targets. NCCT research and development funding supports evolutionary development of the NCCT message set and network management systems (Operations Interfaces, Network Controller, Fusion Engines, Data Guard, Interface to Command &amp; Control, and Interface to Overhead Intelligence Operations), the migration of the NCCT technologies to emerging network centric technologies (Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and web services), and satisfying DoD standards and Information Assurance requirements.  

NCCT Core Technology develops the hardware and software to horizontally integrate Joint and Coalition dissimilar Battle Management, Command &amp; Control (BMC2), and ISR assets and systems into integrated target tracks shared across networked platforms. NCCT Core Technology includes, but is not limited to, network management software, operator interfaces, standard network messages and formats, correlation software and data rules of interaction, NCCT multi-level security hardware and software items, and platform specific Platform Interface Modules (PIMs). Current NCCT-enabled systems include, but are not limited to, the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT, EC-130H, COMPASS CALL, Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) SIGINT components, Falconer Aerospace Operations Centers (AOC), MC-12W Liberty Project Aircraft (LPA), Forward Processing/Exploitation/Dissemination (FPED), Gorgon Stare, Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar (VADER), and Overhead Intelligence Operations (OIO). Prospective Coalition, Joint or Service systems are required to fund their respective integration, unique core technology improvements/upgrades to support system integration.

Information Operations Battle Management (IOBM) and the SUTER Program System (SPS) develop concepts, Tactics/Techniques/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network. SPS's planning, execution and assessment capability is implemented in a distributed operations architecture taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR, non-kinetic, and/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets. Impacting these target sets can be achieved by "attacking" or influencing/shaping links, nodes or end points in the network to include: RF and terrestrial links, switches, routers, hubs, servers, IP addresses, cell phones, antennas, radars, microwave relays, SATCOM receivers, transceivers, etc. The three main pieces of the SPS CONOPS include: first, the use of SPS's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second, the SPS's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs, JIOWC, etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third, via SPS's combined network Common Operating Picture (COP), all involved "players" monitor the plan's execution, provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities, provide continuous assessment/updates of the execution of the plan, and, within authorities (Rules of Engagement/ROEs), re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions. SPS is the technology that assists COCOMs and Components to exercise synchronized dynamic Command and Control (C2) of ISR, kinetic and non-kinetic Joint operations against conventional and terrorist threat networks. SPS provides decision makers and operators supporting airborne, ship-borne, cyber and land- based C2ISR platforms and at supporting locations continuous Predictive Battle-space Awareness (PBA) of the information superiority fight. It also incorporates the machine-to-machine capabilities that rapidly synchronize the employment of kinetic weapons, non-kinetic weapons and ISR assets to target challenging threat systems responsively. SPS depicts a dynamic, multi-security-level picture of current and predicted threat network status, capitalizing on data inputs from sources such as NCCT and Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS). SPS provides a COP that can be tailored to support the integration of ISR, kinetic, and non-kinetic composite target packages supporting COCOM and Component specified information superiority effects and objectives.

The NCCT program is categorized as Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The NCCT Core Technology and Suter (IOBM) capabilities are developed, maintained and sustained with baseline/incremental upgrades plus any Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) developments acquired through the 645th Aeronautical System Group (BIG SAFARI System Program Office/SPO) in accordance with the BIG SAFARI Program Management Directive (PMD) and the BIG SAFARI Class Justification and Authorization (J&amp;A) documents for acquisition of supplies and services.  The procured supplies and services are supported by the BIG SAFARI Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) across the full spectrum of system life cycle management -- developmental engineering to system retirement ("cradle to grave" support concept).  Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging/evolving Combatant Commander requirements.

645th AESG, Wright Patterson AFB OH, manages the Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts used to develop Suter and the NCCT Core Technology.  645th AESG will develop NCCT Core Technology and Suter software on common hardware for systems and platforms designated to field this ISR capability.  Individual program management offices may contract directly with their prime contractors or through the 645th AESG for integration of these ISR capabilities on their respective systems and platforms.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Common Data Link (CDL) provides the DoD standard for interoperable, multi-service, multi-agency, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) datalinks for 10,000+ DoD manned/unmanned airborne and ground platforms.  As the DoD CDL Executive Agent (EA), the Air Force is responsible for cross-service application of CDL RDT&amp;E Military Intelligence Program (MIP) funds facilitating compliance to Congressional and DoD mandates. The EA develops, modifies, distributes, and maintains specifications for the CDL waveform family; ensuring design configuration control, commonality, and interoperability among ISR platforms. Additionally, funds support managing resources allocated for development, maturation, and migration of CDL technologies. 

CDL enables compliance with OSD and Congressional mandates to effectively utilize spectrum, use approved cryptographic equipment, and provide direct support to current operations.  CDL is a vital link in DoD's existing and emerging communication architectures, providing flexibility to accommodate Command and Control (C2) data and myriad types of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), and Full-Motion Video (FMV) data.  The CDL specifications permit current and future ISR asset operations worldwide by providing sensor data directly via point-to-point broadcast to ground sites, airborne platforms and dismounted users.  Also, CDL provides the capability to relay data via air-to-air or compatible satellite links when the asset and ground site are not in line-of-sight. 

CDL's research and development activities support a broad swath of tactical, operational, and strategic ISR users and include achieving higher data rates, multi-access and multi-node network management, crypto modernization, advancements needed to operate in contested environments, terminal and antenna design enhancements, operations in other spectral bands, and improving spectrum efficiency.  Further, CDL development improves large area surveillance missions while supporting continuous improvements and implementation of line-of-sight platform and CDL terminal Command and Control (C2), plus increased ISR (C2ISR) capabilities.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support current and future requirements documentation, program planning and execution. CDL prototype terminal designs provide for future technology insertion and reduce non-recurring engineering and life-cycle costs to the user. 

In addition, the Gigabit Encryption thrust enables CDL to develop a miniaturized gigabit rate Communication Security (COMSEC) device capable of managing CDL data.  The miniaturized COMSEC device will allow faster throughput while reducing Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Common Data Link (CDL) provides the DoD standard for interoperable, multi-service, multi-agency, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) datalinks for 10,000+ DoD manned/unmanned airborne and ground platforms.  As the DoD CDL Executive Agent (EA), the Air Force is responsible for cross-service application of CDL RDT&amp;E Military Intelligence Program (MIP) funds facilitating compliance to Congressional and DoD mandates. The EA develops, modifies, distributes, and maintains specifications for the CDL waveform family; ensuring design configuration control, commonality, and interoperability among ISR platforms. Additionally, funds support managing resources allocated for development, maturation, and migration of CDL technologies. 

CDL enables compliance with OSD and Congressional mandates to effectively utilize spectrum, use approved cryptographic equipment, and provide direct support to current operations.  CDL is a vital link in DoD's existing and emerging communication architectures, providing flexibility to accommodate Command and Control (C2) data and myriad types of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), and Full-Motion Video (FMV) data.  The CDL specifications permit current and future ISR asset operations worldwide by providing sensor data directly via point-to-point broadcast to ground sites, airborne platforms and dismounted users.  Also, CDL provides the capability to relay data via air-to-air or compatible satellite links when the asset and ground site are not in line-of-sight. 

CDL's research and development activities support a broad swath of tactical, operational, and strategic ISR users and include achieving higher data rates, multi-access and multi-node network management, crypto modernization, advancements needed to operate in contested environments, terminal and antenna design enhancements, operations in other spectral bands, and improving spectrum efficiency.  Further, CDL development improves large area surveillance missions while supporting continuous improvements and implementation of line-of-sight platform and CDL terminal Command and Control (C2), plus increased ISR (C2ISR) capabilities.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support current and future requirements documentation, program planning and execution. CDL prototype terminal designs provide for future technology insertion and reduce non-recurring engineering and life-cycle costs to the user. 

In addition, the Gigabit Encryption thrust enables CDL to develop a miniaturized gigabit rate Communication Security (COMSEC) device capable of managing CDL data.  The miniaturized COMSEC device will allow faster throughput while reducing Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) is an OSD special interest program.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>U.S. participation in NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) was ratified by Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) signature/approval of the NATO AGS Program Memorandum of Understanding (PMOU) in June 2009. The PMOU went into effect in Sept 2009 when 15 nations, including the United States, financially committed to support procurement and delivery of the NATO Commander's number one priority to the warfighter.  Canada withdrew in August 2011, leaving 14 participating nations.  Poland recently requested accession which will bring the participating nations back to 15.  

In FY 2012, OSD transferred the NATO AGS project to the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for management and execution. The NATO AGS project funds the U.S. share of the cost for NATO to acquire an air-to-ground ground surveillance capability, improvements to the radar, and U.S. support of NATO AGS-related activities. Operations and continuing support will be funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package funded within the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). 

The AGS system will be a NATO-owned and operated airborne ground surveillance capability that provides continuous, wide area surveillance information in all weather conditions for use at the strategic, operational and tactical levels of command. Interoperable with other national assets, AGS will provide NATO decision makers with near real time, continuous information and situational awareness concerning friendly, neutral, and opposing ground and maritime forces to support mission planning and execution, including force protection and targeting. 

The NATO AGS Program includes:  an air segment consisting of five (5) NATO-developed air vehicles, incorporating elements of the USN Triton (previously Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS)) command and control architecture and the U.S. Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) radar; a unique exportable configuration; a ground segment for data exploitation and distribution that consists of fixed-based site and transportable/mobile ground stations; establishment and operation of a management organization; development of operations and support concepts; and definition and establishment of an initial support capability.  As part of the U.S. government agreement with NATO AGS Management Agency (NAGSMA), the U.S. will integrate Maritime Moving Target and Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar capability into the MP-RTIP radar for NATO AGS. This design and development includes correcting deficiencies, flight testing on the modes and system level performance validation. 

System level configuration changes include a unique configuration to allow for export of the system. 

Deliveries are planned for 2016-2017. Follow-on sustainment and operations will be supported by all 28 NATO nations through their contributions of funding to the program. Mission elements will support two orbits. The Main Operating Base (MOB) air vehicles and mission C2 will be located at Naval Air Station Sigonella, Italy. Exploitation at the MOB will be developed by Selex. EADS and Selex will develop the transportable and mobile general ground stations. 
 
The program, managed by NAGSMA, is composed of design, development, demonstration, and production, as well as Initial In-Service Support (IISS). While the current program includes IISS, the current Direct Commercial Sale (DCS) contract with Northrop Grumman does not include these tasks.

The DCS contract between Northrop Grumman and NAGSMA was signed on 20 May 2012. This funding is the U.S. cost share for the acquisition of the NATO airborne ground surveillance capability as well as the cost share associated with the IISS. IISS and In-Service Support (ISS) will be contracted under separate action. It is anticipated that ISS costs will be commonly funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package, using the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). This funding also includes developmental activity for MP-RTIP to include additional functionality and configuration requirements, studies and analysis related to mission security and exportability, and current and future program planning, project execution, engineering, and program management support to NATO.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>NATO AGS is an OSD special interest program.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>U.S. participation in NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) was ratified by Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) signature/approval of the NATO AGS Program Memorandum of Understanding (PMOU) in June 2009. The PMOU went into effect in Sept 2009 when 15 nations, including the United States, financially committed to support procurement and delivery of the NATO Commander's number one priority to the warfighter.  Canada withdrew in August 2011, leaving 14 participating nations.  Poland recently requested accession which will bring the participating nations back to 15.  

In FY 2012, OSD transferred the NATO AGS project to the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for management and execution. The NATO AGS project funds the U.S. share of the cost for NATO to acquire an air-to-ground ground surveillance capability, improvements to the radar, and U.S. support of NATO AGS-related activities. Operations and continuing support will be funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package funded within the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). 

The AGS system will be a NATO-owned and operated airborne ground surveillance capability that provides continuous, wide area surveillance information in all weather conditions for use at the strategic, operational and tactical levels of command. Interoperable with other national assets, AGS will provide NATO decision makers with near real time, continuous information and situational awareness concerning friendly, neutral, and opposing ground and maritime forces to support mission planning and execution, including force protection and targeting. 

The NATO AGS Program includes:  an air segment consisting of five (5) NATO-developed air vehicles, incorporating elements of the USN Triton (previously Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS)) command and control architecture and the U.S. Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) radar; a unique exportable configuration; a ground segment for data exploitation and distribution that consists of fixed-based site and transportable/mobile ground stations; establishment and operation of a management organization; development of operations and support concepts; and definition and establishment of an initial support capability.  As part of the U.S. government agreement with NATO AGS Management Agency (NAGSMA), the U.S. will integrate Maritime Moving Target and Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar capability into the MP-RTIP radar for NATO AGS. This design and development includes correcting deficiencies, flight testing on the modes and system level performance validation. 

System level configuration changes include a unique configuration to allow for export of the system. 

Deliveries are planned for 2016-2017. Follow-on sustainment and operations will be supported by all 28 NATO nations through their contributions of funding to the program. Mission elements will support two orbits. The Main Operating Base (MOB) air vehicles and mission C2 will be located at Naval Air Station Sigonella, Italy. Exploitation at the MOB will be developed by Selex. EADS and Selex will develop the transportable and mobile general ground stations. 
 
The program, managed by NAGSMA, is composed of design, development, demonstration, and production, as well as Initial In-Service Support (IISS). While the current program includes IISS, the current Direct Commercial Sale (DCS) contract with Northrop Grumman does not include these tasks.

The DCS contract between Northrop Grumman and NAGSMA was signed on 20 May 2012. This funding is the U.S. cost share for the acquisition of the NATO airborne ground surveillance capability as well as the cost share associated with the IISS. IISS and In-Service Support (ISS) will be contracted under separate action. It is anticipated that ISS costs will be commonly funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package, using the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). This funding also includes developmental activity for MP-RTIP to include additional functionality and configuration requirements, studies and analysis related to mission security and exportability, and current and future program planning, project execution, engineering, and program management support to NATO.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element contains Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) Family of Systems interoperability efforts for which the AF is lead service. The DCGS Family of Systems, including AF DCGS, was directed to migrate to a net-centric DoD Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) enterprise enabling the Services to operate and share intelligence products more effectively in a joint environment.  All Services must pursue a common path based on a set of common enterprise services consistent with the Department's net-centric vision while maintaining flexibility to support the full range of warfighter missions.  Specifically, DoD charged the Air Force to lead the development, upgrade, integration, and test of common DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) enterprise services.  The DIB is a set of enterprise standards and services that enable interoperability and component reuse.  All the military services are mandated to incorporate DIB interoperability standards and commit to DIB architecture as the migration path to common DCGS enterprise services. 

The Distributed Common Ground Systems-Imagery (DCGS-I) Testbed is an integration and test environment, used by the Services and Agency DCGS program offices to conduct integration of DCGS components and test interoperability interfaces with new sensors, applications, and net-centric operations. This testbed also supports the integration and testing of DoD DCGS components prior to introduction into the operational environment.  Periodic upgrades ensure the Testbed stays current with DCGS standards and architecture.

Support to OUSD(I), AF DCGS, and NATO interoperability efforts is also provided through this program element. This includes development, testing, and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. 

The Common Imagery Processor effort develops a common imagery sensor processing capability within the DCGS architecture.  The imagery processor accepts airborne imagery data, processes it into an exploitable format, and provides it to other elements within the weapon system and the DCGS Enterprise. Current efforts are transitioning the legacy imagery processor from a hardware/software capability to a virtual software capability, thereby improving enterprise processing capabilities.   Efforts continue to keep the capability on track to handle the current sensors. Activities also include testing, development, and demonstrations integrating updated and new/emerging sensors into DCGS.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The imagery processor accepts airborne imagery data, processes it into an exploitable format, and provides it to other elements within the weapon system and/or the DCGS Enterprise. Current efforts are transitioning the legacy imagery processor from a hardware/software capability to a virtual software capability, thereby improving enterprise processing capabilities.   Efforts continue to keep the capability on track to handle the current sensors. Activities also include testing, development, and demonstrations integrating updated and new/emerging sensors into DCGS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space based navigation system that fills validated Joint Service requirements for worldwide, accurate, common grid three dimensional positioning/navigation for military aircraft, ships, and ground personnel. The consistent accuracy, unaffected by location or weather and available in real time, significantly improves effectiveness of reconnaissance, weapons delivery, mine countermeasures and rapid deployment for all services. GPS must comply with Title 10 United States Code (USC) 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures that continued sustainment and operations of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 51 USC sec 50112 which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.

The system is composed of three segments: user equipment (funded under PE 0305164F), space (funded under this PE and PE 0305165F) and a control network (funded under PE 0305165F and PE 0603423F). The satellites broadcast high accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals which are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. This equipment computes the platform position and velocity and provides steering vectors to target locations or navigation waypoints. The control segment provides daily updates to the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to maintain system precision in three dimensions to 16 meters spherical error probable worldwide. Additionally, GPS supports the United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) mission and provides strategic and tactical support to the following Department of Defense (DoD) missions: Joint Operations by providing capabilities for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT); Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence; Special Operations; Military Operations in Urban Terrain; Defense-Wide Mission Support; Air Mobility; and Space Launch Orbital Support.

GPS III is the next generation Space Vehicle (SV) to join the GPS constellation. GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new civil (L1C) Galileo- compatible signal, and enhanced anti-jam power. SV11 will add two additional secondary payloads, Search and Rescue/GPS (SAR/GPS) and Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA). The SAR/GPS payload provided by Canada will fill a validated National Search and Rescue Committee requirement to provide enduring, space-based distress alerting capability to detect, locate, and relay distress alerts to fulfill its responsibilities under international agreements for Search and Rescue. SAR integration costs are funded by the Coast Guard. LRA, built by the Naval Research Lab (NRL) is a passive reflector that will improve accuracy and provide better ephemeris data. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) funds the integration costs of LRA.

RDT&amp;E, AF PE 0305265F funds GPS III and will support research, development, test and evaluation of GPS III SV01-02, and risk-reducing simulators through a structured systems engineering approach that matures and delivers space vehicles for launch. Space Modernization Initiatives (SMI) focuses on space vehicle affordability and capability, addresses future requirements and resilience needs, and expands the industrial base to enhance future competition. For example, this includes the initial systems design work for incorporating space vehicle technology improvements on items such as second source atomic clocks, smart solar cells that provide 30% more efficiency, alternate transmitter assembly that provides increased power efficiency at a reduced recurring cost, lithium ion batteries which address battery obsolescence issues and offer substantial weight savings, and a dual space-ground link system (SGLS)/Unified S-Band (USB) communication channel to be compliant with the USB interface. RDT&amp;E funds will also be used for GPS III SV09+ risk reduction towards obsolescence and affordability initiatives. GPS III SVs 03-08 are in the Production and Deployment Phase. The Air Force is seeking authorization to exercise the option for SV09-10 under the current contract as technical equivalents of GPS III SV01-08.  The Air Force is also assessing the business case for the future use of a multi-year procurement (MYP) strategy for GPS III.

Additionally the program includes engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations supporting civil and military applications that protect U.S. military and allies' use of GPS.

This program is a Budget Activity 7 - Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Search and Rescue GPS (SAR/GPS) is an approved secondary payload on GPS III beginning with Space Vehicle (SV) 11. SAR/GPS fills validated National Search and Rescue Committee requirements to provide enduring, space-based distress alerting capability to detect, locate, and relay distress alerts to fulfill its responsibilities under international agreements for Search and Rescue.

In addition, the USAF has on-going requirements to rescue US Military personnel in harm's way per Air Force Doctrine Document 2-1.6. The implementation of a US Mid Earth Orbiting Search and Rescue Space Segment is via a Canadian-Provided 406 MHz SAR repeater on GPS III SVs. This system presents a cost effective, low- risk opportunity that accommodates existing and planned 406 MHz beacons across the globe. Per NSPD-39, USAF and USCG, the US operators of the civil COSPAS/ SARSAT system and the international search and rescue system, share costs (50/50) associated with integrating the Canadian provided SAR repeater to GPS III beginning with SV11. Costs presented in this document represent the USAF 50% Share.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GPS III is the next generation Space Vehicle (SV) supporting the GPS constellation. GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new civil (L1C) Galileo-compatible signal, enhanced anti-jam power, and a growth path to full warfighter capabilities. GPS III SV03-08 is in the Production &amp; Deployment Phase.

Funds in this project are for GPS III SV01-08 design and development and will support research, development, test and evaluation of GPS III SV01-02, and risk-reducing simulators through a structured systems engineering approach that matures and delivers space vehicles for launch. Space Modernization Initiatives (SMI) focuses on space vehicle affordability and capability, addresses future requirements and resilience needs, and expands the industrial base to enhance future competition. For example, this includes the initial systems design work for incorporating space vehicle technology improvements on items such as second source atomic clocks, smart solar cells that provides 30% more efficiency, alternate transmitter assembly that provides increased power efficiency at a reduced recurring cost, lithium ion batteries which address battery obsolescence issues and also offer a substantial weight savings, and a dual space-ground link system (SGLS)/Unified S-Band (USB) communication channel to be compliant with the USB interface.

Additionally, the program includes enterprise studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations supporting civil applications that protect U.S. military and allies' use of GPS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS) Program is a Space Command and Control (C2) capability for the Commander,  Joint Functional Component Commander for Space (JFCC SPACE).  The JMS program is predominately a software effort that will produce an integrated, net-centric Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the necessary software applications to accomplish required missions.  The program will provide a collaborative environment that will enhance and modernize space situational awareness (SSA) capabilities; create decision-relevant views of the space environment; rapidly detect, track and characterize objects of interest; identify / exploit traditional and non-traditional sources; perform space threat analysis; and enable efficient distribution of data across the Space Surveillance Network (SSN).  Furthermore, it provides a viable migration path from the legacy Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) system, which has 75% of its components beyond end of life or end of service, and the majority of its software no longer vendor-supported.  JMS will also integrate data from SSA sensors which is exposed via the Net-Centric Sensors and Data Sources effort (project 65A012) in the SSA Systems program (0604425F). This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Air Force transferred program management responsibility in May 2011 from PEO Command and Control and Combat Support, Electronic Systems Center (ESC) to PEO Space, Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) under the rationale that PEO Space has the requisite domain and acquisition expertise that will improve the opportunity for the Air Force to deliver this critical capability in a timely manner to the warfighter. 

The JMS overarching Acquisition Strategy, approved by the Milestone Decision Authority on 15 Apr 2012, provides for a multi-increment program to develop, integrate, test, and deliver JMS capability.  The acquisition strategy reflects new principles that address the speed, agility, and adaptability required for successful IT acquisition resulting in a tailored incremental acquisition approach to deliver early and often by leveraging mature industry capabilities and taking advantage of previous Government investments in Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) and Government lab prototyping efforts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Air Force transferred program management responsibility in May 2011 from PEO Command and Control and Combat Support, Electronic Systems Center (ESC) to PEO Space, Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) under the rationale that PEO Space has the requisite domain and acquisition expertise that will improve the opportunity for the Air Force to deliver this critical capability in a timely manner to the warfighter. 

The JMS overarching Acquisition Strategy, approved by the Milestone Decision Authority on 15 Apr 2012, provides for a multi-increment program to develop, integrate, test, and deliver JMS capability.  The acquisition strategy reflects new principles that address the speed, agility, and adaptability required for successful IT acquisition resulting in a tailored incremental acquisition approach to deliver early and often by leveraging mature industry capabilities and taking advantage of previous Government investments in Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) and Government lab prototyping efforts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Rapid Cyber Acquisition (RCA) provides combatant commanders (CCDRs) with the ability to rapidly respond to emerging cyber needs. RCA provides rapid fielding of capabilities in three areas: defend the Air Force portion of the DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) in response to new and emerging threats; network attack and cyber exploit capabilities through all phases of warfare; and new cyber operations capabilities that address gaps to support evolving missions.

Rapid Cyber Acquisition delivers cyber capabilities to 24th Air Force (24 AF) warfighters in mission-relevant timeframes. RCA provides capabilities in support of US national security interests, to counter current and future cyber threats, and to enhance the nation's ability to operate in cyberspace. It expedites cyber development and modifications of USAF and DoD cyber capabilities. RCA provides solution sets for cyberspace operations: attack, defense, command and control/situational awareness, exploitation, critical infrastructure support, and combat support. RCA provides integration, and technical support to other Service and Government Agency activities to leverage select Air Force-developed technologies and/or operational capabilities. RCA will develop materiel or non-materiel cyber solutions, conduct rapid prototyping, integration, and transition activities for cyber systems. Primary activities include, but are not limited to: development of software/hardware cyber systems; integration and transition of DoD lab-developed cyber capabilities to the warfighter; testing and evaluation; program management administration. Secondary activities include, but are not limited to: studies, analysis, pilots, demonstrations, and risk reduction to emerging technologies for USAF cyber systems. Congress will be notified when all projects have been approved by the end of the fiscal year via Congressional Notification Letters.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Rapid Cyber Acquisition will utilize Concept, Development, Risk Management, or Production and Deployment Plans as a phased approach to acquisition planning. These plans are intended to meet the written acquisition planning requirements and guidance. All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process. Rapid Cyber Acquisition will consider existing contracting vehicles, including but not limited to: Network Centric Solutions (NETCENTS), NETCENTS 2, Information Technology Enterprise Solutions-2 (ITES-2), Government-Wide Acquisition Contract vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV)), General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedules, National Security Agency vehicles and Cyber Warfare Systems Branch Class Justification and Approval document. Multiple award contractual vehicles, such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration's SEWP IV, provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to Rapid Cyber Acquisition. These multiple-award vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act and only require that Rapid Cyber Acquisition provide a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program expedites information and cyberspace superiority capabilities from laboratory, industry, and academia to operational platforms including the Network Attack System (NAS) via the Offensive Cyber Product Line (OCPL).  The OCPL establishes a flexible and balanced approach to rapid acquisition of cyber operational capabilities.  OCPL effectiveness comes from consciously balancing funding into four capability areas required for effective operations: platforms (includes Cyber Mission Platform (CMP), access, and payloads.  The program office investigates and selects the highest potential cyber and Information Operations (IO) technologies to meet specific shortfalls, deficiencies, and requirements documented by major commands (MAJCOMs), unified commands, and IO agencies in Mission Area Plans (MAPs) and capabilities documents. In accordance with AF Policy, the program office develops capabilities in the following cyberspace superiority core capability areas. 

OCPL efforts provide advanced cyber warfare capabilities to the 24th Air Force in direct support of USCYBERCOM and other combatant commanders. OCPL efforts also directly support the AF Information Operations Capability Plan (IOCP) and the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO). OCPL efforts will be prioritized and guided by the Air Force Space Command in support of the Joint Net Attack ICD and other applicable requirements documents. Planned areas of study, prototyping, and technology demonstration will be used to provide warfighters access, platforms, Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO) production (e.g. test and budgets), infrastructure (e.g. mission planning, intelligence, command and control), and tools needed to exploit enemy networks, telephony, Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), electronic warfare operations and Command and Control (C2) systems. These advancements will be used to develop and deliver cutting edge technologies to the warfighter. This capability area utilizes cyber technology investments by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and DoD national laboratories. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging cyber technologies into all regions of the Global Information Grid.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  Program activities are protected under AF Network Warfare Special Access Program(s).

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program expedites information and cyberspace superiority capabilities from laboratory, industry, and academia to operational platforms including the Network Attack System (NAS) via the Offensive Cyber Product Line (OCPL).  The OCPL establishes a flexible and balanced approach to rapid acquisition of cyber operational capabilities.  OCPL effectiveness comes from consciously balancing funding into four capability areas required for effective operations: platforms (includes Cyber Mission Platform (CMP), access, and payloads.  The program office investigates and selects the highest potential cyber and Information Operations (IO) technologies to meet specific shortfalls, deficiencies, and requirements documented by major commands (MAJCOMs), unified commands, and IO agencies in Mission Area Plans (MAPs) and capabilities documents. In accordance with AF Policy, the program office develops capabilities in the following cyberspace superiority core capability areas. 

OCPL efforts provide advanced cyber warfare capabilities to the 24th Air Force in direct support of USCYBERCOM and other combatant commanders. OCPL efforts also directly support the AF Information Operations Capability Plan (IOCP) and the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO). OCPL efforts will be prioritized and guided by the Air Force Space Command in support of the Joint Net Attack ICD and other applicable requirements documents. Planned areas of study, prototyping, and technology demonstration will be used to provide warfighters access, platforms, Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO) production (e.g. test and budgets), infrastructure (e.g. mission planning, intelligence, command and control), and tools needed to exploit enemy networks, telephony, Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), electronic warfare operations and Command and Control (C2) systems. These advancements will be used to develop and deliver cutting edge technologies to the warfighter. This capability area utilizes cyber technology investments by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and DoD national laboratories. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging cyber technologies into all regions of the Global Information Grid.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  Program activities are protected under AF Network Warfare Special Access Program(s).

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) provides a near real-time worldwide, highly survivable/endurable capability to detect, locate, and report any nuclear detonations in the earth's atmosphere or in near space.  USNDS supports NUDET detection requirements across five mission areas: Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA), Nuclear Force Management (NFM), Space Control (SC), Treaty Monitoring (TM), and a classified mission.

The USNDS program is jointly sponsored and funded by the Department of Defense (DoD), through the US Air Force (AF), and the Department of Energy (DOE), through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its Nuclear Detonation Detection (NA-22) office, respectively.  NNSA/NA-22 supplies, at no cost to DoD, USNDS space sensors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the AF's USNDS Program Office, which is responsible for all acquisition and systems engineering, integration and test (SEIT) activities on space vehicles (SVs), to include Global Positioning System (GPS) and additional hosts, and their supporting ground control segments.  The AF directly funds the development of the USNDS ground segment (described below).

DoD funds their contribution to the NDS program in Program Element (PE) 0305913F with RDT&amp;E, OPAF and O&amp;M dollars.  

USNDS consists of space sensors and complex ground segments. The space segment sensors, funded by DOE, consists of three nuclear detection sensor payloads: the Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) payload for Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites, the Global Burst Detection (GBD) payload for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) platforms (GPS satellites), and the Space Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) payload for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) platforms (classified GEO host).  Together, these sensors and associated communications capability provided by the host satellites comprise the global NUDET space segment detection capability for the USNDS.  Space sensors communicate NUDET indications to the fixed ground segment (the RADEC Data Processor (RDP) and the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS)), the deployable mobile ground segment (survivable Ground NDS Terminals (GNTs)), and the survivable/endurable Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs), when fielded.  These ground systems perform data analysis and provide a decision support tool to the Air Force controllers concerning probability of NUDET occurrence.  The ground segment provides ground receiving analysis and reporting capabilities to national authorities, commands, and forward users as well as Department of State (DOS) for Treaty Monitoring and Verification mission.  The ground control segment is being modernized and continuously improved through an incremental evolution acquisition approach.

The upgrade to the GNT is the survivable/endurable Universal Ground Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) Terminal (UGNT) which is funded with AF RDT&amp;E in this PE.  The UGNT provides NUDET Detection Reports to end users through survivable and endurable USNDS communications via Milstar/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) circuits.   The GNT supports ITW/AA and NFM missions.  The UGNT program modifies the baseline of the GNT program and deploys as an integral part of the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Survivable / Endurable Evolution (S2E2) Mobile Ground System (SMGS) units also in support of ITW/AA and NFM.  The UGNT, when integrated with the SMGS, will perform NUDET event processing with fused NDS data from GPS and DSP.  SMGS capability refers to the result of the S2E2 upgrade program for the MGS mission processing capability, including the integration of UGNT.  The intended end state of UGNT integration is delivery of enhanced missile warning and NUDET detection capabilities that meet survivable/endurable ITW/AA requirements directed by the President, SECDEF, Joint Staff, and USSTRATCOM, delivering long-term, cost effective, multi-role, multi-mission space effects to the war fighter across the range of military operations.

This budget line includes systems engineering, research and development, on-orbit and field testing and end-to-end verification of USNDS space sensors, ground analysis and reporting systems in support of the five USNDS mission areas.  Sensor integration for GPS IIF and GPS III are funded in their respective PEs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7 - Operational System Development because it supports operational systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is knowledge of all aspects of space related to operations. As the foundation for space control, SSA encompasses surveillance of all space objects and activities; detailed reconnaissance of specific space assets; monitoring space environmental conditions; monitoring cooperative space assets; intelligence on adversary space operations; and conducting integrated command, control, communications, processing, analysis, dissemination, and archiving activities. Program Element 0305940F, Space Situational Awareness Operations, fields, upgrades, operates and maintains Air Force sensors and information integration capabilities within the SSA network while companion program element 0604425F, Space Situational Awareness Systems, develops new network sensors and improved information integration capabilities across the network. Activities funded in the SSA Operations program element focus on surveillance of objects in earth orbit to aid tasks including satellite tracking; space object identification; tracking and cataloging; satellite attack warning; notification of satellite flyovers to U.S. forces; space treaty monitoring; and technical intelligence gathering. 

The Sensor Service Life Extension Programs (SLEP) in this program element fund efforts to upgrade and extend the life of operational SSA sensors, as needed. These SLEPs include, but are not limited to, programs that extend the serviceable life of assets and maintain critical capability by replacing aging and increasingly unsustainable components with modern equipment. SLEPs may incorporate equipment which inherently includes technological advances resulting in enhanced or increased capabilities. In addition, the SLEP itself may be designed to increase certain capabilities.  The current efforts of Eglin, Haystack Ultra-wideband Satellite Imaging Radar (HUSIR), and Ground-based Electro Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) are representative of sensor systems in the SLEP project.  As the need arises in the execution year, funds in this project may be used to begin sensor life extension programs on additional efforts.  These efforts are in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because they develop modifications for operational SSA sensors.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is knowledge of all aspects of space related to operations. As the foundation for space control, SSA encompasses surveillance of all space objects and activities; detailed reconnaissance of specific space assets; monitoring space environmental conditions; monitoring cooperative space assets; intelligence on adversary space operations; and conducting integrated command, control, communications, processing, analysis, dissemination, and archiving activities. Program Element 0305940F, Space Situational Awareness Operations, fields, upgrades, operates and maintains Air Force sensors and information integration capabilities within the SSA network while companion program element 0604425F, Space Situational Awareness Systems, develops new network sensors and improved information integration capabilities across the network. Activities funded in the SSA Operations program element focus on surveillance of objects in earth orbit to aid tasks including satellite tracking; space object identification; tracking and cataloging; satellite attack warning; notification of satellite flyovers to U.S. forces; space treaty monitoring; and technical intelligence gathering. 

The Sensor Service Life Extension Programs (SLEP) in this program element fund efforts to upgrade and extend the life of operational SSA sensors, as needed. These SLEPs include, but are not limited to, programs that extend the serviceable life of assets and maintain critical capability by replacing aging and increasingly unsustainable components with modern equipment. SLEPs may incorporate equipment which inherently includes technological advances resulting in enhanced or increased capabilities. In addition, the SLEP itself may be designed to increase certain capabilities.  The current efforts of Eglin, Haystack Ultra-wideband Satellite Imaging Radar (HUSIR), and Ground-based Electro Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) are representative of sensor systems in the SLEP project.  As the need arises in the execution year, funds in this project may be used to begin sensor life extension programs on additional efforts.  These efforts are in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because they develop modifications for operational SSA sensors.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Air Force uses the SENSOR contract for sustaining and upgrading various Air Force systems, including the Eglin radar. The radar continues to be operational during the SLEP.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL), a non-profit Federally-Funded Research &amp; Development Center, performs the HUSIR effort under a master contract with the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, in conjunction with support from other agencies as required.  This effort is considered as applied research under that contract.  MIT/LL transferred ownership of the radar to the Air Force but continues to operate it as part of its Lincoln Space Surveillance Complex per contract with the Air Force.  MIT/LL will be responsible for operations and sustainment of the upgraded Haystack radar. The upgrade effort is post Milestone C and is scheduled to complete in FY14.

The GEODSS SLEP was awarded as an option on the SENSOR contract.  The GEODSS SLEP uses a phased development and deployment strategy to reduce risk. The system is in operation during the SLEP and is considered post-Milestone C.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Shared Early Warning System (SEWS) is the result of Presidential foreign policy initiatives which began in 1996.  The SEWS continues to provide Theater Combatant Commanders and foreign nation customers direct operational benefit by improving the architectural design and equipment thereby providing enhanced mission capabilities (i.e., expanded coverage, integration with active defense systems, and radar integration). Foreign customer arrangements are negotiated with individual countries on a bilateral basis to provide selected region-specific missile warning information. SEWS Integration and Test facility is kept current by enhancing systems to improve analysis of real world events. To enhance mission capability the SEWS program tests the Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) migration to Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB), mandatory crypto upgrades, SEWS integration with various radar systems, and the transition to "coalition-based" warning.  SEWS uses Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), Engineering and Technology Acquisition Support Services (ETASS), and Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) contractors to support design, development, and acquisition of a common SEWS architecture to enhance mission capability of existing and future partners. 

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>C-130 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) RDT&amp;E funding has been deleted as a result of proprosed program cancellation in the FY13 PB.  However, Congress added $10M RDT&amp;E in FY13 and $47.3M RDT&amp;E in FY14 to continue C-130 AMP.

The "Optimize" Legacy C-130 Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) program was a new start in FY13 in-lieu-of C-130 AMP, and provided CNS/ATM solution for 176 C-130H aircraft, addressed select obsolescence issues, and retined the navigator position.

The "Minimize" C-130 CNS/ATM program replaced the "Optimize" program in FY 14, and is an airspace compliance focused program to modify 184 C-130H aircraft with 8.33 kHz radios, cockpit voice and digital flight data recorders, Enhanced Mode S, and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out equipment.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The 2013 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) required an Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) cost/benefit analysis (CBA) of the C-130 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) and a reduced scope mod program; it also prevents the Air Force from cancelling C-130 AMP until 90 days after the study is delivered to Congress.  The Air Force delivered the study to Congres in Nov 2013.  However, the FY14 NDAA directed the GAO to conduct a sufficiency review of the IDA study by 1 April 2014, and prevents the AF from canceling C-130 AMP.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>With the FY13 PB's cancellation of the C-130 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP), the Minimize C-130 Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) option provides minimal airspace compliance focused program to modify 178 C-130H aircraft with Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out equipment, 8.33 kHz radios, updated cockpit voice and digital flight data recorders, and Enhanced Mode S.

The 178 aircraft Minimize C-130 CNS/ATM program is comprised of H3s, H2.5s, H2s and H1s; and includes 28 Active Duty, 102 Guard, and 48 Reserve aircraft. The modification effort will be completed in three phases: Phase A updates to 8.33 kHz radios on 150 aircraft (28 modifications previously accomplished on the H1s); Phase B modifies cockpit voice and digital data recorders (CVR/DVR) for 178 aircraft; Phase C relates to ADS-B Out and Enhanced Mode S modifications. Phase C will have 4 prototype aircraft required for accomplishment of the ADS-B Out Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, with the remaining 174 being production aircraft. The prototype aircraft represent each type of C-130H configuration listed above.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The C-5 Core Mission Computer (CMC), Weather Radar, and Mission Systems Equipment Program is a comprehensive sustainment modification to mitigate the obsolescence of the current CMC and weather radar.  This effort centers around modifying the current mission computer to obtain sufficient capacity/capability to support integration of new system capabilities with margin for growth by replacing the Core Processing Module (CPM) cards.  Also, the effort includes replacement of the weather radar with a commercial off-the-shelf color weather radar.  Mission systems equipment includes, but is not limited to, a redesign of the C-5 lavatory system. Examples of other mission systems equipment include troop seats, crew entry door and ladder, and interior trim.  

The current C-5 CMC has reached maximum capacity and cannot integrate required aircraft systems and capabilities to include the weather radar; flight management system (FMS); and communication, navigation, surveillance (CNS)/air traffic management (ATM) requirements.  These requirements include capabilities such as the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), and identification, friend or foe (IFF) mode 5.  The new CMC will allow for current and future throughput growth of additional processing requirements to meet CY 2020 CNS/ATM mandates.

The modification helps to maintain aircraft availability as the new color weather radar replaces the current APS-133 weather radar system, which is experiencing severe diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues.  Failure to replace the CMC to support a new weather radar will create a significant operational impact due to parts obsolescence of the current weather radar.  Equipment DMS issues will be resolved to support continued production and installation of requirements for the C-5 fleet.  Further, DMS issues will be resolved to support continued operations through studies, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, development, and redesign efforts.

The current C-5 lavatory system suffers inoperability and leakage of liquid sodium hypochlorite causing severe corrosion and burnt wires in the landing gear control panels.  A redesign of the Mission Systems Equipment program will increase safety, mitigate risk, and reduce man-hours required to repair extensive damage. 

BA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-5 Core Mission Computer (CMC), Weather Radar, and Mission Systems Equipment Program is a comprehensive sustainment modification to mitigate the obsolescence of the current CMC and weather radar.  This effort centers around modifying the current mission computer to obtain sufficient capacity/capability to support integration of new system capabilities with margin for growth by replacing the Core Processing Module (CPM) cards.  Also, the effort includes replacement of the weather radar with a commercial off-the-shelf color weather radar.  Mission systems equipment includes, but is not limited to, a redesign of the C-5 lavatory system. Examples of other mission systems equipment include troop seats, crew entry door and ladder, and interior trim.  

The current C-5 CMC has reached maximum capacity and cannot integrate required aircraft systems and capabilities to include the weather radar; flight management system (FMS); and communication, navigation, surveillance (CNS)/air traffic management (ATM) requirements.  These requirements include capabilities such as the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), and identification, friend or foe (IFF) mode 5.  The new CMC will allow for current and future throughput growth of additional processing requirements to meet CY 2020 CNS/ATM mandates.

The modification helps to maintain aircraft availability as the new color weather radar replaces the current APS-133 weather radar system, which is experiencing severe diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues.  Failure to replace the CMC to support a new weather radar will create a significant operational impact due to parts obsolescence of the current weather radar.  Equipment DMS issues will be resolved to support continued production and installation of requirements for the C-5 fleet.  Further, DMS issues will be resolved to support continued operations through studies, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, development, and redesign efforts.

The current C-5 lavatory system suffers inoperability and leakage of liquid sodium hypochlorite causing severe corrosion and burnt wires in the landing gear control panels.  A redesign of the Mission Systems Equipment program will increase safety, mitigate risk, and reduce man-hours required to repair extensive damage. 

BA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Core Mission Computer, Weather Radar, and Mission Systems Equipment programs: Engineering, manufacturing, and development (EMD) for the core mission computer and weather radar began in FY13. The acquisition strategy for this project considered every opportunity to use commercial components to modernize the C-5 core mission computer and weather radar and maintain aircraft availability in support of mobility missions worldwide. The strategy is for the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Aero (LMA), to procure the core mission computer chips and weather radar, integrate and test those components, and install on two (2) EMD aircraft. The LMA negotations were completed 4 Feb 14 and have an expected contract award date of March 2014. The contract method is sole source. The contract type will be predominately CPIF (Cost Plus Incentive Fee) with some FFP (Firm Fixed Price) elements. The mission systems equipment redesign will require RDT&amp;E funding for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) proofing. Funds are required for validation and verification of the lavatory design and installation. The Mission Systems Equipment contract method was competitive through the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC). Wyle Science, Technical, and Engineering Group is the selected source, and the contract type is Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The C-17 can perform the entire spectrum of airlift missions and is specifically designed to operate effectively and efficiently in both strategic and theater environments.  Airlift provides essential flexibility when responding to contingencies on short notice anywhere in the world.  It is a major element of America's national security strategy and constitutes the most responsive means of meeting mobility requirements.   Specific tasks associated with the airlift mission include deployment, employment (airland and airdrop), sustaining support, retrograde, and combat redeployment.  Not only can the C-17 deliver outsize cargo to austere tactical environments, but it also reduces ground time during airland operations.  The C-17 will perform its airlift mission well into this century.

C-17 RDT&amp;E funding efforts support, but are not limited to: aircraft performance improvements and airspace access mandates (i.e., Communications/Navigation Improvements); flight test activities and facilities; development of solutions for obsolescence and safety of flight issues; systems engineering/program management administration support; maintenance of avionics laboratories; block development/change management; proposal preparation for new projects; cost estimating and engineering/acquisition studies not related to requirements generation.
  
This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The C-130J is a medium-sized transport aircraft capable of performing a variety of combat delivery (tactical airlift) operations across a broad range of mission environments. The C-130J aircraft, with its extended (by 15 feet) fuselage, provides additional cargo carrying capacity for the USAF combat delivery mission compared with legacy C-130E/H and the C-130J (short). Special mission variants of the C-130J conduct airborne psychological operations (EC-130J), weather reconnaissance (WC-130J), search and rescue (HC-130J), and special operations (MC-130J and AC-130J). All aircraft variants must be capable of worldwide operations.

This program provides RDT&amp;E funding for required capabilities that are grouped as "Block" upgrades or "Capability" updates.  Currently, Block 7.0/8.1 and Capability Management Updates (CMUs) add capabilities to address Communication, Navigation, Surveillance, and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements. All are collaborative efforts between Seven Nations. Content/requirements for block modifications is documented in International Program Directives (IPDs)as determined in the Cooperative Systems and Software Upgrade Requirements Management (COSSURM) process.

The HC/MC Recap Program will integrate the common-core capabilities developed under this program into the HC-130J, MC-130J and AC-130J.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The C-130J aircraft will be modified using a "block upgrade" strategy. The CNS/ATM, navigation safety requirement will initially, be met in three block upgrades. Block 6.0 development was funded from FY03-07. Block 7.0 started in FY07, and Block 8.1 which began in FY12. Subsequently, C-130J modifications will be grouped into smaller CNS/ATM software only updates known as Capability Management Updates (CMU).  CMU development is planned to commence upon contract award Q3/2014. Other AMC initiatives include Mission Planning (Mission Computer) upgrades due to Flight Management System (FMS) Software updates.

In order to better manage the fleet and to avoid having to simultaneously support three separate aircraft configurations (Block 6, Block 7 and Block 8.1) the USAF has decided to combine the Block 7 and Block 8.1 mods.  This will allow the aircraft and trainers to only have to be modified one time.

The proportion of CNS/ATM and navigation safety requirements allocated to Blocks 6.0 through 8.1 was determined via a design trade study conducted by Lockheed Martin (the C-130J prime contractor) and verified by the C-130J system program office and AMC. The development costs are being shared via a global Project Arrangement (PA) by the United States (USAF, USMC, USCG), the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Canada, and Norway. An international program office (IPO), with USAF lead (Wright Patterson AFB, OH), manages the block upgrades development effort. Retrofit of a Block on the aircraft is the responsibility of each nation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project will enhance aircrew simulator fidelity utilizing aircraft flight tests to gather data to accurately emulate ground effect, nose wheel and engine-out data points. Currently the simulator is approved to accomplish only 50% of annual assault landings. This added capability will allow more training to be accomplished in the simulator so the aircraft will be available for more real world missions.  The ability to accomplish more training in the simulator also reduces the annual aircraft O&amp;M requirement.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) system is an evolutionary acquisition program that provides significantly improved defensive systems capability for DoD aircraft to counter the infrared (IR) man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) missile threat.  The current LAIRCM system configuration [AN/AAQ-24V] consists of an ultra-violet missile warning sensor (MWS), a laser transmitter assembly, control interface unit (CIU) and processors to detect, track, jam and counter incoming IR missiles.  The number of sensors and turrets per aircraft is determined by the size and signature of the aircraft.  The system is fully automatic following system power-up.  LAIRCM requirements are documented in the multi-command Operational Requirements Document (ORD) LAIRCM ORD 314-92, validated on 03 Aug 98.  The system was first fielded on the C-17 aircraft.

The baseline program development is complete and consists of the small laser transmitter assembly (SLTA), ultra-violet MWS, processor, control interface unit (CIU) and a repeater (on some aircraft) to meet the need for advanced IR countermeasures.  The Guardian Laser Transmitter Assembly (GLTA) is an upgrade to the baseline transmitter equipment to improve reliability, enhance performance, address obsolescence issues, reduce mass and improve overall functionality.  First production GLTA delivery occurred in June 08.

Development of the Next Generation Missile Warning System (NexGen MWS) is complete and includes new hardware that improves capability.  Baseline equipment (ultra-violet MWS) will be retrofitted with the NexGen MWS as it becomes available.  Developmental test/operational test (DT/OT) was conducted in FY10 with initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&amp;E) in FY11.  

Per DoD direction, LAIRCM program will accomplish aircraft integration and testing and provide integration support/Hardware Buys to incorporate LAIRCM on new platforms, upon request of AMC, AFSOC, multiple potential tanker aircraft variants, and other federal agencies.  The last integration effort will be completed in FY14.

LAIRCM upgrades include, but are not limited to hardware and software upgrades and testing of the LAIRCM system to maintain defensive capability against new and emerging threats.  Capabilities include engagement reporting (ER), Closed Loop Infrared Countermeasures (CLIRCM) and other emerging capabilities to upgrade/update system threat defeating ability. 

Current and future efforts include Threat Analysis; Modeling, Simulation and Emulation Test; and Studies and Analysis.  

Threat Analysis encompasses the activities to support threat exploitation analysis of a variety of threats (both known and emerging) against the current LAIRCM jam code with the intent of determining if jam code updates are required.  Typical threat analysis activities include: threat seeker characterization; model development for advanced threat IR seekers; development and testing of new infrared countermeasures concepts, techniques, and hardware; new technology assessment for potential incorporation into the LAIRCM system; and the evaluation/exploitation of new threats and threat characteristics relative to IRCM. 

Modeling, Simulation, and Emulation Test activities verify and validate the information obtained from threat analysis activities.  These activities include: evaluation of IRCM techniques used in defeating real threat hardware; developing and evaluating jam code; validating and verifying integration of LAIRCM system components to newly developed jam codes, software or hardware; evaluating system effectiveness; performing platform integration support tests; and conducting predictive risk reduction tests prior to Live Missile Fire Test (LMFT) or on aircraft flight testing.

Studies and Analysis include logistics, programmatics, and engineering efforts to ensure continued systems viability and sustainability.

Program management and administration efforts consist of, but are not limited to contract services and Government costs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) system is an evolutionary acquisition program that provides significantly improved defensive systems capability for DoD aircraft to counter the infrared (IR) man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) missile threat.  The current LAIRCM system configuration [AN/AAQ-24V] consists of an ultra-violet missile warning sensor (MWS), a laser transmitter assembly, control interface unit (CIU) and processors to detect, track, jam and counter incoming IR missiles.  The number of sensors and turrets per aircraft is determined by the size and signature of the aircraft.  The system is fully automatic following system power-up.  LAIRCM requirements are documented in the multi-command Operational Requirements Document (ORD) LAIRCM ORD 314-92, validated on 03 Aug 98.  The system was first fielded on the C-17 aircraft.

The baseline program development is complete and consists of the small laser transmitter assembly (SLTA), ultra-violet MWS, processor, control interface unit (CIU) and a repeater (on some aircraft) to meet the need for advanced IR countermeasures.  The Guardian Laser Transmitter Assembly (GLTA) is an upgrade to the baseline transmitter equipment to improve reliability, enhance performance, address obsolescence issues, reduce mass and improve overall functionality.  First production GLTA delivery occurred in June 08.

Development of the Next Generation Missile Warning System (NexGen MWS) is complete and includes new hardware that improves capability.  Baseline equipment (ultra-violet MWS) will be retrofitted with the NexGen MWS as it becomes available.  Developmental test/operational test (DT/OT) was conducted in FY10 with initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&amp;E) in FY11.  

Per DoD direction, LAIRCM program will accomplish aircraft integration and testing and provide integration support/Hardware buys to incorporate LAIRCM on new platforms, upon request of AMC, AFSOC, multiple potential tanker aircraft variants, and other federal agencies.  The last integration effort will be completed in FY14.

LAIRCM upgrades include, but are not limited to hardware and software upgrades and testing of the LAIRCM system to maintain defensive capability against new and emerging threats.  Capabilities include engagement reporting (ER), Closed Loop Infrared Countermeasures (CLIRCM) and other emerging capabilities to upgrade/update system threat defeating ability. 

Current and future efforts include Threat Analysis; Modeling, Simulation and Emulation Test; and Studies and Analysis.  

Threat Analysis encompasses the activities to support threat exploitation analysis of a variety of threats (both known and emerging) against the current LAIRCM jam code with the intent of determining if jam code updates are required.  Typical threat analysis activities include: threat seeker characterization; model development for advanced threat IR seekers; development and testing of new infrared countermeasures concepts, techniques, and hardware; new technology assessment for potential incorporation into the LAIRCM system; and the evaluation/exploitation of new threats and threat characteristics relative to IRCM. 

Modeling, Simulation, and Emulation Test activities verify and validate the information obtained from threat analysis activities.  These activities include: evaluation of IRCM techniques used in defeating real threat hardware; developing and evaluating jam code; validating and verifying integration of LAIRCM system components to newly developed jam codes, software or hardware; evaluating system effectiveness; performing platform integration support tests; and conducting predictive risk reduction tests prior to Live Missile Fire Test (LMFT) or on aircraft flight testing.

Studies and Analysis include logistics, programmatics, and engineering efforts to ensure continued systems viability and sustainability.

Program management and administration efforts consist of, but are not limited to contract services and Government costs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The aircraft creates an air bridge enabling rapid global mobility and global strike missions.  There are 59 KC-10A aircraft in the USAF tanker fleet.  RDT&amp;E funds throughout the FYDP will be used to support the Communications, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM)and Mode 5 modification efforts.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisition Approach Summary:

CNS/ATM: The acquisition is in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  Further, this acquisition was awarded to a single integrator to accomplish all activities and utilizes a firm fixed price (FFP) contract with performance based payments. Payments (expenditures) on this contract are intentionally deferred, to the advantage of the government, to incentivize the contractor to successfully complete program milestones.  These deferred payments cannot be paid until these milestones have been successfully completed; thus, delaying complete expenditure of those funds.  Therefore, expenditures for this effort will lag behind OSD goals.

Mode 5: Acquisition strategy will be a sole source, FFP contract for a 15-month RDT&amp;E effort followed by procurement of kits and modification of fleet at depot.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This line item previously supported two Presidential support airlift modernization efforts:  Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR) and VC-25A Avionics Modernization Program (AMP).  FY15 and beyond, Project 675355 Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization efforts will be executed in PE0401319F, Project 655250, Presidential Aircraft Recap in order to improve transparency for ACAT I acquisition programs; this line item is dedicated soley to VC-25A AMP.

VC-25A AMP assures unrestricted global access to civilian and military airspace to support the President of the United States as Head of State, Chief Executive, and Commander in Chief.  AMP upgrades use a systems approach to aid pilot awareness and alleviate task saturation enhancing safety in a high technology concentrated airspace environment.  VC-25A AMP is a required modification to address safety of flight and to ensure the viability of the Presidential support airlift fleet until PAR is fielded.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY13 adjustment of $11.1M was a Congressional Add for VC-25 AMP to mitigate a shortfall from an FY12 Mark.

FY14 adjustment is a Congressional Directed Reduction due to program decrease ($6.015M).

FY15 adjustment of $6.640M is due to greater than expected Non Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs and inaccurate contractor estimates.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding supports development planning efforts and studies as well as Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract activities for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR) effort.  PAR will recapitalize the VC-25A system and support the Office of the President in executing Constitutional roles of Head of State, Chief Executive, and Commander in Chief.  The principal mission of PAR is to provide the President of the United States and the President's staff and guests with safe, comfortable and reliable air transportation with the same level of security and communications capability as is available at the White House.  As a 'national level' airborne communications node providing voice, data, video, processed imagery and network services, PAR enables the President and traveling staff to address the full range of political and military operations globally.  Development planning funding supports planning efforts and products including systems engineering strategy and analysis; risk analysis and management; concept definition and trade studies; test and evaluation strategy; life cycle cost estimates; sustainment and logistics analysis; information support and network analysis; technology and manufacturing maturity analysis and acquisition planning analysis. Funding also supports award of the PAR EMD contract and initial preliminary design efforts.

FY15 and beyond, Project 675355 Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization efforts will be executed in PE0401319F, Project 655250, Presidential Aircraft Recap in order to improve transparency for ACAT I acquisition programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>VC-25A Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) assures unrestricted global access to civilian and military airspace to support the President of the United States as Head of State, Chief Executive, and Commander in Chief.  AMP upgrades use a systems approach to aid pilot awareness and alleviate task saturation enhancing safety in a high technology concentrated airspace environment.  VC-25A AMP is a required modification to ensure the viability of the Presidential support airlift fleet until the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR) program is fielded.  

If not installed, the VC-25A will not be upgraded with modern flight deck avionics and safety of flight equipment and the President of the United States, while aboard the VC-25A, may encounter routing, timing, or other airspace restrictions, impeding the safe and effective transport of the President.  

AMP complies with mandates for Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 as well as a Coupled Vertical Navigation (VNAV) capability.  It will incorporate multiple subsystems, to include, but not limited to, maneuver camera system, large cockpit displays, and navigation radios to increase the utility and safety of the VC-25A.  Installations are aligned with the aircraft heavy maintenance schedule.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Prior to FY2015, the CV-22 RDT&amp;E budget was funded in BA05, System Development and Demonstration, Program Element 0401318F.  This is a continuation of the CV-22 RDT&amp;E program funded in BA05.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The CV-22 is a Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the 1st generation V-22 tilt-rotor, multi-mission aircraft.  CV-22 RDT&amp;E provides development, integration, testing and enhancement of critical capability to insert, extract, and re-supply special operation forces into politically or militarily denied areas.  The CV-22 Block 10 configuration added terrain following radar, additional fuel tanks, additional radios, flare/chaff dispensers, radio frequency/infrared and defensive countermeasures, weapons, situational awareness improvements, and Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) to the V-22 Block B aircraft.  Block 20 development includes, but is not limited to, improved communications, situational awareness, software, and other requirements specified in the V-22 Block C/20 Capabilities Production Document.  A future capabilities increment is following Block 20 to enhance defensive systems and self-deployment capabilities such as Distributed Ice Protection, improved engine performance, additional CNS/ATM and improved communication capabilities.  CV-22 RDT&amp;E also provides for a baseline CV-22 flight test aircraft for validation/verification of Block 20 and various software and reliability and maintainability mods.  The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness capabilities in incremental modifications.  Ongoing planning and associated activities will take place to prevent diminishing manufacturing resources and obsolescence issues, as required.  

USSOCOM and USAF jointly fund development projects to meet operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness mission needs.  This includes designing, prototyping, integrating, testing and fielding proposed solutions to emerging warfighter issues.  USSOCOM funds the development, integration and testing of SOF unique mission capability, while USAF funds interoperability, basic air vehicle enhancements, integration of Air Force and Navy maintenance and information systems used with the V-22, support for operational testing, and CV-22 implementation and testing of MV-22 Block B and Block C changes.  USSOCOM and USAF jointly fund correction of deficiencies and Block 20 development.  Block 20 increments 1 and 3 are developed with USAF funds and increment 2 is developed with USSOCOM funds.     

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded.  In FY2015, CV-22 is transitioning from BA05 Systems Development and Demonstation to BA07 Operational Systems Development.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The V-22 Joint Program Office (NAVAIRSYSCOM PMA-275) ensures that CV-22 changes are incorporated into the ongoing V-22 production line with minimal impact.  The JPO is developing new capabilities for the V-22 in blocks.  Block 0 and Block 10 have completed development, and Block 20 is currently underway.  NAVAIRSYSCOM awarded a cost plus fixed fee contract with the prime contractor in Dec 2007 for Block 20 development and test.  After Block 20 development and test, future development efforts beyond Block 20 will be conducted as pre-planned product improvements.  For example, the jointly funded Improved Inlet Solution (IIS) effort is expected to significantly improve engine time on wing in an an austere environment.  A cost plus fixed fee contract will be awarded for IIS by NAVAIRSYSCOM to the prime contractor in May 2014 with CV-22 RDT&amp;E BA05 funds.  In FY2015, the CV-22 RDT&amp;E BA07 will continue this effort with incremental funding.  Development activities for the V-22 program are performed by the prime contractor selected on a sole-source basis.  Bell-Boeing is a strategic partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Integrated Defense Systems.  OSD re-designated the V-22 program from ACAT 1D to ACAT 1C on 24 Jul 2012.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Special Tactics/Combat Control, Special Tactics (ST) System Development project focuses on modernization developments for the Battlefield Airmen Operations (BAO) Kit. The project is a program within the overarching Battlefield Airmen Modernization (BA-Mod) Program. BAO Kit will develop, test, train and modernize the existing and future Family of Systems (FoS) that provides a state-of-the-art Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) suite for Air Force Special Operations Command's (AFSOC's) Battlefield Airmen. Efforts in the Special Tactics System Development project focus on reducing the risk of fratricide and substantially reducing size and weight of the equipment carried through three core capabilities: Human Machine Interface (HMI), Line of Sight (LOS) targeting, and Machine to Machine C4ISR System.

This program will develop and enhance technologies for Battlefield Airmen Special Tactics Operators (STO)/Combat Controllers (CCT) to recognize, identify, range, nominate and designate targets during both day and night. BAO Kit will also significantly reduce the time required to find, fix, track, target and engage the enemy by providing highly accurate target grid coordinates in three dimensions, generating target imagery both pre and post-strike, and transmitting target data to Command and Control centers. All BAO Kit systems are light, compact and portable for use by dismounted Battlefield Airmen. FY15 BAO Kit funding will provide significant improvements in operational capability, situational awareness and precision lethality in the battle space and continue to build and enhance the BAO Kit family of systems. These efforts will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increased mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum.

The Special Tactics (ST) System Development activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program develops, tests, and evaluates national and Air Force measurement standards (hardware) and calibration equipment in support of all Air Force programs and activities, including Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories (PMELs) worldwide.  Metrology research and development provides technology to support systems in all phases of development and acquisition, as well as Air Force R&amp;D laboratories, test ranges, ground test facilities, and operational weapons systems support. Rapidly changing technology requires continuing research and development of measurement standards and calibration equipment to ensure modern weapon systems meet Air Force readiness objectives. This program addresses all metrology disciplines and includes the technology areas of laser, infrared, microwave, millimeter wave, optical, physical, mechanical, electrical, electronic, and ionizing radiation measurements. Metrology is a technical discipline devoted to the science of measurements and to the study and improvement of measurement technology.  Measurements are the foundation of military system development, quality assurance, hardware conformance testing and system readiness tests.  The integrity of these tests is assured through calibration and traceability assurance schemes.  The capability to measure and calibrate must parallel the emergence of new technology, new ranges, and new capabilities of military systems.  Lack of new measurement capability impedes or blocks the successful exploitation of new technologies, especially in the movement from development laboratory to production to deployment.  R&amp;D efforts are essential within the DoD to pace these requirements, otherwise, these same new systems will suffer time delays, excessive cost, and increased risk due to unreliable test results in all phases of development, production, deployment and operation.    

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program develops, tests, and evaluates national and Air Force measurement standards (hardware) and calibration equipment in support of all Air Force programs and activities, including Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories (PMELs) worldwide.  Metrology research and development provides technology to support systems in all phases of development and acquisition, as well as Air Force R&amp;D laboratories, test ranges, ground test facilities, and operational weapons systems support. Rapidly changing technology requires continuing research and development of measurement standards and calibration equipment to ensure modern weapon systems meet Air Force readiness objectives. This program addresses all metrology disciplines and includes the technology areas of laser, infrared, microwave, millimeter wave, optical, physical, mechanical, electrical, electronic, and ionizing radiation measurements. Metrology is a technical discipline devoted to the science of measurements and to the study and improvement of measurement technology.  Measurements are the foundation of military system development, quality assurance, hardware conformance testing and system readiness tests.  The integrity of these tests is assured through calibration and traceability assurance schemes.  The capability to measure and calibrate must parallel the emergence of new technology, new ranges, and new capabilities of military systems.  Lack of new measurement capability impedes or blocks the successful exploitation of new technologies, especially in the movement from development laboratory to production to deployment.  R&amp;D efforts are essential within the DoD to pace these requirements, otherwise, these same new systems will suffer time delays, excessive cost, and increased risk due to unreliable test results in all phases of development, production, deployment and operation.    

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2015, Project 675207, Logistics IT System Modernization includes New Start efforts (Transformation - Supply Chain Management Initiative).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS) program was canceled 11 December 2012.  The cancellation of ECSS has driven the Air Force to re-evaluate its strategy to enable logistics Information Technology (IT) capabilities.  The Air Force still requires an integrated logistics capability that provides timely, accurate and reliable information to decision makers at all levels of command and across the full range of military operations.  The Air Force is transitioning from ECSS to a hybrid approach of core legacy system remediation / modification and transformation, to include transitioning to a common IT hosting environment. This approach moves away from a large scale Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) capability and uses firm requirements, smaller scale development efforts and shorter delivery schedules to achieve FY 2017 statutory Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) and operational requirements.
	
Logistics Transformation: Logistics transformation will be accomplished through capability initiatives to include Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO), Supply Chain Management (SCM), Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) and Field Maintenance.  

-- MRO will create an integrated capability that plans, schedules, and executes organic depot maintenance support functions critical to agile planning, optimized workload assignment, resource allocation and throughput, thereby increasing depot maintenance support to the warfighter.  

-- SCM includes Air Force Wholesale Supply, Item Master, Retail Supply, and related initiatives.  Wholesale Supply encompasses centralized planning and management of items and equipment such as: repairables, consumables, Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel (NWRM) and cryptographic items.  Item Master provides the capability to manage comprehensive, accurate, and reliable item data.  Retail Supply comprises business operations and inventory for the Air Force Base Supply community.    

-- The PLM capability will enable Air Force engineering/logistics communities to define, track, protect and manage product data for Air Force weapon systems and equipment. 

-- APS will provide an integrated, accurate and timely supply chain planning capability to project inventory allocations that facilitate improved decision-making throughout the Demand Planning, Inventory Planning, Supply Planning, Exception Management, and Analytics processes.  

-- Field Maintenance will improve Air Force base-level maintainers' ability to plan, schedule, execute and maintain oversight capabilities that support timely and accurate asset/resource management related to weapons systems inventory, status and usage reporting.

Remediation/Modification Efforts:  The remediation and modification of core logistics systems is necessary for the Air Force to meet statutory Financial Improvement Audit Readiness (FIAR) by 2017 and align with the Joint Chiefs of Staff J-4 Concept for Logistics and the Air Force Logistics Board's approved Enterprise Logistics Strategy (ELS).  Systems contained in these business areas include, but are not limited to, the Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS), Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS), Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS), Combat Ammunitions System (CAS), Enhanced Maintenance Operations Center (EMOC), Aircraft Structural Integrity Management Information System (ASIMIS), Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S), Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS), Stock Control System (SCS), Purchase Request Process System (PRPS), Automated Logistics Management Support System (ALMSS), Depot Maintenance Accounting and Production System (DMAPS), Cryptologic Depot Accountability System (CDAS), Commercial Asset Visibility-Air Force (CAV-AF), Enhanced Technical Information System (ETIMS), and Weapon System Management Information System (WSMIS).

Activities for legacy system remediation/modification and transformation will apply Business Process Re-Engineering (BPRE) and the Air Force Service Development and Delivery Process (SDDP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Systems contained in these business areas include, but are not limited to, the Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS), Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS), Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS), Combat Ammunitions System (CAS), Enhanced Maintenance Operations Center (EMOC), Aircraft Structural Integrity Management Information System (ASIMIS), Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S), Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS), Stock Control System (SCS), Purchase Request Process System (PRPS), Automated Logistics Management Support System (ALMSS), Depot Maintenance Accounting and Production System (DMAPS), Cryptologic Depot Accountability System (CDAS), Commercial Asset Visibility-Air Force (CAV-AF), Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS), and Weapon System Management Information System (WSMIS).

Activities for legacy remediation/modification and transformation will apply Business Process Re-Engineering (BPRE) and the Air Force Service Development and Delivery Process (SDDP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Air Force Program Executive Office - Business Enterprise Systems (AFPEO-BES) is evaluating systems under the business capability lifecycle management process to approve milestone decisions for each core logistics system remediation/modification project.

These projects will use Firm Fixed Price contracts to the maximum extent possible as the programs establish new contracts or task orders.  To improve the efficiency of the contracting process and reduce contract cycle time, the core logistics system program offices plan to use the existing NETCENTS-2 contract vehicle utilizing Best Value acquisition methodology where possible.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS) program was canceled 11 December 2012.  The cancellation of ECSS has driven the Air Force to re-evaluate its strategy to enable logistics Information Technology (IT) capabilities.  The Air Force still requires an integrated logistics capability that provides timely, accurate and reliable information to decision makers at all levels of command and across the full range of military operations.  The Air Force is transitioning from ECSS to a hybrid approach of core legacy system remediation / modification and transformation. This approach moves away from a large scale Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) capability and uses firm requirements, smaller scale development efforts and shorter delivery schedules to achieve FY 2017 statutory Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) and operational requirements.
	
The ECSS program planned to complete its Milestone B in April 2011, as reported in the February 2011 Critical Change Report (CCR).  However, the program schedule deteriorated throughout 2011, which resulted in the ECSS Milestone B decision being delayed past April 2012, exceeding the one-year schedule threshold for program milestones.  Based on the programmatic challenges detailed in the January 2012 ECSS Major Acquisition Information System Quarterly Report, the Senior Official determined that a Critical Change occurred.  Based on information that was ascertained during the Critical Change process, the Air Force lost confidence in the program's ability to deliver any logistics capability to the warfighter.  As a result of the Air Force's recommendation, the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) terminated the ECSS program in December 2012.  

Remediation, modernization and transformation efforts are being accomplished under project 675207, Logistics Information Technology System Modernization.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY14, the Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS) Program efforts were transferred from PE 0708012F, Logistics Support Activities, to PE 0708611F, Support Systems Development, BPAC 673318 Product Data Systems Modernization to modify the ETIMS system to support Nuclear Weapons Related Material (NWRM) technical data requirements.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element supports two active projects [project 673318, Product Data System Modernization (PDSM), and project 675042, Logistics Application Logistics Integration (LALI)].

Project 673318: PDSM funds modifications to the Enhanced Technical Information System (ETIMS) Enterprise, which supports Air Force Technical Order management, storage and distribution critical to depot maintenance activities.  ETIMS activities include  studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and program execution to include Nuclear Weapons Related Material (NWRM) technical data requirements.

Project 675042: LALI includes funding for Logistics, Installations and Mission Support - Enterprise View (LIMS-EV) and F-35 User IT Data Exchange Service (UIDES).  

LIMS-EV provides integrated, singular information from multiple source systems through the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) Integration Framework (IF) to Air Force decision makers.  Funding for LIMS-EV supports Business Intelligence (BI) development efforts that enhance the AF logistics community's ability to perform configurable alerting, predictive/what-if analysis and further integrate support equipment, vehicle, munitions, supply, commodities and components (e.g. engines, landing gears, fuel) to increase weapons system  and total asset visibility (TAV).    

Funding for F-35 UIDES will continue Air Force development of a F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) - User IT Data Exchange Service that supports current and future Information Exchange Requirement (IER) data transfer capability from the F-35 ALIS into data reports and configurable tables to receive, store and integrate F-35 operations, maintenance, training and financial data within existing Air Force enterprise views to support the growing fleet of AF F-35 aircraft.  Funding supports development of an enhanced data sharing capability (ability to consume increased volume and variety of ALIS IER data) to support depot data configuration and integration requirements.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program/project planning and execution and future program/project planning.

In the FY15 PB, funding is requested to continue development of ETIMS, LIMS-EV and F-35 UIDES in support of the Air Force's logistics Information Technology modernization requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project 675042: LALI includes funding for Logistics, Installations and Mission Support - Enterprise View (LIMS-EV) and F-35 User IT Data Exchange Service (UIDES).  

LIMS-EV provides integrated, singular information from multiple source systems through the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) Integration Framework (IF) to Air Force decision makers.  Funding for LIMS-EV supports Business Intelligence (BI) development efforts that enhance the AF logistics community's ability to perform configurable alerting, predictive/what-if analysis and further integrate support equipment, vehicle, munitions, supply, commodities and components (e.g. engines, landing gears, fuel) to increase weapons system  and total asset visibility (TAV).  

Funding for F-35 UIDES will continue Air Force development of a F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) - User IT Data Exchange Service that supports current and future Information Exchange Requirement (IER) data transfer capability from the F-35 ALIS into data reports and configurable tables to receive, store and integrate F-35 operations, maintenance, training and financial data within existing Air Force enterprise views to support the growing fleet of Air Force F-35 aircraft.  Funding will also support development of an enhanced data sharing capability (ability to consume increased volume and variety of ALIS IER data) to support depot data configuration and integration requirements, and studies and analysis to support both current program/project planning and execution and future program/project planning.

PE activities support the Business Process Re-Engineering (BPRE) and the Air Force Service Development and Delivery Process (SDDP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2014, Project Number 675303, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) Decision Support System (ADSS) Development, completed.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Program supports the Air Education and Training command (AETC) Decision Support System (ADSS) which is an automated information system that provides AETC leadership and staff with key management information about training production status, including monitoring and assessment of training.  The data and reports from ADSS provide the vital feedback mechanism essential to an effective programming and management process.  The hardware and software components of ADSS interact and communicate via the DOD standard communications infrastructure.  The system uses DOD information transfer assets that provide seamless communications within and across systems and media.  Full Operational Capability (FOC) occurs in FY2014.  

The Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) is the authoritative data source for recording and managing aircrew training information, aircrew/parachutist management, flying hour tracking, flight pay management, and flying gate tracking for 70,000 Air Force members. The Air Force uses this information to enhance safety-of-flight operations and to determine eligibility to perform aviation related events. New development work is required to provide additional flying operations information, which will aid in better portraying Air Force readiness, and to feed this data into Defense Readiness Reporting System Strategic (DRRS-S). These enhanced capabilities, to be developed incrementally, include the following:  electronic flight record, support enhanced flying hour management/execution, simulator and remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) management/utilization, full career logbook, training look-back, aircrew member man-month allocation, enhanced resource and jump module management, and interface with DRRS-S.  ARMS data will also be used to support Headquarters Air Force/Major Command (HAF/MAJCOM) level readiness decision reports/analytics.  New development work in support of ARMS needs to be accomplished with RDT&amp;E versus O&amp;M funds. 

This program is Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) is the authoritative data source for recording and managing aircrew training information, aircrew/parachutist management, flying hour tracking, flight pay management, and flying gate tracking for 70,000 Air Force members. The Air Force uses this information to enhance safety-of-flight operations and to determine eligibility to perform aviation related events. ARMS interfaces with the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) and multiple operations and flight scheduling systems such as Patriot Excalibur (PEX), Graduate Training Integration Management System (GTIMS), Center Operations On-Line (COOL), Global Decision Support System (GDSS), and Automated Aircrew Management System (AAMS) and is used to determine whom to select for flying operations, assignment actions, and promotion of aircrew members.
 
New development work is required to provide additional flying operations information, which will aid in better portraying Air Force readiness, and to feed this data into Defense Readiness Reporting System Strategic (DRRS-S). These enhanced capabilities, to be developed incrementally, include the following:  electronic flight record, support enhanced flying hour management/execution, simulator and RPA management/utilization, full career logbook, training look-back, aircrew member man-month allocation, enhanced resource and jump module management, and interface with DRRS-S.  Additional development work on the existing ARMS, such as database flattening and Business Process Reengineering (BPR) actions, is required prior to incorporating these enhanced capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Personnel Services Delivery (PSD), under the Personnel Administration program, funds operational developments necessary to acquire, field, and modify business processes to transform the delivery of Human Resources (HR) capabilities through the structured redesign of the Total Force Personnel Community's people (Active Duty, Reserve, Guard, and Civilians), processes, and technologies. PSD Transformation fundamentally shifts the way personnel services are provided, transitioning from primarily face-to-face interactions with a personnelist to a tiered model with services delivered through online self-service, contact centers, and fewer in-person interactions.  PSD supports the migration of legacy applications and other information technology to a more sustainable and flexible, services-based architecture.  PSD also supports transition from the legacy Military Personnel Data System to the Air Force Integrated Personnel and Pay System (AFIPPS) to improve financial auditability and track military personnel data.  To this end, PSD supports the development viability of several legacy personnel systems through the deployment and transition to the AFIPPS program.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Personnel Services Delivery (PSD), under the Personnel Administration program, funds operational developments necessary to acquire, field, and modify business processes to transform the delivery of Human Resources (HR) capabilities through the structured redesign of the Total Force Personnel Community's people (Active Duty, Reserve, Guard, and Civilians), processes, and technologies. PSD Transformation fundamentally shifts the way personnel services are provided, transitioning from primarily face-to-face interactions with a personnelist to a tiered model with services delivered through online self-service, contact centers, and fewer in-person interactions.  PSD supports the migration of legacy applications and other information technology to a more sustainable and flexible, services-based architecture.  PSD also supports transition from the legacy Military Personnel Data System to the Air Force Integrated Personnel and Pay System (AFIPPS) to improve financial auditability and track military personnel data.  To this end, PSD supports the development viability of several legacy personnel systems through the deployment and transition to the AFIPPS program.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Provides for development and enhancement of modeling and simulation tools for strategic planning, operational requirements, modernization and recapitalization of systems and programs, and the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) processes for the AF Analytic Community and Secretary of the Air Force Standard Analysis Toolkit  in support of AF Senior Leadership. As new technologies are introduced to the battlefield (Digital Electronic Jammers, maneuvering Surface-to-Surface Missiles, Directed Energy Weapons, etc.)along with evolving warfighting techniques and support operations, the range that needs to be covered analytic tools needs to be expanded as well. M&amp;S creation and enhancement can require extensive research in how to properly implement the emerging weapons capabilities as well as demand development of software techniques to implement the changes. Additionally, emerging and continuing focus areas such as Space, Irregular Warfare, Information Operations, Cyber warfare and ISR demand specific tools of their own for new exploration and development. These focus areas require examination in isolation as well as cross-domain making the problem more complex and increasing the R&amp;D challenges to field new decision support tools.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to provide new and evolving systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

AF/A9 completed spiral one of two for a Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) Builder model to rapidly build a sourced TPFDD from a database containing a set of Air Force Unit Type Codes (UTCs).  The completed spiral provides an initial PC-based capability to allow campaign analysts to rapidly develop TPFDDs to support Air Force and Joint Service population of OSD Support for Strategic Analysis products. In the second thrust, AF/A9 supported initial basic research into the building of an overaching Baysian Network framework to allow rapid tradeoffs amongst various ACAT I acquisition programs.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project 671017, CE IT Transformation, contains a Major Thrust called Next Generation Information Technology (NexGen IT).

NexGen IT is a key USAF effort to comply with statutory and regulatory policy and guidance associated with Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) efforts. 

NexGen IT will transform Civil Engineering (CE) business processes to improve operations and support AF priorities.  The plan is to leverage industry best practices, optimize core business processes, and replace existing outdated IT capabilities with a set of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software solutions and secure a service provider to deploy and maintain the system.  This COTS solution will provide a robust, enterprise-wide CE capability that will consist of an integrated set of embedded / configurable best business practices and capabilities to support the following CE missions:  Real Property Management (RPM), Work &amp; Supply Management (WSM), Project Management (PM), and Energy Management (EnM).  Capabilities are to be configured, tested, and deployed as Capability Groups.  Capability Groups 1&amp;2 are combined and include RPM, WSM, PM, and EnM.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Program and Budget Enterprise Service (PBES) is a software development effort that will utilize a service oriented architecture (SOA) to deliver budgeting and programming cpability for the United States Air Force (USAF).  PBES will replace legacy systems such as as the Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment System (ABIDES) and the Resource Allocation Programming Information Decision System (RAPIDS) and will support the budget formulation and force programming process.

PBES is leveraging existing authoritative data sources to provide needed capability in four (4) incremental releases rather than a single release.  Release capabilities are briefly described below.
Release 1 - Creating the baseline, service top line receipt and allocation, and submission of Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and President's Budget (PB).
Release 2 - Development of options after receiving the Service Top Line from OSD, as well as the integration of Resource  Management Decisions (RMDs).  The second release will also address  integrating Congressional marks prior to execution year fund  distribution.
Release 3 - Air Force cost modeling processes for civilian and military personnel, flying hours, and force structure data management.
Release 4 - capabilities include our justification book processes.

The PBES system is being developed to deliver a flexible programming and budgeting system that can keep up with the constantly changing budget requirements.  The PBES effort will be measured using established approved performance metrics which will create efficiencies and allow budget analysts more time to focus on analytical tasks aleviating manual entry, manual checks and balances, and greater flexibility which leads to the best decision making tools for leadership.

The PBES requirement is authorized per the SAF/FM-approved 1 May 2013 PBES Problem Statement.

Program funding for FY 2016 and beyond is deferred at this time.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Cost Estimating Modeling (CEM) provides and enhances Air Force-wide cost estimating capabilities by developing and modernizing current cost data and estimating models and methods.  These products will improve the quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of the acquisition program cost estimates required by statute (e.g., 10 USC 2366, 2433, 2434) and regulation (e.g., DoDI 5000.02) in support of Air Force and Department of Defense acquisition decisions, programming and execution decisions, and Congressional mandates.   

The Air Force has several requirements for research and development of new and modernized cost estimating capabilities for each weapon system type (aircraft, ballistic missiles, electronics and aircraft modifications, ground stations and automated information systems, cross cutting databases, satellites and launch vehicles, tactical missiles and munitions).  In addition, unanticipated requirements often emerge due to changing acquisition laws, regulations, initiatives; changing technologies; and evolving warfighter requirements which drive the need for cost tool updates or expanded capability.  For example, current shortfalls in capability reflect efforts needed to fill gaps in response to the laws and regulations such as the FY06 NDAA report {PL 109-163--Provisions relating to Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs)}, Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) {provisions related to improving cost estimating quality, especially earlier in the program life-cycle and affordability analysis}, Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) Acquisition Excellence Plan {priorities to improve cost estimating capability and affordability analysis and improved cost estimating support to requirements process}, and new Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) policy {better buying power initiatives on enhanced trade-off analysis, affordability analysis, and will versus should cost analysis}.   

This project will perform knowledge-based studies (KBS) analyzing historical data to produce cost estimate reviews (CERs) or statistical data that will inform a future decision to develop cost estimating databases, methods, and models across hundreds of product work breakdown structure (WBS) elements and functional cost elements within each weapon system type.  The different weapon system types are:  Aircraft, Ballistic Missiles,  Electronics and Aircraft Modifications, Ground Stations and Automated Information Systems (AIS), Cross-Cutting Databases, Satellite and Launch Vehicles (Space Systems), and Tactical Missiles and Munitions.  Some areas of cost modeling efforts that are cross-cutting within all weapon system types are:  cost risk metrics, methods development, statistical model enhancements; software cost database, metrics, statistical model development; contract or engineering change order analysis models; other government cost elements (e.g., program office manning, administration, government test); and commodity area price escalation analysis and models.

The CEM requirement is authorized per the 8 November 2013 Cost Estimating Modeling (CEM) Requirements Justification memo signed by Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Cost &amp; Economics).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

DEAMS Inc 2 is NEW START in FY 2015.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Oracle based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable modern accounting and finance system.  DEAMS is a Joint AF and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting.  DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). 

DEAMS Increment 2 (Inc 2) continues the DEAMS effort started by the DEAMS Inc 1 program and will further deploy the Air Force financial management solution, adding cost accounting, investment funds accounting, and time and labor accounting capabilities.  Completion and deployment of Release 1 will complete the FIAR requirement.  Release 2 will add Foreign Military Sales (FMS).

DEAMS Inc 2 is planned as a two (2) Release program:
Release 1 - Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC).  Completes FIAR requirement.
Release 2 - Contingency Operations (CO) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS).

DEAMS Inc 2 requirement is authorized per the June 2005 Business Enterprise Architecture Initial Capabilities Document as stated in Major Automated Information System (MAIS) Annual Reports.  DEAMS Inc 2 will complete the DEAMS effort initiated with DEAMS Inc 1.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program and execution and future program planning.

The overall DEAMS program is under review by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).  The acquisition and deployment strategy are expected to be adjusted to deploy the current software baseline to all Air Force locations and re-evaluate software upgrade scenarios.  Funding adjustments will be reflected in the FY16 President's Budget.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DEAMS Inc 2 implementation is a continuation of the DEAMS Inc 1 approach and consists of two releases to meet the requirements of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) M-10-26 and the Business Capability Lifecycle (BCL) model.  The DEAMS Inc 2 strategy is composed of functional capability fielded to operational AF in Inc 1 and augmented to include cost, investment funds, and time and labor accounting capabilities for an additional 11,600 users. 

DEAMS Inc 2 is planned as a two (2) Release program:
Release 1 - Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC).  Completes FIAR requirement.
Release 2 - Contingency Operations (CO) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS).

Multiple contract actions are anticipated for the releases in DEAMS Inc 2.

The overall DEAMS program is under review by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).  The acquisition and deployment strategy are expected to be adjusted to deploy the current software baseline to all Air Force locations and re-evaluate software upgrade scenarios.  Funding adjustments will be reflected in the FY16 President's Budget.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Oracle based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable modern accounting and finance system.  DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting.  DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF).

DEAMS Increment 1 (Inc 1) is planned as a six (6) Release program:
Release 1 - Air Mobility Command (AMC) without Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)
Release 2 - AMC with TWCF
Release 3 - Software Upgrades
Release 4 - USTRANSCOM Headquarters 
Release 5 - USAF locations in Continental United States (CONUS)
Release 6 - USAF locations outside the CONUS (OCONUS)

DEAMS Inc 1 capability is deployed and in use at seven locations:  Scott AFB, IL; Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)-Limestone, ME; McConnell AFB, IL; Dover AFB, DE; Grand Forks AFB, ND; Little Rock AFB, AR; and Pope Field, NC.  DEAMS Inc 1 is expected to be deployed to a number of additional locations throughout FY 2014-15.

DEAMS Inc 1 capability will continue to be deployed to additional locations as approved by the Milestone Decision Authority.  The overall DEAMS program is under review by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).   The acquisition and deployment strategy are expected to be adjusted to deploy the current software baseline to all Air Force locations and re-evaluate software upgrade scenarios.  

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

DEAMS Inc 1 requirement is authorized per the June 2005 Business Enterprise Architecture Initial Capabilities Document as stated in Major Automated Information System (MAIS) Annual Reports.

The overall DEAMS program is under review by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).  The acquisition and deployment strategy are expected to be adjusted to deploy the current software baseline to all Air Force locations and re-evaluate software upgrade scenarios.  Funding adjustments will be reflected in the FY16 President's Budget.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Starting in FY 2015, DEAMS OPAF funding requests will be shown in WSC 834470, DEAMS.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DEAMS acquisition strategy was changed from a three increment approach to a two increment approach as a result of the 30 September 2010 Major Acquisition Information System (MAIS) critical change program restructure.  Further, the implementation methodology was changed from a spiral to a multiple release concept to meet the requirements of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) M-10-26 which required programs to decompose their efforts into smaller and shorter segments.

Multiple contract actions are anticipated for the releases in DEAMS Inc 1.

The overall DEAMS program is under review by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).  The acquisition and deployment strategy are expected to be adjusted to deploy the current software baseline to all Air Force locations and re-evaluate software upgrade scenarios.  Funding adjustments will be reflected in the FY16 President's Budget.

Contracting adjustments are anticipated based on the results of the MDA's review of the overall DEAMS program.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
