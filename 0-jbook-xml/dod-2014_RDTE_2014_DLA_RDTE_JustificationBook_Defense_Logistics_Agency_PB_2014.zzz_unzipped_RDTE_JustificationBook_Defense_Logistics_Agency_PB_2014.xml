                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Through the Theater Enterprise Deployment and Distribution (TED2) analysis, the Geographic Combatant Commanders identified several gaps between United
States Transportation Commands strategic lift processes and Geographic Combatant Commander's distribution processes. Highlighted is a lack of capability to (1.) manage transportation planning and execution processes for cargo and passenger movement within their respective theaters of operation or (2.) match global movement requirements against available lift assets to produce an optimized transportation schedule that meets delivery requirements.  AT21 Increment 3 Theater Capability will identify key touch points between strategic and theater processes and synchronize end-to-end delivery of personnel, equipment and supplies by providing enhanced visibility, collaboration, automated processes, alerts and exception management capability supporting transportation planning and execution for theater force and sustainment movements.  When fully implemented, it will provide opportunities to streamline cargo movement by optimizing capacity and provide complete visibility by synchronizing theater movements with strategic movements.

                                    <r2:Description>AT21 Increment III expands on the core, strategic deployment and distribution optimization and business process reengineering work delivered in Increment’s I and II by extending the capability to the individual geographic theaters of operation.  FY12 work focused on initial efforts to synchronize strategic and theater transportation planning and execution processes, largely through a JCTD known as Movement Requirements Visibility – Theater (MRV-T).  FY13 funds are for requirements analysis, engagement with individual Combatant Commands (CCMDs), as well as to commence solution implementation and commencement of Global Mission Scheduling (GMS) cognitive based visualizations coupled with automated scheduling to improve air mobility planning.  Further intent in FY13 was to deliver capability to a single CCMD as a demonstration of effective capability.  The increase from FY13 ($3.9M) to FY14 ($7.8M) is a result of double the workload associated with delivery to two additional CCMDs over the FY14-16 scheduled implementation.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The central idea of the Focused Logistics Joint Functional Concept “is to build sufficient capacity into the sustainment pipeline, exercise sufficient control over the pipeline from end to end, and provide a high degree of certainty to the supported joint force commander that sustainment, and support will arrive where needed and on time.”  The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Research and Development (R&amp;D) program helps achieve this vision by pioneering advanced logistics concepts and business processes that provides the leanest possible infrastructure, the use of the best commercial and government sources, and the application of business practices.  The Logistics R&amp;D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that will provide a significantly higher level of support at lower costs, than would be otherwise attainable.  The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits.  One example is the Department of Defense (DOD) Electronic MALL (EMALL).  DOD EMALL was the first web based, distributed architecture on-line ordering capability.  It has been adopted by the Army, Navy and the Department of Homeland Security.  DLA’s overall Log R&amp;D program has demonstrated positive net present value and a positive return on investment.  </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Contracting issues delayed the start of MLN’s three approved charters which are expected to reengineer the manual, laborious medical business practices associated with: 1) determining "fair and reasonable" pricing for medical products; 2) performing analytical queries of source medical business data; and 3) identifying contracting/sourcing opportunities for medical products based upon best-value criteria that include Federal price, market share, and product life cycle/clinical attributes.  The first release of system capabilities will occur in early FY13.

A new project was initiated to advance the management of DLA Medical’s cold chain activities.  Project will develop, demonstrate, and assess new packaging requirements, processes, and materials (i.e. protocols) that improve the quality of temperature-sensitive medical materiel received by DLA customers and/or reduce the cost for DLA to deliver those medical products.</r2:Text>

The Director decided to implement both The Peak Policy and Next generation inventory model, and substantial efforts were devoted to supporting the Planning Process Owner in responding to that direction.  A new project was initiated to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the Prime Vendor concept to the management of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) items in order to greatly improve support to FMS customers.  Another new project wherein suppliers manage the ordering and delivery of parts for DLA wholesale stock was initiated to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept and its benefits in cost reduction and support to the warfighter. Other projects to improve Customer Collaboration and develop ways to match acquisition strategies to industry capabilities were initiated.  Both projects completing in FY2012 transitioned in FY2012.

Technical/Quality Process Improvement: The PQDR Analysis Tool was transitioned to full operation across the DLA enterprise as part of the Product Data Reporting and Evaluation Program at NAVSEA Portsmouth, whose intention is to ultimately make it available throughout DoD. The projects to transition the Counterfeit Parts Strategic Roadmap and Product Verification Process improvements were completed during the year, and transition began. The DNA Marking Feasibility Demonstration project showed such success that the Director decided to mandate use of the technology for all microcircuit items in FSC 5962 beginning in July 2012, and efforts were directed to support the Technical/Quality Process Owner in implementing that direction.  The Connectors Working Group project to reduce duplicate or unnecessary connectors in the Federal Catalog was unsuccessful and was stopped.  A follow-on project was initiated to improve the Product Verification Process.  Three projects of the four projects completing in FY2012 transitioned in FY2012.

Procurement Process Improvement:  The Decision Support project to evaluate the capabilities of a number of commercially available tools to detect fraudulent practices early – before award if possible – and define requirements for a DLA-wide decision support capability was continued through the year. No projects will complete in FY2012.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) program objective is to research, identify, and implement potential or existing technologies using high-risk, high-payoff tools, methods, techniques, and products.  The DLIR program partners with commercial industry to perform short-term projects (STPs) in various logistics business areas which align with the Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA’s) strategic vision. DLIR improves functional and business processes using the latest technologies available, which support the nation’s warfighter. The technical areas of interest are:

1.)  Development of Logistics Data Interoperability &amp; Availability. Enhances the functionality and compatibility of data in a complex data environment using supply chain relationships and lifecycle management to allow flexible visibility.  2.)  Next Generation Automated Electronic Commerce and Sourcing.  The Next Generation Automated Electronic Commerce and Sourcing technical area of interest focuses on employing the best of breed processes, practices, and technology to enable and/or streamline electronic commerce from the customer’s point-of-need to point-of-satisfaction.

DLIR is working several short term projects in the first area of interest only. They are positioning DLA to move towards a model-based enterprise (MBE), using and acquiring 3-Dimensional model-based data instead of 2-Dimensional hardcopy for weapon system sustainment and support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The project focuses on exchanging logistics product data and part-related technical data for the Air Force’s A10 wing replacement program. A second project is studying current and future practices for identifying requirements for, and acquiring, technical data within a model based enterprise. 

For the Parametric search tool, DLIR is developing a Functional Requirements Document that will capture requirements from all functional users and enable portions of the technology and application to reside behind the DLA firewall.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:Description>E-Mall Access for TENTNET:  This project will make it possible for MilSpec Tent information to be available to all EMALL users.  It will expand the number of tent and shelter products that have rich technical and performance information available on DOD EMALL. The project is structured to benefit the entire tent manufacturing community by making their product more visible and, more importantly, it will improve the quality of product information available to the warfighter.  Plans include completing data collection and web design for three additional MILSPEC tents, complete modifications, and develop web-based training capability.  

Extension of Supply Chain Simulation project:  This represents additional tasking for an existing project.  The project will simulate the capability of the tent supply chain to surge production under varying conditions and requirements.  We expect this project to produce an effective decision making tool for DLA’s Industrial Capabilities Programs allowing program management to evaluate the effect of placing buffer stocks at various levels within the supply chain.  Anticipate completion by Sept 2011.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>USTRANSCOM is tasked to provide globally integrated, agile deployment and distribution solutions and related enabling capabilities to support national security, force readiness and sustainability within an increasingly constrained defense budget. Unpredictable and extended global distribution routes, limited visibility of sustainment requirements, force packaging limitations, lift constraints, anti-access/aerial denial concerns, complex supply chains, as well as non-networked battlefield command and control, planning, and decision support tools impede timely customer logistical support.  To project unimpeded global power and influence, USTRANSCOM must have access to relevant, real-time information and invest in enabling capabilities that contribute to mission success.  Effective knowledge sharing and transparency across the joint logistics enterprise, facilitated by secure enterprise-wide visibility into logistical processes and the ability to effectively collaborate/operate in a degraded cyberspace, is required to promote effective, efficient and responsive global management of force projection and sustainment resources.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This requires investigation into next generation Automated Information Technology (AIT)/Total Asset Visibility (TAV) technologies and/or container security to improve end-to-end distribution visibility and enhance planning/ execution and transform sustainment operations.  Includes the ability to determine immediate, reliable, and accurate shipment status through system access or event management.  Develop an over-arching process and system architecture which will automate and integrate existing and innovative new programs across the supply chain to provide complete In Transit Visibility (ITV) data, to include visibility of non-DOD cargo during humanitarian/disaster relief operations. The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Also need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DOD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Synchronizing strategic/theater delivery capabilities to meet increasingly dynamic customer needs.  Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by the disparity of systems, differing data standards, and insufficient interfaces.  Queries and retrieval of status and shipment information cannot be executed due to lack of connectivity between the various components of the supply chain.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct "what -if" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset’s course, speed or departure/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.  The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Also need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DOD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department has found it critical to National Security to maintain an ability to produce legacy microelectronics long after they are available from commercial foundries which move to more advanced technology levels based upon the global market.  The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) uniquely accomplishes this mission for the Department by providing both a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics parts that are no longer available from, or bid by, commercial sources but are essential to combat operations.  This is a critical capability in an atmosphere of increasing worldwide supply chain risks with threats to defense microelectronics.  The threats include risks, such as, counterfeiting, Trojan horses, unreliability and rapid obsolescence coming from an unpredictable and unsecure supply chain.   As fiscal pressures force the Department to maintain its weapon systems longer than originally planned and their extended combat use increases attrition, the need for DMEA’s unique capabilities increases.

Microelectronics is a crucial technology and central for all operations within the Department.  Yet, as vital as this technology is to Department operations, the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market.  The Department frequently requires legacy microelectronics long after commercial foundries have moved on to advanced technology levels.  As such, the semiconductor industry does not respond to the Department’s unique needs of ultra-low volumes, long availability time frames, or its high-level security concerns.  In these cases, DMEA procures a license to produce technologies in-house that are no longer commercially manufactured or are unavailable due to no-bids owing to low volume requirements.  These licenses enable DMEA to be the Department’s microelectronics supplier of last resort, providing the Department with a long-term, trusted, and assured source. 

DMEA provides increasingly rare microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries.  DMEA provides decisive, quick turn solutions for defense, intelligence, special operations, cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market.  DMEA’s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions—along with its unique technical perspective—allows it to develop, manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability.  DMEA can then use these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele.  After many years of performing analogous efforts, the technical experience, mission knowledge, and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are often incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects.  DMEA’s capabilities make it a key tool in the intelligent and rapid development and application of advanced technologies to identified military needs.  

Working alongside industry, DMEA has created a model partnership that provides this capability for the Department.  DMEA’s unique flexible foundry supports the Department with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now assured to remain in one location for as long as they are needed.  To obtain these processes, DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses.  These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed intellectual property (IP) and the related processes for Department needs.  These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry’s right to bid first on resulting production volumes.  DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components.  If not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production.  A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners’ valuable IP and processes.  DMEA is Government owned and operated, providing the structure and confidence that an industry partner’s IP is protected from potential competitors.  This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring, installing, and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department.  This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems, combat operations, and support needs.  As such, DMEA serves the Department, other US Agencies, industry and Allied nations.

DMEA assists hundreds of programs every year.  DMEA has provided its unique engineering assistance and capabilities to older systems, current systems, and even to programs not yet in the production phase.  This includes the F-18 Super Hornet, F-22 Raptor, F-35, RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-9 Reaper, AEGIS Advanced Surface Missile System, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), among many other programs.  DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Ops, Cyber, Intelligence, and the Radiation-Hard communities.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>With the increase in worldwide asymmetrical operations requiring quick turn, ultra-low volumes and complete trust along with the extension of life for the major weapon systems in all Services, DMEA’s unique-in-the-world capability has experienced significant growth in utilization over the last six years.  Although DMEA’s Technology Development budget has remained steady (with a minor economic growth factor) during that time, DMEA’s support for the Department has increased 19.5% per annum over the same period.  In order to fund these steadily growing requirements, DMEA has delayed or foregone many basic infrastructure updates, scheduled equipment replacements, and the acquisition and implementation of the IP that is needed to continue to support the Department.  This increased budget for DMEA Technology Development extends DMEA’s current capabilities to meet the increased demand and keep pace with the rapid pace of microelectronic technologies.      

The Microelectronics Technology Development and Support funds provide DMEA with the core resources to execute its primary mission of providing an in-house ability to quickly develop and execute appropriate solutions to keep a system operational, elevate the sophistication level or to meet new threats.  These solutions include producing high mix, low volume, unique microelectronics that are endemic to military requirements and are not commercially available.  These funds provide for the development and support necessary to ensure rapid prototyping, insertion, and support of microelectronics technologies into fielded systems, particularly as the technologies advance.  DMEA maintains critical microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries.  DMEA provides an in-house capability to support these strategically important microelectronics technologies within the Department with distinctive resources to meet the Department’s requirements across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support.  This includes producing components to meet the Department’s requirements for ultra-low volume, an extended availability timeframe, and a trusted, assured, and secure supply of microelectronics. These funds provide basic infrastructure updates as well as an in-house technical staff of skilled and experienced microelectronics personnel working in state-of-the-practice facilities providing technical and application engineering support for the implementation of advanced microelectronics research technologies from reverse engineering through design, fabrication, test, assembly, integration and installation. These funds also provide for the recapitalization and modernization of aging microelectronic infrastructure, acquisition and implementation of design and test tools, the development of advanced techniques to reverse engineer circuits, the adaptation of tools and processes to detect increasingly sophisticated counterfeit microelectronics in the defense supply chain, the development of trusted field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and the extension of the process technologies that are necessary to keep pace with the needs of defense customers as weapon system support requirements migrate toward current state-of-the-art technologies.  DMEA’s capabilities make it a key resource in the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements in response to the newest asymmetric threats and to modernize aging weapon systems.  DMEA designs, develops, and supports vital classified assets for ongoing and time-sensitive specialized intelligence operations and missions of the Department and the Special Operations Commands.  DMEA will comply with DoD Strategic Objective 3.5-2D for any demonstration programs at DMEA. 

Today’s weapon systems experience extended field operations and/or are required to remain in service beyond planned replacements, driving the need for growth in DMEA’s unique capabilities.  This need, along with the continual contraction of commercial resources, makes DMEA the only available resource allowing these systems to remain operational.  As such, DMEA and its capability are considered a National Critical Asset.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) requires the ability to develop semiconductor technologies down to 90 nanometer (nm) node sizes with the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) low-volume production-capable foundry capability.  This is a critical, time-sensitive requirement to support the DoD's strategy to provide an assured (always available) and trusted source of integrated circuits for critical weapon systems, sensors, and specialized electronic equipment.  The capability enhancement to DMEA’s existing microelectronics foundry will cover a multitude of feature sizes down to 90nm and will be the only assured supply in the world to satisfy critical DOD and US Government program issues for the foreseeable future.

Market demand for more advanced technology drives the need to make microelectronics with more capabilities in smaller sizes.  The way this size is measured is called “node size”.  In addition to utilizing various processes, industry constantly develops newer processes with ever smaller node sizes.  The pace of this progress follows what is known as “Moore's Law”: the transistor density of integrated circuits doubles every two years.

Most domestic semiconductor foundries will discontinue low-volume, high-mix integrated circuits in as little as two years because there is little or no profit margin left.  90nm is a key node size for defense applications but industry forecasts show that the commercial industry will substantially decrease the production of 90nm chips by 2014, thereby making acquisition of this essential technology extremely difficult or impossible in the future.  To keep 90nm technology available, DMEA must immediately begin to extend its current capability to 90nm to allow sufficient time to buy equipment, get the processes in place, transfer IP, etc., and ensure the DoD’s ability to use this technology by then.  This will also allow DMEA to purchase used equipment at extremely low prices from commercial sources that are closing or have already closed their 90nm process lines.  Without enhancing the existing foundry at DMEA to 90nm, in four years the DoD will be without a trusted and assured source for repeatable procurement of the state-of-the-practice integrated circuits that comprise a vast majority of the U.S. arsenal’s microelectronics.  This, in turn, will severely impact real-world operations.  In the meantime, if a Trusted Supplier is available to make a requested component, DMEA will utilize that source of supply first.  This enhancement of DMEA capabilities is absolutely necessary to provide assured and secure microelectronics design and fabrication for trusted microelectronics systems and semiconductor components to ensure DOD technological superiority over potential adversaries.

The current DMEA foundry capability will accommodate node sizes down to 180nm.  Due to physical limitations in the current DMEA lithography and fabrication equipment, the state-of-the-practice processes down to 90nm that need to be incorporated require an expansion in equipment and facilities to handle the smaller node sizes as well as the larger silicon wafers.  This Project will fund expenses associated with planning and implementing the 90nm capability.  Initial costs will include design and trade studies, costs associated with implementing force protection standards, floor plan layout and planning activities. Further, it will fund the outfitting of the selected property with the required force protection standards, infrastructure, tenant improvements, furniture, and equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department and the National Security Agency (NSA) require uninterruptible access to state-of-the-art design and manufacturing processes to produce custom integrated circuits designed specifically for military purposes.  Under DODI 5200.44, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical/essential systems need to be procured from Trusted sources in order to avoid tampered or sabotaged parts.  Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities (foundries) is making fabless semiconductor companies the norm in the U.S.  Sophisticated off-shore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies have resulted in outsourcing of electronics component and integrated circuit services to offshore facilities.  These trends threaten the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic on-shore suppliers and reducing access to Trusted fabrication sources for advanced technologies.  These trends are of acute concern to the defense and intelligence community.  Secure communications and cryptographic applications, among other defense applications depend heavily upon high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement can translate into a significant force multiplier and capability advantage.  Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors.

The Trusted Foundry program provides the Department and NSA with access to the Trusted state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities necessary to meet the confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs of their customers.  The program also provides the Services with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components.  The NSA Trusted Access Program Office, has successfully contracted with commercial sources to satisfy their state-of-the-art semiconductor requirements. It is imperative for a wide range of technologies in ongoing and future Department/ and NSA systems that access to Trusted suppliers continues.  Most importantly, Trusted Foundry access is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs requiring state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Program Mission: The BEIS builds upon the mature, existing infrastructure of DFAS Corporate Database/DFAS Corporate Warehouse (DCD/DCW), Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS), and Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) to provide timely, accurate, and reliable business information from across the DoD to support auditable financial statements as well as provide detailed information visibility for management in support of the Warfighter.
Concept/Scope: Ensure data compliance with Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) standards; provide security-defined, enterprise-level access to information for ad hoc management queries; and produce external financial management reports/statements based on standardized data. BEIS provides solutions to these goals by:
- Establishing the authoritative source for SFIS values and providing for standardization by implementing SFIS and United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) compliant financial reporting capabilities for Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports.
- Providing an enterprise-wide information environment that will serve as the single source for enterprise-wide financial information.
- Serving as the DoD-wide system for Treasury Reporting.
- Providing decision makers with significantly greater access to financial information through data visibility and business intelligence (e.g., Executive Dashboard).
The BEIS functional baseline encompasses a family of services organized into six distinct lines of business:
- Financial Reporting Services: BEIS will provide SFIS compliant financial statements and budgetary reports for DoD.
- Cash Accountability Reporting Services: BEIS will provide SFIS compliant reports of the Department’s cash position to the Treasury.
- Enterprise Level Business Intelligence Services: BEIS will provide data aggregation services, collecting select transaction level data from DoD systems of record to support business intelligence. BEIS will also deliver corporate business intelligence capabilities such as contingency reporting, status of funds reporting and management dashboards.
- Integration Support Services: This support will be funded by the requesting activity on a fee-for-service basis.
- Reference Data Services: BEIS will establish a centralized repository for maintaining and exposing referential data to the DoD enterprise. This encompasses the SFIS Library data, Master Appropriation data, Corporate Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) data, and the Transportation Global Edit Table data.
- General Ledger Services: BEIS will provide general ledger (i.e., financial management information) services for USSOCOM and select Defense Agencies.
Impact: BEIS will provide DoD enterprise-wide financial visibility to meet Enterprise Transition Plan milestones. It will serve as the centralized financial data source and the single source for enterprise Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports. Through the BEIS enterprise business intelligence capability, DoD decision makers will gain improved visibility into the information they need to make strategic budget decisions. The BEIS financial management capabilities will be used by the Military Services, Defense Agencies, and the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). Modernization efforts to accomplish deployment/implementation of BEIS capabilities are still needed in order to achieve Full Operating Capability (FOC). These efforts have been accelerated to support the Department Auditability goals and targets.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>BEIS leveraged existing infrastructure in DoD’s investment in DCD/DCW, DDRS, and DCAS. BEIS formally implemented a portfolio management approach to program management that helped to ensure a management strategy was in place to better reallocate assets within the portfolio. BEIS has and will continue to deliver needed capabilities more rapidly and efficiently using a Family of Systems (FoS) concept providing a functional baseline organized into six distinct lines of business: General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, Enterprise Level Business Intelligence Services, Cash Accountability and Reporting Services, and Financial Reporting Services. These services are provided by individual IT systems that collectively, make up the BEIS FoS. The BEIS FoS program is composed of four core systems; Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS), Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI), and Defense Corporate Database/Defense Corporate Warehouse (DCD/DCW). Capabilities are being developed incrementally with multiple releases per year to meet the Enterprise Transition Plan milestones provided to Congress. BEIS has achieved FOC for the following system components/services: DCD/DCW, to include General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, and Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI) and transitioned these to DFAS for operations and sustainment.   Based on the list of remaining requirements for BEIS DDRS Financial Reporting Services and BEIS DCAS Cash Accountability and Reporting Services an overall schedule including integrated activities as well as identified products and milestones has been developed. Contracts are competitively awarded to keep costs down. Intra-governmental services are being used where possible for infrastructure support by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Technical Services Organization and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Information Processing Center.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of the Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI) program is to modernize the participating Defense Agencies’ financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, eliminating material weaknesses, and achieving financial statement auditability for the Agencies and field activities across the DoD. DAI will transform the budget, finance, and accounting operations of the participating Defense Agencies to achieve accurate and reliable financial information for financial accountability and efficient decision making. The DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that effectively addresses the requirements depicted in such tools as the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product. The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a .mil environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 100,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions to support the warfighter.

DAI will implement a compliant COTS business solution with common business processes and data standards for the following business functions:  procure to pay; order to cash; acquire to retire; budget to report; cost accounting; as well as time and labor.  Grants financial management, budget formulation, and re-sales accounting will be implemented by full Deployment. The Defense Agencies are committed to leveraging their resources and talents to build an integrated system that supports standardized processes and proves that the DoD is capable of using a single architecture and foundation to support multiple, diverse components.

The benefits of DAI are:
- Common business processes and data standards;
- Access to real-time financial data transactions;
- Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;
- Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities;
- Standardized line of accounting with the use of Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS); and
- Use of USSGL Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.

The system integration services for the DAI will include the following:
Project management; Blueprinting; Design, Build, and Unit Test; Reports, Interfaces, Conversion, Extensions (RICE); Testing (integration, functional, performance, conversion, security, user acceptance, operational); End-User Training/Change Management; System Deployment; Conversion; Information Assurance; Sustainment; Data Service; Help Desk Support; Studies and Analysis Support; and Site Surveys.

Deployed time and labor to Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA).  Continued development of the DAI production baseline (maturing core functionality, BEA Gaps, and the Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions and Workflows (RICEW)) to achieve capabilities required to:  1) deploy four new agencies in October 2012 (beginning of FY 2013) and 2) support thirteen deployed agencies.  Five of the thirteen agencies are only using time and labor.  Continued program activities to conduct business process re-engineering, test developmental products, and prepare DARPA, OEA, Defense Security Services (DSS), and Defense Media Activity (DMA) for implementation of DAI (site surveys, training, infrastructure and sustainment preparations, development and testing). Developed automated timecard generation for use in disasters (i.e. hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, etc.); developed a process to accelerate payments to small businesses; transitioned the Central Contractor Registration interface to System for Award Management (SAM); and modified the Internal Revenue Service Form 1099 feeder report to improve contractor payment reporting.  Continued analyses necessary to prepare software and infrastructure for upgrade to Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) Release 12 (R12) to include performance and sizing requirements.  Finally, DAI began working with the DLA Audit Readiness Office to plan development of the service provider assertion packages supporting the first Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE 16).</r2:Text>

Complete the study of Oracle EBS R12 upgrade.  Procure, install and configure the software and supporting infrastructure for R12.  Configure the DAI production baseline (maturing core functionality, incorporating BEA gaps, and RICEW) by leveraging the inherent features of R12 derived from the study.  Continue program activities to upgrade training materials, implementation planning documents and templates, logistics support, acquisition documentation, architecture views, standard operating procedures, help desk materials, test scenarios and scripts in view of R12.  Conduct a DFAS lead effort to convert, test and port agency data to the new R12 environment in collaboration with the agencies.  Develop detailed logistics plan for migration of existing deployed agencies. Jointly develop the DAI Defense Working Capital Fund core requirements with DISA.  Update accounting to incorporate changes to SFIS in view of the Government-Wide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted Trial Balance System Requirements.  Update global model to incorporate changes in the Acquire-To-Retire business process required by Real Property and Installations Lifecycle Management, core architecture/data elements.  Incorporate additional changes to interfaces as SAM absorbs the functionality of other Federal Integrated Acquisition Environment Systems.  DAI, after having been recognized as an ACAT I Program, will continue to update and develop statutory/regulatory documentation requirements to support at least one ACAT I level Milestone Decision Review as directed by the Milestone Decision Authority and informed by the Acquisition Overarching Integrated Process Team. Continue support of the DLA Audit Readiness Office plan to develop the service provider assertion packages supporting the SSAE 16. </r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defense Information System for Security (DISS) will improve information sharing capabilities, accelerate clearance processing timelines, reduce security vulnerabilities, and increase DoD’s security mission capability. The DISS mission is to consolidate the DoD security mission into an Enterprise System that will automate the implementation of improved national investigative and adjudicative standards to eliminate costly and inefficient work processes and increase information collaboration across the community. DISS is currently under development and will replace the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS), a legacy system. When fully deployed this will be a secure, authoritative source for the management, storage and timely dissemination of and access to personnel clearances with the flexibility to provide additional support structure for future DoD security process growth. When deployed, it will accelerate the clearance process, reduce security clearance vulnerabilities, decrease back-end processing timelines, and support simultaneous information sharing within various DoD entities as well as among a number of authorized federal agencies. DISS will provide improved support to the Insider Threat and Personal Identity programs and will be comprised of capabilities that are currently part of the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) and will create a robust and real-time capability for all DoD participants in the Military Departments, and DoD Agencies. It will also include automated records check (ARC) functionality and the creation of an adjudicative case management capability with e-Adjudication functionality. DISS will also provide the following operational capabilities - single point of entry for: personnel security, adjudicative case management, and decision support functionality to all DoD adjudicators. DISS will provide near continuous intra-Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) communications on a web-based enabled platform utilizing a unified architecture with security management.

The DISS program specifically addresses the requirements of Section 3001(e)  of PL 108-458, Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA).  Additionally the DISS program supports the FY 2012 DoD Strategic Management Plan (SMP)'s Business Goal 6: "Re-engineer / use end-to-end business processes to reduce transaction times, drive down costs, and improve service."

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Travel System (DTS) is a fully integrated, electronic, end-to-end financial management system that automates temporary duty travel for the Department of Defense (DoD). DTS meets unique DoD mission, security and financial system requirements within the guidelines of Federal and DoD travel policies and regulations. DTS automates travel authorizations, reservations and arrangements, voucher processing, payment, reconciliation, accountability and archiving. DTS employs Digital Signature and Login/Authentication which requires users to provide a signed response using a valid DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate to gain access to the DTS application. Travel documents created in DTS are digitally signed with the user’s PKI certificate to provide a means of identifying the signer, verifying the document’s integrity, and enforcing non-repudiation of the signature by the signer.

DTS is a Major Automated Information System (MAIS), Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1AC program. DTS delivers capability by evolutionary acquisition utilizing incremental development; recognizing up front the need for future capability improvements. DTS has a flexible design so that each increment builds upon its core functionality, dependent on available, mature technology providing increasing capabilities to travelers, travel administrators, and process owners. Full Operational Capability (FOC) was declared in March 2010. Future capability improvements will be implemented as P3I beginning FY 2011.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Virtual Interactive Processing System (VIPS) was planned to modernize and automate the Information Technology capabilities for qualifying Applicants into the Military Service.  VIPS would be the future accessioning system to be used by the US Military Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM) and replace their legacy system, USMEPCOM Integrated Resource System (USMIRS). USMEPCOM serves as the single entry point for determining the physical, aptitude, and conduct qualifications of candidates for enlistment. VIPS will provide the capability to electronically acquire, process, store, secure, and seamlessly share personnel data across the Accessions Community of Interest. If fully implemented, VIPS would reduce the cycle time required to induct enlistees to meet the needs of Homeland Defense, reduce the number of visits to the Military Entrance Processing Stations, reduce manual data entry errors, and reduce attrition through better pre-screening practices. GAO reported that better pre-screening practices will yield cost savings and cost avoidance of $83M per year for the VIPS automated elements.  

Due to schedule delays and further refinement of the requirements, VIPS entered into a Critical Change state on May 11, 2011.  The Department of Defense (DoD) Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO) Acquisition Decision Memorandum dated December 7, 2012, cancelled the VIPS program and directed the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to conduct a technology demonstration (TD) of a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) to inform any future acquisition approach to meet existing requirements.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In accordance with BCL, the VIPS Program will use an incremental approach to satisfy USMEPCOM’s requirements. Requirements have been articulated to support the development of the core platform for VIPS as well as capabilities to fully assess a candidate into the military. The revised Increment 1.0 content provides sufficient capability to retire the legacy system, USMEPCOM Integrated Resource System (USMIRS) through a series of capability deployments beginning in FY 2014. Future increments will address the full VIPS capabilities necessary to realize the Return on Investment (ROI).

Originally the VIPS Increment 1.0 was procured under a single contract, competitively awarded to provide both a core infrastructure and business functions to support the accessions process. The VIPS PMO awarded a single Increment 1.0 contract on September 30, 2010 that will initially provide for the design of VIPS Increment 1.0 through PDR. The prime contractor also completed the design, development, and acceptance testing of the ROC prototype. Once the CCR report is completed, the program will seek a Milestone B decision. Following a successful Milestone B decision, the Government will assess appropriate contracting options to complete design, testing, deployment, fielding and training support. The system integration will include management of the technical configuration baseline and sustainment across VIPS. The VIPS PMO has adopted rigorous cost controls using earned value management and a comprehensive risk management program to manage program execution.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>WAWF is the DoD enterprise system for secure electronic submission, acceptance and processing of invoices. It is mandated for use by all DoD Services and Agencies for electronic invoicing by DFAR 252.232-7003. WAWF processes over 86 million transactions worth $301B per year and saves DoD millions of dollars annually in processing cost and avoided interest (over $77.6 M in FY10). WAWF brings together the invoice, the receiving report, and the contract from EDA to provide the accounting and entitlement systems with the three-way match needed to authorize payment. WAWF is also the Enterprise data entry point for the Item Unique Identifier (IUID) and Government Furnished Property (GFP) programs, the source of receipt and acceptance data for Service Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERP), and is central for the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) enterprise solutions for Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) and Inter Governmental Transfer (IGT). The benefits to DoD are a single face to industry suppliers, global accessibility of documents, reduced need for re-keying, improved data accuracy, real-time processing, secure transactions with audit capability, and faster processing resulting in reduced interest penalties. For vendors, benefits include the capability to electronically submit invoices, reduction of lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contract payment records.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD) is a multi-service/multi-agency solution established as a key initiative to provide full visibility of funds distributed through echelon I and II for the Military Departments and at all levels for the Defense Agencies to improve and modernize the OUSD(C) funds distribution process.   Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place.  

Within the current OUSD(C) environment, the Directorates have a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems.  This lack of standardization and integration limits the visibility of funding information, introduces manual efforts and undue complexities into the management of budget authority, and impedes the flow of funding documents.  This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous.  The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions.   

The envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow.  Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data.  Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.

The operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment.  The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding.

EFD Phase II enables replacement of a combination of manual processes and PBAS-Funds Distribution Defense Wide (PBAS-FD DW).  PBAS is built on mature mainframe technology and programmed in COBOL language.  The risk of using outdated technology increases as the system ages. EFD Phase 2 plans included configuring EFD to support TI-97 funds distribution at echelons III and below – those currently executed in PBAS-FD DW.  

EFD Phase III addresses a number of residual functions currently performed in the PBAS system involving Trust Funds, Revolving Funds, BRAC, etc. Final determination of which elements of functionality will be incorporated into EFD or another solution will be based on an analysis of both technical and functional requirements. This analysis will occur likely during FY 2012.    

RDT&amp;E funding is requested for FY 2013 - FY 2015 to support development / implementation of EFD phases II and III.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This is a new program element established to support the Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI), an Acquisition Category I program.  Previous funding for DAI was documented in the Defense Enterprise Business Systems program element 0605070S.


The Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI) mission is to deliver auditable Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliant business environments for Defense Agencies providing accurate, timely, authoritative financial data supporting the DoD goal of standardizing financial management practices improving financial decision support, and supporting audit readiness.  Currently, Defense Agencies use more than 10 different non-compliant financial management systems supporting diverse operational functions and the warfighter in decision making and financial reporting.  These disparate, non-integrated systems do not meet statutory requirements to produce timely, auditable reports.


The DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies’ financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of  agencies and field activities across the DoD.  DAI will support a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision making.   The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a “.mil” environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.


The DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), version 11i (R11).  DAI implemented an Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards.   The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative source).  


DAI supports the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Strategy 5, “Reform the business and support functions of the Defense enterprise”.  DAI is also aligned to the FY 2012/FY 2013 DOD Strategic Management Plan Business Goal 2: “Strengthen DoD financial management to respond to warfighter needs and sustain public confidence through auditable financial statements”. The objective of the Defense Agencies Initiative is to achieve auditable, CFO Act compliant business environments for the Defense Agencies with accurate, timely, authoritative financial data. 


The primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements. Common business functions within budget execution include  the Department’s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report; Procure to Pay;  Acquire to Retire (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (Time and Labor reporting only); and Order to Cash.  Future capabilities will support Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, Budget Formulation, Grants Financial Management, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA)) as well as a Contract Writing capability.


DAI is currently implemented at 11 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, OUSD(C) (Time and Labor only) and supporting over 9,200 users.  In addition, since Oracle is phasing out maintenance of Oracle EBS, Release 11i, the program is required to migrate to EBS Release 12 (R12). The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system.  Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, complete the R12 upgrade, initiate the annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE 16) assertion packages, and sustain the system.  


The benefits of DAI are:
- Common business processes and data standards;
- Access to real-time financial data transactions;
- Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;
- Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities; Standardized line of accounting with the use of SFIS; and
- Use of United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.


The DAI PMO will provide the R12 Upgrade system integration services that include: acquisition management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversion, Extensions, and Workflows (RICEW) objects; testing (information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, security, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated ERP system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support.

FY 2013 Accomplishments to Date: The PMO delivered Release 3.0 full financial capabilities developed during FY 2012 to existing user Agencies as well as DARPA, DSS, OEA, and DMA.  The PMO also delivered a Data Services utility to convey Agency financial data from DAI to an Agency repository or data warehouse.  This generic service was implemented to populate the DARPA MSS.  

In FY 2013 the PMO will: 

•Create current baseline versions of acquisition and other reviews as an ACAT IA program.
•Develop an Oracle EBS R12 upgrade Analyses of Alternatives in concert with the DCMO to include performance and sizing requirements and develop a plan of action and milestones to conduct the upgrade.
•Perform business process re-engineering in concert with the Agencies that will include improving the funds visibility processes, streamlining configuration management, and improving change management.  
•Develop Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DODAF) architectural views to DODAF 2.0 in line with DLA Guidance and Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) 2.0 Analytic Conformance Class (primitives).   
•Identify and track new Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) preparatory audit’s Notices of Findings in the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), FFMIA and other compliance areas.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DAI is being developed and implemented using an incremental strategy including major annual software releases to accommodate the delivery of new capabilities and additional Agency deployments (in future years).  In FY 2014, the DAI PMO will conduct the Oracle EBS Release 12 Upgrade based on the FY 2013 analysis of alternatives conducted with the DCMO.

The PMO is responsible for all aspects of program control and execution. The DAI PMO will use a combination of contract types as directed by the contractual environment to support the delivery and sustainment of required capabilities.  Since the DAI PMO serves as the system integrator using a collaborative team of support contractors that provide expertise in critical/functional areas, the PMO will re-compete services as they expire.  The PMO does not intend to bundle services or obtain a system integrator. 
</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>In FY 2014, the DAI PMO will configure the Global Model and supporting RICEW that will be compatible with the Oracle EBS R12 Upgrade that will deliver a Defense Working Fund capability and a COTS inherent expanded Purchase Request (PR) capability within DAI. The PMO will not deploy any new capability to new Defense Agencies in FY 2014.  The DAI PMO will be reporting on several of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD (AT&amp;L)) Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP) required monthly metrics within the Procure to Pay (P2P) BEA E2E business process flow.  These P2P metrics, also referred to as Electronic Commerce (EC) metrics, include several metrics associated with quality (invoices on hold, pre-validation errors, unmatched disbursements, unsupportable disbursements and frequency of unmatched disbursements; speed (timing of contract award posting to Electronic Document Access system, contract award to obligation and on time treasury reporting and overage invoices); and cost (reconciliation, payment processing fees and interest penalties).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY 2010, DLA Troop Support Subsistence sold $4.7 billion in subsistence goods and services to the Department of Defense and other customers.  The Rations portion of this business was $702M in FY 2010.  The Combat Rations R&amp;D funding request is .002% of sales. The Combat Rations Program is focused on improving the manufacturing technologies related to the production and distribution of the combat rations that are at the forefront of these operations, including Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) as well as Unitized Group Rations (UGR).  The objectives are increased readiness, improved quality, optimum sizing for transportation and storage; and better ration variety.  CORANET research efforts also help control the cost of the combat rations.  The CORANET program engages all elements of the supply chain including the producers, military Services, Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), US Army Veterinary Command, US Army Public Health Command, DLA Logistics R&amp;D, DLA Troop Support Subsistence and academia to research and transition improved technologies for operational rations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense, through the Defense Logistics Agency, purchased $2.1 billion of clothing and textile items in FY 2010.  The lead-time is up to 15 months and the current inventory acquisition value is over $1.4 billion.  The current focus of DLA military clothing research is Customer Driven Uniform Manufacturing (CDUM).  CDUM explores the application of advanced technologies and process reengineering to the end-to-end management of clothing and individual equipment (CIE).  CDUM is focusing on three thrust areas:

  1.  Supply Chain Process Reengineering and Advanced Technology for Military Clothing 
  2.  Central Issue Facility (CIF) Process Reengineering and Shared Visibility
  3.  Manufacturing Methods for Product Performance and Quality Improvement</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>CDUM II will continue the TDP project to address gaps in product specifications by developing a flexible environment that integrates multiple input and output formats to improve management, configuration control and communication between the Government and Defense Industrial Base manufacturers. Technical initiatives include developing a semantic data driven product data environment. Data mining will be adapted to populate the data models. The primary benefit will be a significant reduction in TDP errors and improved data access by the multiple tiers of industrial base.  In addition, the technology facilitates communication among the Service Design Agencies, the Industrial Base and DLA Troop Support-Clothing and Textiles.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Weapon system spare parts which use castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of backorders.  Cast parts are 2% of National Stock Numbered parts but represent 4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% of them are castings.  This program develops innovative technologies and processes to improve the procurement, manufacture, and design of weapon system spare parts that use castings.  The Procurement Readiness Optimization-Advanced Casting Technology (PRO-ACT) program takes a systems view and considers not only the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) perspective but also the Military Service Engineering Support Activities (ESA) which DLA works with to solve technical issues, as well as the industrial supply base.  The program has three components:  Rapid Acquisition, Quality, and Cost Effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Weapon system spare parts that use forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA backorders.  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered parts but represent ~4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% of them are forgings. This program develops methods and technology to improve the supply of forged parts.  This program takes a holistic view of the problem and attacks root causes inside DLA, at DLA’s engineering support activity partners in the Services, and at DLA forging suppliers.  The program has three thrusts:  Business Enterprise Integration to improve supply support approaches; FORGE-IT to develop and improve technical problems; and R&amp;D which develops new technology for forging suppliers, including new methods for making forge dies (typically the longest lead time item) and for simulation of metal flow inside the forge die (to eliminate trial and error development of the die).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Develop a capability to emulate most obsolete digital integrated circuits (ICs) in the Federal catalog using a single, flexible manufacturing line.  DoD has estimated $2.9 billion is spent every five years redesigning circuit card assemblies.  Many of these circuit card redesigns are performed to mitigate IC obsolescence.  Commercial ICs have short Product Life Cycles (often only 18 months).  IC Manufacturers subsequently move on to later generations of ICs, leaving little to no sources for their previous IC products.  DoD maintains weapons systems much longer than IC lifecycles, resulting in an obsolescence problem.  In order to avoid costs and potential readiness issues associated with buying/carrying excess inventories acquired before commercial availability ceases, or redesigning the next higher assembly to mitigate the obsolete IC, DLA (as the manager of 88% of the IC Federal Stock Class) must have the capability to manufacture needed IC devices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>MAE has transitioned fully-developed and verified 800 nanometer Emulation production capabilities, ranging to 200,000 gates, to DLA Land and Maritime for full-scale production of previously non-procurable ICs.  It also transitioned a fully-developed and verified high speed emitter-coupled logic production capability to source critical high demand NSNs lacking supply. MAE has formulated device family targets for a Linear Emulation thrust.  It initiated a 250 nanometer Emulation fabrication process (High Performance (speed) and Density) development providing additional FSC 5962 coverage.  It continued 350 nanometer Emulation fabrication process development, bringing new capabilities to the Customers and Agency.  It incorporated Integrated Circuit Characterization tool advancements into the Emulation flow, enabling supply for non-procurables.  The tool also provided a value-added capability for our Customers’ technical data packages.  MAE implemented microcircuit DNA marking to assure traceability / trust in the supply chain.</r2:Text>

MAE will transition additional Advanced CMOS Digital Microcircuit Emulation capability into full-scale production increasing DLA’s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs.  MAE will also transition higher density Read-Only and Random-Access Memory Emulation capability into full-scale production further increasing DLA’s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs. The newly transitioned Emulation capabilities will address several discontinued device families and will increase the potential Emulation production envelope by several hundred NSNs. MAE will continue 350 and 250 nanometer Emulation fabrication process development, bringing new capabilities to the Customers and Agency.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The BATTNET R&amp;D partners were established by contract September 2009 through a competitive Broad Area Announcement (BAA) allowing for maximum competition. Partner Contracts were based upon proposals that demonstrated knowledge, experience, and expertise in the following areas of interest: Automation, Battery Maintenance, Competition &amp; Contracting Requirements, Diminishing Manufacturing &amp; Supply, Lithium Battery Safety, Reducing Acquisition Costs, Shelf Life, Supply Chain Logistics, Surge/Sustainment, and Technology Transition/Insertion. The BATTNET, which includes a Government Steering Group (GSG) of power source technical experts from the military services R&amp;D groups, is informed of general R&amp;D requirements for supply chain improvement. The partners develop among themselves related R&amp;D projects, which are then formally evaluated by the GSG. Selected projects are then chartered within DLA and planned for contract STP awards when funds are available.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Each Short Term Project (STP) will have performance metrics appropriate to its scope. Also all STPs will include a business case to demonstrate return on investment, or a readiness case to calculate warfighter impact versus costs.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

Many of the Center’s services are also available to the public via the internet, social networks, and apps for mobile devices.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>PDC projects beyond the baseline Situational Awareness &amp; Decision Support Applications/Tools architecture (Atlas/EMOPS/RAPIDS) undertaken in support of the DoD Cooperative Agreement (CA) with the University of Hawaii (UH) are from PDC customers (e.g., DoD, NGOs, other nations, academia, and industry). The PDC prepares the public, disaster managers, governments, and others to mitigate the effects of disasters.  The goal is to have people and technology work together to preserve life, safeguard livelihoods, protect property to foster disaster-resilient communicates. Projects obtained and funded from this customer base serve as a means to determine PDC product and services relevancy.  </r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Projects objectives and tasks are designed to build upon the previous year’s successes and are consistent with the framework and direction provided by the 2011-2015 PDC Strategic Plan.  At the beginning of each calendar year, an Annual Plan is in-place to guide the program and enable a framework for performance feedback to the DoD PDC Program Manager, the PDC Executive Director, WHS CA Contracting Office, and the UH. At the end of each calendar year, these stakeholders meet to review the past year performance and finalize a new Annual Plan for the next calendar year.  This plan details a set of specific objectives to further capabilities and capacities supporting the PDC’s mission and increasing operational value to the stakeholders.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>
