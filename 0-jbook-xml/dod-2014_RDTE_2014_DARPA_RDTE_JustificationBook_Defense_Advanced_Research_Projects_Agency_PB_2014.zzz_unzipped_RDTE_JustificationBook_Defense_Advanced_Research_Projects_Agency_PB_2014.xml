                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications.  It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, biological and materials sciences.

     The Bio/Info/Micro Sciences project will explore and develop potential technological breakthroughs that exist at the intersection of biology, information technology and micro/physical systems to exploit advances and leverage fundamental discoveries for the development of new technologies, techniques and systems of interest to the DoD.  Programs in this project will draw upon information and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple biological architectures and functions, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels. 

     The Math and Computer Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in new computational models and mechanisms for reasoning and communication in complex, interconnected systems.  The project is exploring novel means to exploit computer capabilities; enhance human-to-computer and computer-to-computer interaction technologies; advance innovative computer architectures; and discover new learning mechanisms and innovations in software composition.  It is also fostering the computer science academic community to address the DoD's need for innovative computer and information science technologies.  Additionally, this project explores the science of mathematics for potential defense applications.

      The Cyber Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber-security.  Networked computing systems control virtually everything, from power plants and energy distribution, transportation systems, food and water distribution, financial systems, to defense systems.  Protecting the infrastructure on which these systems rely is a national security issue.   The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD cyber-capabilities survive adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Basic research in cyber security is required to provide a basis for continuing progress in this area. Promising research results will transition to both technology development and system-level projects.

     The Electronic Sciences project explores and demonstrates electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits and processing concepts that will provide: 1) new technical options for meeting the information gathering, transmission and processing required to maintain near-real time knowledge of the enemy and the ability to communicate decisions based on that knowledge to all forces in near-real time; and 2) provide new means for achieving substantial increases in performance and cost reduction of military systems providing these capabilities.

     The Materials Sciences project is concerned with the development of: high power density/high energy density mobile and portable power sources; processing and design approaches for nanoscale and/or bimolecular materials, interfaces and microsystems; and materials and measurements for molecular-scale electronics.

     The Transformative Sciences project supports scientific research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in the areas of computing and the computing-reliant subareas of social sciences, life sciences, manufacturing, and commerce as a means of improving military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging converging trends.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This unique interaction will develop new mathematical and experimental tools for understanding biology in a way that will allow its application to a myriad of DoD problems.  These tools will help exploit the advances in the complex modeling of physical and biological phenomena.  It is also expected that understanding the fundamentals of biology will aid in developing tools to understand complex, non-linear networks and force structures.  This program will also explore the fundamental nature of time in biology and medicine.  This will include mapping basic clock circuitry in biological systems from the molecular level up through unique species level activities with a special emphasis on the applicability to human biology.  Operational relevance of this research activity includes improving our understanding of sleep-wake cycles, increasing the scientific understanding of deployment cycle lengths, and enhancing our ability to model the dynamics of disease outbreaks.</r2:Description>

The unique stability afforded biological systems in their ability to adapt to wide extremes of physical and endurance (e.g., heat, cold, and sleeplessness) parameters will be examined and exploited in order to engineer stability into biological systems required for the military (such as blood, bioengineered tissues or other therapeutics).  A key new antibody technology will develop the ideal antibody master molecule for use in unattended sensors that maintains high temperature stability and controllable affinity for threat agents.  Applications to Defense systems include the development of chemical and biological sensors; tools for strategic military decision-makers involved in information operations, and improved warfighter battlefield survivability.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Mathematics of the Brain

The Quantitative Models of the Brain program will develop a new mathematical paradigm for understanding how to model reasoning processes for application to a variety of emerging DoD challenges.  Critical to this endeavor will be determining how information is stored and recalled in the brain and developing predictive, quantitative models of learning and memory.  Using this understanding, the program will develop powerful new symbolic computational capabilities for the DoD in a mathematical system that provides the ability to understand complex and evolving tasks without exponentially increasing software and hardware requirements.  This includes a comprehensive mathematical theory to extract and leverage information in signals at multiple acquisition levels, which would fundamentally generalize compressive sensing for multi-dimensional sources beyond domains typically used.  New insights related to signal priors, task priors, and adaptation will enable these advances.  This program will establish a functional mathematical basis on which to build future advances in cognitive neuroscience, computing capability, and signal processing across the DoD.  The quantitative models of learning and memory will also lead to improvements in the training of individuals and teams as well as advances in cognitive rehabilitation (e.g. PTSD).</r2:Description>

Physics in biology will explore the role and impact of quantum effects in biological processes and systems.  This includes exploiting manifestly quantum mechanical effects that exist in biological systems at room temperature to develop a revolutionary new class of robust, compact, high sensitivity and high selectivity sensors.  Finally, the quantum phenomena uncovered will be exploited to control the attraction of insects to humans with the potential to completely eliminate insect bites and thus the transmission of parasitic, bacterial or viral pathogens.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Young Faculty Award (YFA) program is to encourage junior faculty at universities and their equivalent at non-profit science and technology research institutions to participate in sponsored research programs that will augment capabilities for future defense systems.  This program focuses on speculative technologies for greatly enhancing microsystems technologies and defense sciences.  The long-term goal for this program is to develop the next generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians in key disciplines who will focus a significant portion of their careers on DoD and National Security issues.  Beginning in 2013, YFA technical topic areas are more closely tied to programs currently underway at DARPA and to recently identified DoD and National Security needs.  The aim is for YFA recipients to receive deep interactions with DARPA program managers, programs, performers, and the user community.  Current activities include research in thirteen topic areas spanning from Quantum Science and Technology to Robotics and Supervised Autonomy, Mathematics, Computing, and the interface of Engineering and Biology.  A key aspect of the YFA program is DARPA-sponsored military visits; all YFA Principal Investigators are expected to participate in one or more military site visits to help them better understand DoD needs.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Strategic Social Interaction Modules (SSIM) program will improve military training to include the social interaction skills and abilities warfighters need for successful engagement with local populations.  In the current operational environment, it is imperative to develop rapport with local leaders and civilians as their cooperation and consent will be necessary for successful operations.  SSIM will emphasize the foundational social skills necessary to achieve cultural understanding in any social setting and the skills necessary for successful interactions across different social groups.  These core skills do not require soldiers to have knowledge of a specific culture prior to contact but emphasizes skills for orienting toward and discovering patterns of meaningful social behavior.  SSIM will develop the requisite training technology including advanced gaming/simulation techniques that incorporate new methods for practicing social agility in social encounters, as well as how to discover and adapt to unfamiliar culturally-specific conduct, manners, and practices.  SSIM will enhance military effectiveness by enabling close collaborative relationships with local peoples and leaders.</r2:Description>

Such a theory would incorporate techniques from diverse mathematical disciplines such as Stochastic Process Theory, Harmonic Analysis, Formal Languages and Theoretical Computer Science to construct a common framework wherein the quantitative value of data acquisition may be assessed relative to dynamically-varying context.  In addition, the structure will accommodate the notion that data acquisition and information processing are coupled, requiring some degree of feedback and control, while simultaneously admitting the possibility of different logics, such as those that allow for incomplete and time-varying states of knowledge.  The result of this effort will produce advances in fundamental domains of mathematics with the potential to reshape current DoD approaches to managing the battlespace.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Unconventional Computation

The Unconventional Processing of Signals for Intelligent Data Exploitation (UPSIDE) program will address the open problems facing real-time ISR systems and other power-constrained data-intensive applications.  The objective of the UPSIDE program is to create a high-level, non-Boolean computational model and map it directly to the unique functional properties of new emerging devices to achieve significant increases in power efficiency and performance.  The UPSIDE program will create a new generation of computing structures that will, in turn, enable revolutionary advances in ISR processing, particularly for DoD applications of embedded, real-time sensor data analysis.  Because Boolean data representations are inherently power-inefficient for many datasets, particularly those produced by noisy analog real-time sensors, the UPSIDE program will establish an unconventional, non-Boolean, computing paradigm to enable new and needed capabilities in the area of sensor data analysis. 

UPSIDE intends to implement this new computing paradigm in the form of a specialized hardware component termed the inference module (IM).  The inference module will be first developed through simulation, and then implemented using mixed-signal complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS), as well as using state of the art emerging (non-CMOS) devices.  Throughout the program, the inference module will be benchmarked using a DoD relevant image processing pipeline, to verify gains in both computing throughput and power efficiency.  The result will be a computing infrastructure and functional implementations that demonstrate three orders of magnitude improvement in processing speed and four orders of magnitude improvement in power efficiency.  These gains will constitute a disruptive new level of embedded computational efficiency for future real-time sensor systems.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>While the DoD has been extremely effective in deploying rigorous analytical and predictive methods for problems involving continuously valued variables (tracking, signals processing), analytical methods for discrete data such as graphs and networks have not kept pace.  Recent evidence has shown that social network analysis can provide critical insight when used in DoD-relevant scenarios.  In this paradigm, nodes represent people of interest and their relationships or interactions are edges; the result forms a network or graph.  Current analysis of social networks, however, is just in its infancy:  the composition of real-world networks is understood only at the most coarse and basic details (diameter, degree distribution).  In order to implement social network techniques efficiently and usefully, a better understanding of the finer mathematical structure of social networks is needed.  This includes the development of a comprehensive and minimal mathematical set that characterizes social networks of DoD interest, and includes a description of how these quantities vary in both space and time.</r2:Description>

Networked computing systems control significant elements of critical national infrastructure, from power plants and energy distribution grids, transportation systems, food and water distribution systems, and financial networks to defense systems.  During the past decade information technologies have driven the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Unfortunately, during the same period, cyber-adversaries, which include nation-states, criminal/terrorist groups, transnational actors, and lone miscreants, have grown rapidly in sophistication and number.  The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD resilience in the face of adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Basic research in cyber security is required to provide a basis for continuing progress in this area.

                                    <r2:Description>The Active Authentication program will develop more effective user identification and authentication technologies.  Current authentication approaches are typically based on long, complex passwords and incorporate no mechanism to verify the user originally authenticated is the user still in control of the session.  The Active Authentication program will address these issues by focusing on the unique aspects of the individual (i.e., the cognitive fingerprint) through the use of software-based biometrics that continuously validate the identity of the user.  Active Authentication will integrate multiple biometric modalities to create a system that is accurate, robust, and transparent to the user.</r2:Description>

Research areas include new electronic and optoelectronic device and circuit concepts, operation of devices at higher frequency and lower power, extension of diode laser operation to new wavelength ranges relevant to military missions, development of uncooled and novel infrared detector materials for night vision and other sensor applications, development of innovative optical and electronic technologies for interconnecting modules in high performance systems, research to realize field portable electronics with reduced power requirements, and system and component level improvements to provide greater affordability and reliability.  Additionally, electronically controlled microinstruments offer the possibility of nanometer-scale probing, sensing and manipulation for ultra-high density information storage "on-a-chip," for nanometer-scale patterning, and for molecular level analysis and synthesis.  These microinstruments may also offer new approaches to integration, testing, controlling, manipulating and manufacturing nanometer-scale structures, molecules and devices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The objective of the Advanced X-Ray Integrated Sources (AXIS) program is to develop tunable, mono-energetic, spatially coherent X-ray sources with greatly reduced size, weight and power while dramatically increasing their electrical efficiency through application of micro-scale engineering technologies such as MEMS and NEMS.  Such X-ray sources will enable new versatile imaging modalities based on phase contrast techniques which are 1000X more sensitive than the conventional absorption contrast imaging.  Such imaging modalities should enable reverse engineering of integrated circuits to validate trustworthiness as well as battlefield imaging of soft tissues and blood vessel injuries from blunt trauma without the injection of a contrast enhancing agent.  The radiation dose required for imaging will also be reduced.

The Basic Research component of this effort will focus on defining the fundamental science necessary for the creation of compact and highly efficient synchrotron X-ray sources.  These sources may lead to future developments in the  imaging field based on tunable x-ray wavelengths.

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Microscale Plasma Devices (MPD) program is to design, develop, and characterize MPD technologies, circuits, and substrates.  The MPD program will focus on development of fast, small, reliable, carrier dense, microplasma switches capable of operating in extreme conditions, such as high-radiation and high-temperature environments.  Specific focus will be given to methods that produce efficient generation of ions, radio frequency energy, and light sources over a range of gas pressures.  Applications for such devices are far reaching, including the construction of complete high-frequency plasma-based logic circuits, and integrated circuits with superior resistance to radiation and extreme temperature environments.  It is envisaged that both two and multi-terminal devices consisting of various architectures will be developed and optimized under the scope of this program.  MPDs will be developed in various circuits and substrates to demonstrate the efficacy of different approaches.

The Basic Research part of this effort is focused on fundamental MPD research and will advance scientific knowledge based on the study of several key MPD design parameters.  These parameters include ultra-high pressure and carrier densities regimes.  MPD will focus on expanding the design space for plasma devices enabling revolutionary advances in microplasma device performance.  It is expected that MPD will develop innovative concepts and technologies that are clearly disruptive with respect to the current state of the art.  Fundamental scientific knowledge derived from MPD is also expected to drive developments in commercialization of MPD technology developed and funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>* Formerly titled the Microsystems Research Consortium

The Semiconductor Technology Advanced Research Network (STARNet) program is a new government-industry partnership focused on removing the roadblocks to achieving performance needed for future sensing, communication, computing, and memory applications.  It combines the expertise and resources from select defense, semiconductor, and information companies with those of DARPA to sponsor an academic base focused on specific technology requirements set by experts in industry and DARPA.  The program will involve close collaboration between these experts and the academic base with industry providing 60% of program funding matched by 40% from DARPA.  For industry, leveraging funding and expertise with both other companies and DARPA to solve common technical hurdles in a pre-competitive research model is highly attractive.  From the government perspective this kind of model also provides unique insight into the directions future commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies will be taking.  This perspective assists DARPA in defining the technology gaps where the DoD can make the most out of its limited resources by investing in those areas where the largest technology discrimination can be achieved.  This discrimination is key to expanding technological superiority of the United States DoD.

Research in STARNet is divided into a discovery thrust (ACCEL) and an integration thrust (NEXT) focused on combining current or emerging technologies to provide new capabilities.  ACCEL includes projects governed by virtual academic centers discovering new material systems, devices, and novel computing/sensing architectures.  NEXT involves projects on advanced analog and mixed signal, complex system design tools, and alternative computing architectures.  As the projects in ACCEL mature it is expected that they will replace the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) based efforts currently in NEXT.  

The STARNet program is unique. It creates a community where industry and government participate as co-sponsors to guide and learn from a large academic research base, with DoD shaping the goals to have direct impact on important long-range DoD problems.  STARNet has a 5-year duration.  It is expected that industry and DARPA will continuously evaluate STARNet and their respective challenges to determine if another collaborative program is warranted at the conclusion of the 5-year term.</r2:Description>

This program will develop arrays that are heavily digitally influenced and that can be connected together as if they represented nodes on a traditional computing network.  New advances in digital circuits at every element array panel will allow for ubiquitous phased array technology with heretofore unrealized coverage and capabilities.  This program will take a fundamental look at the role of digital arrays and how commonality and aggregation can be affected by emerging capabilities.  Simultaneously, this effort will focus on the development of arrays which can quickly create different unique RF personalities/capabilities on top of common digital hardware.  The project will demonstrate levels of diversity in the use of the electromagnetic spectrum which is severely limited by the current approach of hand designing the array with heavily specialized RF beamformers that are unique to each system.

                                    <r2:Description>The Micro-coolers for FPAs program will develop low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) cryogenic coolers for application in high performance infrared (IR) cameras.  It is well known that the sensitivity of an IR focal-plane array (FPA) is improved by cooling its detectors to cryogenic temperatures.  The disadvantages of state-of-the-art cryo-coolers are their large size, high power and high cost.  Thermoelectric (TE) coolers are relatively small, but are very power hungry.
 
To reduce IR camera SWaP-C, innovations in cooler technology are needed.  This program will exploit the Joule-Thompson (J-T) cooling principle, in a silicon-based MEMS technology, for making IR FPA coolers with very low SWaP-C. MEMS microfluidics, piezoelectric MEMS, and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics will be used to demonstrate an integrated cold head and compressor, all in a semiconductor chip.

                                    <r2:Description>Many Department of Defense (DoD) systems use micro- and nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS).  Such devices are used in compact accelerometers and gyroscopes for stability control in inertial navigation and in switches for optical communication and data routing.  However, they operate many orders of magnitude away from their ultimate limits.  Techniques to reduce or overcome thermal noise in MEMS/NEMS devices are critical for realizing their full potential.

The ORCHID program will leverage recent successes within the field of cavity-opto-mechanics to broadly explore the application space while driving technological development toward smaller and more robust devices capable of deployment in the field.  It is envisioned that such devices, once demonstrated, will find broad application across DoD, particularly in the areas of force sensing and optical communication.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Prior DARPA efforts have demonstrated the ability to monolithically integrate inherently different semiconductor types to achieve near-ideal "mix-and-match" capability for DoD circuit designers.  Specifically, one such program was the Compound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon (COSMOS) program, in which transistors of Indium Phosphide (InP) could be freely mixed with silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to obtain the benefits of both technologies (very high speed and very high circuit complexity/density, respectively).  The Diverse &amp; Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) effort will take this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (e.g., GaN, InP, GaAs, ABCS), microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures.  This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true "systems on a chip" (SoCs) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions for a wide array of system applications.

The Basic Research part of this program is focusing on the development of new hetero-integration processes and capabilities that, if successful, will ultimately be demonstrated in application-specific circuits and transferred into the manufacturing flow.

                                    <r2:Description>The Fundamentals of Nanoscale and Emergent Effects and Engineered Devices program seeks to understand and exploit physical phenomena for developing more efficient and powerful devices.  This includes developing devices and structures to enable controllable photonic devices at multiple wavelengths, engineering palladium microstructures with large deuterium loadings to study absorption thermodynamics and effects, and enabling real-time detection as well as analysis of signals and molecules and origin of emergent behavior in correlated electron devices.  Arrays of engineered nanoscale devices will result in an order of magnitude (10 to 100 times) reduction in the time required for analysis and identification of known and unknown (engineered) molecules.  This program will develop novel nanomaterials for exquisitely precise purification of materials, enabling such diverse applications as oxygen generation and desalination, ultra-high sensitivity magnetic sensors, and correlated electron effects such as superconductivity.  Additionally, this program will compare the phenomenology of various biological, physical and social systems and abstract the common features that are responsible for their properties of self-organization, emergent behavior, and physical intelligence.  Finally, this program will develop stabilization and scale-up methods to fabricate high pressure crystal structures within domains not previously possible.  This offers the promise to exploit the incredible properties of high pressure phases (e.g, hardness for armor) using economically viable manufacturing approaches.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Living Foundries</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goal of Living Foundries is to create a revolutionary, biologically-based manufacturing platform to provide new materials, capabilities, and manufacturing paradigms for the DoD and the Nation.  With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  However, the DoD's ability to harness this platform is rudimentary.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the tools, technologies, and methodologies to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  The program will enable the rapid and scalable development of previously unattainable technologies and products (i.e. those that cannot be accessed using known, synthetic mechanisms) leveraging biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials (e.g. flouropolymers, enzymes, lubricants, coatings and materials for harsh environments), novel functions (e.g. self-repairing and self-regenerating systems), biological reporting systems, and therapeutics to facilitate new solutions and enhancements to military needs and capabilities.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling distributed, adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value materials, devices and capabilities in the field or on base.  Such a capability will decrease the DoD's dependence on tenuous material supply chains that are vulnerable to political change, targeted attack, or environmental accident.

If successful, Living Foundries will do for biology what very-large-scale integration (VLSI) did for the semiconductor device industry: enable the design and engineering of increasingly complex systems to address and enhance military needs and capabilities.  Living Foundries will develop and apply an engineering framework to biology that decouples biological design from fabrication, develops and yields design rules and tools, and manages biological complexity through simplification, abstraction, and standardization of both processes and components.  The result will be rapid design, construction, implementation and testing of complex, higher-order genetic networks with programmable functionality and DoD applicability.  Research thrusts include developing the fundamental tools, capabilities and methodologies to accelerate the biological design-build-test cycle, thereby reducing the extensive cost and time it takes to engineer new systems and expanding the complexity and accuracy of designs that can be built.  Specific tools and capabilities include: interoperable tools for design and modeling; automated, modular and standardized fabrication and genome-scale engineering processes; modular regulatory elements, devices and circuits for hierarchical and scalable engineering; standardized test platforms and chassis; and novel approaches to process measurement, validation, and debugging.  Applied research for this program begins in FY 2013 in PE 0602715E, project MBT-02.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Networked Approaches to Intractability program will tackle complex problems such as corruption, human trafficking, and genocide that appear intractable.  The U.S. military is increasingly involved with societies plagued by such seemingly self-perpetuating evils.  Problems in this class often include social, cultural, ideological, political, and economic constraints, and consequently stakeholders with radically differing world views and frames of reference.  Limited U.S. patience for long-term engagements and interconnectedness with other similarly complex problems further characterize the challenge.  Social networking has shown initial promise for problems of this nature, such as bribery, though on a smaller scale.  The Networked Approaches to Intractability program will develop social networking-based applications that incorporate recent breakthroughs in game theory and multi-party negotiation to break vicious social cycles and create virtuous social cycles.  The program seeks approaches to modeling and reasoning about problems of this nature, incentive mechanisms to elicit relevant information from stakeholders, and the creation of tools for combatant commanders and stakeholders collaboratively addressing such challenges.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR) program will create electronic systems capable of physically disappearing (either in whole or in part) in a controlled, triggerable manner.  VAPR will enable a host of previously unrealizable technologies that can be programmed to disappear, are biocompatible, and/or are physically reconfigurable. Applications include sensors for conventional indoor/outdoor environments (buildings, transportation, and materiel), environmental monitoring over large areas, and simplified diagnosis, treatment, and health monitoring in the field. The program will develop and establish an initial set of materials and components along with integration and manufacturing capabilities to undergird a fundamentally new class of electronics defined by their performance and transience. These transient electronics ideally should perform in a manner comparable to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems, but with limited device persistence that can be programmed, adjusted in real-time, triggered, and/or sensitive to the environment.  VAPR will build an initial capability to make transient electronics a deployable technology for the DoD and Nation.  Applied research for the VAPR program is being performed in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.

A basis set of transient materials and electronic components with sufficient electronic and transience performance is needed to realize transient electronic systems for environmental sensing and biomedical applications. Research and development of novel materials for implementing basic transient electronic components (i.e. actives and passives), power supply strategies, substrates and encapsulates as well as development of modes and triggers for transience will form the core of fundamental research activities.  Transient components and devices developed in this technical area will form the basis for advanced functional circuit blocks and test systems to be developed in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Cognitive Cloud program used crowd-sourcing (large-scale, human-centered networks of web-enabled individuals working towards a unified goal) to create solutions for highly complex military problems.  Examples of such problems include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance of denied areas; modeling foreign societies, governments, and militaries; debugging large, complex software systems; and real-time understanding of activity patterns indicative of imminent cyber-attack.  A social compiler which views people, computer, and network ensembles as elements of a single architecture and enables crowd sourced developers to write social programs in a high-level language would automatically decompose the task and organize, incentivize, and outsource appropriate aspects to peer production.  The resulting social computing systems could be applied both within the military and across larger communities to achieve capabilities ranging from highly responsive development of tactics, techniques, and procedures to open-source intelligence and strategic communications.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Basic Operational Medical Science Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Activity because it will explore and develop basic research in medical-related information and technology leading to fundamental discoveries, tools, and applications critical to solving DoD challenges.  Programs in this project address the Department's identified medical gaps in taking care of the warfighter such as blast-induced traumatic brain injury.  Efforts will draw upon the information, computational modeling and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels.  This project will establish a fundamental understanding of brain function, short-term memory and the mechanism(s) of injury induced by exposure to blast.  Basic research that aims at new methods and medical devices includes the ability to perform in-theater, continuous analysis of a warfighter's health as a preventative measure to mitigate widespread disease and development of biomaterials that allow long-term interfaces with neural tissue, electronics that provide sound attenuation and processes to remove harmful bacteria and their toxins in blood to prevent sepsis.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This will require an understanding of neuroscience, significant computational efforts, and new material design and implementation.  Key advances expected from this research include determining the nature and means through which short-term memory is encoded, and discovering the mechanisms and dynamics underlying neural computation and reorganization.  These advances will enable memory restoration through the use of devices programmed to bridge gaps in the injured brain.  Further, modeling of the brain will progress to an unprecedented level with this novel approach. A key aspect of this effort will be to develop non-invasive bioimaging techniques that are capable of rapid analysis and interpretation of brain tissue alterations including new methods of analysis and interpretation for measuring brain tissue alterations at the cellular scale.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program will develop the underlying technologies to rapidly respond to a disease or threat and improve individual readiness and total force health protection by providing capabilities, which are currently available only in centralized laboratories in the U.S., to non-tertiary care and individual settings.  ADEPT will develop and exploit synthetic biology for the in vivo creation of nucleic acid circuits that continuously and autonomously sense and respond to changes in physiologic state and for novel methods to target delivery, enhance immunogenicity, or control activity of vaccines, potentially eliminating the time to manufacture a vaccine ex vivo.  ADEPT advancements to control cellular machinery include research to optimize orthogonality and modularity of genetic control elements; identify methods to increase sensitivity and specificity; and demonstrate methods to control cellular machinery in response to changes in physiological status.  ADEPT will develop methodologies for measuring health-specific biomarkers from a collected biospecimen to enable diagnostics at the point-of-need or resource limited clinical facilities (point-of-care), in-garrison or deployed.  Additionally, ADEPT will develop techniques that will enable the rapid establishment of transient immunity through stimulation of the production of components of the immune system to impart effective but temporary protection.  This transient immunity would bridge the time gap between the delivery of a vaccine and the development of a long term protective immune response.  Applied research efforts are budgeted in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Sepsis, a bacterial infection of the blood stream, is a significant cause of injury and death among combat-injured soldiers.  The goal of this program is to develop a portable device capable of controlling relevant components in the blood volume on clinically relevant time scales.  Reaching this goal is expected to require significant advances in sensing in complex biologic fluids, complex fluid manipulation, separation of components from these fluids, and mathematical descriptions capable of providing predictive control over the closed loop process.  The envisioned device would save the lives of thousands of military patients each year by effectively treating sepsis and associated complications.

Initial basic research will develop the component technologies that will ultimately make up the integrated device. Included in this effort will be the development of non-fouling continuous sensors for complex biological fluids; design of high-flow microfluidic structures that do not require the use of anticoagulation; development of intrinsic separation technologies that do not require pathogen specific molecular labels or binding chemistries; and predictive modeling and control (mathematical formalism) with sufficient fidelity to enable agile adaptive closed-loop therapy.  Applied research efforts are budgeted in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element is budgeted in the applied research budget activity because it focuses on medical related technology, information, processes, materials, systems, and devices encompassing a broad spectrum of DoD challenges.  Biowarfare defense includes the capability to predict and deflect pathogen evolution of natural and engineered emerging threats and therapeutics that increase survivability within days of receipt of an unknown pathogen.  Continued understanding of infection biomarkers will lead to developing a detection device that can be self-administered and provide a faster ability to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater.  Other battlefield technologies includes a soldier-portable hemostatic wound treatment system, capability to manufacture field-relevant pharmaceuticals in theater, and a rapid after-action review of field events as a diagnostic tool for improving the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection.  Improved medical imaging will be approached through new physical properties of cellular metabolic activities.  New neural interface technologies will reliably extract information from the nervous system to enable control of the best robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  To allow medical practitioners the capability to visualize and comprehend the complex relationships across patient data in the electronic medical record systems, technologies will be developed to assimilate and analyze the large amount of data and provide tools to make better informed decisions for patient care.  In the area of medical training, new simulation-based tools will rapidly teach increased competency in an open and scalable architecture to be used by all levels of medical personnel for basic and advanced training.  Advanced information-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare and the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).  This project will also pursue the applied research efforts for dialysis-like therapeutics.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The overarching goal of the Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program is to increase our ability to rapidly respond to a disease or threat and improve individual readiness and total force health protection by providing centralized laboratory capabilities at non-tertiary care settings.  ADEPT will focus on the development of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)-based vaccines, potentially eliminating the time and labor required for traditional manufacture of a vaccine while at the same time improving efficacy.  ADEPT will also focus on advanced development of key elements for simple-to-operate diagnostic devices.  A companion basic research effort is budgeted in PE 0601117E, Project MED-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Tactical Biomedical Technologies thrust will develop new approaches to deliver life-saving medical care on the battlefield.  Uncontrolled blood loss is the leading cause of preventable death for soldiers on the battlefield.  While immediate control of hemorrhage is the most effective strategy for treating combat casualties and saving lives, currently no method other than surgical intervention can effectively treat intracavitary bleeding.  A focus in this thrust is the co-development of a materials-based agent(s) and delivery mechanism capable of damaged tissue-targeted hemostasis and wound control.  This system will effectively treat compressible and non-compressible wounds regardless of geometry or location.  Additionally, rapid response to emerging biological threats on the battlefield is impacted by logistical delays of delivering the necessary therapeutics.  Creating a "pharmacy on demand" will enable far-forward medical providers to manufacture and produce small molecule drugs and biologics in order to ensure that the therapeutics are available when they need them.  Another effort will develop assessment tools to identify soldiers in real time who represent depression and suicide risk by identifying speech biomarkers.  This project will also develop new algorithms, protocols, and methods to allow registration and comparison of disparate sources of data in biology (across species, experimental systems, hierarchies and populations).</r2:Description>

The emergence of advanced medical imaging includes newly recognized physical properties of biological tissue, or metabolic pathway, or physiological function in order to map it into an image of diagnostic utility and performance.  This thrust will examine the capability for new, portable spectroscopic techniques that can provide information for military medical use (e.g., analysis of traumatic brain injury) that is superior to that provided by an MRI.  This need is ever increasing as researchers and scientists seek to better understand anatomical, functional and cellular level interactions.  This thrust will also address how to improve the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection by building a simulated environment for rapid after-action review of field events generated from current military systems.  Finally, this thrust will allow safe, non-invasive detection of microscopic and functional alterations within tissues and organs of a living organism at early stages of injury.  The advanced development of these tools will provide a formidable arsenal of diagnostic tools for warfighter performance and care.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Sepsis, a bacterial infection of the blood stream, is a significant cause of injury and death among combat-injured soldiers.  The goal of this program is to develop a portable device capable of controlling relevant components in the blood volume on clinically relevant time scales.  Reaching this goal is expected to require significant advances in sensing in complex biologic fluids, complex fluid manipulation, separation of components from these fluids, and mathematical descriptions capable of providing predictive control over the closed loop process.  The envisioned device would save the lives of thousands of military patients each year by effectively treating sepsis and associated complications.

Applied research under this program further develops and applies existing component technologies and then integrates these to create a complete blood purification system for use in the treatment of sepsis.  Included in this effort will be development, integration and demonstration of non-fouling, continuous sensors for complex biological fluids; implementation of high-flow microfluidic structures that do not require the use of anticoagulation; application of intrinsic separation technologies that do not require pathogen specific molecular labels or binding chemistries; and refinement of predictive modeling and control (mathematical formalism) with sufficient fidelity to enable agile adaptive closed-loop therapy.  The basic research part of this program is budgeted in PE 0601117E, Project MED-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Musculoskeletal injury and fatigue to the warfighter caused by dynamic events on the battlefield not only impacts immediate mission readiness, but also can have a deleterious effect on the warfighter throughout his/her life.  The Warrior Web program will mitigate that impact by developing an adaptive, quasi-active, joint support sub-system that can be integrated into current soldier systems.  Because this sub-system will be compliant and be transparent to the user, it will reduce the injuries sustained by warfighters while allowing them to maintain performance.   Success in this program will require the integration of component technologies in areas such as regenerative kinetic energy harvesting to offset power/energy demands; human performance, system, and component modeling; novel materials and dynamic stiffness; actuation; controls and human interface; and power distribution/energy storage.  The final suit is planned to weigh no more than 9kg and require no more than 100W of external power.  Allowing the warfighter to perform their missions with reduced risk for injuries will have immediate effects on mission readiness, soldier survivability, mission performance and the long-term health of our veterans.  This effort was previously funded in the Maintaining Combat Performance Thrust in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02.</r2:Description>

The goal of this thrust is to radically improve the state of the art for upper limb prosthetics, moving them from crude devices with minimal capabilities to fully integrated and functional limb replacements.  Current prosthetic technology generally provides only gross motor functions, with very crude approaches to control.  This makes it difficult for wounded soldiers to re-acquire full functionality and return to military service if so desired.  The advances required to provide fully functional limb replacements will be achieved by an aggressive, milestone driven program combining the talents of scientists from diverse areas including: medicine, neuroscience, orthopedics, engineering, materials science, control and information theory, mathematics, power, manufacturing, rehabilitation, psychology and training.  The results of this program will radically improve the ability of combat amputees to return to normal function.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Restoration of Brain Function Following Trauma program will exploit recent advances in the understanding and modeling of brain activity and organization to develop approaches to treat traumatic brain injury (TBI).  Critical to success will be the ability to detect and quantify structural and molecular changes produced in the human brain from explosive blast and correlate those changes with neurocognitive evaluation.  This program will also develop technologies for monitoring and controlling the cells responsible for immune and regenerative responses in the human body.  The ultimate goal is identification of efficacious therapeutics or other therapies that can halt progression of injury and/or reduce the severity or duration of TBI.

The program will follow high-risk populations of service members to elucidate injury from both isolated and repeated events.  Service members in the program are tested with a combination of imaging and neurocognitive functional exams prior to training, after training workup-but before deployment, and again after deployment.  During training and deployed operations the service members wear blast dosimetry systems to document any exposures.  All exposures are analyzed through detailed 3-dimensional reconstructions, combined with medical evaluations and testing records to determine the complex relationships between mechanical properties of blasts and the initiation of pathophysiologic responses.  This effort builds on the successful deployment of the Blast Gauge measurement system in association with clinical indices of neurologic and psychiatric status to define a quantifiable relationship between timing and intensity of blast exposures and development and recovery of physiologic and clinic changes in an active duty population exposed to repetitive sub-clinical blast exposures and at an increased risk of involvement in clinically significant blast events.</r2:Description>

The Detection and Computational Analysis of Psychological Signals (DCAPS) program is developing automated information systems that identify group and individual trends indicative of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) and anomaly detection algorithms that identify emerging physical and psychological crises.  These will complement commercial offerings that have not focused on issues specific to the warfighter.  DCAPS recognizes that security and privacy are critical to user acceptance and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance and so incorporates strong authentication and other security mechanisms as needed to protect patient data.  The program is also developing partnerships with key DoD organizations working in this area, including the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury, the Defense Medical Research and Development Program, the Army Telemedicine &amp; Advanced Technologies Research Center, and the National Center for TeleHealth and Technology.</r2:Description>

PREVENT used a variety of modeling techniques based on in-theater conditions to assess potential TBI caused by blast in the absence of penetrating injury or concussion.  Research worked to create a model that can be directly correlated to the epidemiology and etiology of injury seen in returning warfighters, and attempted to determine the physical and physiological underpinnings and causes of the injury.  Raw data was collected from in-theater blast gauges, along with medical and event reports to form a comprehensive analysis.  As part of the mitigation and treatment strategy, candidate therapeutics were tested in order to alleviate inflammation from both acute and chronic injury.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Information and Communications Technology program element is budgeted in the applied research budget activity because it is directed toward the application of advanced, innovative computing systems and communications technologies.  

     The High Productivity, High-Performance Responsive Architectures project is developing the necessary computing hardware and the associated software technology base required to support future critical national security needs for computationally-intensive and data-intensive applications.  These technologies will lead to new multi-generation product lines of commercially viable, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications; it will include supercomputer, embedded computing systems, and novel design tools for manufacturing of defense systems.

     The Information Assurance and Survivability project is developing the technology required to make emerging information system capabilities (such as wireless and mobile code/mobile systems) inherently secure, and to protect DoD's mission-critical systems against attack upon or through the supporting information infrastructure.  These technologies will enable our critical systems to provide continuous correct operation even when they are attacked, and will lead to generations of stronger protection, higher performance, and more cost-effective security and survivability solutions scalable to several thousand sites.  

     The Language Translation project will develop and test powerful new Human Language Technology that will provide critical capabilities for a wide range of national security needs.  This technology will enable systems to a) automatically translate and exploit large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a variety of means; b) to have two-way (foreign-language-to-English and English-to-foreign-language) translation; c) enable automated transcription and translation of foreign speech and text along with content summarization; and d) enable exploitation of captured, foreign language hard-copy documents.

     The Cyber Technology project supports long term national security requirements through the development and demonstration of technology to increase the security of military information systems.  This involves networking, people, platforms, weapons sensors, and decision aids to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.  The results are networked forces that operate with increased speed and synchronization and are capable of achieving massed effects without the physical massing of forces as required in the past.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The program seeks to develop a design representation from which system designs can quickly be assembled and their correctness verified with a high degree of certainty.  Such a "fab-less" design approach is complemented by a foundry-style manufacturing capability, consisting of a factory capable of rapid reconfiguration between a large number of products and product variants through bitstream re-programmability, with minimal or no resultant learning curve effects.  Together, the fab-less design and foundry-style manufacturing capability is anticipated to yield substantial---by a factor of five to ten---compression in the time to develop and field complex defense and aerospace systems.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly part of the META Program

Instant Foundry Adaptive Through Bits (iFAB), will lay the groundwork for the development of a foundry-style manufacturing capability--taking as input a verified system design specified in an appropriate metalanguage--capable of rapid reconfiguration to accommodate a wide range of design variability and specifically targeted at the fabrication of military ground vehicles.  The iFAB vision is to move away from wrapping a capital-intensive manufacturing facility around a single defense product, and toward the creation of a flexible, programmable, potentially distributed production capability able to accommodate a wide range of systems and system variants with extremely rapid reconfiguration timescales.  The specific goals of the iFAB program are to rapidly design and configure manufacturing capabilities to support the fabrication of a wide array of infantry fighting vehicle models and variants.
Once a given design is developed and verified, iFAB aims to take the formal META design representation and automatically configure a digitally-programmable manufacturing facility, including the selection of participating manufacturing facilities and equipment, the sequencing of the product flow and production steps, and the generation of computer-numerically-controlled (CNC) machine instruction sets as well as human instructions and training modules.  iFAB is mostly an information architecture.  Only the final assembly capability needs to be co-located under a single roof in anything resembling a conventional fabrication facility; the rest of iFAB can be geographically distributed and can extend across corporate and industrial boundaries, united only by a common model architecture and certain rules of behavior and business practices.  The final assembly node of the iFAB facility for infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) is currently slated to be at the Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center at the Rock Island Arsenal.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Power Efficiency Revolution For Embedded Computing Technologies (PERFECT) program will provide the technologies and techniques to overcome the power efficiency barriers which currently constrain embedded computing systems capabilities and limit the potential of future embedded systems.  The warfighting problem this program will solve is the inability to process future real time data streams within real-world embedded system power constraints.  This is a challenge for embedded applications, from Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems on unmanned air vehicles through combat and control systems on submarines.  The PERFECT program will overcome processing power efficiency limitations using near threshold voltage operation, massive and heterogeneous processing concurrency, new architecture concepts, and hardware and software approaches to address system resiliency, combined with software approaches to effectively utilize resulting system concurrency to provide the required embedded system processing power efficiency.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Adaptive Integrated Reliability program goals are to leverage real-time monitoring and the ability to effect fine-grained real-time control to significantly increase the lifecycle reliability of complex aerospace and defense systems.  The program will also develop and demonstrate technology to reduce the incidence of catastrophic failure in complex aerospace defense systems through real-time detection and adaptation.  The program will develop novel in-situ prognostication and health monitoring techniques applicable to complex air and space platforms.  The program will develop tractable approaches to predict, identify, and respond to failures endemic to complex systems such as failure cascades, destructive emergent behavior, and off-nominal responses.  To accomplish this, the program will leverage recent advances in adaptive control for fault isolation and mitigation. Adaptive Integrated Reliability will culminate with installation of the integrated reliability management system on a complex air or space platform and demonstrate 2X reliability improvement via accelerated lifecycle testing with representative stimuli.  This reliability enhancement capability will enable development of a new generation of dependable complex systems and enable the compression of system test timelines by trading off testing for lifecycle reliability.  The requisite design and production tools and techniques developed in the program will have immediate application to space systems and aircraft programs.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The integrated circuit (IC) is a core component of many electronic systems developed for the Department of Defense.  However, the DoD consumes a very small percentage of the total IC production in the world.  As a result of the globalization of the IC marketplace, much of the advanced IC production has moved to offshore foundries, and these parts make up the majority of ICs used in today's military systems.

Without the ability to influence and regulate the off-shore fabrication of ICs, there is a risk that parts acquired for DoD systems may not meet stated specifications for performance and reliability.  This risk increases considerably with the proliferation of counterfeit ICs in the marketplace, as well as the potential for the introduction of malicious circuits into a design.

Through the IRIS program, DARPA seeks to develop techniques that will provide system developers the ability to derive the function of digital, analog and mixed-signal ICs non-destructively, given limited operational specifications.  These techniques will include advanced imaging and device recognition of deep sub-micron Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) circuits, as well as computational methods to solve the NP-complete problem of determining device connectivity.

Finally, the IRIS program will produce innovative methods of device modeling and analytic processes to determine the reliability of an IC by testing a limited number of samples.  The current understanding of IC aging mechanisms, including negative bias temperature instability (NBTI), hot carrier injection (HCI), time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) and electromigration (EM) will be leveraged to develop unique diagnostic test techniques.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Clean-slate design of Resilient, Adaptive, Secure Hosts (CRASH) program will develop cyber security technologies using the mechanisms of biological systems as inspiration for radically re-thinking basic hardware and system designs.  Higher level organisms have two distinct immune systems: the innate system is fast and deadly but is only effective against a fixed set of pathogens; the adaptive system is slower, but can learn to recognize novel pathogens.  Similarly, CRASH will develop mechanisms at the hardware and operating system level that eliminate known vulnerabilities exploited by attackers.  However, because novel attacks will be developed, CRASH will also develop software techniques that allow a computer system to defend itself, to maintain its capabilities, and even heal itself.  Finally, biological systems show that diversity is an effective population defense; CRASH will develop techniques that make each computer system appear unique to the attacker and allow each system to change over time.</r2:Description>

SAFER creates automated processes and technologies enabling military users to send and receive content on the Internet, utilizing commercially available hardware and software, in ways that avoid efforts to deny, locate, or corrupt communications.  SAFER is also developing technology for performing computations on encrypted data without decrypting it first through fully homomorphic encryption and interactive, secure multi-party computation schemes.  This will enable, for example, the capability to encrypt queries and compute an encrypted search result without decrypting the query.  This technology will advance the capability to run programs on untrusted hardware while keeping programs, data, and results encrypted and confidential.  This mitigates the important aspect of supply chain compromise.</r2:Description>

The Mission-oriented Resilient Clouds (MRC) program will create technologies to enable cloud computing systems to survive and operate through cyber attacks.  Vulnerabilities found in current standalone and networked systems will be amplified in cloud computing environments.  MRC will address this by creating advanced network protocols and new approaches to computing in potentially compromised distributed environments.  Particular attention will be focused on adapting defenses and allocating resources dynamically in response to attacks and compromises.  MRC will create new approaches to measuring trust, reaching consensus in compromised environments, and allocating resources in response to current threats and computational requirements.

                                    <r2:Description>The High Assurance Cyber Military Systems program will develop and demonstrate the technologies required to secure mission-critical embedded computing systems.  The DoD is making increasing use of networked computing in systems such as military vehicles, weapon systems, ground sensors, smartphones, personal digital assistants, and other communication devices.  This dependence makes it critically important that the embedded operating system provides high levels of inherent assurance.  This operating system must also integrate the computational, physical, and networking elements of the system while running on a processor with very limited size, weight, and power.  Consequently, it can only devote a limited share of its computational resources to security while satisfying hard real-time constraints.  Recent advances in program synthesis, formal verification techniques, low-level and domain-specific programming languages, and operating systems mean that fully verified operating systems for embedded devices may be within reach at reasonable costs.  Systems that admit static verification can provide both high assurance and high performance to avoid the many dynamic checks otherwise necessary to provide high assurance.  The program will develop, mature, and integrate these technologies to produce an embedded computing platform that provides a high level of assurance for mission-critical military applications.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Language Translation project is developing powerful new technologies for processing foreign languages that will provide critical capabilities for a wide range of military and national security needs, both tactical and strategic.  The technologies and systems developed in this project will enable our military to automatically translate and exploit large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a variety of means.  Current U.S. military operations involve close contact with a wide range of cultures and peoples.  The warfighter on the ground needs hand-held, speech-to-speech translation systems that enable communication with the local population during tactical missions.  Such tactical applications imply the need for two-way (foreign-language-to-English and English-to-foreign-language) translation.  Because foreign-language news broadcasts, web-posted content, and captured foreign-language hard-copy documents can provide insights regarding local and regional events, attitudes, and activities, language translation systems also contribute to the development of strategic intelligence.  Such strategic applications require one-way (foreign-language-to-English) translation.  Exploitation of the resulting translated content requires the capability to automatically collate, filter, synthesize, summarize, and present relevant information in near real-time.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Deep Exploration and Filtering of Text (DEFT) program will enable automated extraction, processing, and inference of information from text in operationally relevant application domains.  A key DEFT emphasis is to determine the implied and hidden meaning in text through probabilistic inference, anomaly detection, and disfluency analysis. To accomplish this, DEFT will develop and apply formal representations for basic facts, spatial, temporal, and associative relationships, causal and process knowledge, textually entailed information, and derived relationships and correlated actions/events.  DEFT inputs may be in English or in a foreign language and sources may be completely free-text or semi-structured reports, messages, documents, or databases.  DEFT will extract knowledge at scale for open source intelligence and threat analysis.  Planned transition partners include the intelligence community and operational commands.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Crowd-Sourced Formal Verification (CSFV) program will create technologies that enable crowd-sourced approaches to securing software systems through formal verification.  Formal software verification is a rigorous method for proving that software has specified properties, but formal verification does not currently scale to the size of software found in modern weapon systems.  CSFV will enable non-specialists to participate productively in the formal verification process by transforming formal verification problems into user-driven simulations that are intuitively understandable.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Cyber Warfare Control System (CWCS) program will create a semi-automated system that can sense and respond to cyber attacks more rapidly than human operators.  CWCS will combine fully-automated cyber defense with man-in-the-loop cyber offense to bring to bear the full range of cyber responses allowed under applicable policies.  Technologies to be developed and integrated may include anomaly detection, big data analytics, case-based reasoning, heuristics, game theory, and stochastic optimization.  The CWCS capability is needed because highly-scripted, distributed cyber attacks exhibit speed, complexity, and scale that exceed the capability of human cyber defenders to respond in a timely manner.  A CWCS prototype system should be capable of competing at a high level in cyber competitions.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Cyber Camouflage, Concealment, and Deception (C3D) program is developing novel approaches for protecting cyber systems that mimic camouflage, concealment, and deception in the physical world.  These will make attackers expend more resources to achieve their goals and provide an asymmetric advantage for the defender.  C3D will enable the creation, deployment, management, and control of synthetic entities, objects, resources, and identities that produce uncertainties for attackers and make their task significantly more difficult, perhaps even intractable.  With C3D, infrastructure and other enterprise resources such as switches, servers, and storage could be virtually replicated to confound enemy targeting.  Decoy file systems could confuse attackers thereby greatly decreasing their odds for success.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Cognitive Computing Systems program element is budgeted in the Applied Research budget activity because it is developing the next revolution in computing and information processing technology that will enable computational systems to have reasoning and learning capabilities and levels of autonomy far beyond those of today's systems.  The ability to reason, learn and adapt will raise computing to new levels of capability and powerful new applications. 

The Cognitive Computing project will develop core technologies that enable computing systems to learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience, and respond intelligently to things that have not been previously encountered.  These technologies will lead to systems demonstrating increased self-reliance, self-adaptive reconfiguration, intelligent negotiation, cooperative behavior and survivability with reduced human intervention.

The Collective Cognitive Systems and Interfaces project will dramatically improve warfighter and commander effectiveness and productivity using advanced cognitive approaches that enable faster, better informed, and more highly coordinated actions than those of our enemies.  This will be accomplished by developing revolutionary methods that increase our information processing capabilities, enhance our situational awareness, and enable more cohesive group action by our forces.  Critical technical areas addressed in this project include automated coordinated decision support, information sharing, and ensured communications.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Cognitive Computing project will develop core technologies that enable computing and autonomy systems to learn and apply knowledge gained through experience.  These technologies will lead to systems with increased self-reliance and the capacity to operate with reduced programmer and operator intervention.  In resource-limited settings, these capabilities will make the difference between mission success and mission degradation or failure, increase safety by allowing warfighters to operate systems from greater standoff distances, and reduce staffing requirements by providing greater autonomy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Autonomous Robotic Manipulation (ARM)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Autonomous Robotic Manipulation (ARM) program is developing advanced robotic technologies that will enable autonomous (unmanned) mobile platforms to manipulate objects without human control or intervention.  A key objective is intelligent control of manipulators to independently perform subtasks over a broad range of domains of interest to the warfighter, thereby reducing operator workload, time on target, training time, bandwidth, and hardware complexity.  Current manipulation systems have many limitations.  For example, while they perform well in certain mission environments, they have yet to demonstrate proficiency and flexibility across multiple mission environments; they require burdensome human interaction and the full attention of the operator; and the time required to complete tasks generally exceeds military users' desires.  ARM will create manipulators with a high degree of autonomy capable of serving multiple military purposes across a wide variety of application domains including, but not limited to, counter-improvised explosive device, countermine, search and rescue, weapons support, checkpoint and access control, explosive ordnance disposal, and combat casualty care (including battlefield extraction).  ARM will enable autonomous manipulation systems to surpass the performance level of remote manipulation systems that are controlled directly by a human operator.</r2:Description>

Of particular importance is development of a new data synchronization architecture between the handhelds and the backend computing/storage nodes.  Additionally, appropriate middleware services and libraries are being developed to facilitate shared capabilities such as map viewing, apps management, and collection of logs, usage statistics, and user feedback.  Apps, together with handhelds and networks, are tested in different training environments as well as in deployed environments.  Performance and usage are carefully tracked and user feedback collected to guide rapid enhancement of apps.  The effort is creating a military apps development community by reaching out to non-traditional performers and will explore new models for software acquisition based on end-user empowerment.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Detection and Computational Analysis of Psychological Signals (DCAPS) program is developing automated information systems that identify group and individual trends indicative of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) and anomaly detection algorithms that identify emerging physical and psychological crises.  These will complement commercial offerings that have not focused on issues specific to the warfighter.  DCAPS recognizes that security and privacy are critical to user acceptance and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance and so incorporates strong authentication and other security mechanisms as needed to protect patient data.  The program is also developing partnerships with key DoD organizations working in this area, including the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury, the Defense Medical Research and Development Program, the Army Telemedicine &amp; Advanced Technologies Research Center, and the National Center for TeleHealth and Technology.  This effort is funded in PE 0602115E, Biomedical Technology beginning in FY 2013.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Machine Intelligence project developed technologies that enable computing systems to extract and encode information from dynamic and stored data, observations, and experience, and to derive new knowledge, answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations.  Enabling computing systems with machine intelligence is now of critical importance because sensor, information, and communication systems continuously generate and deliver data at rates beyond which humans can assimilate, understand, and act.  This explosion in available data/information ("big data"), combined with the ready availability of inexpensive mass storage and ubiquitous, inexpensive, computation-on-demand, provide the foundation for entirely new machine intelligence capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Machine Intelligence project developed technologies that enable computing systems to extract and encode information from dynamic and stored data, observations, and experience, and to derive new knowledge, answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations.  Enabling computing systems with machine intelligence is now of critical importance because sensor, information, and communication systems continuously generate and deliver data at rates beyond which humans can assimilate, understand, and act.  This explosion in available data/information ("big data"), combined with the ready availability of inexpensive mass storage and ubiquitous, inexpensive, computation-on-demand, provide the foundation for entirely new machine intelligence capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Visual Media Reasoning (VMR) program is creating technologies to automate the analysis of enemy-recorded photos and videos and identify, within minutes, key information related to the content.  This will include the identification of individuals within the image (who), the enumeration of the objects within the image and their attributes (what), and the image's geospatial location and time frame (where and when).  Large data stores of enemy photos and video are available but cannot be leveraged by a warfighter or analyst attempting to understand a specific new image in a timely fashion.  The VMR program will enable users to gain insights rapidly through application of highly parallelized image analysis techniques that can process the imagery in massive distributed image stores.  VMR technology will serve as a force-multiplier by rapidly and automatically extracting tactically relevant information for the human analyst and alerting the analyst to scenes that warrant the analyst's expert attention.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>DARPA's Biological Warfare Defense project is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its focus is on the underlying technologies associated with pathogen detection, prevention, treatment and remediation.  This project funds programs supporting revolutionary new approaches to biological warfare (BW) defense and is synergistic with efforts of other Government organizations.

Efforts to counter the BW threat include countermeasures to stop pathophysiologic consequences of biological or chemical attack, host immune response enhancers, medical diagnostics for the most virulent pathogens and their molecular mechanisms, collection of atmospheric trace constituents to support chemical mapping, tactical and strategic biological and chemical sensors, and integrated defensive systems.  This program also includes development of a unique set of platform technologies and medical countermeasures synthesis that will dramatically decrease the timeline from military threat detection to countermeasure availability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DARPA's Biological Warfare Defense project is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its focus is on the underlying technologies associated with pathogen detection, prevention, treatment and remediation.  This project funds programs supporting revolutionary new approaches to biological warfare (BW) defense and is synergistic with efforts of other Government organizations.

Efforts to counter the BW threat include countermeasures to stop pathophysiologic consequences of biological or chemical attack, host immune response enhancers, medical diagnostics for the most virulent pathogens and their molecular mechanisms, collection of atmospheric trace constituents to support chemical mapping, tactical and strategic biological and chemical sensors, and integrated defensive systems.  This program also includes development of a unique set of platform technologies and medical countermeasures synthesis that will dramatically decrease the timeline from military threat detection to countermeasure availability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>To further develop an expedited medical countermeasure capability, emerging technologies will be integrated to address the safety and efficacy considerations in the risk/benefit package necessary to successfully counter naturally emerging or engineered biological warfare threats and new emerging infectious threats.  These technologies will also be focused on reduction of time, risk, and cost associated with new therapeutic development.  For example, this program will develop in vitro tissue constructs (IVTC) that will emulate human response to therapeutic compounds, thereby significantly reducing the cost and time for evaluating safety and efficacy of therapeutics.</r2:Description>

The system demonstrated materials, packaging, and extraction technologies that sample atmospheric impurities with concentrations ranging from 50 parts per trillion to 50 parts per million by volume, from 100 liter-atmospheres of gas, in less than five minutes.  The analysis system integrated high-resolution separation and spectroscopic techniques with automated analysis software to enable identification and ranking (by concentration) of all components present in complex gas mixtures.  Reproducible analysis of atmospheric samples using sophisticated analytical technology yielded data for baseline conditions, natural variability, and permit detections of nefarious anomalies associated with production, movement, and storage of weapons, even under shifting backgrounds driven by meteorological and seasonal events.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because it supports the advancement of concepts and technologies to enhance the next generation of tactical systems.  The Tactical Technology program element funds a number of projects in the areas of Naval Warfare, Advanced Land Systems, Advanced Tactical Technology, Aeronautics Technology and Network Centric Enabling technologies.

The Naval Warfare Technology project develops advanced enabling technologies for a broad range of naval requirements.  Technologies under development will increase survivability and operational effectiveness of small and medium surface vessels in rough seas.  New areas to be investigated include ship self defense techniques, novel underwater propulsion modalities, vessels for estuary and riverine operations and unmanned sea vehicles for anti-submarine warfare.

The Advanced Land Systems project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations.  The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that will enhance the military's effectiveness while decreasing the exposure of U.S. or allied forces to enemy fire.  Advanced manufacturing demonstration activities are also funded.

The Advanced Tactical Technology project is exploring the application of compact and solid state lasers; high performance computational algorithms to enhance signal processing, target recognition and tracking, electromagnetic propagation, and processing of advanced materials and microelectronics; precision optics components for critical DoD applications; aerospace electronic warfare systems; new tactical systems for enhanced air vehicle survivability, advanced airbreathing weapons, and enabling technologies for advanced space systems; and Training Superiority programs that will create revolutionary new training techniques.

The Aeronautics Technology project explores technologies to reduce costs associated with advanced aeronautical systems and provide revolutionary new capabilities for current and projected military mission requirements. This project funds development of a hybrid ground/air vehicle, an advanced helicopter rotor capable of being optimized for each mission, and robust study efforts.

The Network Centric Enabling Technology project funds sensor, signal processing, detection, tracking and target identification technology development required for true network-centric tactical operations.  Technologies developed in this project will enable localized, distributed and cross-platform collaborative processing so that networks of sensors can rapidly adapt to changing force mixes, predictive modeling tools to evaluate failing nation states and identify potential hot spots, and social networking approaches to identify and track potential terrorist cells.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) program has three primary goals: (1) to build and demonstrate an experimental unmanned vessel with beyond state-of-the-art platform performance based on clean sheet design for unmanned operation, (2) demonstrate the technical viability of operating autonomous unmanned craft at theater or global ranges, from forward operating bases, under a sparse remote supervisory control model, and (3) leverage unique ACTUV characteristics to transition a game changing ASW capability to the Navy.  By establishing the premise that a human is never intended to step on board at any point in the operational cycle, ACTUV concepts can take advantage of an unexplored design space that eliminates or modifies conventional manned ship design constraints in order to achieve disproportionate speed, endurance, and payload fraction.  The resulting unmanned naval vessels must possess sufficient situational awareness and autonomous behavior capability to operate in full compliance with the rules of the road and maritime law to support safe navigation for operational deployments spanning thousands of miles and months of time.  When coupled with innovative sensor technologies, the ACTUV system provides a low cost unmanned system with a fundamentally different operational risk calculus that enables game changing capability to detect and track even the quietest diesel electric submarine threats.  Key technical areas include unmanned naval vessel design methodologies, ship system reliability, high fidelity sensor fusion to provide an accurate world model for autonomous operation, novel application of sensors for ASW tracking, and holistic system integration due to unique optimization opportunities of the ACTUV system.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Arctic Operations initiative is focused on developing technology to assure U.S. capability to achieve situational awareness in the Arctic.  Due to retreating Arctic ice in the coming decades there is an expectation for increased shipping traffic during the summer months, and increased interest in exploiting natural resources along the Arctic continental shelf.  This growth in activity will increase the strategic significance of the region, and will drive the need to ensure stability through effective regional monitoring.  The extreme environmental conditions of the Arctic may challenge the effectiveness of conventional technology to provide such monitoring.  As such, this program seeks to exploit unique physical attributes and emergent environmental trends in the Arctic to create surprising new capabilities, and will develop technologies for persistent and affordable sensing and communication both above and below the ice to ensure responsive operations.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Upward Falling Payloads (UFP) program will develop forward-deployed unmanned distributed systems that can provide non-lethal effects or situational awareness over large maritime areas.  The UFP approach centers on pre-deploying deep-ocean nodes years in advance in forward operating areas which can be commanded from standoff to launch to the surface.  Advances in miniaturized sensors and processors, the explosive growth in the variety of small unmanned systems, and the advances in autonomy and networking all point toward highly-capable, yet affordable distributed systems.  Currently, large numbers of distributed unmanned systems are not utilized in far-forward areas due to logistics and distance, the need for delivery platforms, and the associated latency for insertion.  The UFP program will remove this barrier to accelerate large-scale unmanned distributed applications and missions.  The presumption is that a wider range of technology options and system solutions will emerge when the barriers to deployment are removed.</r2:Description>

TEMP will develop critical enabling modular technologies and evaluate the feasible range of naval missions that can be serviced from this highly flexible and cost effective unconventional force structure model.  An initial mission to be explored will be the modular sea depot concept to enable a remote unmonitored refueling capability for small craft; enabling independent operation from host ships.  TEMP will also evaluate a Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA/DR) mission, engineering a modular first responder capability that allows the rapid force closure capability of TEMP to deliver immediate lifesaving operations in the hours and days following a disaster event, prior to the time that conventional platforms and organizations are able to respond.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goals of the Fast, Adaptable, Next-Generation Ground Combat Vehicle (FANG) program are to employ a novel, model-based correct-by-construction design capability, a highly-adaptable foundry-style manufacturing capability, and crowd-sourcing design methods to demonstrate 5X-10X compression in the timeline necessary to build an infantry fighting vehicle.  The program seeks to create an open-source development infrastructure for the aggregation of designer inputs applicable to complex electromechanical systems as well as software, and to exercise this infrastructure with a series of design challenges, leading to prize awards and builds of winning designs in a foundry-style, rapidly configurable manufacturing facility.  The design challenges will culminate in a complete build of a next generation infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) to a requirements set loosely analogous to an existing program of record, but executed on a roughly one-year timescale.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Robotics Challenge program, originally reported solely under Project NET-01, PE 0603766E, will directly meet Department of Defense strategic needs by developing robotic technology for disaster response operations.  This technology will improve the performance of robots that operate in the rough terrain and austere conditions characteristic of disasters, and use vehicles and tools commonly available in populated areas.  This technology will work in ways easily understood by subject matter experts untrained in the operation of robots and be governed by intuitive controls that require little training.   The program will also meet the global need for resilience against natural disasters and industrial accidents, and increase the resilience of infrastructure against acts of terrorism.

The primary goal of the Robotics Challenge program is to develop ground robotic capabilities to execute complex tasks in dangerous, degraded, human-engineered environments.  The program will focus on robots that can utilize available human tools, ranging from hand tools to vehicles.  The program aims to advance the key robotic technologies of supervised autonomy, mounted mobility, dismounted mobility, dexterity, strength, and platform endurance.  Supervised autonomy will be developed to allow robot control by non-expert operators, to lower operator workload, and to allow effective operation despite low fidelity (low bandwidth, high latency, intermittent) communications.  Anticipated Service users include the Army, Marines, and Special Forces.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The U.S. military achieves overmatch against its adversaries via vehicles in all regimes - land, sea and air.  This level of overmatch is not enjoyed at the squad to individual dismounted warfighter level, however.  The goal of the IS2 program is to leverage advances in real-time situational awareness and mission command; organic three-dimensional dismount mobility; extended range tracking, targeting, and response; and unmanned mobility and perception in order to create a squad that is 10x more mission capable.  The concept of overmatch at the squad level includes increased human stand-off, a smaller force density, and adaptive sensing to allow for responses at multiple scales.  IS2 will explore advanced wearable force protection, advanced organic squad level direct and indirect trajectory precision weaponry, and advanced single soldier aerial transport approaches and technologies.  This end result of the IS2 program is an individual dismount outfitted with sensors, weaponry, and supporting technology to achieve one-on-one overmatch as well as the overall integration of unmanned assets alongside the dismounts to create a new Hybrid Squad unit.</r2:Description>

Lethal direct fire overmatch requires larger cannons and larger vehicles to overcome threat armor systems.  MCPW will provide a very precise medium caliber capability to neutralize threat combat vehicles with precision vs. penetration.  MCPW will enable smaller very capable combat vehicles, changing the ground vehicle requirement for larger vehicles to support larger cannons.  The technologies will also support shipboard precision engagement against "go fast boats" and other lower tier naval threats.</r2:Description>

The C-Sniper system will operate day and night from a static or mobile military vehicle and will provide the operator with sufficient information to make a timely engagement decision.  Once a decision is made, the C-Sniper will provide data and control to point and track the on-board weapon to the selected target.

                                    <r2:Title>Excalibur</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Excalibur program will develop high-power electronically-steerable optical arrays, with each array element powered by a fiber laser amplifier.  These fiber-laser arrays will be sufficiently lightweight, compact, and electrically efficient to be fielded on a variety of platforms with minimal impact on the platform's original mission capabilities.  Each array element will possess an adaptive-optic capability to minimize beam divergence in the presence of atmospheric turbulence, together with wide-field-of-view beam steering for target tracking.  With each Excalibur array element powered by high power fiber laser amplifiers (at up to 3 kilowatts (kW) per amplifier), high power air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements will be enabled that were previously infeasible because of laser system size and weight.  In addition, this program will also develop kilowatt-class arrays of diode lasers which will provide an alternate route to efficiently reaching mission-relevant power levels, and they will test the ultimate scalability of the optical phased array architecture.  Excalibur arrays will be conformal to aircraft surfaces and scalable in size and power by adding additional elements to the array.  Excalibur will provide the technology foundation for the defense of next generation airborne platforms, including all aircraft flying at altitudes below 50,000 ft, and against proliferated, deployed, and next-generation man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) and more capable air-to-air missiles converted for use as ground-to-air missiles.  Excalibur will enable these platforms to fly at lower altitudes and conduct truly persistent, all-weather ground missions, such as reconnaissance despite low-lying cloud cover.  Further capabilities may include: multichannel laser communications, target identification, tracking, designation, precision defeat with minimal collateral effects as well as other applications.

The Excalibur Budget Activity 2 program will develop the core set of laser components for efficiently driving elements of high-power electronically steerable optical arrays, namely: high-power coherently- and spectrally-combinable fiber laser amplifiers, high-brightness laser diodes for efficiently pumping the fiber laser amplifiers, and kW-class single-mode laser diode arrays.  In addition, advanced techniques (packaging, thermal and power management, beam control, target tracking, etc.) will be developed for light-weight, high power fiber-laser based and podded High Energy Laser Countermeasure (HELCM) systems enabling near-term options for low-altitude aircraft self-defense against MANPADS.  The vulnerabilities of MANPADS and other surface-to-air missiles, as well as their potential to incorporate counter-countermeasures to HELCM systems will also be measured and assessed.  These techniques and measurements will be designed to work in tandem with, and to support, the HELCM prototype subsystems developed under the Budget Activity 3 Excalibur program in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.

The Excalibur Budget Activity 2 program will also conduct several analytical studies relevant to scaling and applications of high-efficiency (30% - 40% wall plug efficient) high power electric lasers that will examine: the potential to scale the output power of diode pumped alkali lasers (DPALs) to tactical and strategic levels (100's kW - MW class); the potential for integrating low-cost, high-sensitivity, wide-field-of-view imaging seekers and directional acoustic cueing into locating extended-altitude MANPADS; and the potential to use high power fiber lasers for long range target identification and tracking.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>An outgrowth of the Integrated Sensing and Processing program, the International Space Station SPHERES Integrated Research Experiments (InSPIRE) program will utilize the DARPA-sponsored Synchronized Position, Hold, Engage, and Reorient Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) platform, which has flown onboard the International Space Station (ISS) since May 2006, to perform a series of multi-body formation flight experiments that necessitate a medium-duration zero-gravity environment.  The overarching objectives of InSPIRE are twofold:  (1) to leverage the human presence in space for rapid, iterative experimentation and design of DoD-relevant space capabilities, and (2) to provide the next generation of scientists and engineers with experience in carrying out meaningful space experimentation economically, over reasonable time scales.  InSPIRE will enhance the ability to rapidly mature and insert new technologies into national security space assets.  The InSPIRE program will expand on the capabilities developed through SPHERES by developing a SPHERES-II infrastructure, adding arms, manipulator hands, and hard docking ports.  InSPIRE will also design a new generation of Spherelets.  Spherelets development will test satellite constructs where small satellite modules self-assemble into larger operational space structures, such as telescopes.  In addition, the InSPIRE program will continue the SPHERES Zero Robotics Challenge competition among high schools and middle schools across the United States.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System (HELLADS) program is to develop a high-energy laser weapon system (150 kW) with an order of magnitude reduction in weight compared to existing laser systems.  With a weight goal of &lt;5 kg/kW, HELLADS will enable high energy lasers (HELs) to be integrated onto tactical aircraft, and will significantly increase engagement ranges compared to ground-based systems, enabling high precision, low collateral damage, and rapid engagement of fleeting targets for both offensive and defensive missions.  The HELLADS program has completed the design and demonstration of a revolutionary prototype unit cell laser module.  That unit cell demonstrated power output and is demonstrating optical wavefront performance that supports the goal of a lightweight and compact 150 kW high energy tactical laser weapon system.  Two unit cell module designs with integrated power and thermal management systems were fabricated and tested; they demonstrated an output power exceeding 34 kW.  Based on the results of the unit cell demonstration, additional laser modules will be replicated and connected to produce a 150 kW laser that will be demonstrated in a laboratory environment.  The 150 kW laser will then be integrated with beam control, prime power, thermal management, safety, and command and control subsystems all based upon existing technologies to produce a ground-based laser weapon system field demonstrator.  The capability to shoot down tactical targets such as surface-to-air missiles and rockets and the capability to perform ultra-precise offensive engagements will be demonstrated in a realistic ground test environment.  Additional funding for this integration effort is provided for HELLADS testing in Project NET-01, PE 0603766E.  The HELLADS laser will be transitioned following testing to a tactical platform for performance demonstration of ground, sea, or airborne precision engagements.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Transformer (TX) Vehicle program will develop a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), road-worthy vehicle that can carry a 1,000 lb payload at a range of 250 nautical miles on a single tank of fuel.  With a flyable/roadable vehicle, the warfighter has the ability to avoid road obstructions as well as improvised explosive devices and ambush threats, providing flexibility for tactical military and personnel transport missions.  The primary focus of this program is to demonstrate the ability to build a ground vehicle that is capable of configuring into a VTOL air vehicle that provides sufficient flight performance and range, while carrying a payload that is representative of four troops with gear.  The enabling technologies of interest include hybrid electric drive, advanced batteries, stowable wing structures, ducted fan propulsion, lightweight materials, and advanced sensors and flight controls for stable transition from vertical to horizontal flight.  TX vehicles could be dispatched for downed airman recovery, for evacuating injured personnel from difficult-to-access locations, or to resupply isolated small units.  TX will also be suitable for enhanced company operations concepts which would provide the warfighter/team increased situational awareness for operations in an urban environment.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Technology Demonstrator program, an outgrowth of the Mission Adaptive Rotor program, will demonstrate revolutionary improvements in (heavier than air) VTOL air vehicle capabilities and efficiencies through the development of subsystem and component technologies, and aircraft configurations and system integration.  The program will lead to ground and flight tests of a technology demonstrator aircraft.  Program goals include demonstrating flight speeds in excess of 300 kts, while simultaneously retaining and proving enhanced hover and hot/high operation that are key and unique to VTOL flight.  Improvements in aircraft productivity indices that are reflective of meaningful gains in military transport efficiencies of the system will be a key focus of the program.  Considerations will include alternative (for example, non-rotary wing) air vehicle configurations that embrace efficient new designs when addressing lift offset, propulsive compounding, and other solution spaces.  A strong emphasis will be placed on the development of elegant, multi-functional subsystem technologies that demonstrate net improvements in aircraft efficiencies that will be exemplified on the basis of defined productivity metrics.  Additionally, the program will design and demonstrate new concepts of adaptable landing gear to enable operations from irregular landing zones and moving launch/recovery platforms.  Furthermore, novel electric power generation, motors, and distributed propulsion systems will also be studied in detail for future VTOL applications, including thrust and control authority augmentation, and power on demand.  The VTOL Technology Demonstrator will demonstrate the mission utility of the new technologies to enable previously un-executable missions and new concepts of operation.</r2:Description>

DARPA will conduct a study of current air dominance efforts in coordination with the United States Air Force and Navy and explore potential technology developmental areas to ensure the air superiority of the United States in the future.  The study will consider roles of manned and unmanned platforms; the relative performance of alternative integrated system of systems concepts that combine various mixes of capabilities networked together; and the cost effectiveness of alternative balances of platforms and systesms that provide surveillance, command and control, electronic warfare, and weapons functions.  Innovative platform concepts for airframe, propulsion, sensors, weapons integration, avionics, and active and passive survivability features will be explored as a central part of the concept definition effort.  This effort will also explore the expanded development and use of automated and advanced aerospace engineering design tools, modeling, and simulation in areas that can increase the likelihood of producing more capable products with improved efficiency.  Following the initial multi-agency study, DARPA will present technical challenges to Industry to allow them to explore and present potential solutions.  Enabling technologies are next generation platforms, advanced networking capabilities, reliable navigation, passive and active defense, electronic attack, area denial, advanced sensors, and cyber technologies.  After the study, it is envisioned that high potential prototype programs will emerge to develop technologies for future air dominance.  Early planning for future technologies will also help to define the funding baselines for DOD research and development and acquisition programs.  This effort will be funded from PE 0602702E, Project TT-07, and from PE 0603286E, Project AIR-01.  Under this PE the study will fund concept and technology development efforts.  Systems efforts will be funded from AIR-01.</r2:Description>

Petrel will fill the niche between conventional airlift and sealift through development of a new transportation mode capable of high speed operation across the surface/air interface over water as well as terrain.  Technical approaches for rapid transport across the ocean and movement from the ship to the tactical battlefield will consider traditional and non-traditional aerodynamic and hydrodynamic concepts as well as innovative uses of existing technologies.  Primary technical goals for Petrel are to reduce or eliminate intermodal delays and to achieve a transport efficiency better than $0.1/ton-mi.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Mission Adaptive Rotor (MAR) program is to develop and demonstrate the capability to achieve dramatic improvements in rotor performance, survivability, and availability through the use of technologies that enable adaptation of the rotor throughout military missions and/or mission segments and applications of advanced manufacturing technologies to reduce part counts and improve dynamic behavior.  Recent research indicates that significant performance benefits could be achieved by actively morphing the shape or properties of the rotor system; additionally, active rotors with on-blade control could eliminate the need for a rotor swashplate.  Other advanced technologies are also being studied which could lead to improvements in hover and cruise efficiencies, and the elimination of large, open rotor systems all together.  MAR capability will result in dramatic improvements in system performance, operational availability, sustainability, and survivability, including reduction in acoustic susceptibility and rotor vibration while increasing useful payload fraction and range.  The MAR program will design, test, and mature active rotor technologies that enable the effective operation of military rotorcraft in performance-limited environments of high-altitude mountainous terrain and deserts.  The MAR program will also facilitate the development of advanced technologies for application to future vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) class platforms capable of high cruise speed and efficient hover, leading to unsurpassed aircraft performance capabilities.</r2:Description>

Social network theory has emerged in recent years as a promising approach for understanding groups of individuals connected through a variety of shared interests and collaborative activities.  For the military, social networks provide a promising model for understanding terrorist cells, insurgent groups, and other stateless actors whose connectedness is established not on the basis of shared geography but rather through the correlation of their participation in coordinated activities such as planning meetings, training/mission rehearsal sessions, sharing of materiel/funds transfers, etc.  Nexus 7 supports emerging military missions using both traditional and non-traditional data sources for those areas of the world and mission sets with limited conventional Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.  Examples of additional data sources include foreign news, media, and social network data.  These non-traditional sources will be integrated with a wide variety of military structured and unstructured data.  Nexus 7 will develop quantitative techniques and tools for processing and analyzing these large data sources as a means for understanding relationships between hostile, neutral, and friendly foreign organizations with the United States.</r2:Description>

The XDATA program seeks to develop computational techniques and software tools for analyzing large volumes of data, both semi-structured (e.g., tabular, relational, categorical, meta-data, spreadsheets) and unstructured (e.g., text documents, message traffic).  Central challenges to be addressed include a) developing scalable algorithms for processing imperfect data in distributed data stores, and b) creating effective human-computer interaction tools for facilitating rapidly customizable visual reasoning for diverse missions.  The program will develop open source software toolkits that enable flexible software development supporting users processing large volumes of data in timelines commensurate with mission workflows of targeted defense applications.  An XDATA framework will support minimization of design-to-deployment time of new analytic and visualization technologies on diverse distributed computing platforms, and also accommodate changing problem spaces and collaborative environments.</r2:Description>

The Visual Media Reasoning (VMR) program will create technologies to automate the analysis of enemy-recorded photos and videos and identify, within minutes, key information related to the content.  This will include the identification of individuals within the image (who), the enumeration of the objects within the image and their attributes (what), and the image's geospatial location and time frame (where and when).  Large data stores of enemy photos and video are available but cannot be easily leveraged by a warfighter or analyst attempting to understand a specific new image in a timely fashion.  The VMR program will enable users to gain insights rapidly through application of highly parallelized image analysis techniques that can process the imagery in massive distributed image stores.  VMR technology will serve as a force-multiplier by rapidly and automatically extracting tactically relevant information for the human analyst and alerting the analyst to scenes that warrant the analyst's expert attention.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Probabilistic Programming for Advancing Machine Learning (PPAML) program will create an advanced computer programming capability that greatly facilitates the construction of new machine learning applications in a wide range of domains.  This capability would increase the number of people who could effectively contribute, would make experts more productive, and would enable the creation of new tactical applications that are inconceivable given today's tools.  The key enabling technology is a new programming paradigm called probabilistic programming that facilitates the management of uncertain information.  In this approach, developers will use the power of a modern (probabilistic) programming language to quickly build a generative model of the phenomenon of interest as well as queries of interest, which a compiler will convert into an efficient application.  PPAML technologies will be designed for application to a wide range of military domains including ISR exploitation, robotic and autonomous system navigation and control, weather prediction, and medical diagnostics.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Currently most autonomous unmanned systems, from robots for IED operations to sophisticated drones, are actually operated with supervised autonomy with one or more humans "in-the-loop" for every unmanned system.  This prevents humans from effectively performing their mission while also directing the operations of unmanned teammates, thereby negating the force multiplication potential of robotics.   The Manned-Unmanned Collaborative Autonomy program will develop concepts and implementing software for a truly shared autonomy - human "on-the-loop" - in which multiple unmanned systems can perform missions with minimal guidance from, and limited cognitive interference with, a single human operator in conventional arenas, such as air or ground, as well as atypical environments such as littoral waters. Approaches to develop shared autonomy will build on past successes in a range of efforts, including pilot-on-the-loop simulations under the past DARPA Unmanned Combat Air Rotor (UCAR) and Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) efforts as well as the significant progress made in DARPA's Warfighter Under Stress program.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Video and Image Retrieval and Analysis Tool (VIRAT) program developed and demonstrated a system for video data exploitation that enables an analyst to rapidly find video content of interest from archives and provides alerts to the analyst of events of interest during live operations.  The ability to quickly search large volumes of existing video data and monitor real-time video data for specific activities or events provides a new capability to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies.  Currently, video analysis is very labor intensive, limited to metadata queries, manual annotations, and "fast-forward" examination of clips.  The software tools developed under VIRAT radically improve the analysis of huge volumes of video data by: 1) alerting operators when specific events or activities occur at specific locations or over a range of locations and; 2) enabling fast, content-based searches of existing video archives.  The final products of the VIRAT program have been transitioned to the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) - Army.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its objective is to develop material, biological and energy technologies that make possible a wide range of new military capabilities.

The major goal of the Materials Processing Technology project is to develop novel materials, materials processing and manufacturing techniques, mathematical models and fabrication strategies for advanced structural and functional materials and components that will lower the cost, increase the performance, and/or enable new missions for military platforms and systems.  Included in this project are efforts across a wide range of materials including: structural materials and devices, functional materials and devices, and materials that enable new propulsion concepts for land, sea, and space vehicles and low distortion optical lenses.

The Biologically Based Materials and Devices project acknowledges the growing and pervasive influence of the biological sciences on the development of new materials, devices and processes, as well as the commensurate influence of materials, physics and chemistry on new approaches to biology and biochemistry.  Contained in this project are thrusts in the application of biomimetic materials and devices for Defense, the development of biochemical materials to maintain performance, the use of biology's unique fabrication capabilities to produce structures that cannot be made any other way, and the development of manufacturing tools that use biological components and processes for material synthesis.  It also supports a major thrust that will revolutionize the development of prosthetics for the wounded soldier.

The Tactical and Strategic Energy Technology project focused on the unique challenges facing the DoD in developing and demonstrating advanced power generation and energy storage technologies.  It addressed critical military needs for improved energy efficiency and availability to support a range of military missions that include individual warfighter and small unit operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Multifunctional Materials and Structures thrust is developing materials and structures that are explicitly tailored for multiple functions and/or unique mechanical properties.  This thrust also explores novel materials and surfaces that are designed to adapt structural or functional properties to environmental and/or tactical threat conditions.  Included in this thrust are efforts that will lower the weight and increase the performance of aircraft, enhance the efficiency of turbines, and improve the performance of surface dominated properties (friction, wear, and membrane permeability).  New materials synthesis processes for thin films will also be explored to extend equipment lifetime and reduce logistics costs.  In addition, reactive structures that can serve as both structure and explosive will be developed to decrease the weight and increase the performance of munitions.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Manufacturable Gradient Index Optics (M-GRIN) program seeks to advance the development of GRIN lenses from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 8.  The program will expand the application of gradient index optics (GRIN) by providing compact, lightweight, and cost-effective lenses with controlled dispersion and aberrations that will replace large assemblies of conventional lenses.  The ability to create entirely new optical materials and surfaces creates the potential for new or significantly improved military optical applications, such as solar concentrators, portable designators, highly efficient fiber optics, and imaging systems.  The program also seeks to extend GRIN manufacturing technologies to glass, ceramic, and other inorganic materials in order to allow for small, lightweight, customized optical elements for mid-wave and long-wave infrared (MWIR and LWIR) applications.  A key component of the program is to develop new design tools that enable optics designers to incorporate dynamic material properties, fabrication methods, and manufacturing tolerances.

                                    <r2:Description>The Biofuels program explored longer term, higher risk approaches to obtaining and using energy.  A pathway to affordable self-sustainable agriculture-sourced production of an alternative to petroleum-derived JP-8, that meets all DoD needs, was investigated.  Initial efforts focused on the conversion of crop oil triglycerides to JP-8.  Additional efforts expanded the spectrum of convertible feedstocks to cellulosic, algal, and other similar materials, enabling a diversified feedstock portfolio that can meet the entire DoD need within a sustainable commercial framework.  An important variant of this latter category is the development of man- and vehicle-portable technologies that produce substantial quantities of JP-8 and other useful liquid fuels from indigenously available or harvestable resources near desired locations worldwide.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Neuroscience Technologies thrust leverages recent advances in neurophysiology, neuro-imaging, cognitive science, and molecular biology to sustain and protect the cognitive functioning of the warfighter faced with challenging operational conditions.  Warfighters experience a wide variety of operational stressors, both mental and physical, that degrade critical cognitive functions such as memory, learning, and decision making.  These stressors also degrade the warfighter's ability to multitask, leading to decreased ability to respond quickly and effectively.  Currently, the long-term impact of these stressors on the brain is unknown, both at the molecular and behavioral level.  This thrust area will utilize modern neuroscientific techniques, in conjunction with emerging solutions in neurally enabled human-machine interface technologies, to develop quantitative models of this impact and explore mechanisms to protect, maintain, complement, or restore cognitive functioning during and after exposure to operational stressors.  In addition, new approaches for using neural signals to make human-machine systems more time efficient and less workload intense will be identified, developed, and evaluated.  This thrust area will have far-reaching implications for both current and future military operations, with the potential to protect and improve cognitive performance at the individual and group level both prior to and during deployment.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Living Foundries</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goal of Living Foundries is to create a revolutionary, biologically-based manufacturing platform to provide new materials, capabilities, and manufacturing paradigms for the DoD and the Nation.  With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  However, the DoD's ability to harness this platform is rudimentary.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the tools, technologies, and methodologies to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  The program will enable the rapid and scalable development of previously unattainable technologies and products (i.e., those that cannot be accessed using known, synthetic mechanisms), leveraging biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials (e.g., flouropolymers, enzymes, lubricants, coatings and materials for harsh environments), novel functions (e.g., self-repairing and self-regenerating systems), biological reporting systems, and therapeutics to enable new solutions and enhancements to military needs and capabilities.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling distributed, adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value materials, devices, and capabilities in the field or on base.  Such a capability will decrease the DoD's dependence on tenuous material supply chains vulnerable to political change, targeted attack, or environmental accident.

Research thrusts will focus on the development and demonstration of open technology platforms, or bioproduction pipelines, that integrate the tools and capabilities developed in PE 0601101E, TRS-01 to prove out capabilities for rapid (months vs. service-oriented architecture years) design and construction of new bio-production systems for novel materials.  The result will be an integrated, modular infrastructure across the areas of design, fabrication, debugging, analysis, optimization, and validation -- spanning the entire development life-cycle and enabling the ability to rapidly assess and improve designs.  Integrated processes developed in this program will translate into significant performance improvements and cost savings for the production of advanced materials, biological reporting systems, and therapeutics.  These technologies will ultimately result in point-of-use, on-demand, customizable, and distributed production of strategic materials and systems.  Key to success will be tight coupling of computational design, fabrication of systems, debugging using multiple characterization data types, analysis, and further development such that iterative design and experimentation will be accurate, efficient and controlled.  Demonstration platforms will be challenged to build a variety of military-relevant and complex materials and functionalities, such as synthesis of advanced, functional chemicals and polymers  (e.g., those tolerant of harsh environments), production of bio-reporting systems, or rapid and dynamic prevention, identification, and repair of corrosion/materials degradation.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Maintaining Combat Performance thrust utilizes breakthroughs in biology and physiology to sustain the peak physical and cognitive performance of warfighters operating in extreme conditions.  Today, warfighters must accomplish their missions despite extraordinary physiologic stress.  Examples of these stressors include temperature extremes (-20 degrees F to 125 degrees F), oxygen deficiency at high altitude, personal loads in excess of 100 lbs, dehydration, psychological stress, and even performance of life-sustaining maneuvers following combat injury.  Not only must troops maintain optimum physical performance, but also peak cognitive performance, which includes the entire spectrum from personal navigation and target recognition, to complex command and control decisions, and intelligence synthesis.  The Maintaining Combat Performance thrust leverages breakthroughs in diverse scientific fields in order to mitigate the effects of harsh combat environments ranging from fundamental research elucidating the biological mechanisms of adaptation to application of novel body-worn actuation materials to reduce soldier loads.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of this thrust is to radically improve the state of the art for upper limb prosthetics, moving them from crude devices with minimal capabilities to fully integrated and functional limb replacements.  Current prosthetic technology generally provides only gross motor functions, with very crude approaches to control.  This makes it difficult for wounded soldiers to re-acquire full functionality and return to military service if so desired.  The advances required to provide fully functional limb replacements will be achieved by an aggressive, milestone driven program combining the talents of scientists from diverse areas including: medicine, neuroscience, orthopedics, engineering, materials science, control and information theory, mathematics, power, manufacturing, rehabilitation, psychology and training.  The results of this program will radically improve the ability of combat amputees to return to normal function.  This effort will be funded in PE 0602115E, Biomedical Technology beginning in FY 2013.</r2:Description>

The objective of the Cognitive Technology Threat Warning System (CT2WS) program was to drive a breakthrough in visual threat warning devices by leveraging discoveries in the disparate technology areas of flat-field, wide-angle optics, large pixel-count digital imagers, visual processing pathways, neurally based target detection signatures and ultra-low power analog-digital hybrid signal processing electronics.  This program led to the development of prototype digital imaging threat cueing systems capable of effective detection ranges of 1 km against dismounts, 5 km against stationary vehicles, and 10 km against moving vehicles.  Simultaneously, the system surveys a 120-degree or greater field of view, enabling the warfighter to detect, decide and act on the most advantageous timeline in complex operational environments.</r2:Description>

While animals and humans accomplish this seemingly effortlessly and constantly, computational vision systems have, to date, been unable to replicate this feat of biology.  The Neovision2 program pursued an integrated approach to developing an advanced object recognition capability based on the visual pathways in the mammalian brain.  Specifically, this program developed a cognitive sensor technology with limited size, weight, and power that transforms data from an imaging sensor suite into communicable knowledge for mobile, autonomous surveillance systems.  The program demonstrated an improvement of four orders of magnitude in energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.  To achieve the vision, the program utilized advanced device design, signal processing and mathematical techniques across multiple brain regions to create an electronic neuro-biological (neuromorphic) vision system.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project focused on the unique challenges facing the DoD in developing and demonstrating advanced power generation and energy storage technologies.  It addressed critical military needs for improved energy efficiency and availability to support a range of military missions.  At the individual warfighter and small unit operations level, efforts are addressing the need for mission extending power generation and energy storage technologies with particular emphasis on portability and robustness challenges that are unique to the DoD.  As electronic systems are common to all scales of power generation and energy storage and management, this project also investigated improved board-level power conversion and regulation strategies to more efficiently convert and distribute high voltages to locally required low voltages for powering integrated circuits and sensors.  The project also included an effort that is exploring ultra-high-efficiency gas turbine engines for power generation on large platforms including Navy cruisers and destroyers.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Vulcan program was to design, build, and ground test a pressure gain combustion (PGC) technology system that demonstrates a 20% reduction in specific fuel consumption for power generation turbine engines.  PGC technology has been under development for more than a decade and considerable progress has been made in key enabling technology areas.  The technology is believed mature enough to permit a dramatic new system capability.  PGC, when combined with turbine engines, offers the ability to design a new class of hybrid turbine power generation engines and Mach 4+ air breathing propulsion systems.  The Vulcan system consists of a full scale PGC, a compressor, and a turbine, and has direct application to ship power generation and propulsion turbine engines, aviation turbine engines, high-Mach air breathing engines, as well as commercial turbine engines of the same variety.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Microscale Power Conversion (MPC) program will address the fundamental limitations of power conversion by enabling a new technology and approach that exploits advances in basic power devices that can operate at very high frequencies with low losses.  A key benefit of these new devices is that they can be integrated into very compact circuits and assemblies that will provide dramatic advances to the power bus of a platform.  Specifically, this program will develop the technology to enable DC to DC power conversion for military applications at the scale of an integrated circuit so it can be embedded within the electronics subsystem and a new distributed power architecture can be realized.  The focus of this program is on attaining 100MHz internal operation frequencies of power circuits since the size of the passive elements (inductors and capacitors) in a power converter scales inversely as the fourth power of the internal operating frequency.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research budget activity because its objective is to develop electronics that make a wide range of military applications possible.

Advances in microelectronic device technologies, including digital, analog, photonic and MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) devices, continue to have significant impact in support of defense technologies for improved weapons effectiveness, improved intelligence capabilities and enhanced information superiority.  The Electronics Technology program element supports the continued advancement of these technologies through the development of performance driven advanced capabilities, exceeding that available through commercial sources, in electronic, optoelectronic and MEMS devices, semiconductor device design and fabrication techniques, and new materials and material structures for device applications.  A particular focus for this work is the exploitation of chip-scale heterogeneous integration technologies that permit the optimization of device and integrated module performance.

The phenomenal progress in current electronics and computer chips will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology in the early 21st century, a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue.  Another thrust of the program element will explore alternatives to silicon-based electronics in the areas of new electronic devices, new architectures to use them, new software to program the systems, and new methods to fabricate the chips.  Approaches include nanotechnology, nanoelectronics, molecular electronics, spin-based electronics, quantum-computing, new circuit architectures optimizing these new devices, and new computer and electronic systems architectures.  Projects will investigate the feasibility, design, and development of powerful information technology devices and systems using approaches for electronic device designs that extend beyond traditional Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) scaling, including non silicon-based materials technologies to achieve low cost, reliable, fast and secure computing, communication, and storage systems.  This investigation is aimed at developing new capabilities from promising directions in the design of information processing components using both inorganic and organic substrates, designs of components and systems leveraging quantum effects and chaos, and innovative approaches to computing designs incorporating these components for such applications as low cost seamless pervasive computing, ultra-fast computing, and sensing and actuation devices.

                                    <r2:Description>There is a critical ongoing military need for flexible, affordable, hand-held cognitive military electromagnetic interfaces.  The Adaptive Radio Frequency Technology (ART) program will provide the warfighter with a new, fully adaptive radio platform capable of sensing the electromagnetic and waveform environment in which it operates, making decisions on how to best communicate in that environment, and rapidly adapting its hardware to meet ever-changing requirements, while simultaneously significantly reducing the size, weight and power (SWaP) of such radio nodes.  ART will also equip each warfighter, as well as small-scale unmanned platforms, with compact and efficient signal identification capabilities for next-generation cognitive communications, sensing and electronic warfare applications.  ART technology will also enable rapid radio platform deployment for new waveforms and changing operational requirements.  The project will remove the separate design tasks needed for each unique RF system, which will dramatically reduce the procurement and sustainment cost of military systems.  ART aggregates the Feedback Linearized Microwave Amplifiers program, the Analog Spectral Processing program, and Chip Scale Spectrum Analyzers (CSSA) program, and initiates new thrusts in Cognitive Low-energy Signal Analysis and Sensing Integrated Circuits (CLASIC), Radio-Frequency Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (RF-FPGA), and Dynamic Live Active Nulling (DyLAN).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Diverse &amp; Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Prior DARPA efforts have demonstrated the ability to monolithically integrate inherently different semiconductor types to achieve near-ideal "mix-and-match" capability for DoD circuit designers.  Specifically, the Compound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon (COSMOS) program, in which transistors of Indium Phosphide (InP) could be freely mixed with silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to obtain the benefits of both technologies (very high speed and very high circuit complexity/density, respectively).  The Diverse &amp; Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) effort will take this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (for example, Gallium Nitride, Indium Phosphide, Gallium Arsenide, Antimonide Based Compound Semiconductors), microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures.  This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true "systems on a chip" (SoCs) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions for a wide array of system applications.  

In the Applied Research part of this program, high performance RF/optoelectronic/mixed-signal SoCs for specific DoD transition applications will be developed as a demonstration of the DAHI technology.  In addition, in order to provide maximum benefit to the DoD, as these processes are developed, they will be transferred to a manufacturing flow and made available (with appropriate computer aided design support) to a wide variety of DoD laboratory, FFRDC, academic and industrial designers.  Manufacturing yield and reliability of the DAHI technologies will be characterized and enhanced.  This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01, and advanced technology development efforts funded in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro PN&amp;T) program is developing technology for self-contained chip-scale inertial navigation and precision guidance.  This technology promises to effectively mitigate dependence on Global Positioning System (GPS) or any other external signals, and enable uncompromised navigation and guidance capabilities.  The program will enable positioning, navigation and timing functions without the need for external information updates by employing on-chip calibration, thereby overcoming vulnerabilities which arise in environments where external updates are not available such as caves, tunnels, or dense urban locations.  The technologies developed will enable small, low-power, micro-gyroscopes capable of operating in both moderate and challenging dynamic environments; chip-scale primary atomic clock standards; and on-chip calibration systems for error correction.  Advanced micro-fabrication techniques allow a single package containing all the necessary devices (clocks, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and calibration mechanisms) to be incorporated into a volume the size of a sugar cube.  The small size, weight and power of these technologies and their integration into a single package responds to the needs of guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and individual soldiers.

The successful realization of a Micro PN&amp;T device is dependent on developing fundamentally new batch microfabrication processes, gaining an understanding of the sources and effects of error at the micro-scale, and exploring new combinatorial physics.  Innovative 3-D microfabrication techniques will allow co-fabrication of different materials and devices on a single chip.  Clocks, gyroscopes, accelerometers, calibration stages, and 3D structures could be integrated into a small, low power architecture.  This co-location of different inertial and timing devices opens the possibility for utilization of combinatorial physics in a single micro-system, enabling fast start-up time, increased bandwidth and long-term stability, thus effectively providing very accurate navigation devices.  Advanced research for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-12.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The objective of the Advanced X-Ray Integrated Sources (AXIS) program is to develop tunable, mono-energetic, spatially coherent X-ray sources with greatly reduced size, weight and power while dramatically increasing their electrical efficiency through application of micro-scale engineering technologies such as MEMS and NEMS.  Such X-ray sources will enable new versatile imaging modalities based on phase contrast techniques which are 1000X more sensitive than the conventional absorption contrast imaging.  Such imaging modalities should enable reverse engineering of integrated circuits to validate trustworthiness as well as battlefield imaging of soft tissues and blood vessel injuries from blunt trauma without the injection of a contrast enhancing agent.  The radiation dose required for imaging will also be reduced.

The Applied Research component of this effort will focus on applying basic research discoveries to the development of a compact, pulsed X-ray source.  Such sources are a necessary component to enable future technologies with high-speed motion imaging capabilities and the reverse engineering of integrated circuits.  This program also includes related basic research efforts funded under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Microscale Plasma Devices (MPD) program is to design, develop, and characterize MPD technologies, circuits, and substrates.  The MPD program will focus on development of fast, small, reliable, carrier dense, microplasma switches capable of operating in extreme conditions such as high-radiation and high-temperature environments.  Specific focus will be given to methods that produce efficient, high-pressure (up to or even beyond atmospheric pressure) generation of ions, radio frequency energy, and light sources.  Applications for such devices are far reaching, including the construction of complete high-frequency plasma-based logic circuits, and integrated circuits with superior resistance to radiation and extreme temperature environments.  It is envisaged that both two and multi-terminal devices consisting of various architectures will be developed and optimized under the scope of this program.  MPDs will be developed in various circuits and substrates to demonstrate the efficacy of different unique approaches.

The MPD applied research program is focused on transferring the fundamental scientific advances funded by PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 to produce complex circuit designs that may be integrated with commercial electronic devices.  It is expected that the MPD program will result in the design and modeling tools, as well as the fabrication capabilities necessary to commercially manufacture high-performance microscale-plasma-device-based electronic systems for advanced DoD applications.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Pixel Network (PIXNET) for Dynamic Visualization</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Pixel Network for dynamic visualization (PIXNET) program addresses the squad level capability gap for target detection, recognition and identification in all weather and day/night missions.  The vision of the program is to offer the warfighter a small and versatile infrared (IR) camera that would be affordable to individual soldiers and provide multiple IR band imagery with fusion capability to take full advantage of different wavelength band phenomenology in a compact single unit.  In the future, the availability of the PIXNET camera would enable a peer-to-peer networked system for image sharing within a squad, thereby providing a better common operating picture of the battlefield and significantly enhancing the warfighter's situational understanding.  The program aims to develop a low size, weight and power (SWaP), low cost, soldier portable multiband infrared camera that will render real-time single and multiple imagery using thermal and reflective bands.  The camera will also provide fused reflective and thermal band imagery on demand.  The use of fused imagery in the PIXNET design will allow the soldier to detect camouflaged targets and distinguish targets from decoys.  The PIXNET camera will eliminate limitations posed by current capability to detect, recognize and identify targets in low light and no light nighttime operations.

The PIXNET program will focus on a significant reduction in SWaP and cost of infrared sensor components to enable portability and ability to deploy widely to all participants in the theater.  Low-cost manufacturing of wafer scale IR sensors and coolers will provide a price point that will allow these components to be deployed to each warfighter.  The emphasis on a small form-factor will naturally enable new opportunities such as surveillance with small UAVs, rifle sights with multiple bands, vehicle mounted, helmet mounted and handheld surveillance systems.  The phenomenology of different infrared wavelengths will be exploited for a target of interest and only chunks of relevant data will be fused by a smart phone android processing platform, thus reducing the data burden and ease of display.  The combination of a smart phone and PIXNET camera at the soldier level will enable more effective tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) over the current capability.  The PIXNET program takes advantage of the computing capability of smart phones to process and fuse multicolor images and send them as videos or still images to the warfighter's helmet mounted display via a wireless or wired connection.  The smart phone and PIXNET camera integration allows for a strategy to produce low cost imaging system with single band and combined band imagery.  PIXNET capability could be further exploited in the future to enable a fully networked system such as the Network Warrior integrated multiple Soldier systems capability with full spectrum image and video sharing.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Microscale Power Conversion (MPC) program will address the fundamental limitations of power conversion by enabling a new technology and approach that exploits advances in basic power devices that can operate at very high frequencies with low losses.  A key benefit of these new devices is that they can be integrated into very compact circuits and assemblies that will provide dramatic advances to the power bus of a platform.  Specifically, this program will develop the technology to enable DC to DC power conversion for military applications at the scale of an integrated circuit so it can be embedded within the electronics subsystem and a new distributed power architecture can be realized.  The focus of this program is on attaining 100 Megahertz (MHz) internal operation frequencies of power circuits since the size of the passive elements (inductors and capacitors) in a power converter scales inversely as the fourth power of the internal operating frequency.  In FY 2012, MPC is funded in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-03.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Phased arrays are critical system components for high performance military electronics with widespread applications in communications, electronic warfare and radar.  The DoD relies heavily on phased arrays to maintain technological superiority in nearly every theater of conflict.  The DoD cannot update these high cost specialized arrays at the pace necessary to effectively counter adversarial threats under development using commercial-of-the-shelf components that can undergo technology refresh far more frequently.  The Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) program will develop adaptive and standardized digital-at-every-element arrays.  The hand designed, static RF beamformers will be replaced with cost effective digital array systems capable of a yearly technology refresh.  By doing so, phased arrays will become ubiquitous throughout the DoD, proliferating onto many platforms for which phased arrays had been previously prohibitively expensive to develop or maintain.  The basic research component of this program is budgeted under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Micro-coolers for Focal Plane Arrays (MC-FPA)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Micro-coolers for FPAs program will develop low Size, Weight, Power, and cost (SWaP-C) cryogenic coolers for application in high performance IR cameras.   The sensitivity of an IR focal-plane array (FPA) is improved by cooling its detectors to cryogenic temperatures.  The disadvantages of state-of-the art Sterling cryo-coolers used for high performance IR FPAs are large size, high power and high cost.  On the other hand, thermoelectric (TE) coolers used in low performance IR cameras are relatively small, high power and it is difficult to achieve temperatures below 200 K.  
 
To reduce IR camera SWaP-C, innovations in cooler technology are needed.  This program will exploit the Joule-Thompson (J-T) cooling principle, in a silicon-based MEMS technology, for making IR FPA coolers with very low SWaP-C. MEMS microfluidics, piezoelectric MEMS, and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics will be used to demonstrate an integrated cold head and compressor, all in a semiconductor chip.  Since a J-T cooler works by cooling from gas expansion, the coefficient of performance is expected to be much higher than state-of-the-art TE coolers and significantly smaller than Sterling coolers.  The chip-scale J-T cooler will be designed for pressure ratios of 4 or 5 to 1 with high compressor frequency in small volume.  The goal of the MC-FPA Program will be to demonstrate cooling down to 150K.  The microcoolers chip-scale size will cost less and will be significantly smaller.  Once the proof-of-principle is demonstrated, subsequent program effort would focus on transitioning to chip-scale manufacture on 8-12 inch wafers, resulting in cooler costs decreasing to as low as $50.  An extended wavelength-range short-wave IR detector will be integrated with a micro-cooler for demonstration of the MC-FPA. The basic research component of this program is budgeted under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Quantum Information Science (QIS) program will explore all facets of the research necessary to create new technologies based on quantum information science.  Research in this area has the ultimate goal of demonstrating the potentially significant advantages of quantum mechanical effects in communication and computing.  The QIS program is a broad effort addressing the fundamental material science and physics associated with solid-state qubits.  The primary technical challenges include loss of information due to quantum decoherence and the practical limitations associated with solid-state devices (operation at cryogenic temperatures, susceptibility to electronic and magnetic noise, limited coupling distance for qubit interactions, etc.).  Theoretical efforts in QIS are investigating novel techniques for preserving coherence, distributing quantum entanglement, and efficiently modeling qubit operation.  Complementary experiments are seeking to demonstrate qubits with better coherence properties than existing devices and to implement entangling operations between two or more solid-state qubits.  Future technologies utilizing quantum information science could enable ultra-secure communications; faster algorithms for optimization and simulation in logistics, war gaming, and pharmaceutical development; and new methods for image and signal processing in measurement and signature intelligence activities (MASINT).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR) program will create electronic systems capable of physically disappearing (either in whole or in part) in a controlled, triggerable manner.  VAPR will enable a host of previously unrealizable technologies that can be programmed to disappear, are biocompatible, and/or are physically reconfigurable. Applications include sensors for conventional indoor/outdoor environments (buildings, transportation and material), environmental monitoring over large areas, and simplified diagnosis, treatment, and health monitoring in the field. The program will develop and establish an initial set of materials and components along with integration and manufacturing capabilities to undergird a fundamentally new class of electronics defined by their performance and transience. These transient electronics will perform in a manner comparable to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems, but with limited device persistence that can be programmed, adjusted in real-time, triggered, and/or sensitive to the environment.  VAPR will provide an initial capability to make transient electronics a deployable technology for the DoD and Nation.  Basic research for the VAPR program is being performed in PE 0601101E, TRS-01.

To manufacture transient systems at scale will require significant research and development into: higher levels of circuit integration and complexity to realize advanced circuit functionalities; integrated system designs to achieve required function (in modes that offer programmed or triggered transience); integration of novel materials into circuit fabrication processes; and development of new packaging strategies. The efficacy of the technological capability developed through VAPR will be demonstrated through a final test vehicle of a transient sensor system. The goal is to develop a suite of design principles, develop strategies and pathways, process flows, tools and basic components that are readily generalizable and can be leveraged towards the development of many other transient electronics devices</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Self-HEALing mixed-signal Integrated Circuits (HEALICs) program is to develop technologies to autonomously maximize the number of fully operational mixed-signal systems-on-a-chip (SoC) per wafer that meet all performance goals in the presence of extreme process technology variations, environmental conditions, and aging.  Virtually all DoD systems employ mixed-signal circuits for functions such as communications, radar, navigation, sensing, high-speed image and video processing.  A self-healing integrated circuit is defined as a design that is able to sense undesired circuit/system behaviors and correct them automatically.  As semiconductor process technologies are being scaled to even smaller transistor dimensions, there is a dramatic increase in intra-wafer and inter-die process variations, which have a direct impact on realized circuit performance, as well as significantly increased sensitivity to temperature and ageing effects.

This applied research program aims to develop techniques to regain lost performance and stabilize operation of mixed-signal SoCs over system lifetimes.  Consequently, the long-term reliability of DoD electronic systems is expected to be significantly enhanced.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Efficient Linearized All-Silicon Transmitter ICs (ELASTx) program is the development of revolutionary high-power/high-efficiency/high-linearity single-chip millimeter (mm)-wave transmitter integrated circuits (ICs) in leading-edge silicon technologies for future miniaturized communications and sensor systems on mobile platforms.  The high levels of integration possible in silicon technologies enable on-chip linearization, complex waveform synthesis, and digital calibration and correction.  Military applications include ultra-miniaturized transceivers for satellite communications-on-the-move, collision avoidance radars for micro-/nano-air vehicles, and ultra-miniature seekers for small munitions.  The technology developed under this program could also be leveraged to improve the performance of high-power amplifiers based-on other nonsilicon technologies through heterogeneous integration strategies.  Significant technical obstacles to be overcome include the development of highly efficient circuits for increasing achievable output power of silicon devices (e.g., device stacking, power combining) at mm-waves; scaling high-efficiency amplifier classes to the mm-wave regime; integrated linearization architectures for complex modulated waveforms; and robust RF/mixed-signal isolation strategies.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Analog-to-Information (A-to-I) Look-Through program will fundamentally improve the operational bandwidth, linearity, and efficiency of electronic systems where the objective is to receive and transmit information using electromagnetic (radio) waves under extreme size/weight/power and environmental conditions required for DoD applications.  The A-to-I Look-Through program will develop ultra-wideband digital radio frequency (RF) receivers based on Analog-to-Information Converter (AIC) technology.  Compared to conventional RF receivers, AIC-based designs will increase receiver dynamic range and frequency band of regard while reducing data glut, power consumption and size.  Likewise, limitations of current-art power amplifier technology in simultaneously achieving high operational bandwidth, linearity, efficiency and power has resulted in well documented instances of electronic fratricide.  This program will overcome these limitations by converting digital signals directly to high power RF analog signals, thus eliminating the traditional high power amplifiers that are limited by the above-mentioned tradeoffs.  Transition is anticipated into airborne SIGINT and electronic warfare systems, as well as ground-based special operations forces systems.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Most Integrated Circuit (IC) foundries offering leading edge technology are located outside of the United States.  The detrimental effects of this trend are twofold: a lack of access to advanced onshore technology accelerates the migration of highly trained circuit designers from the United States; and DoD is faced with fewer trusted domestic foundries despite becoming increasingly reliant on leading edge semiconductor processes for its most critical systems.

Research at advanced semiconductor technology nodes is essential for driving future technology developments in both commercial and DoD application spaces.  Thus, the objective of the Leading Edge Access Program (LEAP) is to provide university, industry and Government researchers access to state-of-the-art, onshore complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology to develop advanced IC concepts relevant to DoD problems.  Specifically, LEAP will offer onshore foundry access to CMOS technology nodes of 45 nm and below to increase the number of U.S. designers possessing expertise in leading edge CMOS nodes.</r2:Description>

Innovations in design and fabrication were pursued to enable precision etching, deposition, and pattern transfer techniques to produce resonant cavities, electrodes, and magnetics, and electron emitting cathodes for compact high-performance millimeter wave devices.  These new technologies eliminated the limitations associated with the conventional methods for assembly of high-power sources in this frequency range.  Advanced research for this program was budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The objective of the Short-range Wide-field-of-regard Extremely-agile Electronically-steered Photonic Emitter and Receiver (SWEEPER) program was to develop chip-scale dense waveguide modular technology to achieve true embedded phase array control for beams equivalent to 10W average power, less than 0.1 degree instantaneous field of view (IFOV), greater than 45 degree total field of view (TFOV), and frame rates of greater than 100 hertz (Hz) in packages that are "chip-scale."  Such performance represents a three order of magnitude increase in speed, while also achieving a greater than two orders of magnitude reduction in size.  Additionally, the integrated phase control provided the unprecedented ability to rapidly change the number of simultaneous beams, beam profile, and power-per-beam, thus opening a whole new direction in operational capability.  Key technical challenges included the ability to achieve the needed facet density (facet pitch should be on the order of a wavelength or two), control the relative phase across all facets equivalent to 9-bits, and efficiently couple and distribute coherent light to facets from a master laser oscillator with an integrated waveguide structure.</r2:Description>

T3 would be carried internally on stealth aircraft or externally on fighters, bombers, and UAVs.  The enabling technologies are: propulsion, data links, and digital guidance and control.  T3 would allow any aircraft to rapidly switch between air-to-air and air-to-surface capabilities.  T3's speed, maneuverability, and network-centric capabilities would significantly improve U.S. aircraft survivability and increase the number and variety of targets that could be destroyed on each sortie.  The program is jointly funded with, and will transition to the Air Force.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Persistent Close Air Support (PCAS)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Persistent Close Air Support (PCAS) program will significantly increase close air support (CAS) capabilities by developing a system to allow continuous CAS availability and lethality to the supported ground commander.  The enabling technologies are: manned/unmanned attack platforms, next generation graphical user interfaces, data links, digital guidance and control, and advanced munitions.  PCAS will demonstrate the ability to digitally task a CAS platform from the ground to attack multiple/simultaneous targets.  PCAS will allow the Joint Tactical Air Controller (JTAC) the ability to rapidly engage multiple moving targets simultaneously within the area of operation.  PCAS's ability to digitally task a CAS platform to attack multiple/simultaneous targets would improve U.S. ground forces operations and speed of attack.  The system will be designed to reduce collateral damage and potential fratricide to friendly forces.  The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force.</r2:Description>

The goal of the Integrated Hypersonics (IH) program is to develop, mature, and test next-generation technologies needed for global-range, maneuverable, hypersonic flight at Mach 20 and above for missions ranging from time-critical, survivable transport to conventional prompt global strike.  IH seeks technological advances in the areas of: next generation aero-configurations; thermal protection systems and hot structures; adaptive guidance, navigation, and control; enhanced range and data collection methods; and advanced propulsion concepts, including real-time trajectory planning.  The IH program is designed to address technical challenges and improve understanding of long-range hypersonic flight through an initial full-scale baseline test of an existing hypersonic test vehicle, followed by a series of subscale flight tests, innovative ground-based testing, expanded modeling and simulation, and advanced analytic methods, culminating in a test flight of a full-scale hypersonic demonstrator.  This program will leverage advances made by the previously funded Falcon program.  The Integrated Hypersonics (IH) program results are planned for transition to the Air Force.</r2:Description>

The goal of the Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node (TERN) is to dramatically advance the aviation capability of smaller, lower-cost ships.  The program will demonstrate the technology for launch and recovery of large, medium altitude, long-endurance aircraft capable of providing persistent 24/7 Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and strike capabilities at long radius orbits.  By extending the ISR/strike radius and simultaneously increasing time on station beyond current capabilities from smaller ships, TERN will enable novel operational concepts including responsive, persistent deep overland ISR/strike without requirement for forward basing.  To achieve these goals, the program will create new concepts for aircraft launch and recovery, aircraft logistics and maintenance, and aircraft flight in regimes associated with maritime operating conditions.  The program will culminate in a launch and recovery demonstration.  Application of TERN technologies and operationally concepts will enable a novel and cost efficient approach for mission sets including ship identification, overland or maritime surveillance, and strike.  The anticipated transition partner is the Navy.</r2:Description>

DARPA will conduct a study of current air dominance efforts in coordination with the United States Air Force and Navy and explore potential technology developmental areas to ensure the air superiority of the United States in the future.  The study will consider roles of manned and unmanned platforms; the relative performance of alternative integrated systems concepts that combine various mixes of capabilities networked together; and the cost effectiveness of alternative balances of platforms and systems that provide surveillance, command and control, electronic warfare, and weapons functions.  Innovative platform concepts for airframe, propulsion, sensors, weapons integration, avionics, and active and passive survivability features will be explored as a central part of the concept definition effort.  This effort will also explore the expanded development and use of automated and advanced aerospace engineering design tools, modeling, and simulation in areas that can increase the likelihood of producing more capable products with improved efficiency.  Following the initial multi-agency study, DARPA will present technical challenges to industry to allow them to explore and present potential solutions.  Enabling technologies are next generation platforms, advanced networking capabilities, reliable navigation, passive and active defense, electronic attack, area denial, advanced sensors, and cyber technologies.  After the study, it is envisioned that high potential prototype programs will emerge to develop technologies for future air dominance.

                                    <r2:Description>The joint DARPA/Air Force Integrated Sensor Is Structure (ISIS) program is developing a sensor of unprecedented proportions that is fully integrated into a stratospheric airship that will address the nation's need for persistent wide-area surveillance, tracking, and engagement for hundreds of time-critical air and ground targets in urban and rural environments.  ISIS is achieving radical sensor improvements by melding the next-generation technologies for enormous lightweight antenna apertures and high-energy density components into a highly integrated lightweight multi-purpose airship structure - completely erasing the distinction between payload and platform.  The ISIS concept includes ninety-nine percent on-station 24/7/365 availability for simultaneous Airborne Moving Target Indicator (AMTI) (600 kilometers) and Ground-Based Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) (300 kilometers) operation; ten years of autonomous, unmanned flight; hundreds of wideband in-theater concealed communications links; responsive reconstitution of capabilities lost by any failed space assets; plus CONUS-based sensor analysis and operation.  The ISIS technologies will be made available to the Air Force and other Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The objective of the Vulture program is to demonstrate the required technology to enable an airborne payload to remain persistently on-station, uninterrupted and unreplenished, for over five years performing strategic and tactical communications, position/navigation/timing (PNT) and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions over an area of interest.  Vulture technology enables a re-taskable, persistent pseudo-satellite capability, in a notional aircraft package.  The technology challenges include structural integrity of very lightly-loaded airframe structure, efficient and reliable energy collection, storage/retrieval and management, and reliability technologies capable of allowing the aircraft to operate continuously for five years.  The remaining Vulture program will conduct subscale demonstration activities to prove out critical technologies.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and Navy.</r2:Description>

The program used two NASA RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned aircraft as surrogate platforms to inform the development of next generation HALE aircraft built around aerial refueling, which has proven vital to manned military aviation.  Specific challenges included precise control of limited flight performance aircraft under high-altitude conditions, redundant safe separation, and complex unmanned flight operations.  The program also promoted the application of autonomy for better effectiveness, efficiency, and safety in challenging environments.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Space Programs and Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced space systems and provides revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military missions.

A space force structure that is robust against attack represents a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space assets.  The keys to a secure space environment are situational awareness to detect and characterize potential threats, a proliferation of assets to provide robustness against attack, ready access to space, and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit assets.  Ready access to space requires the delivery of defensive systems, replenishment supplies to orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities.  An infrastructure to service the mission spacecraft allows defensive actions to be taken without limiting mission lifetime.  In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space.

Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terrestrial users.  Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness; enabling concepts include novel propulsion/propellants, unique manufacturing processes; precision control of multi-payload systems, and payload isolation and pointing systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>System F6</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The objective of the System F6 program is to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a satellite architecture wherein the functionality of a traditional "monolithic" spacecraft is replaced by a cluster of wirelessly-interconnected spacecraft modules.  Each such "fractionated" module would contribute a unique capability, for example, computation and data handling, communications relay, guidance and navigation, payload sensing, or it can replicate the capability of another module.  The fractionated modules would fly in a loose, proximate cluster orbit capable of semi-autonomous reconfiguration or a rapid defensive scatter/re-gather maneuver.  Critical to this architecture is a robust, system-level approach to ensuring security, integrity, and availability, while implementing authentication and non-repudiation.  While delivering a comparable mission capability to a monolithic spacecraft, the objective of the System F6 program is to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a satellite architecture wherein the functionality of a traditional "monolithic" spacecraft is replaced by a cluster of wirelessly-interconnected spacecraft modules.  Each such "fractionated" module would contribute a unique capability, for example, computation and data handling, communications relay, guidance and navigation, payload sensing, or it can replicate the capability of another module.  The fractionated modules would fly in a loose, proximate cluster orbit capable of semi-autonomous reconfiguration or a rapid defensive scatter/re-gather maneuver.  Critical to this architecture is a robust, system-level approach to ensuring security, integrity, and availability, while implementing authentication and non-repudiation.  While delivering a comparable mission capability to a monolithic spacecraft, System F6 significantly enhances architectural and programmatic adaptability and robustness - reducing risk through the mission life and spacecraft development cycle, enabling incremental deployment of the system, and enhancing survivability.  The System F6 architecture provides valuable options to decision makers throughout the life cycle development of future space systems that are absent in present-day monolithic architectures.

The System F6 program will culminate in an on-orbit demonstration of a multi-module space system incorporating the F6 Technology Package (F6TP) a suite of technologies, components, and algorithms that enables semi-autonomous multi-body cluster flight and secure, distributed, real-time sharing of various spacecraft resources at the cluster level.  Multiple versions of the F6 Technology Package will be developed on the basis of open-source interface standards, software, and reference designs termed the F6 Developer's Kit (FDK).  The on-orbit demonstration will be capable of accommodating one or more spacecraft payload modules supplied by a third-party mission partner.  Residual capability to support future payloads with the existing on-orbit infrastructure will also remain following the demonstration, and the infrastructure can be upgraded for a perpetual on-orbit resource capability.  The utility of the F6 architecture in low earth orbit (LEO) is significantly enabled by persistent broadband connectivity to the ground which allows resource sharing between space-based modules and terrestrial network nodes.  A solution to enable high-availability, low-latency, persistent, high-bandwidth communication with LEO spacecraft will be developed in the course of the F6 program.  The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force, though the architecture will have the ability to simultaneously accommodate payloads from multiple other partners including the Army and Navy.  The resultant architecture is expected to significantly lower the barrier to entry and enhance competiveness of the national security space industrial base.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA) program is to mature and demonstrate technologies for cost effective, routine, reliable, horizontal access to low earth orbit (LEO).  ALASA seeks improvements in cost, responsiveness, flexibility, and resilience with a single approach.  ALASA will enable small satellites to be deployed to orbit from an airborne platform, allowing performance improvement, reducing range costs, and flying more frequently, which drives cost per pound down.  The ability to relocate and launch from virtually any major runway around the globe reduces the time needed to deploy a satellite system.  Launch point offset permits essentially any possible orbit direction to be achieved without concerns for launch direction imposed by geography.  Finally, launch point offset allows the entire operation to be moved should a particular fixed airfield become unavailable due to natural phenomena or other issues.  Challenges include, but are not limited to: in-air separation of aircraft and orbit-insertion launch stages, development of alternatives to current range processes, control of weight and margin under a hard gross weight limit, and achieving a cost per flight of $1 million, including range support costs, to deploy satellites on the order of 100 lb.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and Army.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Space Domain Awareness (SDA)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Space Domain Awareness (SDA) program is to develop and demonstrate an operational framework and responsive defense application to enhance the availability of vulnerable space-based resources.  Current space surveillance sensors cannot detect, track, or determine the future location and threat potential of small advanced technology spacecraft in deep space orbits, where a majority of DoD spacecraft are located.  Additionally, servicing missions to geosynchronous (GEO) orbits will require exquisite situational awareness, from ultra-high-accuracy debris tracking for mission assurance at GEO orbits to high resolution imaging of GEO spacecraft for service mission planning.

SDA will investigate revolutionary technologies in two areas: 1) advanced space surveillance sensors to better detect, track, and characterize space objects, with an emphasis on deep space objects, and 2) space surveillance data collection and data processing/ fusion to provide automated data synergy.  The resulting increase in space domain awareness will enhance overall space safety of flight, and allow space operators to make informed, timely decisions.  The SDA program will leverage data fusion and advanced algorithms developed under the Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) program, as well as seek to exploit new ground-breaking technologies across the electromagnetic spectrum and utilize already existing sensor technology in non-traditional or exotic ways, to bring advanced capabilities to the space domain.  SDA will correlate a wide range of operational support and space system user data to rapidly identify threat activities, propose mitigating countermeasures, and verify the effectiveness of selected responses.  Critical technologies include accessing disparate sources of relevant data, model-based situational awareness, and candidate response generation and evaluation.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the ability to continuously adapt to changes in defended system components and usage patterns as well as validation of system integrity.

Efficient collection of data for SDA is crucial to controlling costs.  SDA will demonstrate new approaches to collection of data utilizing a variety of collection modalities, ranging from fusion of observations from non-traditional sources, such as amateur includes orbit outlook astronomers, to evaluation of sparse aperture imaging techniques.  The Galileo effort will develop technology to image a Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite from the ground.  Galileo will utilize fixed mobile telescopes, each with adaptive optics and a guide star, to create multiple baselines that can be used to reconstruct the image through an inverse Fourier transform.  The concept is similar to existing astronomic interferometers, except Galileo will extend the basic interferometric technology to utilize fiber optic transport of light between each telescope to match the optical path length instead of the traditional evacuated light tubes.  Technical challenges include: controlling thermal effects and dispersion within the fiber to properly interfere the light from the two telescopes, precisely measuring the distance between the fixed and mobile telescope systems, and accurately measuring relative phase from low signal flux levels with low mutual coherence.  The potential transition customer is the Air Force.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Space Surveillance Telescope (SST)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) program will develop and demonstrate an advanced ground-based optical system to enable detection and tracking of faint objects in space, while providing rapid, wide-area search capability.  A major goal of the SST program is to develop the technology for large curved focal surface array sensors to enable an innovative telescope design combining high detection sensitivity, short focal length, wide field of view, and rapid step-and-settle to provide orders of magnitude improvements in space surveillance.  This capability will enable ground-based detection of un-cued objects in deep space for purposes such as asteroid detection and space defense missions.  The program is also investigating expanding the demonstration of the telescope to explore detection and tracking of broader classes of space objects under different orbital regimes, and the impact of observations from different environments.  The Air Force Space Command is the intended transition partner.

 In addition, the program is investigating data fusion and advanced algorithms for correlation of unknown objects.  SST is expected to generate a large number of uncorrelated targets (UCTs), and new methods will need to be employed to rapidly characterize and attribute the new objects.  Furthermore, the data fusion effort is investigating methods which combine observations from disparate sensors (such as optical and radar installations) to more rapidly, accurately, and completely provide knowledge about UCTs.  Specifically, the data fusion effort is investigating methods to quickly provide positive identification of orbital objects, rapidly characterize them and maintain a catalog of determined characteristics, and dynamically schedule available sensors to provide the most valuable and timely observations possible.  Where appropriate, SST will investigate new concepts which would provide complementary or further advances in ground-based deep space object detection and characterization.

The SST Australia effort will provide a further operational demonstration of the SST at an Australian site.  Such a location presents a more operationally relevant demonstration, with a richer and more interesting population of SSA targets in geosynchronous orbit.  A demonstration in Australia would investigate telescope performance and observe objects and orbits not visible from the current site in New Mexico.  In addition, the demonstration would generate data for analysis and fusion efforts, which will be used to further refine and evaluate data processing techniques, such as those developed under the Ibex effort.  This program will address technical challenges which may arise from an Australian site, including adaptations to a different telescope environment, and the logistical and communications challenges presented by a site significantly more remote than the current SST location.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>To date, servicing operations have not been conducted on spacecraft beyond low earth orbit (LEO).  A large number of national security and commercial space systems operate at Geosynchronous (GEO) altitudes, furthermore, many end-of-life or failed spacecraft drift without control through portions of the GEO belt, creating a growing hazard to operational spacecraft.  Technologies for servicing of spacecraft with the expectation such servicing would involve a mix of highly autonomous and remotely (i.e., ground-based) teleoperated robotic systems have been previously pursued.  The Phoenix servicing program will build upon these legacy technologies, tackling the more complex GEO environment and going beyond pure traditional servicing functions.  The program seeks to repurpose high value long life components on existing satellites in GEO, in full collaboration and cooperation with existing satellite owners, utilizing commercial ride-along capability to send newly developed small, modular, and inexpensive "satlet" satellite modules into GEO for use in upgrading, fixing, repairing, and enhancing the repurposed components.  Key challenges include transportation and orbital maneuvering, robotic systems and integration, and extravehicular tool requirements.  The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Army, Air Force, intelligence community, and other potential users require affordable support to the tactical warfighter via space.  The goal of the SeeMe program is to demonstrate the ability to get near-real-time, i.e., no older than ~90 minutes, images directly to individual users' handheld devices from space.  This will be accomplished via a very low cost constellation of inexpensive, disposable small satellites routinely and inexpensively put in orbit through low cost horizontal (aircraft-released) launches.  The current methodology for satisfying imagery needs from space is to build multipurpose systems with very high reliability and long life, at very high costs, and launch them on expensive vertical launch boosters. In most cases, commercial or military, the time to deliver an already built space intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance system suitable to meet tactically desired ground sample distance is on the order of 20+ months, and the data delivery mechanism is typically more than several days (and up to weeks) to the end user.  SeeMe intends to radically shorten the entire cycle: ground development time, launch cadence, and on-orbit request-to-image-delivery time through new satellite manufacturing techniques, advanced low-cost aperture technologies, leveraging alternative launch concepts, and a novel direct-to-user command and data exfiltration architecture.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and the Army.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The X-SEP program will mature the technologies for advanced solar electric propulsion to support a wide range of future DOD missions.  Past DOD and NASA efforts have identified and begun maturing critical enabling technologies including light weight and high power solar arrays, advanced solar cells, efficient deployment mechanisms, power management and distribution; and advanced electric propulsion concepts.   A critically important technology gap is integration into a flight demonstration able to survive in the harsh radiation and thermal space environments.  The X-SEP program will mature and validate key technologies on the ground, then fabricate a deep space X-Satellite to demonstrate:  1) a space qualified power system 1/3 the weight of anything ever flown 2) electric propulsion thrust over input power greater than 90 mN/KW, and 3) modular power scaleable to over 1 MW.  A key goal is validating the critical technologies for a wide range of next generation high power space systems including highly survivable early missile warning sensors; space situational awareness; efficient on-orbit robotic servicing; new technical approaches for space based radar; next generation high power communications; and dynamic near continuous maneuvering for survivable information, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) orbital missions.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Advanced Electronics Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it seeks to design and demonstrate state-of-the-art manufacturing and processing technologies for the production of various electronics and microelectronic devices, sensor systems, actuators and gear drives that have military applications and potential commercial utility.  Introduction of advanced product design capability and flexible, scalable manufacturing techniques will enable the commercial sector to rapidly and cost-effectively satisfy military requirements.

The MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Integrated Microsystems Technology project is a broad, cross-disciplinary initiative to merge computation and power generation with sensing and actuation to realize a new technology for both perceiving and controlling weapons systems and battlefield environments.  MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems to address issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements.  The project will also address thermal management, navigation and positioning technology challenges.

The goal of the Mixed Technology Integration project is to leverage advanced microelectronics manufacturing infrastructure and DARPA component technologies developed in other projects to produce mixed-technology microsystems.  These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness and security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms.  The chip assembly and packaging processes currently in use produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system.  This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'.  The ability to integrate mixed technologies onto a single substrate will increase performance and reliability, while driving down size, weight, volume and cost.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These issues include microscale power and actuation systems as well as microscale components that survive harsh environments.  The microfluidic molecular systems effort will develop automated microsystems that integrate biochemical fluid handling capability along with electronics, optoelectronics and chip-based reaction and detection modules for tailored sequence analysis to monitor environmental conditions, health hazards and physiological states.  Thermal management technologies will develop heat resistant thermal layers to provide efficient operation for cooling electronic devices.  Another focus in micro technologies is to improve navigation, position and timing capabilities for uncompromised navigation and positioning in today's dynamic military field of operations.

The major technical focus areas of the MEMS and Integrated Microsystems programs contained in this project are: 1) inertial measurement; 2) fluid sensing and control; 3) electromagnetic and optical beam steering; 4) chemical reactions on chip; 5) electromechanical signal processing; 6) analytical instruments; 7) thermal management; and 8) navigation and positioning technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro PN&amp;T)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro PN&amp;T) program is developing technology for self-contained chip-scale inertial navigation and precision guidance.  This technology promises to effectively mitigate dependence on Global Positioning System (GPS) or any other external signals, and enable uncompromised navigation and guidance capabilities.  The program will enable positioning, navigation and timing functions without the need for external information updates by employing on-chip calibration, thereby overcoming vulnerabilities which arise in environments where external updates are not available such as caves, tunnels, or dense urban locations.  The technologies developed will enable small, low-power, micro-gyroscopes capable of operating in both moderate and challenging dynamic environments; chip-scale primary atomic clock standards; and on-chip calibration systems for error correction.  Advanced micro-fabrication techniques allow a single package containing all the necessary devices (clocks, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and calibration mechanisms) to be incorporated into a volume the size of a sugar cube.  The small size, weight and power (SWaP) of these technologies and their integration into a single package responds to the needs of guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and individual soldiers.  The Micro PN&amp;T program is an aggregation of Integrated Primary Atomic Clock, Navigation Grade Integrated Micromachined Gyroscopes, Micro Inertial Navigation Technology, Information Tethered Microscale Autonomous Rotary Stages, Micromachined Rate Integrating Gyroscopes, Single-Chip Timing and Inertial Measurement Unit, Primary and Secondary Calibration on Active Layer, and Chip-Scale Combinatorial Atomic Navigator.  The technology is expected to transition through industry and existing DoD transition partnerships with the Services.

To achieve the low SWaP necessary for guided munitions, UAVs, and personal navigation applications, the technologies in the MicroPN&amp;T program will have to push the limitations of integration and performance in current MicroElectroMechanical systems (MEMS) technologies.

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Thermal Management Technologies (TMT) program was to explore and optimize new nanostructured materials and other recent advances for use in thermal management systems.  The overall goal of the program was to insert breakthrough materials and structures at all layers of DoD systems, and enable higher power densities, increased performance, and improved efficiency.  Modern, high-performance heat spreaders, which use two-phase cooling, were developed to replace the copper alloy spreaders in conventional systems.  Enhancing air-cooled exchangers by reducing the thermal resistance through the heat sink to the ambient, increasing convection through the system, improving heat sink fin thermal conductivity, optimizing and/or redesigning the complementary heat sink blower, and increasing the overall system (heat sink and blower) coefficient of performance was another thrust of this program.  Another element of this effort focused on novel materials and structures that can provide significant reductions in the thermal resistance of the thermal interface layer between the backside of an electronic device and the next layer of the package, which might be a spreader or a heat sink.  Technology will be inserted through DoD industrial firms into future DoD systems.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The goal of the Mixed Technology Integration project is to leverage advanced microelectronics manufacturing infrastructure and DARPA component technologies developed in other projects to produce mixed-technology microsystems.  These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness, security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms.  At the present time, systems are fabricated by assembling a number of mixed-technology components: microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microphotonics, microfluidics and millimeterwave/microwave.  Each technology usually requires a different level of integration, occupies a separate silicon chip and requires off-chip wiring, and requires fastening and packaging to form a module.  The chip assembly and packaging processes produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system.  This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'.

The field of microelectronics incorporates micrometer/nanometer scale integration and is the most highly integrated, low-cost and high-impact technology to date.  Microelectronics technology has produced the microcomputer-chip that enabled or supported the revolutions in computers, networking and communication.  This program extends the microelectronics paradigm to include the integration of heterogeneous or mixed technologies.  This new paradigm will create a new class of 'matchbook-size', highly integrated device and microsystem architectures.  Examples of component-microsystems include low-power, small-volume, lightweight, microsensors, microrobots and microcommunication systems that will improve and expand the performance of the warfighter, military platforms, munitions and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs).

The program includes the integration of mixed materials on generic substrates including glass, polymers and silicon.  The program is design and process intensive, using 'standard' processes and developing new semiconductor-like processes and technologies that support the integration of mixed-technologies at the micrometer/nanometer scale.  The program includes the development of micrometer/nanometer scale isolation, contacts, interconnects and 'multiple-chip-scale' packaging for electronic, mechanical, fluidic, photonic and rf/mmwave/microwave technologies.  For example, a mixed-technology microsystem using integrated microfluidics, MEMS, microphotonics, microelectronics and microwave components could provide a highly integrated, portable analytical instrument to monitor the battlefield environment, the physical condition of a warfighter, the identity of warfighters (friend or foe) or the combat readiness of equipment.  The ability to integrate mixed technologies onto a single substrate will drive down the size, weight, volume, and cost of weapon systems while increasing their performance and reliability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Low Cost Thermal Imager - Manufacturing (LCTI-M) effort builds upon previous manufacturing and imaging work and will develop a pocket-sized, manufacturable, and practical thermal imager at a price point that allows them to be provided to large numbers of warfighters.  Availability of very low cost and small form-factor infrared (IR) cameras will facilitate new techniques and applications that could provide the decisive edge needed in modern battlefields.  These cameras will allow a soldier to have practical thermal imaging capability for locating warm objects (e.g., enemy combatants) in darkness.  The small size, weight and power (SWaP) thermal camera will be integrated with a handheld device such as a cell phone with network capability for tactical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.  In order to achieve this goal, breakthroughs will be required in low-cost thermal imagers manufactured using wafer scale integration, vacuum packaging, low cost optics and low-power signal processing.  By the end of the program, the imager chips will be fully integrated with a low-cost processor and optics.  The camera will have wireless connectivity to integrate video display with cell phones or PDAs.  U.S. Army PEO Soldier Sensors and Lasers (SSL), PM Optics USMC, USSOCOM and industry will be the transition partners.</r2:Description>

These fiber-laser arrays will be sufficiently lightweight, compact, and electrically efficient to be fielded on a variety of platforms with minimal impact on the platform's original mission capabilities.  Each array element will possess an adaptive-optic capability to minimize beam divergence in the presence of atmospheric turbulence, together with wide-field-of-view beam steering for target tracking.  With each Excalibur array element powered by high power fiber laser amplifiers (at up to 3 kilowatts (kW) per amplifier), high power air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements will be enabled that were previously infeasible because of laser system size and weight.  In addition, this program will also develop kilowatt-class arrays of diode lasers which will provide an alternate route to efficiently reaching mission-relevant power levels, and they will test the ultimate scalability of the optical phased array architecture.  Excalibur arrays will be conformal to aircraft surfaces and scalable in size and power by adding additional elements to the array.  Excalibur will provide the technology foundation for defense of next generation airborne platforms, including all aircraft flying at altitudes below 50,000 ft, against proliferated, deployed, and next-generation man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) and more capable air-to-air missiles converted for use as ground-to-air missiles.  Excalibur will enable these platforms to fly at lower altitude and conduct truly persistent, all-weather ground missions, such as reconnaissance despite low-lying cloud cover.  Further capabilities may include multichannel laser communications, target identification, tracking, designation, precision defeat with minimal collateral effects as well as other applications.

The Excalibur program will also develop efficient high-power laser amplifier arrays based on coherent or spectral beam-combining.  The potential of these arrays to scale to tactical power levels (100 kilowatt class) will be investigated.  These laser amplifier arrays will be designed to work in tandem with the core laser components developed under the Excalibur program in PE 0602702E, Project TT-06.  In addition a conceptual design and CONOPS development for a High Energy Laser Counter Measure (HELCM) system will be developed to enable a near-term capability for low-altitude self-defense against MANPADS.  This technology will transition via industry.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Diverse &amp; Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Prior DARPA efforts have demonstrated the ability to monolithically integrate inherently different semiconductor types to achieve near-ideal "mix-and-match" capability for DoD circuit designers.  Specifically, one such program was the Compound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon (COSMOS) program, in which transistors of Indium Phosphide (InP) could be freely mixed with silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to obtain the benefits of both technologies (very high speed and very high circuit complexity/density, respectively).  The Diverse &amp; Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) effort will take this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (for example, Gallium Nitride, Indium Phosphide, Gallium Arsenide, Antimonide Based Compound Semiconductors), microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures.  This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true "systems on a chip" (SoC) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions for a wide array of system applications.

This program has complementary research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01, and in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.  The Advanced Technology Development part of this program will leverage the 6.1 and 6.2 programs with focus on the establishment of an accessible, manufacturable technology for device-level heterogeneous integration of a wide array of materials and devices (including, for example, multiple electronics and MEMS technologies) with complex silicon-enabled (e.g. CMOS) architectures on a common silicon substrate platform.  This part of the program is expected to culminate in accessible foundry processes of DAHI technology and demonstrations of advanced microsystems with innovative architectures and designs that leverage heterogeneous integration.  By the end of the program, this effort seeks to establish a technologically mature, sustainable DAHI foundry service to be made available (with appropriate computer-aided design support) to a wide variety of DoD laboratory, FFRDC, academic and industrial designers.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Advanced Wide FOV Architectures for Image Reconstruction &amp; Exploitation (AWARE) program primarily addresses the passive imaging needs for multi-band, wide field of view (FOV) and high-resolution imaging for ground and near ground platforms.  The AWARE program aims to solve the technological barriers that will enable wide FOV, high resolution and multi-band camera architectures by focusing on four major tasks: high space-bandwidth product (SBP) camera architecture; small pitch pixel focal plane array architecture; broadband focal plane array architecture; and multi-band focal plane array architecture.

The AWARE program will advance integration of technologies that enable wide field of view and high resolution and multi-band cameras, including the technologies demonstrated in the related AWARE program in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.  AWARE aggregates the following programs: Lambda Scale (formerly NIRD), Broadband (formerly PT-SQUAD), Multi-Band (formerly DUDE), and Wide Field of View (formerly MOSAIC).  The integration of the technologies will demonstrate subsystems such as focal plane arrays (FPAs) and cameras.  Such focal plane arrays can also be used to fabricate very large number of pixels for persistent surveillance applications.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The objective of the High Frequency Integrated Vacuum Electronics (HiFIVE) program was to develop and demonstrate new high-performance and low-cost technologies for implementing high-power millimeter-wave sources and components.  This program developed new semiconductor and micro-fabrication technologies to produce vacuum electronic high-power amplifiers for use in high-bandwidth, high-power transmitters.  Innovations in design and fabrication were being pursued to enable precision etching, deposition, and pattern transfer techniques to produce resonant cavities, electrodes, and magnetics, and electron emitting cathodes for compact high-performance millimeter wave devices.  These new technologies will eliminate the limitations associated with the conventional methods for assembly of high-power sources in this frequency range.  This technology is transitioning via industry.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Command, Control and Communications Systems program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because its purpose is to demonstrate and evaluate advanced information systems research and development concepts.

The goals of the Command and Control Information Systems project are to develop and test innovative, secure architectures and tools to enhance information processing, dissemination and presentation capabilities for the commander.  This will give the commander insight into the disposition of enemy and friendly forces, a joint situational awareness picture that will improve planning, decision-making and execution support capability and provide secure multimedia information interfaces and assured software to "on the move" users.  Integration of collection management, planning and battlefield awareness programs is an essential element for achieving battlefield dominance through assured information systems.

The goals of the Information Integration Systems project are to take diverse data inputs from a variety of sources, efficiently disseminate the information, and perform distributed and dynamic all-source correlation and fusion to produce an integrated, geo-spatially referenced, battlefield database and knowledge-base.  The principal element of this project is assured communications using standard and non-traditional means, on and off the battlefield.

The goals of the Secure Information and Network Systems project are to develop and test emerging computer and network systems where the impact of the systems and the vulnerabilities of the systems are not kinetically based.  Computer and network security technologies arising from other projects will be further identified, developed, integrated, and tested.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Military operations since the end of the Cold War show theater-level command, control, communications, and intelligence/information systems lack the ability to fully support operations in complex, time-critical environments.  Warfighters must be prepared for operations ranging from peacekeeping in urban centers to heavy battle actions in remote areas.  Current capabilities do not provide the commander with real-time, secure, situational awareness or the ability to orchestrate high-tempo planning, rehearsal, and execution.  The programs in this project are developing and testing innovative, secure architectures and tools to enhance information processing, dissemination, and presentation capabilities.  These will provide the commander with insight into the disposition of enemy and friendly forces, a joint situational awareness picture that will improve planning, decision-making, and execution, secure multimedia information interfaces, and software assurance to the warfighter "on the move."

                                    <r2:Description>The Resilient Command and Control (RC2) program developed a general framework and set of critical mission assurance capabilities to enable Commanders and their staffs to manage the array of C2 systems and architectures (sensor, communications, and information processing) used to conduct operations.  These adaptive, resilient C2 resource planning and re-planning capabilities enabled mission success in the face of C2 system outages.  Specific technologies developed under RC2 included advanced analysis, visualization, and planning tools that provided Commanders and their staffs with a dashboard to enhance situation awareness of the C2 architectures and understand the mission impact of outages.  The RC2 tools and technologies enabled operators to detect anomalous behavior via intuitive information displays; assess business function impact, including second- and third-order effects; and re-plan how the system can be used to achieve organizational goals and priorities.  A transition plan was developed with the Navy PEO C4I Maritime Tactical Command and Control program.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The success of military operations depends on timely, reliable, secure, and synchronized dissemination of command and control and relevant situational awareness information to every military echelon.  While wired communications and networks are fairly well developed, providing assured high-bandwidth mobile wireless capabilities that match or exceed commercial wired infrastructure is needed to meet the demands of military users.  The goal of the Information Integration Systems project is to develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide effective communications to U.S. forces.  Approaches to this goal include developing technologies that increase network capacity and scaling, enhance spectrum efficiency in congested spectrum, tolerate network degradation, provide man-made and natural electromagnetic interference mitigation, defeat network reconnaissance and surveillance, counter denial of service and other threats, and autonomously move relevant information from the cloud to the edge.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Communications Under Extreme RF Spectrum Conditions (CommEx)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Communications Under Extreme RF Spectrum Conditions (CommEx) program will develop signal detection and reasoning technology that will allow radios to recognize interference and jamming attacks and then adapt to maintain communications, even in the presence of cognitive jammer attacks and dynamic interference of multiple cognitive network interactions.  The program will develop models of adversary, commercial, and friendly cognitive radios and implement those models in a reasoner that assesses, in real time, the current and future dynamics of the communications network.  Core technologies for operation in highly dynamic and/or high jamming to signal environments will be developed to include: automated jamming waveform forensics; local environment assessment (time, space, frequency, polarization); technologies for addressing known attack strategies and interference properties; and antenna, signal processing, modulation, and network optimization technologies.  Based on predictions of the level of communication success compared to mission communication requirements, the reasoner within the cognitive radio will choose waveform selections/configurations that best achieve mission objectives.  The reasoner will include the capability to analyze and select optimum frequency, waveform, and network configurations during all aspects of a mission.  The design effort will lead to new radio communication architectures, more robust radio communication networking, and better understanding of selection amongst interference avoidance and interference suppression strategies.  This program also seeks to enable communication between dispersed and distributed emitters and receivers to provide a multiplier in capacity for both locating emitters and assessing effectiveness of an electronic attack.  The CommEx technology is planned for transition to the U.S. Army, Air Force, and Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Computational Leverage Against Surveillance Systems (CLASS)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Commercial Test and Measurement equipment has advanced greatly with the emergence of sophisticated cellular and wireless local area network technology and can be used to intercept, analyze and exploit our military communications signals.  The Computational Leverage Against Surveillance Systems (CLASS) program seeks new ways to protect our signals from exploitation by increasingly sophisticated adversaries and to do so in a way that can be maintained as commercial technology advances.  Three different techniques are being developed: 1) Waveform Complexity uses advanced communications waveforms that are difficult to recover without knowledge and understanding of the signals itself; 2) Spatial Diversity uses distributed communications devices and the communication environment to disguise and dynamically vary the apparent location of the signal; 3) Interference Exploitation makes use of the clutter in the signal environment to make it difficult for an adversary to isolate a particular signal.  The objective of the program is to make modular communications technology that is inexpensive to incorporate in existing and emerging radio systems (&lt;$100 incremental cost) but pushes adversaries to need more than 1,000x our processing power - supercomputer-level processing power.  Another track of the program will extend the CLASS technology to provide Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) communications.  These techniques will reduce the detectability of communications signals by a factor of 1,000x beyond current capabilities.  Scalable performance will allow LPI techniques to better trade information rate for communications capacity.  Technologies from this program are planned to transfer to the U.S. Army (for ground system applications) and to USAF (for airborne applications).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The CBMEN program's goal is to provide tactical warfighters operating at the edge with interactive, on-demand access to relevant information and a greater ability for real-time sharing of new operational content.  This content can include images, video, maps, situational awareness, and command and control information.  Advances in communications technologies are enabling high-capacity communications to the edge.  However, the current centralized or regional storage and dissemination of information presents reliability and capacity challenges with distributing relevant information to users at the edge.  Commercial industry has developed approaches to the autonomous dissemination of high demand information by using distributed servers and advanced networking and information database technologies, combined with highly-reliable fixed networking infrastructure with embedded complex information exploitation tools.  The commercial system is enabled by infrastructure (e.g. fiber optic networks) that is not available to the warfighter at the edge.  This program will leverage commercial technologies to develop, prototype, and demonstrate the networking technologies and information dissemination techniques needed to enable efficient and robust content distribution using dynamic, mobile, ad hoc military networks.  CBMEN will be installed and demonstrated on existing radios.  Capabilities from this effort will transition to the DoD.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Communications requirements are growing exponentially due to the proliferation of high-data rate sensors (full motion video), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and the emergence of the Soldier/Marine as both an operator and a sensor within military networks.  However, limited spectrum availability results in a large disparity between capacity need and availability.  Mobile Hotspots will develop an airborne high capacity data distribution network to interconnect groups of tactical users in a manner that is conceptually similar to the commercial tiered approach interconnecting cell towers and wireless hotspots.  Mobile Hotspots will exploit advances in millimeter-wave technology and airborne networking to develop a self-organizing, 1 Gbps mobility backbone formed from highly-directional communications links to interconnect mounted and dismounted warfighters, dispersed tactical operations centers, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets.  Low size, weight and power designs will be integrated with commercial and military communications equipment and mounted on tactical UAVs and ground vehicles to provide network access to mobile users via infrastructureless hotspots that are compatible with existing radios.  The Mobile Hotspots program is targeted to transition to the Army and Marine Corps Expeditionary Forces.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Wireless Network after Next (WNaN) and Advanced Wireless Networks for the Soldier (AWNS) program goals are to develop and demonstrate technologies and system concepts that will enable densely deployed radio networks to compensate for limitations of the physical layer of a low-cost wireless node.  WNaN/AWNS networks will manage node configurations and the topology of the network to reduce the demands on the physical and link layers of the network.  The technology created by the WNaN/AWNS effort will provide reliable and available battlefield communications at low system cost.  This program will also improve the hardware, firmware, and software to allow the integration of the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) for backward interoperability to legacy communication systems.  AWNS is also investigating the integration of Multi-User Detection (MUD) and Multiple-Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology into the WNaN radio platform to position these technologies for transition into the WNaN radio node.  In addition, this effort will investigate Wireless Distributive Computing (WDC), Content Based Access (CBA), and smart antenna technology to enhance the network and node ability to understand the operating environment, mission concept of operations, and node responsibilities to assist in data processing, information dissemination, and accomplishment of military mission objectives.  In addition, this program will develop a low-cost handheld/body wearable wireless node that can be used to form high-density ad hoc networks and gateways to the Global Information Grid.  This program will also develop robust networking architecture(s) and network technologies/processes that will exploit high-density node configurations.  AWNS technology is planned for transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Unlike commercial wireless communications, the military cannot count on a set of secure, fixed cell towers to establish wireless networks capable of receiving and distributing large amounts of data from distributed sources.  Rather, such communication must rely on approaches such as balloons and temporary communication towers that have a high logistical burden and are extremely vulnerable.  Building upon technologies investigated under other programs in this project, the Fixed Wireless at a Distance program will overcome these limitations by developing a re-locatable, long-range (10-100s of km) communication infrastructure that provides high-capacity (10s of megabits per second) data links from within a protected space.  The key innovation in this program is the use of a large number of rapidly deployable, distributed, ground-based antenna arrays that can form a coherent aperture for directional transmission and reception of information to/from tactical wireless networks.  Program challenges include the fundamental limits (power and extent) of transmitter gain as well as the rapid and practical deployment of the ground-based arrays.  When completed, the Fixed Wireless at a Distance program will extend the reach of tactical communication systems by 10X without the need for vulnerable and costly infrastructure.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>One of the key advantages on the battlefield is the ability to actively sense and manipulate the radio frequency (RF) environment, enabling reliable and assured communications, as well as effectively mapping and manipulating the adversary's communications in ways that defy their situational awareness, understanding, or response.  Current approaches are emitter-based, with the signal processing techniques focused on array and time-based processing for each emitter.  As the RF environment becomes more complex and cluttered, the number of collection assets and the required level of signal processing inhibits our capability to pervasively sense and manipulate at the precision (time, frequency, and space) required for effective action.  To address these and other shortfalls, the Advanced RF Mapping program will develop and demonstrate new concepts for sensing and manipulating the RF environment based on distributed rather than centralized collection.  This approach will take advantage of the proliferation of RF devices, such as radios and cell phones, on the battlefield.  To leverage these existing devices effectively, the program will develop new algorithms that can map the RF environment with minimal communication load between devices.  It will also develop approaches to exploit our precise knowledge of the RF environment and the distributed proximity of RF devices to provide reliable and assured communications for our warfighter as well as to infiltrate or negate our adversaries' communications networks.  Building upon technologies investigated within other programs in this project, the Advanced RF Mapping program will enable both offensive and defensive operations in complex RF environments.  Advanced RF Mapping technology is planned to transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Scalable Millimeter-wave (MMW) Architectures for Reconfigurable Transceivers (SMART) program, last funded in FY 2010, developed a new technology for producing very thin millimeter-wave array apertures and transceivers.  The technology development culminated in the demonstration of a large-sized coherent, active electronically-steerable array (AESA) with an output power density of 5W per square cm and a total layer thickness of less than 1cm.  The SMART technology approach resulted in a breakthrough in performance over conventional millimeter-wave approaches.  The 3-D multi-layer assemblies developed will greatly reduce AESA packaging complexity and enable very compact, low-cost, millimeter-wave, and radio frequency circuit "building blocks" to combine to form arbitrarily large arrays.  New capabilities, such as the ability to construct reconfigurable and/or multi-band AESAs and other MMW circuits, will be enabled by this architectural approach.

The SMART program is transitioning through industrial producers of MMW radar and communication system components for DoD applications.  Additional funding in FY 2013 and FY 2014 is budgeted to facilitate this transitional work to move beyond laboratory demonstrations to a manufacturing environment consistent with high yield, volume capability, and advanced readiness levels while maintaining performance.  An additional goal is to demonstrate the ability to adapt to system-level requirements as obtained from applications such as air-to-air and satellite communications at MMW frequencies, such as serial addressable arrays and large aperture assembly.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The increasing proliferation of video, voice, chat, and other important data-streams on the battlefield is driving a need for higher capacity, reliable, assured, and all-weather communications that are deployable on a wide range of air, ground, and maritime platforms.  The goal of this program is to demonstrate a 100 Gigabit-per-second (Gb/s) radio frequency (RF) backbone that will meet the anticipated mid-term (within 3-10 years) wireless networking requirements of deployed military forces.  DARPA's hybrid Free Space Optical Experimental Network Experiment (FOENEX) system has broken the 10 Gb/s wireless network boundary using free-space optical links, but all-weather Ku band components are currently limited to much less than 1Gb/s capacity.  Furthermore, the hybrid optical/RF system exhibits size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) characteristics that preclude deployment on many SWaP-limited platforms.  Moving to a millimeter-wave (mmW) solution will provide high capacity as well as all-weather resiliency, yet presents technical challenges that include the generation of higher-order waveforms (beyond common data link), efficient power transmission, high-speed routing, and low-noise receivers.  This program will develop the constituent subsystems (waveform generation, efficient power amplifiers, and receivers) and spatial multiplexing architectures to construct an all-weather mmW 100 Gbps backbone at half the size, weight and power consumption of the current FOENEX system.  The 100 Gbps RF Backbone program is intended for transition to multiple Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Current Presidential Initiatives, FCC Broadband Task Force, and Congressional legislation are working to transition large swaths of spectrum (up to 500 MHz) from Federal (DoD is the primary contributor) to civilian use for broadband telecommunications.  The DoD will need more data/sensor capacity over the next decades and will therefore need new technology to operate with less spectrum.  The objective of this program is to investigate improvements in spectral reuse (spectrum sharing of sensor/radar bands).  The program will leverage technical trends in cooperative sharing to exploit radar anti-jam and interference mitigation technologies that could enable spectrum sharing by allowing overlay of communications within the same spectral footprint.  The approach will include exploring real-time control data links between radars and communications systems, and developing the advanced waveforms and components to enable radars and communication networks to operate in close proximity.  The ultimate goal is to turn the DoD spectrum loss into a net gain of up to hundreds of MHz in capacity. Technology from this program will be made available to the DoD.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Military Networking Protocol (MNP) program creates architectures, protocols and network controllers to enhance security and operation of networks.  MNP technologies enforce user authentication, manage network traffic, and automatically configure networks.  By enforcing user authentication, military network protocols provide full attribution of every device and track each device's network packets to provide full attribution down to the individual source of bad/erroneous data or malicious activity.  MNP prioritization schemes will be controlled by various echelons to address changing mission requirements.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Optical &amp; RF Combined Link Experiment (ORCLE) program combined radio frequency (RF) and free space optical (FSO) communications as well as networking technologies that exploit the benefits of complementary path diversity.  This effort encompassed the extension of research into the FSO/RF Internet Protocol-based Network system, called Optical RF Communications Adjunct (ORCA).  Using optical and RF communication techniques, ORCLE improved battlespace communications using a hybrid RF and FSO link in air-to-air-to-ground environments.  The central challenge was to enable optical communications bandwidth without giving up RF reliability, regardless of the weather.  ORCLE developed RF and FSO propagation channel analysis, coding techniques, and modeling to include weather, atmospherics, and aero-optics to provide the joint force commander assured high-data rate communications.  The technical objective was to prototype and flight demonstrate hybrid FSO/RF air-to-air-to-ground links that combine the best attributes of both technologies and simulate hybrid network performance.  The ORCLE technology is transitioning to the Air Force and Navy.</r2:Description>

Current cyber defenses are primarily based on network and host intrusion detection and look for break-ins and abnormal behavior without context.  The CINDER program will build tools and techniques that apply mission templates of advanced cyber espionage onto seemingly normal internal system and network activity.  The program focuses on identifying ongoing adversary missions rather than a person, program, or particular piece of malware.  Through this CINDER will uncover ongoing advanced persistent cyber threats and espionage within our cyber environments.  Capabilities from this program will transition to DoD and the defense industrial base.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Network-Centric Warfare Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts.  It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission.  The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system.

The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are:  (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  

The Maritime Systems project will identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Naval forces play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly increased capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents using systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often co-located and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System (HELLADS)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>This program builds upon the past achievements of the High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System (HELLADS) development program and the Aero-Adaptive Aero-Optic Beam Control (ABC) program, budgeted in DARPA PE 0602702E, Project TT-06.  The goal of the HELLADS program is to develop a high-energy laser weapon system that will provide an order of magnitude reduction in weight compared to existing laser systems.  HELLADS will enable high-energy lasers (HELs) to be integrated onto tactical aircraft and will significantly increase engagement ranges compared to ground-based systems, in addition to enabling high precision/low collateral damage and rapid engagement of fleeting targets for both offensive and defensive missions.  Advancements in beam control and other subsystems that are required for the practical integration of a laser weapon into existing tactical platforms will be explored.  With the assistance of the Services, the HELLADS program will pursue the necessary analysis, coordination, and design activity for a prototype laser weapon system incorporating the HELLADS laser system and the ABC turret into air, ground, or sea-based tactical vehicles.  While the prototype laser weapon system module is in design and development, the HELLADS 150 kilowatt (kW) laser will be made available for demonstration opportunities and transition to the Army and Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Legged Squad Support System (LS3) program will explore the development of a mission-relevant quadruped platform scaled to unburden the infantry squad and hence unburden the soldier.  In current operations, soldiers carry upwards of 50lbs of equipment, in some cases over 100lbs, over long distances in terrain not always accessible by wheeled platforms that support infantry.  As a result, the soldier's combat effectiveness can be compromised.  The LS3 program will design and develop prototypes capable of carrying 400lbs of payload for 20 miles in 24 hours, negotiating terrain at endurance levels expected of typical squad maneuvers.  LS3 will leverage technical breakthroughs of prior biologically inspired legged platform development efforts.  It will develop system designs to the scale and performance adequate for infantry squad mission applications, focusing on platform, control, and human-machine interaction capabilities, as well as secondary design considerations, such as acoustic signature.  Anticipated service users include the Army, Marines, and Special Forces.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Robotics Olympics 

Advancements are being made in land-capable, high degree-of-freedom unmanned platforms to enable mobility over complex terrain.  Many current prototypes are inspired by biological systems and while proof-of-principle systems have or are demonstrating unprecedented mobility, limitations have emerged.  Advanced capabilities in perception, control, and physical capability/coordination are needed to work autonomously in human environments.  These are critical enablers for performing mission-relevant tasks in austere and remote regions, partially-destroyed roads, high-threat anti-access/area denied environments, rubble-filled areas, and providing greater range/endurance for soldiers, platforms, and personnel.

The Robotics Challenge program will boost innovation in autonomous systems and expand platform utility through enhanced actuation, energy density, perception, locomotion, agile reconfiguration, and design efficiency.  Program thrusts are centered on a progressive regimen of physical problem solving, real-time team oriented tasks, and dynamic adaptation designed to build "machine trust", especially when integrated with humans in a variety of operational environments.  The Robotics Challenge program consists of a series of obstacle course style challenge events that will focus on technology solutions to demonstrate and test robot capabilities for disaster response.  Robotics Challenge events will drive advances in power systems, agility and speed, precision in perception tied to platform coordination, dexterity, and impulsive power.  Program objectives focus on technologies to expand mobility and extend endurance of unmanned platforms, advanced tactile and manipulation capabilities, and tools for cost effective design, validation, and construction of autonomous technology, and human-robot interaction.  The 6.2 portion of this program is budgeted in PE 0602702E project TT-04.  Anticipated Service users include the Army, Marines, and Special Forces.</r2:Description>

Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The diesel-electric submarine is an asymmetric threat in terms of its cost and consequential growth in numbers relative to our legacy maritime platforms.  In addition, these submarines have trended toward lower acoustic signature levels, and have grown in lethality.  The Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program intends to reverse the asymmetric advantage of this threat through the development of advanced standoff sensing from unmanned systems.  Deep ocean sonar nodes will operate at significant depths in open ocean areas to achieve large fields of view to detect submarines overhead.  Each deep node is the maritime equivalent of a satellite, and is referred to as a subullite.  The significant field of view, along with the advantage of low-noise phenomena at extreme depths will permit a scalable number of collaborative sensor platforms to detect and track submarines over large areas.  For the vast shallow continental shelf areas, the program similarly adopts distributed mobile sensors, but instead leverages insights in non-acoustic sensing from above.  The effort is highly focused on achieving new detection modalities with sufficient low power, weight, and size, to enable UAV implementations.  Initial efforts will focus on identifying the best detection methods leveraged from state-of-the-art sensors and new physical and operational insights.  From this work, prototype systems will evolve through at-sea testing and sensor integration.  The program will achieve breakthrough technology for long-range detection and classification, communications, energy management, sensor and platform integration, and robust semiautonomous processing and control for distributed sensing platforms.  This program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Structural Logic program is developing platform structures and frames that can adapt to varying loads and simultaneously exhibit both high stiffness and high damping.  This program will demonstrate the utility of negative stiffness structural elements developed under the Multifunctional Materials and Structures program, budgeted in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-01, in the ridged support frames of real world DoD platforms.  As the demands on military platforms increase, so does the need for structures to mitigate the shock and vibrations applied by dynamic environments.  Today's structures exhibit limited adaptability and typically achieve either extreme stiffness or damping.  In military platforms, extremely stiff structures provide high strength, but readily transfer loads to passengers often resulting in serious injury.  Conversely, existing damping structures can reduce the load transferred to passengers, but only at the expense of structural strength and integrity.  By demonstrating the ability to combine stiffness, damping, and dynamic range in a single structure, the Structural Logic program will enable the design of military platforms with the ability to continually adapt their properties to match the demands of a dynamic environment.  Technology from this program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Increasing requirements for missions in shallow littoral waters have created a need for a survivable and cost-effective capability to perform intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, antisubmarine warfare, special operations forces, and other missions in the littorals.  Today we risk manned submarines in waters that are shallower than the length of our hulls and we pit these high value assets against diesel electric submarines that in some cases pose an overmatching threat against our systems in these shallow waters.  The Unmanned/Minimally-manned Underwater Vehicle (UMUV) program will develop a vehicle specifically designed to operate in the littoral battlespace with the capability of performing littoral missions that span a wide range of complexity and can be performed with a small manned crew or autonomously (i.e., unmanned) depending upon mission requirements.  The UMUV will have the autonomy, range and endurance to drive to the fight from a safe basing location, will be capable of carrying the full range of payloads that are needed to support operational needs in littoral waters, and will provide the capability to perform missions where risk to personnel limits our willingness to execute these missions.  The program will explore low-cost derivatives of commercial underwater vehicles, the integration of advanced communication and sensor technologies, and the teaming of the UMUV with manned systems.  The UMUV program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Sensors Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability and battle damage assessment.  

The Surveillance and Countermeasures Technology project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems.  Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with tactical information needed to succeed in future wars.  Additionally, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats.  

The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor processing technologies and systems necessary for the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) mission.  The project is primarily driven by four needs:  1) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; 2) countering camouflage, concealment and deception of mobile ground targets; 3) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near real-time; and 4) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control, tracking, timely engagement and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.

The Exploitation Systems project develops algorithms, software, and information processing systems to extract information from massive intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) datasets.  In particular, it develops new technologies for detection and discrimination of targets from clutter, classification and fingerprinting of high value targets, localization and tracking over wide areas, and threat network identification and analysis.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Adaptable Navigation Systems (ANS)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Adaptable Navigation Systems (ANS) program will provide the U.S. warfighter with the ability to navigate effectively in all environments, including when Global Positioning System (GPS) is unavailable due to hostile action (jamming) or blockage by structures, foliage, or other environmental obstacles.  The ANS approach relies on two major technology innovations.  The first is the use of Signals of Opportunity (SoOp) from a variety of ground, air, and space-based sources.  These will be received on the Services' forthcoming software-defined radios and will use specially tailored algorithms to determine position.  The second technology innovation allows SoOp-based position information to be combined with inertial and other sensors to enable flexible navigation systems that can be reconfigured in the field to support any platform or environment.  While component technology for positioning, navigation, and timing is advancing rapidly (in the form of Micro Electro-Mechanical System devices, clocks, and new aiding sensors), real-time integration and reconfiguration of these components is not possible given today's navigation filters and centralized processing architectures, which are inherently fragile to change.  Recent advances in mathematics, data abstraction, and network architectures could enable "plug-and-play" integration of both existing and future navigation components to allow real-time integration and reconfiguration of navigation systems.  If successful, major improvements in navigation accuracy and system cost could also be realized.  Early transition partners would include all Services, with emphasis on platforms and users that must operate in multiple environments.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Adaptable, Low Cost Sensors</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The objective of the Adaptable, Low Cost Sensor program is to leverage commercial technology and commercial manufacturing techniques to improve the development time and significantly reduce the cost of sensors and sensor systems.  Military sensors are currently developed as unique designs that fully integrate mission specific hardware required for sensing, with all of the other non-mission specific capabilities, including supporting sensors (GPS), processing, memory storage and communications into a single device.  Not only does this approach significantly increase the cost of the device, it makes changing requirements and the upgrading of any specific component extremely difficult.  Commercial processes, such as those used in the smart phone industry, create reference designs for common system functions and features to accelerate system development time, and make it easier to change requirements and upgrade capability.  Adopting commercial processes makes it possible to create a mission-independent, designed-to-cost "commercial smart core" that can be combined with an appliqué of mission-specific hardware to provide the overall sensor system.  The core can be upgraded independently of any particular sensor; sensors can make use of the advances and decreasing cost that is inherent in commercial technology.  Commercial technology can be used in the core and commercial development and manufacturing techniques can also be leveraged to further improve the cost and development time of sensor systems.  In addition, this program will enable effective distributed sensor systems that were previously infeasible due to high cost of individual sensors.  The Smart Munitions effort will use ADAPT's sensing, processing, communications, and location capabilities to provide positive identification and man-in-the-loop control of distributed unattended ground sensor systems.  The Smart Munitions effort will develop a reference design used to demonstrate capability and develop tactics for unattended sensors.  This program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

The Multi-Function Optical Sensing program will provide an alternative approach to detecting, tracking, and performing non-cooperative target identification, as well as providing fire control for fighter class and long-range strike aircraft.  This program leverages emerging high-sensitivity focal plane array (FPA) and compact, multiband laser systems technology in the near/mid/long-wave infrared bands to enable the development of a multi-function optical system.  Technical challenges include the demonstration of inexpensive, multiband, large-format, photon-counting, high-bandwidth receivers and their integration into a multi-optical sensor suite compatible with airborne assets.  The Multi-Function Optical Sensor program will result in an airborne system that can detect, geolocate, and identify targets at standoff ranges.  Technologies from this program will transition into the Services.</r2:Description>

This program developed techniques to inject and recover probing radar waveforms and unravel the complicated multipath in the return signals to enable the mapping and characterization of building interiors.  Radar signals were used to image static structures directly.  Doppler processing of radar signals was also exploited to find, identify, and perform feature-aided tracking of moving personnel within a building and allow mapping of building pathways and stairways by monitoring traffic through buildings.  Multipath and propagation effects were modeled and iteratively compared with hypotheses of building structures to provide 3-D building maps and large concentrations of metal materials like weapons.  Technologies developed under this program have been made available to the Army and U.S. SOCOM for transition.</r2:Description>

Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery.  The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.  The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Behavioral Learning for Adaptive Electronic Warfare (BLADE) program will develop the capability to jam adaptive and rapidly evolving radio frequency (RF) threats in tactical environments and at tactically-relevant timescales.  This will change the paradigm for responding to evolving threats from lab-based manual development to an adaptive in-the-field systems approach.  When an unknown or advanced RF threat appears, BLADE networked nodes will dynamically characterize the emitter, synthesize an effective countering technique, and evaluate jamming effectiveness by iteratively probing, learning, and adapting to the threat.  An optimization process will tailor near-real-time responses to specific threats, producing a countermeasure waveform that maximizes jam effectiveness while minimizing the required jamming resources.  Thus BLADE will enable the rapid defeat of new RF threats and provide the warfighter with real-time feedback on jam effectiveness.  The program is planned for transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Previously part of Behavioral Learning for Adaptive Electronic Warfare (BLADE)

The goal of the Adaptive Radar Countermeasures (ARC) program is to provide effective electronic countermeasure (ECM) techniques against new or unknown threat radars.  Current airborne electronic warfare (EW) systems rely on the ability to uniquely identify a threat radar system to apply an appropriate preprogrammed countermeasure (CM) technique which can take many months to develop.  Countering radar systems is increasingly challenging as digitally programmed radars exhibit novel behaviors and agile waveform characteristics.  ARC will develop new processing techniques and algorithms that adapt in real-time to generate suitable countermeasures.  Using techniques such as state modeling, machine learning, and system probing, ARC will learn the behavior of the threat system, then choose and implement an appropriate countermeasure strategy.  ARC technologies will transition to the U.S. Air Force and Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Military Imaging and Surveillance Technology (MIST) program will develop a fundamentally new optical Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that can provide high-resolution 3-D images to locate and identify a target at much longer ranges than is possible with existing optical systems.  Several prototype optical surveillance and observation systems will be developed that will: (1) demonstrate probabilities of recognition and identification at distances sufficient to allow stand-off engagement; (2) overcome atmospheric turbulence, which now limits the ability of high-resolution optics; and (3) increase target identification confidence to reduce fratricide and/or collateral damage.  The program will develop and integrate the necessary component technologies including high-energy pulsed lasers, receiver telescopes that have a field of view and depth of field that obviates the need for steering or focusing the optical system, computational imaging algorithms to improve system resolution, and data exploitation and analysis tools.  Advances in laser systems, digital imagers, and novel image processing algorithms will be leveraged to reduce the overall size, weight and power of imaging systems to allow for soldier portable and UAV platform integration.  MIST will also continue to integrate technologies developed under the Crosswind Sensor System for Snipers (C-WINS) and the Dynamic Image Gunsight Optics (DInGO) efforts.  MIST will develop an optical rifle scope that enables a soldier, with minimal training, to shoot a firearm with marksman accuracy at range while also enhancing the capability for close quarters combat.  The MIST program will transition the optical ISR technology to the Air Force, and SOCOM.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Multifunction RF (MFRF) program initially developed a helicopter pilot performance enhancement system for landing in degraded visual environments (DVE) such as dust clouds.  Beyond landing aids in DVE, RF-based sensors can also be used for additional situational awareness, such as near ground obstacle avoidance, air-to-air collision avoidance, targeting/fire control, as well as many other combat support activities.  Building on advancements made with RF sensors under this program, the program will further seek to eliminate many redundant RF elements of current independently-developed systems for landing in DVEs, terrain avoidance, obstacle avoidance, and targeting/fire control.  This will reduce the overall weight, power usage, cost, and profusion of subsystems and exterior antennas on military aircraft, thus enabling greater mission capability with reduced vehicle system integration burden.  Transition is planned to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Recent conflicts have demonstrated the need for close air support by precision attack platforms such as the AC-130J or the MH-60 class helicopters in support of ground forces.  Under clear conditions, targets are easily-identified and engaged quite effectively, but in degraded environments the atmosphere is not always clear, and inhibits traditional optical sensors.  The AC-130J must fly above cloud decks in order to avoid anti-aircraft fire, and this negates optical targeting sensors.  Similarly, rotary/wing blades in urban operations generate copious amounts of dust that block circling assets from supplying cover fire for ground forces.  The Video-rate Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) program will develop a real-time spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging sensor that will provide imagery of a region to allow high-resolution fire direction in conditions where optical sensors do not function.  Technology from this program is planned to transition to AFSOC.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Advanced Airborne Optical Sensing</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Advanced Airborne Optical Sensing program is developing electro-optical and infrared sensors and processing technologies for aerial platforms.  Significant challenges have arisen as the result of two warfighting trends.  First, the ever-changing mix of airborne platforms now includes a greater number of smaller UAVs.  Second, the target set is increasingly challenging and now includes vehicles and individual dismounts that operate under foliage and in urban canyons, using camouflage, obscurants, and other means of concealment.  In response to these challenges, the Advanced Airborne Optical Sensing program has developed enhanced optical, electro-optical, photonic and other technologies for airborne optical sensing systems.  Specific examples of these technologies include: embedded image processors tailored to real-time detection, identification, and tracking of military targets; advanced laser radar technologies; hyper-spectral sensing technologies; flash detection and underwater object detection; advanced digital signal processing to support onboard image reconstruction, atmospheric correction, and system calibration; and adaptive optics techniques, such as deformable mirrors and liquid crystal spatial light modulators.  The program has extended these technologies and is making them practical for airborne surveillance systems. The remaining effort in this program is the HALOE (High Altitude Lidar Operations Experiment) program which has demonstrated, in an operational environment, the full capability of a 3-D imaging system.  The HALOE system provides support for current and emerging warfighter needs by delivering high-resolution, wide-area 3-D lidar imagery data in the Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) environment.  This system provides the unprecedented capability to collect accurate, high resolution 3-D data over wide areas to support a wide range of high-value applications, including detailed mission planning, vertical obstruction detection, helicopter landing zone analysis, and imagery geolocation.  The pathway to accomplish this goal includes improving the robustness and reliability of the sensor, conducting demonstrations, and training with CONUS flight tests leading to OCONUS operational experimentation in partnership with the Army.

HALOE successfully completed the CONUS flight testing phase and was deployed OCONUS for further testing and system checkout to address current and emerging needs of U.S. forces under the direction of commanders in theater during 2011.  The completed HALOE system will transition to the U.S. Army.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Autonomous Real-time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance (ARGUS) program developed airborne sensor systems that provide a persistent, real-time, high-resolution, wide-area, day-night video surveillance capability.  The ARGUS Infrared System (ARGUS-IR) uses an advanced infrared (IR) composite focal plane array (FPA) sensor.  The nighttime persistent capability provided by ARGUS-IR combined with the daytime capability provided by the ARGUS Imaging System (ARGUS-IS) enables 24-hour day/night surveillance.  ARGUS-IR's wide-area, high-update-rate, high-resolution imaging capability enables detection and tracking of dismounts as well as vehicles.  ARGUS-IR utilizes the signal/image processor developed as part of ARGUS-IS, enabling ARGUS-IS and ARGUS-IR to be combined on a common platform.  ARGUS-IR must overcome a number of demanding technical challenges related to the IR FPA and size, weight, and power constraints for the IR sensor.  A transition plan is being developed with the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Exploitation Systems project develops algorithms, software, and information processing systems to extract information from massive intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) datasets.  In particular, it develops new technologies for detection and discrimination of targets from clutter, classification and fingerprinting of high value targets, localization and tracking over wide areas, and threat network identification and analysis.  Efforts will focus on difficult ISR environments, for example (a) urban environments with extensive building obscuration, large volumes of civilian traffic, and feature-rich terrain, (b) mountain environments with highly variable terrain elevation, complex local and regional threat networks, and predominantly dismounted adversaries, (c) jungle environments with targets under heavy canopy, animals, and other sources of clutter masking human activity, and (d) maritime and littoral environments where threats now include terrorists, pirates, smugglers, drug traffickers, and other non-traditional adversaries.  The resulting technology will enable operators to more effectively use ISR data in the execution of wide area search, border and road monitoring, high value target tracking, overwatch, and other missions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Insight is developing the next generation multi-intelligence (multi-INT) exploitation and resource management system.  Insight provides new exploitation capabilities through an integrated, standards-based system that is designed for mission flexibility and cross-theater applicability.  Insight will enable detection of threat networks through combination and analysis of information from imaging and non-imaging sensors and other sources.  The technical approach emphasizes model-based correlation, adversary behavior modeling, threat network analysis tools, resource management tools, a unified data management and processing environment, novel exploitation algorithms and analysis methodologies, and tools to integrate human and machine processing, including visualization, hypothesis manipulation, on-line learning, and distributed social intelligence.  Insight development activities leverage both virtual and physical test bed environments.  The virtual test bed enables evaluation of alternative sensor mixes and algorithms under extended operating conditions.

                                    <r2:Description>The Worldwide Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (WISR) system will provide ISR capability in denied areas.  The U.S. military has limited capability to obtain airborne ISR observations of many critical problem areas, and overhead observations are limited by sensor resolution, collection timeline, and platform geometry.  However, millions of videos posted worldwide reflect events and areas of interest for national security, and the number is rapidly increasing.  WISR will use ground-level video and still images to produce 3-D and 4-D reconstructions of events and use these reconstructions to code descriptions of dynamic content, rather than focusing on the identification and movement of individual objects and humans in the scene.  WISR constructs will be suitable for describing and differentiating patterns-of-life to reflect local and societal changes. The program will use this data in support of three missions: intelligence preparation for expeditionary forces entering a new area of operation, reconstruction of significant events worldwide, and battle damage assessment. These techniques will transition to operational commands and the intelligence community.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Multi-Sensor Exploitation program provided multi-sensor exploitation capabilities enabling missions such as overwatch, border surveillance, high value target tracking, and threat network detection using mixes of imaging, radar, signals, human intelligence, and other sources.  New processing techniques for hyperspectral imaging sensors enabled long duration tracking of vehicles and dismounts.  Scalable stochastic modeling and inference techniques yielded improved situation awareness and assessment for wide-area electro-optical/IR motion imaging, radar, and multi-sensor exploitation applications in settings where large numbers of interacting entities engaged in complex activities are observed over long periods of time.  The techniques are intended for use in riverine and maritime environments, where extremist and criminal groups threaten political stability, trade routes, and free commerce, map navigable tributary systems, detect and identify threats, and monitor their activity.  Potential transition partners include USAFRICOM, USSOUTHCOM, USSOCOM, and intelligence agencies.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Foliage Penetrating Radar Planning and Exploitation program developed and integrated exploitation capabilities that find and track dismounted targets in densely forested terrain.  Current foliage penetrating radar systems provide an important capability for detecting dismount targets under foliage, but the systems also detect animals, moving water, blowing trees, and other scene clutter moving under or in the foliage that make situation assessment manpower and radar resource intensive.  This program addressed these issues by (1) developing algorithms that exploit Doppler signature data to classify detections as dismounts, animals, clutter, or vehicles; and (2) developing group tracking software that automatically tracks groups of dismounts and provides an accurate group size ("raid count") to users.  The Doppler discriminator and group tracking software were integrated into a stand-alone exploitation system which provides a significantly improved capability for finding and localizing targets under foliage, as well as providing automatic raid count and human/vehicle/animal/clutter classification.  The program is transitioning to USSOUTHCOM and USSOCOM.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element is budgeted in the Management Support Budget Activity because it funded the building relocation support cost requirements for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).  The move to a new facility was in response to the Department of Defense Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) and Anti-terrorism/Force Protection Requirements Regulation (UFC 4-010-01 dtd 8 Oct 2003, as amended 22 Jan 2007).  The regulation is mandatory for facilities leased for DoD use and applies to all new leases executed on or after 1 Oct 2005 and to renewal or extension of any existing lease on or after 1 Oct 2009.  DARPA's prior leased facility did not meet the UFC standards and the lease extended beyond October 2009.  This Program Element funded all expenses associated with planning and movement of the Agency to its new location.  Initial costs included design and trade studies, costs associated with implementing force protection standards, floor plan layout and planning activities that led up to the move.  Further, it funded outfitting of the selected property with the force protection standards, infrastructure, equipment, and furniture required for the DARPA staff and completion of the move in May 2012.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element is budgeted in the Management Support Budget Activity because it funded the building relocation support cost requirements for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).  The move to a new facility was in response to the Department of Defense Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) and Anti-terrorism/Force Protection Requirements Regulation (UFC 4-010-01 dtd 8 Oct 2003, as amended 22 Jan 2007).  The regulation is mandatory for facilities leased for DoD use and applies to all new leases executed on or after 1 Oct 2005 and to renewal or extension of any existing lease on or after 1 Oct 2009.  DARPA's prior leased facility did not meet the UFC standards and the lease extended beyond October 2009.  This Program Element funded all expenses associated with planning and movement of the Agency to its new location.  Initial costs included design and trade studies, costs associated with implementing force protection standards, floor plan layout and planning activities that led up to the move.  Further, it funded outfitting of the selected property with the force protection standards, infrastructure, equipment, and furniture required for the DARPA staff and completion of the move in May 2012.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Cyber Security Initiative was to revolutionize the Nation's ability to conduct cyber operations by developing a persistent and cost-effective cyber testing environment.  The National Cyber Range (NCR) program developed a network testbed that allows for research experimentation on diverse hardware and software topologies to produce qualitative and quantitative assessments of cyber security research and development programs through a safe, instrumented experimentation environment.  The range is designed to replicate complex, heterogeneous networks.  It will revolutionize cyber testing to enable efficient cyber experimentation and facilitate realistic testing of tools and techniques to enable high fidelity assessments of cyber tools and techniques and the rapid transition of research programs to operations.  This program is available for leverage or use by all Federal Government organizations.</r2:Description>
