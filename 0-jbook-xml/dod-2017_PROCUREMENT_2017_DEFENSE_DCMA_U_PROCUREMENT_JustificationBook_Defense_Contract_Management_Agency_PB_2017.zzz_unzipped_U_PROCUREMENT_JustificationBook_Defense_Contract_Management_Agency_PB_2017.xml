            <proc:Description>Several recent shifts in regulation and DoD direction have caused DCMA to reevaluate the Major Equipment Program and postpone planned activities in FY 2015 and FY 2016.  As such DCMA has requested funding for FY 2017 be rephased for use in FY 2018.  The remaining FY 2015 funding combined with FY 2016 funding will support both 2016 and 2017 planned activities.

The Major Equipment program enables several critical initiatives across the Department supporting information technology asset management, cyber security, and financial improvement and audit readiness.  These efforts directly support regulatory requirements rooted in the 2014/15 NDAA sections 935 and 937, OMB-16-1, SD 527-1 (INFOCON), and DoDI 8531.AA (VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT).  This program is utilized for the purchase of hardware and software products for both IT Enterprise Capability and DCMA Business Mission Area Systems.  This program is primarily supports two main DCMA efforts: Mechanization Of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS) Modernization and the IT Asset and Service Management Platform.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2017 ($.092) DCMA has a requirement to procure replacement passenger carrying vehicles ($.050) in support of DCMA's overseas contract administration operations conducted throughout the world. DCMA is continuing efforts to convert its overseas fleet from owned passenger carrying vehicles to long-term commercial leases where available. With the General Services Administration's (GSA) limited support of leasing vehicle outside of Germany, DCMA will continue to require passenger carrying vehicles procurement authority. The Major Equipment program also enables several critical initiatives across the Department supporting information technology asset management, cyber security, and financial improvement and audit readiness.  These efforts directly support regulatory requirements rooted in the 2014/15 NDAA sections 935 and 937, OMB-16-1, SD 527-1 (INFOCON), and DoDI 8531.AA (VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT).  In FY17 this program is utilized for the purchase of hardware and software products for both IT Enterprise Capability and DCMA Business Mission Area Systems. This program will support two main DCMA efforts ($.042): MOCAS Modernization and the IT Asset and Service Management Platform.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Remarks>DCMA's requirement to procure replacement passenger carrying vehicles supports DCMA's overseas contract management mission.  Currently, DCMA maintains field offices in Germany, the Middle East, and the Pacific Rim requiring such vehicles.  DCMA is continuing to pursue efforts to convert our overseas fleet from owned passenger carrying vehicles to long term commercial leases or leases with the General Services Administration (GSA) where available. GSA vehicle lease services are currently not available outside of Germany; therefore, DCMA continues to require passenger carrying vehicle procurement authority for locations outside of Germany.</proc:Remarks>
