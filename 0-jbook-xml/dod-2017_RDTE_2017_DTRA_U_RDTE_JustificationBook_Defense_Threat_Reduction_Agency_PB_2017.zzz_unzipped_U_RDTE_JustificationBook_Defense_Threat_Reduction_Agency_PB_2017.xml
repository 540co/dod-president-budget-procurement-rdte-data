            <r2:ProgramElementNote>*Project RU title changes from Fundamental Research for Combating WMD to Basic Research for Countering WMD beginning in FY 2017.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Basic Research Initiative funds research across physical, material, engineering, computational, and life sciences directed toward greater knowledge and understanding of the fundamental aspects of observable phenomena associated with weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

The Basic Research Initiative is the Nation’s only basic research program solely dedicated to countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD).  It provides for the discovery and development of basic knowledge by research performers comprised from academia and world-class research institutions in government and industry. This investment helps motivate the scientific community to conduct research benefiting WMD-related defense missions, advancing the body of CWMD knowledge, and improving knowledge of research efforts that benefit nonproliferation, counter proliferation, and consequence management efforts. These efforts are closely coordinated with DTRA’s Chemical and Biological Technologies Department, which executes a basic research program under DoD’s Chemical and Biological Defense Program. 

Each year, program and technical managers conduct formal assessments of the portfolio, leveraging deep S&amp;T expertise within DTRA, as well as from the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group, independent external panel reviews, and other CWMD-focused stakeholders. This coordination facilitates unique, CWMD-relevant basic research while eliminating unintended duplication of effort in the broader defense S&amp;T community.

Descriptions of the technical areas covered in DTRA’s Basic Research Initiative portfolio are provided in the R-2a exhibit.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Basic Research for Countering WMD project as the nation’s only basic research solely dedicated to countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD), is a core strategic investor in future scientific and technological progress across the full spectrum of Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA) CWMD mission areas. This project concentrates on high risk, high-payoff basic research, leveraging world class expertise in academia, government, and industry to increase the foundational body of scientific knowledge supporting DTRA’s Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development projects.  This Initiative aligns with DTRA’s strategic objectives that directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense, and the broader WMD threat reduction community.  The portfolio addresses this guidance through capability enhancements, projects, and Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers. Specifically, they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based and inspired materials for Department of Defense (DoD) applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements.  This project solicits, coordinates, and conducts basic research aligned to five Thrust Areas.  Each Thrust Area Manager coordinates an independently reviewed portfolio of research projects selected for scientific merit, technical quality, and the potential for innovation. 

Thrust Area 1: Science of WMD Sensing and Recognition. This thrust area explores novel methodologies to investigate physical properties of sensitive materials as they interact with phenomena associated with WMD, such as ionizing radiation. This research provides the basis for developing capabilities to discover the presence, identity, and quantity of material or energy in the environment that may be significant, in turn providing the means to develop advanced forensic applications that enable detection, characterization, and attribution, particularly in post-detonation radiative environments.

Thrust Area 2: Network Sciences. This thrust area explores analytical, numerical, computational and other mathematical approaches to model and simulate the behavior of layered, interdependent physical networks affected by WMD. This interdisciplinary, theoretical research provides the basis for developing advanced algorithms and analytical frameworks that accurately predict and depict WMD environments by characterizing impacts and vulnerabilities, representing root causes of cascading failures, and assessing robustness, resilience, restoration, and recovery in varying degrees of disruption.

Thrust Area 3: Science for Protection. This thrust area employs experimental, computational, and theoretical approaches to explore and understand the causal mechanisms and deleterious characteristics of ionizing radiation and the tolerance, response, and resistance characteristics of affected sensitive electronic systems and microorganisms. This research provides the basis for engineering resilient systems and technologies, offering radical improvements to the survivability and performance of mission-critical electronic equipment and personnel in hostile radiative environments.

Thrust Area 4: Science to Defeat WMD. Through experimentation and computational modeling and simulation, this thrust area investigates phenomena associated with penetration physics, shock propagation and turbulence dynamics, and researches novel energetic and reactive materials for defeat of targets containing WMD. This research provides the scientific foundation necessary to develop advanced solutions for: (1) accessing WMD in hardened and deeply buried infrastructure, (2) defeating (non-nuclear) targets with minimal unintended collateral effects, and (3) predicting post-detonation (non-nuclear) weapon effects.

Thrust Area 5: Science to Secure WMD. This thrust area leverages a wide range of scientific and mathematical disciplines to explore phenomena related to physical, biological and chemical interactions with radioactive particles and waveforms. This research provides the technical basis for development of innovative, unconventional applications to improve security oversight and control of WMD materials and facilities and to improve monitoring and surveillance systems related to arms control and nonproliferation.
 
The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 maintains the investment in basic research to keep pace with inflation. The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 balances near term operational needs with future technical developments and capabilities. Reductions to the RDT&amp;E portfolio impacted investment in efforts with lower return on investment, lower customer demand, or that were early in the development cycle.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) WMD Defeat Technologies program element funds the expansion and application of basic scientific knowledge in order to develop novel materials, devices, systems, and methods supporting next generation concepts and technologies that enable advances in weapons of mass destruction (WMD) surveillance, detection, defeat, prevention, nonproliferation, counterproliferation, consequence management, and treaty verification.

This Applied Research portfolio is aligned with strategic planning objectives as well as with science and technology (S&amp;T) investment direction which is established annually by DTRA and the US Strategic Command Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (SCC-WMD). The objectives directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.

The portfolio advances DTRA’s Countering WMD (CWMD) mission by balancing the following imperatives: invest in DTRA’s applied research capabilities and increase the CWMD technology base to maximize future pay-off; capitalize on opportunities to deliver innovative, cost-effective solutions to technical challenges that must be resolved prior to system-specific technology investigations and development; and ensure applied research efforts are directly aligned to mission-specific capability requirements of DTRA, the Military Departments, Combatant Commanders, other DoD and federal agencies, and international partners.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease in FY 2017 from the previous President's Budget submission is due to the net effect of increased investment in this program element for the revitalization of CWMD test capabilities, targeting support, and threat forecasting, combined with the transition of full effects modeling technology from applied research (6.2) to advanced technology development (6.3), and the balancing of near term operational needs with future technical developments and capabilities.  Other reductions were in support of Departmental efficiencies and economic assumptions.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Information Sciences and Applications project develops concepts and technologies in the areas of high-speed information processing, modeling and simulation, signal detection, and data-driven decision analysis in support of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA) technical reachback teams. This project develops and maintains continuously improving collaborative architectures and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and High-yield Explosives (CBRNE) modeling &amp; simulation codes that drive an integrated suite of decision support tools serving the Combatant Commands, other Department of Defense (DoD) agencies, and national and international Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) partners.  This effort also provides management and support of the Threat Reduction Advisory Committee.  The committee is a senior-level Federal Advisory Committee, which provides independent expert advice on CWMD to the Secretary of Defense through the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, and the Assistant Secretary of Defense4 for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Defense Matters.  This effort also funds the Next Generation Nuclear Professionals (NextGen) activities.  This is an outreach effort that encourages collaboration between those currently in the nuclear field and those who are considering entering that field. The effort consists of conferences, working groups, a debate series, publications, international outreach, an online presence, and a Nuclear Scholars effort.

The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment in advanced analytics and modeling and simulation. The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to decreased investment in hazard and effects characterization and technology-driven WMD threat Forecasting.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Detection Technologies mission is to conduct Research, Development, Test, &amp; Evaluation to 1) identify, develop, and exploit signatures associated with nuclear threat enablers such as nuclear expertise, financing, or unique materials to advance U.S. capabilities to detect and interdict such threats; and 2) locate, identify, and track special nuclear material and improve detection factors such as range, time, sensitivity, or accuracy to enhance Service/Special Mission Unit capabilities. These efforts support Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for countering terrorism, counter/nonproliferation, and homeland defense. 

The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the subdivision of Project RF-Detection and Forensics Technologies into Projects RD-Detection Technologies and RF-Forensics Technologies beginning in FY 2016.  The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to reduced investment in radiation detection, nuclear threat detection intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Forensics Technologies project develops post-detonation nuclear forensics technologies providing accurate, rapid and reliable means to collect, analyze, and evaluate prompt data and debris from a nuclear or radiological event in support of exploitation and attribution efforts. These forensics technologies also enable the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and its trusted partners to detect, locate, identify, track, and interdict nuclear and radiological threats, including weapons and material, and enablers to their acquisition and development. In accordance with Department of Defense Directive S-2060.04, DTRA serves as the US Government lead for post-detonation National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) research and development (R&amp;D). As the central NTNF R&amp;D coordinator, DTRA works in consultation with interagency partners to develop and improve ground-based capabilities supporting exploitation and attribution missions.

The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the realignment of nuclear threat detection activities into Project RD-Detection Technologies.  The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 reflects increased investment in nuclear device characterization for forensics and nuclear forensic materials exploitation for attribution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defeat Technologies project develops innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon technologies to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders to deny, disrupt, and defeat adversarial use of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) while minimizing collateral effects. Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of WMD threat materials, an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and the physical and nonphysical support networks enabling both. It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes and selecting technologies for integration into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities. This effort includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, sub-scale test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation Countering WMD (CWMD) capabilities. The project places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials. Technologies with the potential for weapon and capability integration are transitioned to the advanced technology development effort under this project. On a limited basis, technology test data is shared with coalition partners.

The decrease from FY2015 to FY2016 is due to reduced investment in next generation CWMD technologies to balance other priorities.  The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to further reduced investment in next generation CWMD technologies to balance other priorities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Nuclear Survivability project develops innovative technologies for the protection of mission-essential personnel, critical military and national defense capabilities, and associated control and support systems during a nuclear event. Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is designated by the Department of Defense (DoD) as the center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) survivability assessments. The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD’s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. The radiation hardened nano-electronics effort develops and demonstrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD space and strategic system requirements.  Experimental Capabilities activities provide the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and EMP test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment. This effort leverages research from and coordinates with the National Nuclear Security Administration (United States) and the Atomic Weapons Establishment (United Kingdom) to develop enabling technologies for improved nuclear weapon effects experimentation capabilities.  Nuclear Technology Analysis Support provides detailed planning related to policy, strategy, objectives, and programmatic integration. This project also supports international collaboration, user groups, and case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group. The Human Survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects.  

The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the realignment of system vulnerabilities and assessment activities from Project RL-Nuclear &amp; Radiological Effects to Project RI.  The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the net effect of increased investment in system vulnerability and assessment and nuclear weapons effects experimentation and decreased investment in radiation hardening nano-electronics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The WMD Counterforce Technologies Project develops Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) weapon effects modeling algorithms, full and sub-scale test series required to investigate CWMD weapon effects and sensor performance, and visualization and situational awareness tools to support the next generation DTRA Technical Reachback cell. These activities are critical enablers for the development of advanced CWMD planning tools. Advanced Energetics develops energetic materials and weapon design technology providing advanced defeat capabilities for engaging hard and deeply buried targets that are well beyond current high explosive blast/frag warhead technology.

The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 reflects increased investments in advanced energetics and weapons effects modeling.  The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to decreased investment in advanced materials and energetics to balance other priorities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Countering WMD Test and Evaluation project provides a unique national test bed capability for simulated Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) facility characterization, weapon-target interaction, and WMD facility defeat testing. The test bed facility provides structured and systematic end-to-end test event planning, preparation, management, execution, and data analysis. The test bed offers test instrumentation (data acquisition systems and optics), scientific analysis and predictions, test article construction, test article/test bed remediation, tunnel mining, architectural and engineering design, systems engineering and integration, and test data management. The facility leverages fifty years of expertise in investigating weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferant nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD. Subject matter experts design full and sub-scale testing strategies focusing on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels. This capability does not exist anywhere else within the Department of Defense (DoD) and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Counter WMD.  

The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment in test and technology support and the national test bed.  The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to increased investment in test and technology support to revitalize DTRA’s CWMD test and evaluation capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Counterproliferation Initiatives - Proliferation, Prevention, and Defeat program element funds the development and testing of subsystems and components for integration into prototype systems with the potential to transition into mature, state-of-the-art weapons of mass destruction (WMD) surveillance, detection, defeat, prevention, nonproliferation, counterproliferation, consequence management, and treaty verification capabilities.

The Counterproliferation Initiatives - Proliferation, Prevention, and Defeat portfolio is aligned with strategic planning objectives as well as with science and technology (S&amp;T) investment direction which is established annually by DTRA and the US Strategic Command Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (SCC-WMD). The objectives directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.

The portfolio advances the Countering WMD (CWMD) mission by selecting advanced technology development initiatives that meet the following criteria: (1) efforts are clearly defined and directly linked to mission-specific capability requirements of DTRA, the Military Departments, Combatant Commanders, other DoD and federal agencies, and international partners; (2) preliminary assessments of subsystems and components offer the highest potential for technological feasibility, operability and producibility upon transition out of S&amp;T research; (3) activities demonstrate cost effectiveness or cost reduction potential of technologies during field testing or simulation at scale.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease in FY 2017 from the previous President's Budget submission is due to the net effect of the transition of full effects modeling technology from applied research (6.2) to advanced technology development (6.3), decreased investment in detection technologies in (6.3) to fund increased investment in targeting support, and threat forecasting in (6.2). This is part of an overall Agency rebalancing of near term operational needs with future technical developments and capabilities. Other reductions were in support of Departmental efficiencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), and economic assumptions. Reductions to the RDT&amp;E portfolio impacted investment in efforts with lower return on investment, lower customer demand, or that were early in the development cycle.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Information Sciences and Applications project provides technical expertise and reach-back support to the United States and its allies across the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) mission space. The project performs continuous modeling of ad hoc computational analyses on the consequences of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) in consultation with military and civilian planners, warfighters and first responders, and leverages research performed by the Project on Advanced Systems and Concepts for CWMD at the Naval Postgraduate School. The project also supports international CWMD cooperation by developing technologies and concepts suitable for foreign release.

The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the realignment of funding for Technical Reachback from Project RM to Project RA-Information Sciences and Applications.  The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the net effect of increased investment in hazard and effects characterization and decreased investment in technical reachback.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Detection Technologies project continues research formerly conducted under project RF. This project develops, integrates and transitions advanced concepts, technologies and subsystems enabling enhanced nuclear and radiological location, identification, and tracking capabilities. Leveraging gains made in applied research efforts, this project produces advancements in range, process time, sensitivity and accuracy. In addition, this project continues the development of novel concepts and technologies enabling the identification and exploitation of non-radiation based signatures associated with nuclear threats (e.g., transportation of nuclear materials, patterns of activity, or unique materials).

The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the subdivision of Project RF-Detection and Forensics Technologies into projects RD-Detection Technologies and RF-Forensics Technologies beginning in FY 2016.  The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to decreased investment in radiation detection and nuclear threat detection intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This project supports the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in two research areas: (1) Countering WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) Counterproliferation Research and Development is a collaborative effort to develop advanced, warfighter-unique technologies to defeat terrorist WMD development/acquisition pathways, to include defeat of the devices themselves, while minimizing risks to U.S. forces; (2) USSOCOM CWMD-T Support  develops concepts and technologies to integrate and synchronize operations and activities that prevent terrorists and rogue nation states from developing, acquiring, proliferating, or using WMD. This effort supports Commander USSOCOM responsibilities under the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Unified Command Plan.

The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the deferment of lower priority projects until further maturation in the technology readiness level.  The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to reduced investment in next generation CWMD technologies to balance other priorities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Forensics Technologies project develops, integrates, tests and demonstrates post-detonation nuclear forensics systems providing accurate, rapid and reliable means to collect, analyze, and evaluate prompt data and debris from a nuclear or radiological event in support of exploitation and attribution efforts. These forensic capabilities enable the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and its trusted partners to detect, locate, identify, track, and interdict nuclear and radiological threats, including weapons and material, and enablers to their acquisition and development. In accordance with DoD Directive S-2060.04, DTRA serves as the US Government lead for post-detonation National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) research and development (R&amp;D). As the central NTNF R&amp;D coordinator, DTRA works in consultation with interagency partners to develop and improve ground-based capabilities supporting exploitation and attribution missions. NTNF R&amp;D supports advanced research in the following areas: (1) prompt nuclear effects exploitation for attribution; (2) nuclear device characterization for forensics; (3) nuclear forensic materials exploitation for attribution.

The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 in Project RF is due to the realignment of nuclear threat detection activities into Project RD-Detection Technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both. This program achieves these goals through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems or rapid WMD elimination capabilities. This effort includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved.  Requirements are delineated in Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Countering WMD (CWMD) capability. Based on specified requirements, weapons and capabilities are transitioned to a Service program of record for system acquisition.

The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the relative effect of the increased investment in FY 2015 as a result of the Congressional Add for Technology Solutions Supporting Operations in Subterranean Environments.  This investment was realigned during FY 2015 from Project RE-Counter-Terrorism Technologies to better reflect the nature of the investment.  The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to decreased investment in next generation CWMD technologies to balance other priorities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Nuclear Survivability project develops, integrates, demonstrates and transitions innovative technologies for the protection of mission-essential personnel, critical military and national defense capabilities, and associated control and support systems during a nuclear event. Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability Policy.  The Defense threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is the DoD-designated center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse survivability assessments. The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD’s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control system, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. The Radiation hardened nanoelectronics effort develops and integrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nanoelectronics to meet DoD space and strategic system requirements.  The Human Survivability supports the Nuclear Test Personnel Review Program (NTPR), confirming the participation of Atomic Veterans in nuclear testing and radiological events and providing radiation dose assessments. The NTPR is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Justice for radiogenic disease compensation programs.

The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment in Nuclear Surety.  The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to increased investment in radiation hardened nanoelectronics and nuclear weapons stockpile logistics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The assessment modeling tools provide critical analytics for Consequence of Execution (COE) considerations during nuclear targeting and post-detonation nuclear response, supporting interagency strategic and tactical decision making. These COE considerations can include the full range of political, military, economic, social, infrastructure, and information (PMESII) factors and their interaction, extending analytical capabilities beyond common damage assessment practices and into second and third order effects. These activities/efforts support Combatant Commands and other Department of Defense (DoD) organizations by providing accurate and reliable consequence assessment and response information.  Note: This is a new funding line established to rapidly transition capabilities to programs of record.

The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the transition of nuclear effects modeling applied research efforts to advanced technology development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Counterforce Technologies project develops, integrates, demonstrates and transitions emerging technologies enabling efforts to find, characterize, assess, and plan for the defeat of WMD threats. There are two core research efforts in this project. The WMD battlespace awareness effort provides warfighters with capabilities to find, characterize, and assess WMD threats. This effort develops and integrates sensing technologies with multi-mission Unmanned Aerial System payloads. The Countering WMD (CWMD) weapons effects effort develops modernized, fast-running, validated CWMD planning tools and integrates modeling and simulation software to optimize the execution of WMD and associated hard target defeat operations.

The decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the realignment of funding for Technical Reachback from Project RM to Project RA-Information Sciences and Applications.  The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to increased investment in WMD reconnaissance technology and weapons effects and planning tools.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Target Assessment Technologies project develops, integrates, tests, demonstrates and transitions processes and technologies providing advanced capabilities in the areas of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) target assessment and functional defeat. The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining current or future vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and denying reconstitution efforts. Applying these processes to time-dependent constraints related to WMD target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge. This project develops analytical tools and processes required to (1) find and characterize WMD targets and associated hard and deeply buried targets and to (2) assess in real time the results of physical and functional defeat operations (such as a direct attack). These novel, dynamic capabilities enable Combatant Commands and the intelligence community (IC) to hold at risk high value targets possessed by adversaries.

The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 reflects the continuing investment in the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software.  The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the projected completion of the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize, and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the development of verification and monitoring capabilities for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to counter proliferation and weapons of mass destruction (WMD). DTRA’s Nuclear Arms Control Technologies (NACT) program performs Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to improve the sustainability, reliability, and effectiveness of capabilities related to its operational mission to install, operate, maintain, and sustain the waveform and radionuclide nuclear detonation detection stations comprising the U.S. portion of the International Monitoring System (IMS). This delivers data to the U.S. monitoring and verification community and enables U.S. compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) nonproliferation objectives.
  
The project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. This project conforms to the administration’s research and development priorities related to WMD arms control and disablement. Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide data required to inform compliance assessments, and support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams.
 
The primary RDT&amp;E program emphasis is on improvements that enable the installation of treaty-specific stations, which reduce costs and increase the reliability in diverse and often harsh environments; improve efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of existing stations and treaty-specified verification capabilities; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of, nuclear weapons tests. The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies.

The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to investment in research on radionuclide sampling and analytical capabilities. The decrease from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to re-phasing of program activities to FY 2018 and FY 2019.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Efforts in this project were completed in FY 2014. Under Project RL, the Net-Centric Architecture program integrated legacy capabilities and facilitated data sharing through a net-centric framework. It provided near-real time collaborative analysis capabilities between the Department of Defense (DoD) and key interagency and international partners through a globally accessible net-centric framework known as the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset.  This toolset migrated the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA's) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) modeling and simulation codes to provide an integrated suite of Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) decision support capabilities. The framework was the only operational chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) framework in the world that provided capabilities through web applications, net-centric web services, and stand-alone mobile deployments which are validated and accredited for operational use by international, national, state, and local authorities.  

The decrease in FY 2015 is due to the completion of Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset investments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
