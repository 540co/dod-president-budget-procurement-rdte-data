                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element aligns system development and demonstration of Heavy Tactical Vehicles with Future Modular Force requirements to support combat and combat support missions.  These missions include the following: line haul, local haul, and unit resupply. These trucks transport water, ammunition, and general cargo over all terrain and throughout the battle-space.  Funding will also be used for developing the Army's next generation of tactical trucks, as part of the Army's Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Modernization Strategy. Funding in Project 659 supports the Family of Heavy Trucks (FHTV) Heavy Dump Truck (HDT). Funding in Project VR5 supports periodic, evolutionary upgrade of survivability and crew protection for Heavy Tactical Vehicles as described in the Long Term Protection Strategy.

In FY14, Army PM MRAP will execute research and development on survivability, mobility and storage technologies. Within the survivability arena, JPO MRAP will focus on improved underbody armor concepts to improve current capabilities and to accomplish this with no to only minimal increase in vehicle weight.  Additional survivability efforts will work toward RPG/Shaped Charge threat defeat mechanisms that have a higher probability of defeating this prolific threat, as well as developments in Transparent Armor (TA) that will extend the life of the TA in order to reduce sustainment costs.  Additional analysis of black box data recorders from vehicles operating in a home station training profile will also give us opportunities to reduce operating and sustainment costs when operating CONUS. Due to the size and increased weight of the enduring MRAP variants, mobility studies will be conducted to identify technologies that will regain levels of mobility that were traded off during previous survivability upgrades. Since a significant portion of the MRAP vehicles will be stored in APS locations, PM MRAP will also conduct corrosion protection efforts to develop strategies to minimize degradation of systems that are held in long term storage.

Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicle</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Heavy Dump Truck (HDT) supports construction projects by loading, transporting and dumping payloads of sand and gravel aggregates, crushed rock, hot asphalt mixes, earth, clay, rubble, large boulders and other materials up to gross vehicle weight rating to job sites under worldwide climatic conditions.  The HDT also serves as a quarry truck for the quick transport of bulk raw earth material to and from the crushing screening and washing plant and the asphalt mixing plant and the HDT also serves as a transportation asset for organizational equipment. 

The HDT is required to replace the M917 and F5070 HDT.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Movement Tracking System (MTS) is a satellite based, asset visibility and situational awareness enabler that assists Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) commanders and their staffs.  MTS identifies and tracks the location of vehicles, communicates with vehicle operators, and redirects missions on a worldwide, near real-time basis during peacetime operations and war.  MTS provides the capability to link ground level operators conducting missions and commanders/managers that plan, direct, and control operations and allows for continuous CS/CSS asset visibility across the tactical area of operations.  FY08/09 funding supported development of block modifications on the MTS.  This block modification will develop and test interfaces to the Transportation Coordinator's Automated Information for Movement System (TC AIMS II) and Global Combat Support System-Army (GCCS-Army).  FY12 funding continues interface development &amp; testing.

There is no FY14 Base or OCO funding for this project.  The MTS program is being converged into the PM FBCB2 Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P), as 'JBC-P Log'.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The FY 2012 funds support tire improvement efforts intended to extend the life of the tire.  FY 2012 funding will compare capabilities of the current M1000 Trailer to Objective Requirements, perform capability gap analysis, market surveys and propose concept trailers to meet future objective requirements.  Modernized trailers are better able to match the capabilities of today's improved tactical wheeled vehicles and tractors.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>The tire improvement effort is to improve wear and identify aging characteristics that will be used to improve future tires.  The Next Generation Heavy Trailer Study will compare capabilities of the current M1000 Trailer to Objective Requirements, perform capability gap analysis, market surverys and propose concept trailers to meet future objective requirements.  Modernized trailers are better able to match the capabilities of today's improved tactical wheeled vehicles and tractors.</r2:Text>
