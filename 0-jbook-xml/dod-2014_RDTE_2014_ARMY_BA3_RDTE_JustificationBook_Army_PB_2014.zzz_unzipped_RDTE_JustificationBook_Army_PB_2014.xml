                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates equipment and innovative techniques for precision aerial delivery of cargo and personnel.  Aerial delivery is a key capability for rapid force projection and global precision delivery. These efforts are designed to advance state of the art precision delivery technologies such as parachutes, guidance and navigation and control components and subsystems, tracking sensors, software algorithms, and safety rigging which integrates with currently equipped aircraft, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and advanced rotary wing aircraft.  These efforts provide the Warfighter with highly accurate, timely cargo/payload delivery and resupply in all terrain and weather conditions.  Precision delivery/resupply reduces vulnerability of ground soldiers, aircraft and crew. Precision aerial delivery supports remote warfare with activities such as placement of battlefield sensors, reduction of Soldier load and initial delivery of key expeditionary base camp assets.  Demonstrated technologies transition to Product Manager (PM)-Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), PM-Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-SCIE) as well as other Army PMs.

Efforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.

Work in this project is fully coordinated with PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates technologies for military combat feeding systems and combat rations.  Areas of emphasis include: enhanced nutrient composition to maximize cognitive and physical performance on the battlefield; cutting edge food stabilization and preservation techniques that increase the variety and quality of rations used by the Joint Services; novel ration packaging solutions to minimize degradation of combat rations during storage; field portable biosensors for food-borne pathogen detection and identification as well as predictive modeling tools to protect the Warfighter from food-borne illnesses. This project demonstrates combat feeding equipment with reduced logistics (in component parts, weight, volume, fuel, and water) and labor requirements, while improving the quality of food service. The project, a Department of Defense (DoD) program for which the Army has Executive Agent responsibility, provides technology development for Joint Service Combat Feeding. The DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board provides oversight for this project.  Demonstrated field feeding equipment transition to Product Manager (PM)-Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS).

Efforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.

Expeditionary Base Camp (EBC) systems (or remote command outposts) provide an operational capability for Small Combat Units (battalion and below) and Soldiers which are rapidly deployable/re-locatable and require no Military Construction and limited materiel handing support. The need for this technologically enabled capability has arisen as a result of new tactics, techniques and procedures used in austere, remote, and challenging environments in which stability operations, counterinsurgency operations and peace keeping missions are conducted. The Army envisions continuing to conduct this full range of operations worldwide, particularly in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. This project integrates mature technologies to create mission specific lab demonstrators and evaluates the performance capabilities using metrics and methodologies developed under PE 0602786//Project VT4.   

Efforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) maturates and demonstrates advanced medical technologies including drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, and developing medical practices and procedures to effectively protect and improve the survivability of U.S. Forces across the entire spectrum of military operations. Tri-Service coordination and cooperative efforts are focused in four principal medical areas: Combat Casualty Care, Military Operational Medicine, Militarily Relevant Infectious Diseases, and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine. 
 
Promising medical technologies are refined and validated through extensive testing, which is closely monitored by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as part of their processes for licensing new medical products. The FDA requires medical products to undergo extensive preclinical testing in animals and/or other models to obtain preliminary effectiveness and safety information before they can be tested in human clinical trials. Clinical trials are conducted in three phases to prove the safety of a drug, vaccine, or device for the targeted disease or medical condition, starting in Phase 1 with a small number of healthy volunteers. Following Phase 1, Phase 2 clinical trials to provide expanded safety data and evaluate the effectiveness of a drug, vaccine, or medical device in a larger population of patients having the targeted disease or medical condition. Each successive phase includes larger numbers of human subjects and requires FDA cognizance prior to proceeding. Work conducted in this PE primarily focuses on late stages of technology maturation activities required to conduct Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Some high-risk technologies may require additional maturation with FDA guidance prior to initiating these clinical trials. Such things as proof of product stability and purity are necessary to meet FDA standards before entering later stages of testing and prior to transitioning into a formal acquisition program where large Phase 3 pivotal trials will be conducted for licensure. Activities in this PE may include completion of preclinical animal studies and Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies involving human subjects according to FDA and EPA requirements. Promising medical technologies that are not regulated by the FDA are modeled, prototyped, and tested in relevant environments.

Blast research and research into maturing field rations in this PE are fully coordinated with the United States Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center.  This coordination enables improved body armor design and rations for Soldiers. Additionally, the activities funded in this PE are externally peer reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee. The ASBREM Committee serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses biomedical research and development community, as well as its associated enabling research areas.

Project 810 maturates and demonstrates FDA-regulated medical countermeasures such as drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic systems to naturally occurring infectious diseases and wound infections of military importance, as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis.  The project also supports testing of personal protective measures such as repellents and insecticides regulated by the EPA. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.

Project 840 validates studies on safety and effectiveness of drugs, biologics (products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and medical procedures intended to minimize immediate and long-term effects from battlefield injuries; advanced technology development and clinical studies for treatment of ocular and visual system traumatic injury; and restoration of function and appearance by regenerating skin, muscle, and bone tissue in battle-injured casualties. Additionally, this project develops and realistically tests improved occupant protection systems through medical research to characterize mechanisms of injuries sustained by occupants of ground-combat vehicles subjected to underbody blast events, determine human tolerance limits to underbody blast forces, and develop tools to predict injuries to ground-combat vehicle occupants exposed to underbody blast forces.

Project FH4 maturates, validates, and supports enhanced Force Health Protection of Soldiers against threats in military operations and training. Health-monitoring tools are matured to rapidly identify deployment stressors that affect the health of Joint Forces. These databases and systems enhance the DoDs ability to monitor and protect against adverse changes in health, especially mental health effects caused by changes in brain function.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project maturates and demonstrates FDA-regulated medical countermeasures such as drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic systems to naturally occurring infectious diseases that are threats to U.S. military deployed forces. The focus of the program is on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that can adversely impact military mobilization, deployment, and operational effectiveness. Prior to licensure of a new drug or vaccine to treat or prevent disease, the FDA requires testing in human subjects. Studies are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage in a small study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. All test results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use. This project supports the studies for safety and effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to the next phase of development for completion of expanded safety and initial studies for effectiveness in larger populations. If success is achieved for a product in this project, the effort will transition into Advanced Development. The project also supports testing of personal protective measures that can reduce disease transmission from biting insects and other vectors to include products such as repellents and insecticides, which are regulated by the EPA. 
 
Research conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas: 
(1) Drugs to Prevent/Treat Parasitic (living in or on another organism) Diseases
(2) Vaccines for Prevention of Malaria
(3) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)
(4) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)
(5) Diagnostics and Disease Transmission Control 
 
Research is conducted in compliance with FDA regulations for medical products for human use and EPA regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides).

Work is managed by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and the U.S. Army Medical Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID) and coordinated with NMRC.  The Army is responsible for programming and funding all DoD naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.    

Promising medical countermeasures identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603807A, project 808.
 
The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.    
  
Work in this project is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories; USAMRIID, Fort Detrick, MD; and the Navel Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories. Significant work is conducted under a cooperative agreement with the Henry M. Jackson Foundation, Bethesda, MD.

Efforts in this project support the Soldier portfolio and the principal area of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This 1-year effort supports research to enable the Live-Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E) community to conduct realistic survivability testing of ground-combat vehicles subjected to underbody blast (UBB) threats, with a primary emphasis on assessing potential occupant casualties, as well as to enable the development and testing of improved occupant protection systems.  UBB creates injurious forces on occupants of ground-combat vehicles that are more violent and that act in directions not normally encountered in civilian automotive accidents. Injury prediction tools that were developed to assess occupant safety in automobile crashes are not adequate for assessing occupant survivability in ground-combat vehicles exposed to UBB threats. Accurately predicting the spectrum of injuries caused by UBB forces in live-fire tests of ground-combat vehicles presents a unique challenge for the Department of Defense (DoD). A UBB medical research program is being initiated to understand the human tolerance limits and injury mechanisms needed to accurately predict injuries to ground-combat vehicle occupants caused by UBB events.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project maturates, demonstrates, and supports enhanced Force Health Protection of Soldiers against threats in military operations and training. Health-monitoring tools are matured to rapidly identify deployment stressors that affect the health of Joint Forces. These databases and systems enhance the DoD's ability to monitor and protect against adverse changes in health, especially mental health effects caused by changes in brain function. Force Health Protection work is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The program is maturing the development of global health monitoring (e.g., development of neuropsychological evaluation methodologies) and validating clinical signs and symptoms correlating to medical records, diagnosed diseases, and mortality rates. The key databases supporting this program are the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow for the examination of interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.  

This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services. The cited work is fully coordinated with Natick Soldier Research Development Engineering Command (NSRDEC), Natick, MA.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                                    <r2:Title>Future Affordable Turbine Engine (FATE)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Demonstrate an advanced, innovative 7000 horsepower class gas turbine engine that provides significant improvement in operational capability for current and future rotorcraft.  FATE uses sequential design and fabrication iterations to mature a design to demonstrate significant reduction in specific fuel consumption (SFC), significant improvement in horsepower-to-weight ratio, and significant reduction in production and maintenance cost compared to year 2000 state-of-the-art engine technology.  The sequential design and fabrication process will begin with the compressor subsystem, then the combustor subsystem, then the turbine subsystem, and finally the mechanical systems.  Work in this project is coordinated with efforts in PE 0602211A, project 47A.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates advanced technologies for future High Energy Laser (HEL) weapons technology.  The major effort under this project is the phased approach for mobile high power solid state laser (SSL) technology demonstrations that are traceable to the form, fit, and function requirements for a HEL weapon.  At entry level weapon power of around 10 kW, SSL technology has the potential to engage and defeat small caliber mortars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), surface mines, sensors, and optics.  At full weapon system power levels of around 100 kW, SSL technology has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM), UAVs, and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), as well as surface mines, sensors, and optics at tactically relevant ranges.  HELs are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to strategically, operationally, or tactically stockpile ordnance.  This effort utilizes a modular building block approach with open systems architecture to ensure growth, interoperability, and opportunity for technology insertions for maturation of laser, beam control, sensor/radar, integration of power and thermal management subsystems, as well as Battle Management Command, Control, and Computers (BMC3). 

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Ground portfolio.

                                    <r2:Description>This effort matures and integrates devices to protect occupant's eyes, vehicle cameras and electro-optic fire control systems against anti-sensor laser devices as well as reduce the sensor's optical signature. Anti-sensor laser devices can deny vision either temporarily or permanently, by flooding the sensor with too much light (jamming) or by damaging the sensor. These jamming or damaging effects can slow our battle tempo, disrupt fire control solutions, or prevent vehicles from completing their mission entirely. This effort focuses on optical systems that protect sensors to maintaining fire control capability, situational awareness and protect Warfighter vision from pulsed, continuous wave and future laser threats.

                                    <r2:Description>This effort researches, designs and evaluates high power density engines and transmission systems needed to offset increasing combat vehicle weights (armor), increased electrical power generation needs (onboard communications, surveillance and exportable power ), improved fuel economy (fuel cost &amp; range), enhanced mobility (survivability), and reduced cooling system burden (size, heat rejection). Currently, less than 1/3 of the total available energy from the fuel is converted into usable mechanical work (propulsion). This effort also researches and matures thermal management technologies and systems including heat energy recovery, propulsion and cabin thermal management sub-systems to utilize waste heat energy and meet objective power and mobility requirements on all ground vehicles. Lastly, this effort maximizes efficiencies within propulsion and thermal systems to reduce burden on the vehicle while providing the same or greater performance capability.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures, integrates, and demonstrates vehicle electronics hardware such as computers, sensors, communications systems, displays, and vehicle command/control/driving mechanisms as well as vehicle software to enhance crew performance, increase vehicle fuel efficiency, reduced Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP) burdens and reduce vehicle maintenance costs. This project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. Additionally this project matures integrated condition based maintenance technologies that reduce the operation and sustainment costs of vehicle electronics and electrical power devices. Technical challenges include: increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure data networks, interoperability of intra-vehicle systems, and advanced user interfaces. Overcoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test/evaluation.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) technologies including sensor technologies, perception hardware and software, and robotic control technologies that enable UGV systems to maneuver on- and off-road at militarily significant speeds with minimal human intervention, thereby enabling the Soldier to perform other mission tasks. Challenges addressed include: obstacle avoidance, overcoming perception limitations, intelligent situational behaviors, command and control by Soldier operators, frequency of human intervention, operations in adverse weather, and robots protecting themselves and their surroundings from intruders. Mature technologies are incorporated in UGV technology demonstrators so that performance can be evaluated for tactical maneuver and sustainment applications.  

The approach builds upon, complements, and does not duplicate previous and ongoing investments conducted under the Joint Robotics Program Office, in program element (PE) 0602601A, project H91 (Ground Vehicle Technology) and by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability). 

Work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Ground Portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  

Work in this project is performed by Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC), Warren, MI, in collaboration with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi and Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This project element (PE) matures and demonstrates advanced behavioral and social science technologies that enhance performance to ensure that the Warfighter keeps pace with the transformations in systems, weapons, equipment, and mission requirements to meet the goals of the future force.  These technologies provide key capabilities through training methods and techniques that prepare Soldiers and leaders to effectively operate in complex digitized, networked environments; enable the use of embedded training technologies envisioned for future command and control (C2) systems; as well as foster cognitive, behavioral, and psychological flexibility, adaptability, and mission readiness.  Project 792 evaluates new selection measures, refines performance metrics, assesses innovative training techniques, and analyzes methods and tools to better adapt training to meet goals and requirements. Increased funding in FY12 for this PE is based on work shifted from PE 0602785A due to need for increased focus on maturation and demonstration of selection techniques and tools as well as training methods.

Work in this project complements and is fully coordinated with 0603015A (Next Generation Training &amp; Simulation Systems), 0602308A (Advanced Concepts and Simulation), PE 0602716A (Human Factors Engineering Technology) and PE 0602785A (Manpower/Personnel/Training Technology.)

This project codes, optimizes and demonstrates software-based tactical cross domain solutions that enable operations and intelligence information sharing across security domains to replace current application-specific hardware solutions. This project also codes, optimizes and demonstrates cyber security software to proactively defend wireless networks against cyber attack using nontraditional methodologies.

This project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Ground, Air and Soldier portfolios.

Note: In FY14 funding for Mission Command (MC) efforts previously conducted in in this Project has been moved to PE/Project 0603772/101 to consolidate MC efforts into a single PE/Project.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates next generation training and simulation systems that integrate virtual threats, asymmetric warfare concepts, network-centric operations, and embedding training capabilities as well as technologies into operational go-to-war future force systems to include dismounted warrior systems.  The synergy between these embedded training capabilities and the immersive training advanced technology development in PE 060315/project S28 provides Army units with a set of complementary embedded as well as deploy-on-demand systems that provide just-in-time, dynamic, realistic training, and mission rehearsal capabilities.  Demonstrations include technologies that form a framework for future training applications for the range of future force operations such as robotic control and other sensor operations; mission planning and rehearsal; command, control, and maneuver; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) network analysis to support distributed simulations; and vehicle system interface requirements.  This project creates a joint environment by synchronizing virtual and constructive simulated forces with the next generation and current training systems from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine forces.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Efforts in this project mature and demonstrate state-of-the-art and simulation systems.  These efforts include a distributed Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) environment that integrates a collection of multi-fidelity models and simulations and tools that map to an evolving architecture and M&amp;S activities to support decisions throughout the acquisition life-cycle.  This provides a unifying M&amp;S architecture  that synchronizes and integrates multi-resolution modeling applications such as Live, Virtual, and Constructive experimentation.  This effort ultimately comprises a portfolio focused on researching cutting edge M&amp;S methods to enable the Army and DoD to perform critical System of Systems (SoS) analysis, experimentation, technology tradeoffs, capability assessments, concept development, and training that saves time and resources while increasing the effectiveness of  acquisition and training activities.  

Funding increase in FY13 reflects the use of Advanced Distributed Simulation Environments to support development of enterprise architectures for holistic modeling and simulation of dismounted Soldier protection, lethality with cognitive and physical performance.

Efforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE maturates and demonstrates advanced technology of candidate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines, prepares and conducts human clinical studies to assess safety and effectiveness of candidate HIV vaccines, conducts research to control HIV infection in military environments, protects the military blood supply from HIV, and protects military personnel from risks associated with the HIV infection. All HIV technology development activities are conducted in compliance with FDA regulations. FDA requires thorough testing in animal models (preclinical testing) to ensure safety and effectiveness prior to approving controlled clinical evaluation of drugs, vaccines, and medical devices in humans. Normally, clinical trials are conducted in three phases to prove safety and effectiveness of the drug, vaccine, and device for the targeted disease or condition. An increasing number of test subjects are used in each subsequent phase. All results are submitted to FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for routine medical use. This program is jointly managed through an Interagency Agreement by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), the National Institutes of Health, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).

This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments or other government organizations.   
 
Work is fully coordinated with work funded in program element PE 0602787A, project 873 (HIV Exploratory Research). 
 
The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.     
 
Work in this PE is performed by WRAIR, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories, and NMRC, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories. The Henry M. Jackson Foundation, located in Bethesda, MD, provides support for FDA testing and other research under cooperative agreement.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds research to develop candidate HIV vaccines, to assess their safety and effectiveness in human subjects, and to protect the military personnel from risks associated with HIV infection. In addition, it is designed to find ways to protect the blood supply from contamination with HIV virus. All HIV technology development is conducted in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. Evaluations in human subjects are conducted to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of candidate vaccines, as required by FDA regulation. Studies are conducted stepwise: first, to prove safety; second, to demonstrate the desired effectiveness of the drug, vaccine, or device for the targeted disease or condition in a small study; and third, to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human population trials.  All results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use. This project supports studies for effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to the next phase of development for completion of effectiveness testing in larger populations.  

This program is jointly managed through an Interagency Agreement by USAMRMC and NIAID. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments or other government organizations.

Work is fully coordinated with work funded in program element PE 0602787A, project 873 (HIV Exploratory Research), and are further matured under PE 0603807A, project 811.

                                    <r2:Description>This effort seeks to challenge conventional approaches to technology and systems development and insertion, and increase the awareness of risks and opportunities earlier in the lifecycle in order to improve system design, development and employment.  It builds on the concepts and methodology developed under the Deployable Force Protection Adaptive Red Teaming effort and applies them to other high-priority areas for the Army.  It designs and conducts a series of live, virtual and mixed scenarios and demonstrations to evaluate the most promising technologies.  It stresses and assesses developing technology systems for both individual and system-of-system performance across a representation of operational environments, realistic scenarios and emerging threats.  Activities include: identifying, integrating and examining technology performance at live demonstration venues with experienced operators; emulating emerging threats and alternative futures to challenge assumptions regarding scenarios and system employment; and identifying and informing of potential vulnerabilities in systems and systems-of-systems, including but not limited to, training, logistics and adaptability.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) matures and demonstrates electronic warfare (EW) sensors and software intended to deny, disrupt, locate or destroy the enemy's command, control, and communications (C3) systems and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets. This PE matures both countermeasures (CM) and counter-countermeasures (CCM) to deny the enemy the use of their systems while protecting US assets from enemy deception and jamming. Project K15 matures and demonstrates capabilities to locate and exploit enemy communication systems including computer networks. Project K16 matures and demonstrates multifunctional EW capabilities (jamming) to enhance platform survivability and provide near real-time situational awareness to the commander through the detection, identification and geo-location of emitters of interest.

Work in this PE is complimentary of PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science), and fully coordinated with PE 0603003A (Aviation Advanced Technology) and PE 0603313A (Missile and Rocket Advanced Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this PE is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Demonstration scenario: an individual EW asset acquires three threat signals but is only able to address and defeat one of them due to constraints (e.g., power, bandwidth, or etc.). Because all three detections are reported to the network, other EW assets can address and defeat the two outstanding signals.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:Description>This effort augments and enhances existing light weight dismount and tactical vehicles systems to add real-time Combat Identification (CID) capabilities, along with embedded training, without significantly altering size, weight and power of current and emerging equipment packages. The focus is on making current systems and capabilities (weapon sites, radios, sensors, and etc.) multifunctional rather than adding stand-alone CID systems that would increase the burden on the Soldier. Work accomplished under PE 0602120A/project H15 compliments this effort. In FY13and FY14 this effort supports Technology Enabled Capability Demonstration 3.b: Surprise/Tactical Intelligence-Actionable Intelligence.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) transferred from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (RDT&amp;E,DW) to the Department of the Army (RDT&amp;E,A) in FY 12.

During the Continuing Resolution in Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 the HPCMP received $44.3 million and authority from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) for initial operations during the CRA period as the HPCMP was considered a new start for the Army even though it was a transferred program.  When the FY 2012 budget was approved/appopriated, the $44.3M was returned by the Army (RDT&amp;E,A) to RDT&amp;E,DW.  The actual FY 2012 appropriated Army program was $228.15 million including the paid back funding.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) demonstrates and provides high performance computing hardware, parallel software, wide area networking services, and expertise that enable the Department of Defense (DoD) Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) community to investigate and understand physical phenomena and behavior of systems through large scale computational simulation. DoD users of these services work in a diverse variety of science and technology areas including structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, material science, chemistry, biology, electromagnetics and acoustics, weather, ocean modeling, signal/image processing, forces modeling and simulation, environmental quality, electronics/networking/systems/C4I, and space and astrophysical sciences.  The computational expertise and resources (massively parallel, networked, multi-core computers, advanced software applications and secure connectivity) provided by this Program enable DoD researchers and engineers to analyze complex problems and phenomena and develop novel solutions using state-of-the-art, physics-based and discrete event simulations.  The combined capabilities of the HPC centers and the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) enable massive calculations to be completed more efficiently and at reduced cost than if each DoD research organization were to duplicate the necessary resources. For example, DoD personnel use High Performance Modernization Program (HPCMP) resources to do such things as improve the performance of manned and unmanned aircraft, validate design concepts and establish expected performance of new armor and penetrator designs, speed the development of new ship designs, and demonstrate the viability of weapons systems performance. The HPCMP supports the requirements of DoD scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs), the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and support for software applications. Dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) augment the DSRCs to form the total HPCMP computational capability. In 2012 the HPCMP provided approximately 1.47 billion processor hours to a user community representing requirements from all three services and the agencies of the DoD. The bulk of this capability is provided via 13 supercomputers (including systems for classified processing) located in the 5 DSRCs across the country providing a total of approximately 180,000 processors and 1.7 quadrillion floating point operations per second (1.7 petaFLOPS). DoD users store their results in 16 petabytes (16,000,000,000,000 bytes) of storage archival distributed across the centers and duplicated for backup (for a total storage capability of 32 petabytes). The DREN interconnects HPCMP resources and users nationwide via a research infrastructure that provides an aggregate network capacity of 25 billion bits per second to 38 user sites, 5 DSRCs, and 4 smaller affiliated resource centers (ARCs). Individual user site speeds range from 45 to 622 million bits per second, ARC speeds range from 155 to 2488 million bits per second, and DSRC speeds range from 622 to 3110 million bits per second. Mission-critical DoD applications across the spectrum of DoD activities are supported by the software component of the Program through training in advanced computational methods, the development of productive application development environments, tools, and methodologies, and through the direct provision of computational scientists and engineers to improve the performance, accuracy, and relevance of physics-based computational models.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project enables the Defense research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) community to resolve critical scientific and engineering problems more quickly, and with more precision, using advanced, physics-based computer simulation supported by high performance computing (HPC) technology. The computational expertise and resources enable DoD personnel to analyze phenomena that are often impossible, not cost effective, too time-consuming, or too dangerous to study any other way.  The High Performance Modernization Program (HPCMP) supports the requirements of the DoD's scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: supercomputing resource centers, the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and support for software applications. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive capabilities and demonstrate new technologies that address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments. Efforts of the DSRCs are augmented by dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) that address near real-time and real-time HPC requirements. The total aggregate computational capability is roughly 1.7 quadrillion floating point operations per second (1.7 petaFLOPS); this capability is expected to double by 2013. All sites in the HPC Modernization Program are interconnected to one another, the user community, and major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which matures and demonstrates state of the art computer network technologies. The DREN interconnects 45 user and center sites at network speeds of up to 3 gigabits per second. The Software Application Support (SAS) effort optimizes and improves the performance of critical common DoD applications programs to run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, matures and demonstrates leading-edge computational technology from academic and commercial partners, and provides collaborative programming environments.     

Work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Innovation Enablers (formerly named Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This is a Congressional increase to the High Performance Computing Modernization Program.

This project enables the Defense research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) community to resolve critical scientific and engineering problems more quickly, and with more precision, using advanced, physics-based computer simulation supported by high performance computing (HPC) technology. The computational expertise and resources enable DoD personnel to analyze phenomena that are often impossible, not cost effective, too time-consuming, or too dangerous to study any other way.  The High Performance Modernization Program (HPCMP) supports the requirements of the DoD's scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: supercomputing resource centers, the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and support for software applications. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive capabilities and demonstrate new technologies that address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments. Efforts of the DSRCs are augmented by dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) that address near real-time and real-time HPC requirements. The total aggregate computational capability is roughly 1.7 quadrillion floating point operations per second (1.7 petaFLOPS); this capability is expected to double by 2013. All sites in the HPC Modernization Program are interconnected to one another, the user community, and major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which matures and demonstrates state of the art computer network technologies. The DREN interconnects 45 user and center sites at network speeds of up to 3 gigabits per second. The Software Application Support (SAS) effort optimizes and improves the performance of critical common DoD applications programs to run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, matures and demonstrates leading-edge computational technology from academic and commercial partners, and provides collaborative programming environments.     

Work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Innovation Enablers (formerly named Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.

                                    <r2:Description>This project improves detection of buried low metal/low contrast explosive threats, such as Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), and antitank landmines and increases Rates of Advance (RoA). Improving the signal to noise ratio and acquisition rates reduces susceptibility to electromagnetic interference and improves the interoperability with electronic countermeasures, while continuing to improve detection and reduce false alarms. Currently, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) capabilities for detection of explosive threats in an electronic warfare environment are limited by radar receiver technology and detection latency. This effort leverages the technology results from forward looking radar technology investigations under the Threat Detection and Neutralization for Route Clearance effort and Threat/Mine Detection for In Road Obstacles.</r2:Description>

This effort develops an illumination capability and modifies target detection algorithms for integration into current prototype digital goggles. This will be a helmet mounted capability to aid the dismounted forces as they execute route clearance missions by improving detection of command initiation wires, trip wires and indicators of IED emplacement such as disturbed earth. A next generation handheld explosive hazard detector technology will also be developed and matured with improved IED detection capabilities and SWaP characteristics. The next generation handheld detector technology may be inserted into the current AN/PSS-14 Mine Detector as an upgrade or may be a new handheld detector.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) matures and demonstrates sensor technologies that increase Warfighter survivability and lethality by providing sensor capabilities to acquire and engage targets at longer ranges in complex environments and operational conditions (e.g. day/night, obscured, smoke, adverse weather). Project K70 pursues technologies that improve the Soldier's ability to see at night, provide rapid wide area search, multispectral aided target detection (AiTD), and enable passive long range target identification (ID beyond threat detection) in both an air and ground test-beds. Project K86 matures and evaluates sensors and algorithms designed to detect targets (vehicles and personnel) in camouflage, concealment and deception from airborne platforms, and provides pilotage and situational awareness imagery to multiple pilots/crew members independently for enhanced crew/aircraft operations in day/night/adverse weather conditions.  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  

Work in this PE is fully coordinated with efforts in PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision and Electro-Optics Technology), PE 0602712A (Countermine Systems), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0603003A (Aviation Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), PE 0603774A (Night Vision Systems Advanced Development) and PE 0604710A (Night Vision Systems Engineering Development).

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) matures and demonstrates technologies that assist Army installations in becoming environmentally compatible without compromising readiness or training critical to the success of the future force.  Project 002 demonstrates tools and methods for compliance with environmental laws by control, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste products; and conservation of natural and cultural resources while providing a realistic environment for mission activities. Project 025 demonstrates pollution prevention tools and methods to minimize the Army's use and generation of toxic chemicals and hazardous wastes.  Project 03E focuses on restoration of sites contaminated with toxic and/or hazardous materials (such as unexploded ordnance) resulting from Army operations. This program demonstrates technological feasibility, assesses the technology as well as its producibility, and transitions mature technologies from the laboratory to the user.  Technologies developed by this program element improve the ability of the Army to achieve environmental restoration and compliance at its installations, at active/ inactive ranges and other training lands, and at its rework as well as production facilities.  Technologies demonstrated focus on reducing the cost of treating hazardous effluents and remediating Army sites contaminated by hazardous/toxic material.    

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  

This program is fully coordinated and complementary to PE 0602720A (Environmental Quality Technology).

Work in this PE is performed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS, and the US Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates technologies transitioned from PE 0602720A (Environmental Quality Technology), Projects 048 and 896, that assist Army installations in achieving environmental compliance.  These technologies reduce the cost of treating hazardous effluents from Army installations, including forward operating bases, to satisfy increasingly stringent waste, wastewater and air pollutant discharge requirements.  Army facilities are subject to fines and facility shutdowns for violation of federal, state, and local environmental regulations.  This technology is essential to control and reduce the generation of waste to satisfy hazardous waste reduction goals and to avoid future environmental costs as well as liabilities to the Army.  Efforts under this project enable the Army to reduce environmental constraints at installations while complying with the myriad of federal, state, and host country environmental regulations and policy.  Technologies demonstrated also reduce the cost of resolving training noise compliance issues for the Army, avoid reductions in availability of training facilities, and sustain the viability of testing and training ranges as well as protect the critical resources, i.e., land, air, and waters of the Army.  

Work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Innovation Enablers (formerly Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy, and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates technologies transitioned from PE 0602720A (Environmental Quality Technology), Projects 835 and 896 that improve the Army's ability to achieve cost-effective environmental restoration and management of contamination resulting from Army training or operations at its installations, active and inactive ranges, its rework and production facilities, in operations and on the battlefield.  Advanced development activities address the management/mitigation of materials released to the natural environment and residual environmental effects of military training and operations.  The emphasis of this effort includes restoration of legacy materials, e.g., traditional explosives energetics, and unexploded ordinance; management of new materials, e.g., nanomaterials and emerging contaminants; and mitigation of residual impacts from implementation of sustainable technologies and processes.  Technologies matured within this project enable the Army to cost effectively address current and future environmental liabilities resulting from the use of militarily relevant materials in the environment and implementation of the new family of sustainable technologies for energy production.  Current and planned efforts enable the Army to efficiently characterize, evaluate, assess, and remediate soil and water at installations, ranges, facilities, and during operations in the face of changing weather and climatic conditions.  Efforts also identify ways to economically comply with the myriad of federal, state, and host country regulations dealing with contaminated soil and water.  A key aspect of this work is the enhancement of risk assessment and life cycle analysis techniques that can more accurately display the environmental liabilities associated with fielding new systems and technologies.  This program includes pilot scale field studies to establish technological feasibility and assess performance and productivity of the risk assessment techniques.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project matures and demonstrates software and architectures for geospatial mapping applications and decision aids for the Warfighter; components, systems, system of systems and decision aids to enable ground vehicle mobility (freedom of movement), including force projection, countermobility to impede movement of threat forces; survivability and force protection to protect personnel, facilities and assets through design and reinforcement of structures, and deployable force protection to detect, assess, and defend against threats for troops deployed at smaller bases (such as bases being compromised or overrun). Work is in support of current and future ground force operations.  Software and architectures for geospatial projects mature and validate geospatial decision tools in support of operations planning and decision making to advance utility for geospatial capability and techniques across the Army, services and coalition and to advance and mature the information architecture that supports the total Army's discovery and access to data, geospatial information and analytical tool suites.  Deployable Force Protection (DFP) activities are focused on filling critical gaps in protecting forces operating at smaller, remote bases and include maturation, integration, and demonstration of components, systems and systems of systems for rapidly deployable threat detection in direct line-of-site and non-line-of-site environments; situation assessment to help reduce false alarms and decrease manpower required to monitor the environment; passive protection to mitigate blasts, direct, and indirect fire effects; and active defense to suppress or eliminate threats and threat systems.  Work in survivability and force protection also includes maturing and demonstrating software to characterize blast effects generated from explosive events, such as improvised explosive device detonation in soils, and support design and decision aids.  Work in mobility and force projection includes maturing and demonstrating software and hardware to assess and improve freedom of movement for ground forces.  

Work in this project supports the Army S&amp;T Ground and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) Portfolios.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  

This work is fully coordinated with and complementary to PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology).  Geospatial activities are coordinated with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA).

                                    <r2:Description>This effort matures, integrates and demonstrates rapidly deployable threat detection, situation assessment, passive protection and active defensive technology-enabled capabilities to meet critical capability gaps for troops operating remotely at smaller bases or integrated with local communities. The needs at these smaller bases (less than 300 persons, not all U.S. troops) are unique based on constraints in transportability, manpower, organic resources, lack of hardening of structures, resupply, and training for example. Moreover, lack of interoperability and scaleability consume manpower and take away from time needed to perform missions. Threats include bases being overrun by hostiles; direct fire; rockets, artillery and mortars; and improvised explosive devices. Force protection challenges at these remote, smaller bases include providing increased standoff detection, blast and ballistic protection, and kinetic technologies subject to the constraints mentioned above.  This effort begins to fill a significant gap in force protection capabilities. This work is fully coordinated with PE0602784A/T40, Deployable Force Protection; PE 0602786A; PE0603313A/G03; and PE 0603125A.  Work is performed by Army, Navy, and Air Force labs and centers.</r2:Description>
