            <proc:Description>Passenger Carrying Vehicles includes the procurement of sedans, station wagons, law enforcement sedans, ambulances and buses.  These vehicles are general in nature, but they fulfill unique and distinct needs commensurate with their design.

Sedans are available in compact, mid-size, and large, and are used to support a variety of functions and missions at all levels of the Air Force.  A portion of these sedans is dedicated for use by the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) and a portion is procured as chase cars used to support U-2 aircraft operations.

Station wagons are mid-sized vehicles which are primarily used to transport personnel and light cargo. They are mostly used in overseas locations and some high security areas located near missile installations. They are also used in the maintenance and flying operation areas to support aircraft sortie generation.  

Law Enforcement Sedans (LE Sedans) come equipped with a heavy-duty component package for law enforcement and security missions.  Security forces personnel use this type of vehicle for emergency response, traffic control, patrol duties, and base security operations.

Ambulances include both bus ambulances and modular ambulances that are used for medical evacuation operations.   The bus ambulance is a 44 passenger bus converted to accommodate massive patient transport for medical emergency situations and humanitarian/disaster relief operations.  The modular models are standard commercial ambulances that are available in 4x2 and 4x4 configurations.  They are used for the movement of patients under field conditions, aircraft crash rescue operations, and routine transportation of patients to and from medical facilities.

Buses include a variety of commercial vehicles that support a broad range of mass transit requirements.  Bus sizes range from the 16 passenger shuttle bus to the 52 passenger bus.  These vehicles support Air Education and Training Command (AETC) training units, Air Force band organizations, protocol offices, and several other missions.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Program elements associated with this P-1 Line are: 0202834F, 0207142F, 0207597F, 0305202F, 0502834F,0502844F, 0702831F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY17 procurement dollars in the amount of $14.437M will procure, but not be limited to, 226 vehicles in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel.

FY17 OCO dollars in the amount of $2.003M will procure, but not limited to, 15 vehicles in support of Overseas Contingency Operations.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>FY15 funding totals include $3M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

This vehicle group consists of pickup trucks, trailers, semi-trailers, trucks, vans, utility trucks, maintenance and facility vehicles essential to base and flying operations.  Assets are critical to the Air Force mission and are essential to flight line operations (aircraft maintenance), depot maintenance, component routing to depot back shops and airfield maintenance, and Air Base Civil Engineers performing base housing maintenance and repairs.  These items are critical across the spectrum of functional users throughout the Air Force and provide multi-purpose capabilities.  These vehicles also support mission needs for light to heavy cargo transport, as well as transportation for air/flight crew personnel.  Cargo utility vehicles also provide heavy cargo movement for civil engineering and construction projects.  Without the procurement of these replacement vehicles, the Air Force will not have  the ability to support broad spectrum Air Force operations.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

            <proc:Description>Funding provides for a variety of security and tactical vehicles essential to strategic military operations.  This program previously procured the standard diesel powered High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) and all configurations used by the Air Force, Guardian Angel Air-Deployable Rescue Vehicle (GAARV), and cargo trailers.  In the future, funding will be used to procure next generation security and tactical vehicles.

The M1101 and M1102 are light tactical trailers (designated by load weight) in a single axle, two wheel trailer designed to be towed by a HMMWV towing vehicle.  The trailers have the same tires, wheels, and track width as the HMMWV.  The only difference between the M1101 and the M1102 trailer is the model information and payload capacity.  The trailers have various applications and provide the forces with a light, nimble, rugged trailer built primarily for hauling cargo.

Guardian Angel Air-Deployable Rescue Vehicle: The Guardian Angel Air-Deployable Rescue Vehicle (GAARV) is an air-deployable surface recovery platform capable of maneuvering over adverse terrain in order to search for and recover isolated personnel and/or equipment.  It will provide increased survivability during "outside the wire" personnel recovery operations, more secure transportation capability to the recovery team and injured/isolated personnel from an area of high threat, and necessary training platforms for operators to familiarize themselves with vehicles they utilize in the area of operations.  It also provides operators with increased protection from enemy fire and improvised explosive devices. Funding includes, but is not limited to procurement of end items, training, upgrades, retrofits, spares, repairs, deployment packages and returns.  Due to rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements.

The Special Purpose Vehicles group consists of various vehicles for flightline, maintenance, and facility operations used for a variety of purposes.  Examples of these vehicles include the IW 40 tractor, 4 and 8 passenger over-the-snow-carriers, an assortment of wreckers and refuse trucks, potable and non-potable water distribution trucks, refueling vehicles, deicers, staircase trucks, lavatory service trucks, high reach maintenance trucks, glycol recovery vehicles, diable patient vehicles, and tow tractors. Tow tractors are used to tow aircrafts, munition trailers, and ground support equipment.  The IW 40 tractor is a small farm tractor used primarily to pull a mower and for other light tasks; the snow carriers are tracked vehicles which move personnel in snowy conditions and are used in search and rescue missions; the wreckers are used to move disabled vehicles, haul vehicles or to deploy a heavy duty winch.  The refuse trucks in this group include one which tilts and dumps a payload and one which compacts refuse prior to discharge. Aircraft refueling vehicles refuel and defual aircrafts. Potable water distribution trucks provide drinking water to personnel; non-potable water distribution trucks are used primarily to wet down and control dust at a construction site.

            <proc:Description>This P-1 line procures a variety of critical fire fighting and crash rescue vehicles.  Vehicles typically include, but are not limited to, the following:

-- The P-19 Crash Truck is an Air Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) vehicle that is a first response vehicle on the scene of an aircraft fire emergency.  It equips bases with the capability to rapidly extinguish aircraft fires.  This truck is a mandatory flight line operations safety requirement and is essential at bases with a flying mission. The P-19 also provides fire fighting capability for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve installations located at municipal airports.  An installation's P-19 requirement is determined by the type of aircraft frequenting the aerial facility and the resulting gallons per minute of fire fighting agent required.  This vehicle provides aircrew, passenger, weapons, and airframe fire protection at a crash site.

-- The P-21 Aerial Lift Truck is a fire fighting vehicle with a 105 foot aerial ladder.  It provides improved agent delivery over older model vehicles, as well as the capability to provide elevated delivery of agent involving high rise buildings and warehouse facilities.

-- The P-22 4x2 and P-24 4x4 Pumper Trucks are designed primarily to fight structural fires.  The trucks have a 750-gallon water tank and a 50-gallon Aqueous FilmFoam class "A" foam tank and are capable of applying 1250 gallons per minute. P-24 is built on a rugged 4x4 chassis that equips forces with limited off-road/rugged terrain capability.  The P-22 4x2 Pumper Truck has the same fire fighting capability as the P-24, but is used in urban areas.

-- The P-23 Crash Truck is a larger version of the P-19 ARFF truck and has a larger fire suppression capacity.  It is primarily assigned at transport, bomber, depot, and cargo aircraft bases.

-- The P-26 Water Tanker Truck is a 4000-gallon resupply truck used to support the ARFF vehicles, fight wild land fires, and provide mutual assistance to communities. 

-- The P-29 Wild Land Firefighting Truck is a four-person crew cab truck which contains a modular agent and pump and roll delivery system as well as firefighting tools and equipment.  This truck is outfitted with a compressed air foam system (CAFS) and has a 500 gallon water tank.  The truck is intended to combat wild land and brush type fires.

-- The P-30 is a Medium Rescue Vehicle.  It is designed to bring equipment, lighting, a winch, and a generator to the scene of a rescue event.  This vehicle has 450 cubic feet of storage space and affords easy equipment access and improved storage compartments.  This truck is assigned to the larger industrial bases.

-- The P-31 Hazardous Material Vehicle is a dual purpose vehicle that stows and transports hazardous material response equipment for the purpose of mitigating chemical leaks, spills, and releases.  This vehicle also provides an incident command workstation area for the purpose of research, command, control, and communications during containment/cleanup operations. 

-- The P-33 Quint Truck is a fire fighting truck with a 75 foot aerial ladder.  It provides improved agent delivery over older models as well as the capability to provide elevated delivery of agent involving high rise and warehouse facilities.

-- The P-34 is a first response Air Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) vehicle which equips forces with initial "knock down" capability.  The P-34 is the first fire truck to employ Ultra High Pressure (UHP) technology which allows the vehicle to discharge a mixture of water and foam at 1350 psi, this UHP technology makes the vehicle three times more effective than a conventional ARRF truck.  The truck has a 400 gallon water tank and a 50 gallon foam tank along with a bumper turret and 200 feet of handline all mounted on an F-550 chassis.

-- The Rapid Intervention Vehicle (RIV) is a first response aircraft fire truck; it is the newest addition to the Air Force's fleet of crash response vehicles.  The RIV is the first vehicle in the AF to use new ultra high pressure (UHP) fire fighting technology which makes this truck 3 to 3.5 times more efficient at knock-down than conventional ARFF vehicles.  This feature increases the length of time the vehicle can remain on the scene without having to be resupplied.  Perched on an F550 chassis, the RIV is equipped with  a 4-wheel drive train; it provides seating for four, equips fire fighters with limited storage for rescue equipment; has a bumper turret, a 200 ft hand line and a winch.  Because of its size, speed and agility this truck can get to a crash scene quickly and perform fire fighting operations until the larger trucks can arrive at the scene.   

These vehicles are all built to meet the performance standards of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and Air Force safety regulations.

            <proc:Description>FY15 funding totals include $1.734M in Overseas Contingency Operations.

This program procures snow removal vehicles and commercial sweepers used on all airfield surfaces to remove snow and help prevent foreign object damage (FOD) to aircraft engines and tires.  Snow removal equipment includes front mounted brooms, multi-purpose blowers, and plows.  These vehicles provide critical mission support to airfield operations because fighter aircraft cannot land or take off with ice on the runway.  Multi-purpose vacuum sweepers maintain airfields, roads, and grounds.  Vacuum sweepers provide equally important support at all air bases due to the high cost of FOD and the potential for loss in FOD-related engine accidents.

These assets are critical to the Air Force mission.  They are the primary equipment used for snow, ice, and debris removal from runways and taxiways year round.  The vital functions of these vehicles prevent the closing of airfields due to debris and/or snow and ice buildup. 

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

Assistant Secretary of Defense/Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD/C3I) directed implementation of the DoD Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (CMI) on 23 February 2001. Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Notice 6510/NSA 3-9 direct the modernization of all cryptography in military systems in the US, NATO and Coalition nations. To prevent information compromise, the National Security Agency (NSA) mandate requires Link 16 cryptographic systems be upgraded. The CJCS directed a modernization effort at the recommendation of the NSA to modernize equipment and provide enhanced security for Link 16 tactical networks (Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (CM). Likewise, a radio frequency spectrum memorandum of agreement between the DoD and the Department of Transportation mandate the internal frequency remapping of our Link 16 family of terminals to avoid conflict with next generation Federal Aviation Administration radio aids to navigation. These two mandates, among other operational reliability and capability improvements will be satisfied under a Block Upgrade (BU2) effort planned for the Link 16 Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Low Volume Terminal (LVT). BU2 will procure new Signal Message Processor (SMP) cards that incorporate the most current NSA mandated cryptographic standards. BU2 will also procure a new Tailored Processor/Ground Multiplexer card, update software and firmware in the MIDS LVT to improve operational reliability and provide the radio the ability to remap the lower frequency range of the terminal. The new cards will be installed in all terminals and spare cards will also be purchased.  Crypto mod kit being developed by the Navy as part of MIDS LVT Block Upgrade 2.

PE 0303135F PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI) 

This program funds procurement of PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI). PKI provides identity management (IDM) services to support warfighter requirements. PKI provides the basic framework and services implemented within DoD to ensure information systems security. It provides the capability to attach digital signatures to electronic documents for identity management, and to encrypt and decrypt electronic documents for secure transmission. PKI-enabled applications afford confidentiality and authentication services to communications and/or network transactions, as well as verification of the data integrity and non-repudiation of those transactions. PKI is one of many security solutions used to protect information and provide attributes to enable access to critical resources in the Global Information Grid (GIG) and is used concurrently with other solutions. Funding supports several different requirement areas to procure infrastructure equipment for the field in support of Secret Internet Protocol Routed Network (SIPRNET), PKI, and Evolutionary PKI End User Equipment. 


PE 0303140F INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY PROGRAM: 

This program funds procurement of Communications Security (COMSEC) equipment, ancillary encryption/decryption devices, and related equipment to enable the secure transport of 
information. United States Air Force (AF) and the Department of Defense (DoD) require the capability to collect, process, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information while denying an adversary the ability to intercept, collect, destroy, interpret, or manipulate our information flows. Secure communication allows the DoD to achieve and maintain decision superiority; the key to successful application of the military instrument of national power. AF COMSEC equipment protects information such as, warfighter positions, mission planning, target strikes, commander's orders, intelligence, force strength, and force readiness. This COMSEC program ensures adversaries cannot interpret, manipulate, or destroy information. When an adversary is capable of interpretation, manipulation, or destruction of the information used by the warfighter, DoD military forces may suffer significant and/or devastating mission degradation that can result in loss of life and resources and/or cede information that could be used against the United States in a public forum. The COMSEC program includes equipment upgrades and replacements which incorporate latest and/or best technologies mandated to provide mission critical warfighter secure voice and data communications in space, tactical, strategic, and network applications for our globally-deployed COMSEC crypto assets supporting both AF and DoD missions. Details of the assets are included in each section's narrative.

PE 0303135F PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI): 
 
1.  EVOLUTIONARY PKI END USER EQUIPMENT: Funding supports PKI Identity and Access Management needs that must be procured rapidly to strengthen and defend the Air Force Information Network (AFIN) from new and evolving vulnerabilities.  Funding and quantities directly support PKI-based software authentication and hardware security afforded by smartcards or other hardware methods, enabling users to authenticate securely to the network.

 
2.  AIR FORCE DIRECTORY SERVICES (AFDS): AFDS is one of three pillars of DoD Identity Management. The others are PKI and CAC. AFDS ensures that AF user identities are common and synchronized across directories and information stores of various networks, systems, and applications. AFDS eliminates the disparity of maintaining stove-piped systems and through the use of directory technology, alleviates latency associated with the sharing/replication of identity data attributes. AFDS supports delivery of an enterprise security service and backbone for AF networks (both in-garrison and tactical), by providing AF user credentials to the AF Network Enterprise and AF system applications. AFDS addresses challenges and enhances AF mission performance through seamless integrated access to the right information anywhere, anytime. AFDS leverages and provides a core meta-directory service that "joins" and synchronizes personal identity data attributes from authoritative AF and DoD repositories for use by all AF systems and applications. FY17 funds will procure hardware, software, and support upgrades. 
 
 
PE 0303140F INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY PROGRAM: 
 
1. Space COMSEC Mission: Space COMSEC procures crypto products for ground nodes that link to space assets. Space COMSEC equipment is a foundational element in achieving Air Force space and information superiority. Space COMSEC is an enabler for space system compliance with DoD I 8581.01 - Information Assurance (lA) Policy for Space Systems used by the Department of Defense. Space COMSEC mission provides communications security products and lifecycle sustainment support to all DoD satellite systems and commercial systems supporting DoD missions. It enables secure Command and Control (C2) of satellites and prevents unauthorized access and destruction. It enables secure transmission of satellite system's health status telemetry data (satellite health and relative orbital position) to ground control stations, thus protecting critical information about the capabilities of DoD satellite systems. The capability of a system must be protected from an adversary to avoid exploitation of a system weakness/limitation, knowledge of which could assist an adversary in a successful mission against DoD military forces and potential loss of life. Space COMSEC also provides secure transmission of information collected by satellite sensors, which provides the warfighter an integrated view of the battle space. Space COMSEC provides for secure SATCOM, positioning, navigation, timing, weather, nuclear detection and early warning missions. Space COMSEC also enables transmission security (TRANSEC) for space platforms. Space COMSEC mission procures crypto end items and logistics elements to support developing and operational space systems. Funding for this effort is in PE 0303140F. 
 
      a. PRODUCTS: FY17 funding moved to APPN 3021 Space Procurement.  FY16 funding provides for the production of Space COMSEC products to meet developing and operational space program needs. Space COMSEC products include End Crypto Units (ECU), Embedment Solutions (ES), TRANSEC, and ancillaries. Due to low volume production quantities and high reliability design, Space COMSEC products can range in price from $10K per unit to $2M per unit. As a commodity item, Space COMSEC procures standard crypto products, which enable minimized lifecycle footprints. Space COMSEC procures from multiple crypto vendors, however, with the low volume consumption by space programs the space crypto industry base is less than a dozen companies. 
 
      b. LOGISTICS: FY17 funding moved to APPN 3021 Space Procurement.  FY16 funding provides for the production of Space COMSEC logistics elements. Space COMSEC products typically have a 20 to 40 year life cycles to support development, launch, and operation of multiple AF and DoD space systems. Space COMSEC is provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the space system developing contractors and operational ground stations. Space COMSEC products are high-cost critical assets. They are organically sustained to include component level maintenance exclusively by the AF. Logistics procures the necessary lifecycle sustainment elements required to meet the 40 year mission requirements. Logistics elements include specialized test sets, certified training materials and courses, maintenance manuals, provisioning, and modifications. 
 
2. AIR AND GROUND (A&amp;G) COMSEC PROGRAM: The Air and Ground COMSEC Program procures and supports a wide range of secure encryption products supporting AF, inter-service, and various DoD agency customers; and includes items approved under National Security Agency's Commercial COMSEC Evaluation Program (CCEP) such as KIV-7M, Tactical fast lane (TACLANE), and other High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptor (HAIPE) devices.  The program includes equipment upgrades and replacements that incorporate state-of-the-art technologies for mission-critical warfighter secure voice and data communications.  The program provides needed upgrades to encryption devices in FY17 to comply with NSA's Advance Cryptographic Capabilities (ACC) directives. The program supports space, tactical, strategic, and network applications for globally deployed cryptologic assets supporting Air Force and DoD.  Supported systems fall within Air Force Information Systems Security and Information Assurance arenas.  Funding for this effort is in PE 0303140F. 
  
      a. IN-LINE NETWORK ENCRYPTORS: Previously called "Network Encryption Systems.”  FY17 funding fields the new In-Line Network Encryptors (INE) required to maintain the confidentiality, data integrity, and non-repudiation of classified communications.  INEs are the mainstay for securing communications used in classified terrestrial and airborne communications networks.  The new INEs feature robust data encryption improvements included in the HAIPE Interoperability Specification (HAIPE IS) as well as Internet Protocol Version 6 capability that will improve security and expand the bandwidth of USAF secure Internet Protocol networks.
 
      b. LINK ENCRYPTION FAMILY (LEF):  FY17 funds provide for the replacement of the legacy LEF with new more secure crypto modernization compliant LEF devices .  The LEF provide near real time secure communications for national and command level decision making authorities up to TOP SECRET SCI.  The new LEF devices include more robust encryption algorithms, as well as dual channel, increased bandwidth capability, and reprogramability.  NSA has issued classified instructions regarding the use of specific LEF devices.
 
      c. AIR AND GROUND COMSEC CONSOLIDATED:  The following requirements have been combined into one line: Secure Telephones, COMSEC Acquisition Reform (CAR), Peculiar Support Equipment, Secure Communications Voice/Data, Embedded Encryption Devices, and Telemetry Encryption Devices.  FY17 funds procure secure voice/data equipment, DOD Type I COMSEC equipment and commercial cryptography products, testing and support equipment, embedded COMSEC modules, and telemetry devices and Link-16.  The Air and Ground COMSEC line is an aggregate of numerous items.  Each year the type and/or quantity of items utilized to meet requirements varies; an average unit cost is based on number/type of units planned for purchase.
 
3. CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODERNIZATION: The DoD is transforming its existing operational capabilities to realize a seamless joint network of information and engagement grids that securely link sensors, command and control cells, and tactical units to support current and future warfighting capabilities. This includes cryptographic devices that are more robust, modular, scalable, capable, net-centric, and durable allowing more effective and efficient performance including reduced inventory, expanded data rates, simplified upgrades, and ensured Global Information Grid-compatibility. The Global Information Grid (GIG) requires a transformed cryptographic inventory. The DoD Cryptographic Modernization (CM) Initiative delivers that inventory, ensuring a strong security posture for national security and tactical communications systems by providing transparent cryptographic capabilities consistent with operational imperatives, National Security Agency mandates, and mission environments. The future inventory will provide security devices that ease logistics, support joint interoperability, improve interoperability with allies and coalition partners, enable network-centric and transparent key/equipment management, and allow effective future upgrades. These CM programs enable information dominance by developing and procuring communications security devices that deter and deny known and emerging threats while accommodating significantly increased bandwidths and processing speeds without increasing communication transient and information holding risk. Current CM programs will ensure modernized, secure communications capability to VINSON/ANDVT radios, the Identification Friend Foe (IFF) Mode 5 system, a Remote ReKey system for multiple Homeland Defense and other radar sites, the few remaining, unmodernized-Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) networks, miniaturized crypto for small unmanned systems, and all future satellite control systems and mission data downlinks.  Current programs will replace/upgrade over 30,000 devices out of the Air Force's 245,000+ crypto devices and proved over 100,000 new devices where none were previously available. Other potential programs are undergoing development under the auspices of this line of this PE in order to meet emerging COMSEC requirements for Key Management Infrastructure compatibility, as well as various enterprise-wide technological upgrades mandated under the National Security Agency assessments and Policy #3-9. FY17 Funding for this effort is in PE 0303140F. 
 
      a. IDENTIFICATION FRIEND OR FOE (IFF) MODE 5 CRYPTO MODERNIZATION: This program developed and is procuring devices to encrypt/decrypt IFF Mode 4 and Mode 5 interrogator and transponder operations. These devices, built to Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS),  IFF, Mark XIIA, System (AIMS) 04-900 Cryptographic Interface Standard, are integrated into all airborne platforms and ground radar applications to provide critical, immediate tactical aircraft identification data to ground and airborne systems. Procurement of the two primary devices, KIV-77 and KIV-78 will conclude in FY15 for the KIV-78 and FY18 for KIV-77 (required to outfit most of the USAF fleet) and a remote form factor for certain C2 AF aircraft: 
 
             (1) KIV-77 DEVICES: The FY17 funding procures KIV-77s. KIV-77 is a cryptographic device developed by the USAF to integrate into the APX-119 IFF host box used in the majority of USAF aircraft and ground surveillance /control systems. 
  
             (2) KIV-78 DEVICES: The FY16 funding procures the technical support and travel CLINS for the KIV-78s. KIV-78 is a cryptographic device developed by the USAF in conjunction with Navy IFF Mode 5 upgrades for USAF F-16s and U.S. Navy /U.S. Marine Corps F /A-18s. 
 
      b. REMOTE REKEY (RRK) (CI-33) DEVICES: The RRK modernization program, a part of the AF Key Management Enterprise (KME), will include the current CI-13 capabilities, expand ability to store keying material and rekey other cryptographic devices, and add capability to key/rekey the new Identification Friend or Foe Mode 5 system. RRK uses existing Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) infrastructure communications to distribute key material produced via the Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) or the Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) capabilities, to manage the distribution network, and to configure/status remote End Cryptographic Units (ECUs).

The VACM Embedded Project upgrades the BBIO module as a permanent modification of the ARC-234. 
 
            (1) VINSON/ANDVT CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODERNIZATION (VACM) COMPONENTS (ARC-234): The VACM Embedded Project was established to modernize cryptographic devices that are integrated within various Vinson/ANDVT radios. The Baseband Input/Output (BBIO) module performs COMSEC functions for the ARC-234. The Permanent Sustainment Modification of the ARC-234 will retain Embedded Communications Security (COMSEC) capability by upgrading the BBIO module with reprogrammable hardware and modern crypto algorithms.  
 
            (1a) VINSON/ANDVT CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODERNIZATION (VACM) COMPONENTS (ARC-234), Installation:  The upgraded BBIOs will be installed/modified into the ARC-234 radios beginning in FY16. 
  
            (2) VINSON/ANDVT CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODERNIZATION (VACM) INTERIM CONTRACTOR SUPPORT (ICS): Logistics is required for the initial period of operation for the VACM device. For the purposes of this contract, ICS includes material management, supply distribution, repair functions for the VACM device, technical manuals revisions and software management and maintenance. 
 
            (3) VINSON/ANDVT CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODERNIZATION (VACM) DEVICES: The VINSON/ANDVT CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODERNIZATION (VACM) program is procuring devices. The production line will replace five crypto device types on critical national leadership networks including airborne, ground and mobile platforms. 
 
      d. Missile Electronic Encryption Device (MEED): The MEED Modification will procure the modified legacy Missile Entry Control System (MECS) devices used to securely authenticate personnel attempting access to this Nation's ground-based Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) facilities.  This effort will bring the MEED equipment into compliance with current NSA information assurance (IA) security design guidance.

      e. Technology Development (TD): Technical Development (TD) conducts concept development and early systems engineering activities to analyze evolving threats and Communications Security (COMSEC) capability gaps across AF mission areas. Develops, plans and executes foundational technology maturation efforts to inform COMSEC requirements, build capability roadmaps and support cost estimates prior to Materiel Development Decision (MDD). Mitigates risk for thousands of AF users affected by algorithm security issues and ensures required security upgrades can be integrated into the AF enterprise.  Works with NSA and other services to develop standards that increase security of communication and information products and facilitate efficient crypto and COMSEC enterprise management.

     FY17 Plans: 
            (1) Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) Crypto: No action planned

            (2) Classified Data at Rest (CDAR) Crypto: Continued procurement of legacy encryption solutions for application to unprotected legacy Air Force platforms.

            (3) Trusted Sensor (TS) Crypto: Completion of procurement of Trusted Sensor network encryptors with software package enabling intrusion detection on classified and unclassified networks by CVA Hunter weapon system.

            (4) Integrated Data Denial (IDD) Crypto: No action planned 

            (5) Advanced Crypto Capabilities (ACC): Planned modification activity in support of KG-245A.
 
      f. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION (PMA): Program management administration costs support management with engineering and technical expertise in support of development and procurement activities. 
 
4. AIR FORCE ELECTRONIC KEY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (AFEKMS): AFEKMS is a part of the AF Key Management Enterprise (KME), a sustainment program that works in concert with the DoD EKMS Program to provide secure, flexible, and timely upgrades to cryptographic key generation, distribution, and management systems. AFEKMS sustains the current Electronic Key Management System and serves as the bridge to the full operational capability (FOC) of DoD KMI. The Air Force continues to purchase AF EKMS physical products required under the COMSEC Material Control System (CMCS). Funding for this effort is in program element 0303140F. 
 
      a. TECHNICAL UPDATES: FY17 funding procures hardware and software products necessary to update the Tier 1 Net Key Servers, Tier 3 system data management devices (DMDs); and systems to maintain an audit trail for COMSEC materials. 
 
      b. KOV-21 CARDS &amp; REFRESH: Funding procured KOV-21 cards, which are the crypto engine for the simple key loader. KOV-21 cards life expectancy is approximately 7-11 years depending on use. Capital Equipment Replacement began in FY10 and will continue until the Air Force Last Mile Load Element is fielded. 
 
      c. SIMPLE KEY LOADER (SKL) &amp; REFRESH: FY17 funding procures AN/PYQ-10 (C) SKL units which are controlled cryptographic items that are mission essential to help the AF load Crypto key into various platforms. SKLs replace the obsolete AN/CYZ-10 and SKLs that were fielded in prior years (end-of-life due to KOV-21 card). Disruption of the SKL delivery schedule could degrade and/or disrupt secure communications in the battlefield. Capital Equipment Replacement continues incrementally across the FYDP until the Air Force Last Mile Load Element is fielded. 
 
5. AIR FORCE KEY MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE (AF KMI): The Department of Defense (DoD) has directed the replacement of the legacy Air Force Electronic Key Management System (AFEKMS) portion of the AF Key Management Enterprise (KME) with the DoD Key Management Infrastructure (KMI).  The Air Force KMI transition activity procures and deploys the DoD KMI training, equipment and software within the AF to provide mission critical Communications Security support for all AF mission and platforms implementing the core capability for the AF's future KME.  The AF KMI transition activity  procures KMI connectivity, key management and cryptographic unique/certified products to replace legacy AFEKMS equipment per National Security Agency (NSA) mandates and to field KMI-enabled products that have been under previous years DOD development.  Funding for this effort is in program element 0303140F. 
 
      a.  KMI Hardware: FY17 funding procures:  KMI Management Clients (MGCs)that provide the user interface; Advanced Key Processors (AKPs) that provide the cryptographic capability to interact with the DOD KMI; KG-250 High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptors (HAIPEs) that provide secure connectivity to the KMI; KOV-29 Type 1 Tokens that provide secure user identification/authentication to the KMI;  and other peripheral KMI equipment requirements.  KMI Last Mile production effort begins to procure Portable Key Loaders (PKLs) and Tactical Key Loaders (TKLs) to replace fielded legacy Simple Key Loaders (SKLs) and Really Simple Key Loaders(RASKL) in the key management enterprise.

      b.  KMI Last Mile Production:  Funding procures competitive source selection activities, production planning, annual production lots of Portable Key Loader devices, training and hardware/software support capabilities.

            <proc:Description>The Communications Security (COMSEC) modification activity ensures the integration, installation, and sustainment of cryptographic equipment. This activity is a critical component in providing robust, secure global communications, enabling information superiority. It provides the warfighter with the security needed to protect the flow and exchange of operational decision-making information through the retrofit and modification of selected COMSEC equipment. These modification efforts ensure legacy equipment can meet current COMSEC operational environment requirements. Funding for this effort is in program element (PE) 0303140F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY17 funding provides replacement of critical components to maintain mission data life cycle requirements. As the obsolescence of parts
occurs in the sustainment of the products, modifications must be implemented to keep the products operational for satellite programs. Funds are used to update both cryptographic
product end items and logistics lifecycle support elements.

FY17-specific modifications include upgrades to new KS-252 crypto modernization product. The KS-252 is next generation command control encryption and telemetry decryption product
enabled with 5 algorithms used in satellite ground control stations. Current delivered units have an inadvertent timer rollover event which results in the unit resting every 49 days with
impacts to satellite operations. There are also classified "features” that need to be fixed and the product re-certified by NSA.</proc:Justification>

Military Intelligence Program (MIP) Activities PE 0305192F - P-40A
FY17 funding will enable completion of AF JWICS Enterprise disaster recovery capabilities for core services at the four Enterprise Service Centers (ESCs).  AF DRP will determine implementation strategy for the development and application of a disaster recovery solution for NASIC, PACAF, and possibly EUCOM to support their local Continuity of Operations/Disaster Recovery (COOP/DR) requirements by providing information recovery technology for Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) level networks.  Funds will be used to conduct site surveys, procure servers, storage devices, associated software/hardware upgrades, and installation costs.

Network-Centric Collaborative Targeting PE 0305221F - P-40A

            <proc:Description>Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) procures and supports fixed-base and tactical radar, navigation aids, voice communications, and data processing/automation capabilities which enables Air Force (AF) air traffic controllers to provide advisory, sequencing, separation, and landing guidance services to all aircraft in USAF-assigned airspace.  In support of Global Mobility, Agile Combat Support, Global Strike, Homeland Security, and Global Response concepts of operation, ATCALS centrally manages the Air Force's Air Traffic Control capability to ensure Air Traffic Control facilities/equipment can safely and expeditiously support en route and terminal operations in benign and combat areas of responsibility.  ATCALS operational and training systems must be interoperable with systems operated by other services, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), or host nations. 


In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.


AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AND AIRFIELD OPERATIONS (ATC OPS): ATC OPS provides for procurement of new system and replacement, modification, or mitigation of diminishing manufacturing source issues of legacy ATC navigation and landing systems, as well as related voice communications, data processing/automation systems, and ancillary equipment such as ATC digital audio legal recorders, flight data input/output systems, electronic flight strip systems, air traffic information systems, instrument procedures, and airfield management systems.  A key element of ATC operations is the ATCALS Fixed Base (FB) Navigational Aids (NAVAIDs) Family of Systems (FOS) replacement program, which combines organizational realignments, process improvements, and investments in state-of-the-art commercial-off-the-shelf technology to replace legacy fixed and deployable equipment.  The FB NAVAIDS FOS replacement program includes the fixed base Very High Frequency (VHF) Omnidirectional Range System (VOR), Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN), and VORTAC (combined VOR/TACAN), Deployable TACAN, and Digital ATC radios.  ATCALS also includes procurement of a new Deployable Instrument Landing System (D-ILS) which will replace the 1970s era mobile precision approach radar.  These investments will result in significant manpower and operations/ maintenance savings over the next 20 years. 

1.  DIGITAL AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (ATC) RADIO REPLACEMENT: The ATC ground-to-air VHF and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radios are 30 years old and difficult to maintain.  The Digital ATC Radio Replacement Program will replace ATC fixed-base radios with state-of-the-art systems that will include a remote maintenance capability and 8.33kHz channel spacing (mandatory requirement in Europe by FY2018).  In order to ensure system  commonality and common logistics support and training, ATC radios are being procured as a centrally managed item by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Tinker AFB.  Approximately 5,200 radios will be replaced. 

2.  ATCALS Fixed Base (FB) Navigational Aids (NAVAIDS) FoS: The FB NAVAIDs FOS replaces the current 1970s era systems which have reached the end of their normal lifespan, are manpower intensive, and costly to support.  New systems will include remote maintenance, monitoring, alignment, and flight inspection support capabilities via Remote Maintenance Centers (RMC).  One VOR (1 AD), 28 VORTACs (25 AD/1 ANG/2 AFR), and 92 fixed-based TACANs (76 AD/10 ANG/6 AFR) will be procured from FY2012 through FY2018.

3. DEPLOYABLE INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM (D-ILS): D-ILS is a deployable Category I (200ft decision height/2400ft runway visual range) ILS with remote monitoring and maintenance capabilities.   D-ILS will provide precision approach capability in adverse weather conditions for contingency operations and humanitarian or disaster relief operations.  D-ILS will replace the current Air Force mobile Precision Approach Radar (PAR) system used to support operations at deployed locations.  These systems were procured in the 1970s, are manpower intensive, and logistically unsupportable. On average, only 18% (three of 17 systems) of the mobile PAR systems are operational on a daily basis. D-ILS will support increased operations in the area of responsibility, allow phase out of the currently obsolete legacy systems and provide interoperability with the Civil Reserve Air Fleet.   

4.  Deployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON): D-RAPCON will replace the 40 year old AN/MPN-14K and AN/TPN-19 Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and Operations Shelter (OPS) subsystems with state of the art digital systems.  Modification and overhaul of the existing systems has proven to be ineffective due to diminishing manufacturing sources.  On average, no more than three of the existing 17 systems are deployable at any given time.  The current AN/TPN-19 and AN/MPN-14K Operational Availability rates are 69% and 67% respectively versus the a D-RAPCON requirement of 98%.  D-RAPCON will provide aircraft surveillance/sequencing, air traffic control communications, and automation capabilities for terminal area air traffic control operations.  D-RAPCON will also be deployed with a fixed base or deployable Instrument Landing System and a fixed or mobile control tower to provide a complete air traffic control capability.  The D-RAPCON will support tactical military and worldwide humanitarian operations and also provide a capability to support domestic disaster relief.  The primary surveillance radar coverage (non-cooperative targets) is out to 60 nautical miles (nm) and the secondary surveillance radar coverage (cooperative targets) will increase from 120 nm to 200 nm.  Due diminishing manufacturing sources, life of type purchases will be required each year.  The D-RAPCON Capability Development Document was approved by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council on 8 Feb 11.

            <proc:Description>PE 0305137F NATIONAL AIRSPACE SYSTEM (NAS)

NAS is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC (Component) program which entered full rate production on 15 Jun 05.  It modernizes the Department of Defense (DoD) Air Traffic Control (ATC) system in concert with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) modernization effort.  The FAA is the overall NAS program lead and the Air Force (AF) is the DoD lead.  NAS increases safety of flight, provides systems and facilities interoperable with FAA modernization, replaces aging DoD ATC systems, provides identical service to military and civilian aircraft, and reduces DoD flight cancellations/delays and maintenance.  Equipment procured includes ATC automation systems, surveillance radars, voice switches, military site-unique equipment (at test range facilities), associated Pre-Planned Product Improvements, site preparation, installation support, ancillary equipment and supplies, direct production support, flight, periodic security interoperability, and information technology certifications.  For the AF, this includes procurement funding for 91 DoD Advanced Automation Systems (DAASs) [45 Radar Approach Control Facilities and 46 Air Traffic Control Towers], 48 Digital Airport Surveillance Radars (DASRs), and other equipment required to interface with the FAA.
 
DAAS is comprised of equipment tailored to support two types of ATC operations facilities: Radar Approach Control (RAPCON) and military control tower facilities.  It provides digital radar displays, consoles, automation hardware and software to replace systems approaching the end of their life cycle.  DASR consists of two subsystems: a primary and a secondary surveillance radar.  DASR provides aircraft position and other data to controller displays in the RAPCON and at select control tower locations.  DASR replaces the current generation of DoD analog ATC surveillance radars.  

The NAS modernization program will complete equipment procurement and installation in FY2017 and is now transitioning to the operations and support phase which will focus on mitigation of DAAS/DASR diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) and sustainment issues. 

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.  Reserve component allocations are subject to Total Force priorities and demand.  

PE 0305114F AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AND LANDING SYSTEMS (ATCALS)

ATCALS procures and supports fixed-base and tactical radar, navigation aids, voice communications, and data processing/automation capabilities.  ATCALS enables United States Air Force (USAF) air traffic controllers to provide advisory, sequencing, separation, and landing guidance services to all aircraft in AF-assigned airspace.  ATCALS support under PE 0305114F for the NAS program includes mitigation of DMS issues (replacement of obsolete DAAS processors and displays), and procurement of one DAAS to support the ATCALS/DAAS Operational Support Facility (OSF).    

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.  Reserve component allocations are subject to Total Force priorities and demand.  

Note:  DMS mitigation funding was not part of the NAS Acquisition Category ACAT IC program baseline and therefore, is not included in System Acquisition Report unit cost calculations or the P-21 Production Schedule.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0305137F and PE 0305114F</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>PE 0305114F AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AND LANDING SYSTEMS (ATCALS):  Equipment procurements under the ATCALS PE include the following:

1.  NAS CAPITAL EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT PROCESSORS (unit cost under $250K but funded with procurement funds as processors certified and centrally managed by FAA):  No FY17 funding requested.

            <proc:Description>BCS-F supports the NORAD/NORTHCOM homeland defense and air sovereignty mission for fixed Air Defense Sectors.

1. BATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM-FIXED (BCS-F): BCS-F is a bi-national program with Canada. The BCS-F Program supports a battle management command and control system with capability to integrate
data from existing and future civil and military defense surveillance systems into a comprehensive recognized air picture. BCS-F systems serve as Air Force Homeland Defense battle management Command
and Control hubs and integrators for data from radar sensors, data links and supporting communications architecture. BCS-F provides tactical communications and data link capabilities with other military and civil systems responsible for planning, directing, coordinating and controlling forces for air surveillance, air defense, and control of sovereign US air space. This integrated air picture enhances the capability to conduct peacetime air sovereignty operations and transition to active air defense operations in the event of aggression. BCS-F Increment 3 program ended after reaching full deployment in November 2012. BCSF baseline also includes Remote Tactical Air Picture/Remote Work Station (RTAP/RWS).

2. NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION - INTEGRATED AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM (NCR-IADS): NCR-IADS provides ground-based air defense of the National Capital Region airspace, and provides an integrated air

            <proc:Description>PE 0207412F CONTROL AND REPORTING CENTER (CRC)

The Control and Reporting Center (CRC) program element provides for integration of new capabilities, upgrades, and modifications. Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS)
issues. The CRC is a mobile, ground-based theater air control system (TACS) surveillance and battle management command and control (BMC2) element. It consists of facilities, equipment, and people. It is a customizable, modular, transportable, and persistent weapon system employed at the tactical level to support air and surface operations. These efforts include, but are not limited to, the modification of the AN/TYQ-23A(V)1 Operations Module (OM), the AN/TRC-213/214 Remote Radio Secure Voice System (RRSVS) and the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) Module (JM) Link 16 Upgrade. 

AN/TYQ-23A(V)1 OM is a low density/high demand (LD/HD), rapidly deployable, ground-based C2 asset. This automated, computer-based information system provides operators the real-time battlespace picture necessary to plan, direct, and control tactical air operations and airspace management tasks. In order to meet warfighter requirements, incremental updates are required. For example, these improvements will add Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet), Mode 5 Integration, improved data links, Multiple Source Correlator Tracker upgrades, limited battle management for contested environs, and cyber security upgrades, Cross Domain Solution (CDS). Modifications will also be required to integrate it with the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3DELRR). AN/TRC-213/214 RRSVS is a voice radio and OM-interface unit. The RRSVS allows real-time, secure voice communications between aircraft and battle management C2 operators in the CRC. Everything over Internet Protocol (EoIP) which is used for external communications, Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), and Integrated Waveform will also be integrated into a future RRSVS upgrade. JM Link 16 Upgrade will provide for crypto modernization and will meet FAA mandated frequency re-mapping requirements and stand up of organic support for both software and hardware.

In 4th quarter of FY 2016 the entire program including SPM responsibilities transitions to HBZ at Hill AFB, UT.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0207412F.

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $27.177 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>PE 0207412F CONTROL AND REPORTING CENTER (CRC) 

FY17 funding supports: 

a. OPERATIONS MODULE MODERNIZATION (OM Mod). Upgrades include, but are not limited to the following: replacing legacy computer and software with a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS)-based architecture, increasing system capacities as outlined in the OM Mod Functional Capabilities Document (FCD), both OM Mod and Increment 1, and integrating it with external operator workstations.

            <proc:Description>PE 0305111F WEATHER SERVICE 

The Weather Observation Forecast procurement line acquires meteorological equipment and ground-based space environment sensing systems supporting the global missions of the Air Force (AF), Army, Special Operations Forces (SOF), combatant commands, and other government agencies. Additionally, these funds procure information system equipment for processing, storing, and disseminating weather information for analysis, forecasting, and mission integration at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Fixed and transportable equipment provides observing and forecasting capabilities for home station and deployed locations in support of worldwide Air and Space Expeditionary Forces and Army forces. Weather system technological upgrades provide critical support to modern air and space combat operations. These systems enhance the effectiveness and survivability of AF weapon systems and precision munitions by accurately predicting environmental impacts to optimize mission execution and planning, targeting, weaponeering, and battle damage assessment, as well as space systems operations and effectiveness. Program Management Administration costs include Federally Funded Research and Development Centers and Advisory and Assistance Services. 

AF Weather Weapon System (AFWWS) activities align under four capability areas: 1) Weather Data Collection, 2) Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination, 3) Weather Forecasting, and 4) Product Tailoring/Warfighter Applications. This alignment ensures an integrated and systems-oriented approach to program management decisions. Development funding for Weather Observation/Forecast is in Program Element (PE) 0305111F, Weather Service. 

1. Weather Data Collection: Provides automated atmospheric (a.k.a. terrestrial) and space environmental sensing capabilities at fixed and deployed locations worldwide. The data gathered by multiple sensor systems is exploited for environmental battlespace awareness, characterization, safety of flight, and resource protection. Items A-C (below) were formerly consolidated as "Observing System 21st Century (OS-21)." 

A. AN/FMQ-23: Fixed automated weather observing system that collects weather elements and formulates aviation surface weather reports. 

B. Next Generation Ionosonde (NEXION): Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) vertical incidence radar that obtains measurements of the ionosphere from directly overhead in the medium and high frequency radio bands. 

2. Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination: Assimilates worldwide sources of atmospheric and space weather data, produces decision-quality information for warfighters, and disseminates those products to intermediate and end users via a net-centric interface ensuring data integrity and continuity of service. Weather data formats and transmission protocols support DoD's Data Services Environment and Meteorological and Oceanographic Community of Interest objectives for integration into warfighter command and control, mission planning, and modeling and simulation systems. Improved analysis of real-time weather information supports DoD's role in transformation of the National Airspace System through the Next Generation Air Transportation System and enhances Air Force energy security plans. 

A. Weather Data Analysis (WDA)--Provides atmospheric, space, and climatological data analysis capabilities within the AF Weather production center to generate products required by AF and Army operational units worldwide. Additionally, WDA provides data storage and network infrastructure supporting production, development, and testing activities and transport of data among multiple nodes and classification levels. 

3. Weather Forecasting: Provides numerical weather prediction, cloud, space environment, and atmospheric constituent (e.g., aerosols) forecast models and other environmental forecast products for worldwide AF, Army, SOF, space, and national intelligence community operational support. Uses high-performance computer servers and high-capacity storage for atmospheric and space weather modeling and worldwide environmental forecast products within DoD Data Center 14866. 

A. Numerical Weather Modeling (NWM)--Provides atmospheric and space weather modeling and worldwide environmental forecast products supporting military and intelligence operations worldwide. 

4. Product Tailoring/Warfighter Applications: 
Provides timely, local and regional target-scale weather information to operational commanders within a given Area of Responsibility and at tactical levels provides front-line weather information to warfighters in support of combat operations. Supports the 'train as you fight' concept by assuring fixed and deployable systems have a similar performance parameters and user interfaces. 

A. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET)--Provides a standard AF Weather forecaster toolkit to ingest weather data and deliver timely, tailorable, precise weather impacts to the warfighter.

PE 0305903F - COCOM MOBILE CONSOLIDATED COMMAND CENTERS (MCCC) 

Modification for the COMBATANT COMMANDER (COCOM), MOBILE CONSOLIDATED COMMAND CENTER (MCCC):  The COCOM's MCCC provides continuity of command capabilities to accomplish directed missions in the event primary command and control facilities are incapacitated.  It provides a survivable and endurable command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) capability accomplishing directed COCOM missions.  The MCCC provides C4I for Homeland Support/Homeland Defense (HLS/HLD) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM).

PE 0305906F - NCMC - ITW/AA SYSTEM 

Modification for NORAD CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX-INTEGRATED TACTICAL WARNING/ATTACK ASSESSMENT(NCMC-ITW/AA) SYSTEMS: These systems integrate and correlate missile launch, space object orbit, and air surveillance information to assess the nature of an enemy attack and issue warnings to the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of Canada, United States Secretary of Defense and warfighting Combatant Commanders (C2). Funding procures replacement for reliability and maintainability of the information systems hardware and associated systems software for Cheyenne Mountain operating locations to include legacy space defense systems at Vandenberg AFB, CA and remote interfacing sites essential for executing US Strategic Command, NORAD, Joint Force Component Commander (JFCC) space missions exercised in the Cheyenne Mountain Complex (CMC), Joint Space Program Operations Center (JSpOC), and forward operating locations.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Mission Planning Systems (MPS) Hardware program procures commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) computing systems hardware and hardware-related requirements for Air Force active duty, Guard, and Reserve units worldwide.  These computing systems provide a flexible, configurable and cost-effective range of increasing capability to meet the continuum of peacetime, contingency and wartime planning requirements.  These electronic systems provide a mission data management system that efficiently interfaces with other planning systems as well as aircraft avionics.  These computing systems are procured on a four-year life cycle replacement to effectively address and/or alleviate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.  Once procured the systems are centrally managed for all applicable AF platforms and their operational users, including Guard and Reserve Forces.

The program continues the procurement of COTS computing hardware and other devices associated with the Mission Planning Systems program.  It also continues the procurement of all capital replacement hardware used in conjunction with MPS and other pre-, post-, and in-flight mission planning software.  Together this hardware and associated software enables aircrews and other planners to plan the safest, most effective operational missions in a timely manner.  

The program procures COTS based Personal Computing (PC) Systems to include (but are not limited to) desktop computers, laptops, personal digital assistants (PDA), tablet PCs, color printers, storage devices, displays, other peripherals, software and software licenses, and other support services, that together, allow the user to produce the necessary charts and other mission-specific products required to effectively perform a variety of military missions. 

A variety of information technology, navigation and communications hardware and software packages will also be procured each year to meet the varied needs of mission planning platforms and training units.  This PC-based capability, when integrated with corresponding mission planning software releases, provides a portable, tailorable, net-centric system for aircrews to complete the mission planning function.  The procured items also enable aircrews to effectively utilize software that has been modified to stay in sync with new capabilities incorporated into select platforms via their Operational Flight Program (OFP) update process.  They also provide a mission planning capability for precision/autonomous guided munitions and can also be networked with other Theater Battle Management (TBM) systems to further tailor a platform's mission planning environment. 

The MPS procurement strategy leverages the rapid increase in PC-based technology to enable high-end computing on increasingly smaller and more mission-oriented devices.  The programs procure UNIX and PC-based systems that provide flexible, configurable, and cost effective solutions that increase tactical and strategic capabilities to meet the continuum of operations ranging from peacetime contingencies to conventional and nuclear wartime mission planning requirements.  Each segment of the program has shifted its hardware emphasis from a limited number of large, complex planning systems to more compact and personal planning devices that can be tailored to satisfy user needs.  This adjustment is a practical and efficient way to meet technology-driven challenges such as the evolutionary nature of mission planning (that necessitates recurrent hardware changes to meet overall system requirements) and advances in COTS technology that makes available new capabilities (which may lower component costs or address component obsolescence).  It is also a more effective way to address changes in the number, type, and deployment of aircraft/weapons that force changes in the number of UNIX and PC-based mission planning computers and their concept of operations.  

1. MISSION PLANNING SYSTEMS (MPS) HARDWARE:  This acquisition is a continuation of procurement efforts to provide MPS-related hardware for Air Force platforms.  The program will provide a suite of COTS-based mission planning hardware and software systems that can be integrated with USAF Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems for the operation of USAF aircraft (e.g. F-22, B-1, F-16, F-15, RC/OC-135, E-3, E-4, E-8, RQ-4, C-130, HC-130, EC-130, HH-60, KC-135, KC-46, C-5, KC-10, C-17, U-2, B-52, B-2, MC-12, T-38) and the support of USAF training requirements.  MPS allows aircrews to electronically receive tasking orders, intelligence information, target coordinates, imagery and other information.  This information is then used to organize and prepare flight (including equipment and personnel airdrop) and weapons delivery planning data (e.g., maps, charts, imagery, flight logs, radar predications, and navigation databases) that is electronically transferred to aircraft and/or precision-guided weapons.  MPS increases the combat effectiveness of Air Force aerial assets (including unmanned air vehicles, conventional and low-observable aircraft, and weapons) and Army guided delivery systems by supporting the use of sophisticated avionics and precision/autonomous guided munitions.  It helps to increase wartime sortie rates while improving aircrew and aircraft survivability and aircrew readiness.

2. PRECISION AERIAL DELIVERY SYSTEM (PADS): PADS provides the capability for direct delivery of cargo and equipment through high altitude, precision airdrops (principally with C-17 and C-130 aircraft).  Currently it consists of the Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) acquisition effort.  JPADS is a collaborative effort with the Army, USMC, and other agencies to provide aviators the ability to accurately airdrop payloads (including supplies/equipment and personnel) to units in the field from altitudes beyond the reach of some surface-to-air weaponry.  This portion of the program procures COTS-based computing hardware, support services and aerial delivery systems to enable completion of pre and in-flight mission planning functions as well as aerial delivery proficiency training in and with operational units.

                    <proc:Remarks>Unit costs vary because different types/configurations of equipment are being procured.

Mission Planning Systems (MPS) and Precision Aerial Delivery Systems (PADS) components are procured as commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) equipment using various contracting methods, vehicles and agencies. Items are procured annually via Delivery Orders (DOs) on a variety of contract vehicles (e.g. Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, and GSA and NASA SEWP IV Contract schedules) and through agencies such as AFWAY/NETCENTS II (Gunter AFB).

Mission Planning Systems (MPS) assets are centrally managed by the MPS System Support Facility (SSF) at Hill AFB.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>INTEGRATED STRATEGIC PLANNING AND ANALYSIS NETWORK (ISPAN):  The mission of USSTRATCOM is to conduct global operations in coordination with other Combatant Commands, Services, and appropriate U.S. Government agencies to deter and detect strategic attacks against the U.S. and its allies.  It provides full-spectrum global strike, and coordinated space, missile defense, and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives.  USSTRATCOM will also provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, global command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter.  ISPAN enables USSTRATCOM to carry out these missions.  It is one of DoD's most complex classified computer systems and the only national force level planning system.

The ISPAN program is comprised of two independent but complementary planning systems; the Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS) and the Global Adaptive Planning Collaborative Information Environment (GAP-CIE).  MPAS is an automated information system to support Global Strike nuclear and conventional target development and weaponeering.  MPAS includes Mission Planning, Analysis, and Decision Support tools and an Enterprise Database to sustain and support nuclear and conventional strategic war planning.  GAP-CIE provides web-enabled adaptive planning, rapid distributed Course of Action (COA) development and global situational awareness supporting both contingency and crisis planners.  ISPAN enables an effects-based approach to planning and operations; cross domain information sharing; and serves multiple planning environments.  It develops, verifies, and produces Operational Plan (OPLAN) 8010.  It also supports the USSTRATCOM family of plans construct and current Concept of Operations.  The system performs tasks ranging from creating and running Courses of Action (COAs) on threat scenarios to providing data for developing bomber aircraft crew strike mission data in digital and hard copy formats.  It includes automated data processing equipment (ADPE), multiple networks, unique processes and procedures, software, training, associated deployable and distributed data processing nodes, a test/development environment, and subsidiary systems.  The system will migrate to the new USSTRATCOM Command and Control Facility. 

ISPAN uses a four-year life-cycle replacement plan to procure required Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware (e.g. servers, storage devices, workstations, peripherals and other network components).  In some instances the hardware must be combined with commercially available software to form unique planning environments.  The programs  life cycle replacement plan for hardware follows industry standards and is used to eliminate the peaks and valleys associated with maintaining compatibility with the fast moving COTS hardware technology improvement cycle.  It also allows the program to better utilize existing manpower to install and configure the hardware systems to provide an incremental and efficient replacement of critical infrastructure components as they become obsolete.  Hardware and software procured within the program is used to support all ISPAN program increments.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in Program Element 0101313F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY17 funding continues the life-cycle procurement of commercial-based hardware and software components for the ISPAN mission system which consists of the Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS) and the Global Adaptive Planning Collaborative Information Environment (GAP CIE) efforts.  Funding procures mission system infrastructure, architecture, and related support components.  This includes COTS-based hardware and software for an operational capability lab environment to certify ISPAN applications for operational use.  Funding also provides a secure cross-domain security solution capability to enable automated data transfers between multi-level networks supporting planners worldwide on multiple enclaves. It allows for the procurement of items such as (but are not limited to) application servers, switches, storage area network (SAN), backup and recovery systems, guard solution software and other articles that will provide a secure Cross Domain Security Solution (CDSS) capability, and the life-cycle replacement of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) at development contractor sites.  Funding also provides for procurement of virtualization technology environments and distributed operations capability to support joint warfighters across geographically separated locations.  Finally, funding provides for the initial migration of the ISPAN mission system to the new USSTRATCOM Command and Control Facility.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>GLOBAL COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM AIR FORCE (GCCS-AF): The GCCS-AF program provides the common AF infrastructure hardware and software necessary to pass AF command and control (C2) data among commands, their components, and the joint GCCS. This program procures GCCS components which include, but are not limited to, servers, work stations, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software, and associated peripherals to provide users with the full suite of joint baseline capability (including the common operating picture) and AF specific applications such as the Deliberate Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) and Logistics Feasibility Analysis Capability (LOGFAC) that feed into the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES). GCCS-AF is integrated at the following locations to establish initial and full joint connectivity and operational capability across the spectrum of intelligence, operations, manpower, and logistics: AF-supported war-fighting command, Headquarters United States Air Force, Major Command headquarters (MAJCOM), numbered air forces, wings, Air National Guard (ANG) bases, Air Force Reserve (AFR) bases, and remote sites. Each site will comply with current Air Force and Department of Defense (DoD) network initiatives by employing a standardized interface among AF base-level classified C2 networks, AF base-level network control centers, and the joint Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET). This program provides a flexible open system and distributed C2 architecture necessary to support the joint GCCS. GCCS supports AF operations by installing and upgrading a site's classified C2 system through extensive use of COTS technology that adheres to AF command and control, communications, and computer architectures and standards. 

Funding for the exhibit contained in PE 0303150F: GLOBAL COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>GLOBAL COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM AIR FORCE (GCCS-AF): FY17 procurement funding procures various types and quantities of hardware and software in support of installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel. GCCS-AF will procure and install GCCS-J version 6.0 hardware and software (government-off- the-shelf and commercial-off-the-shelf) at warfighter Combatant Command (COCOM) and MAJCOM locations, providing a full spectrum of command, control, logistics, and intelligence capability from strategic to unit level operations with total joint service connectivity. GCCS-AF will continue to provide operational maintenance and support to the procured Strategic Server Enclave application and database servers, enclave protection components, and end-user equipment at multiple existing sites and support the deployment of updates to the Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) and Logistics Feasibility Analysis Capability (LOGFAC) applications. The GCCS architecture supports functional users on each base and specifically incorporates manpower and logistics functions into GCCS. GCCS-AF will continue to maintain and support a Windows baseline and server infrastructure to enable user access to the DCAPES and LOGFAC applications from any AF location. These fielding activities are consistent with the AF's Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) C2 structure and integration with DoD's emerging next generation joint C2 enabler.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>AMC Command and Control System PE 0401840F - P-40A
PE 0401840F MOBILITY COMMAND AND CONTROL:

GLOBAL MOBILITY COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2) ARCHITECTURE AIR MOBILITY COMMAND (AMC): The AMC C2 architecture is an integrated, command-wide program that supports US Air Force airlift/air refueling missions around the globe with centralized control/decentralized execution. To execute America's Global Reach mission, Air Mobility Command's 618th Air Operations Center (AOC) plans, schedules, and directs a fleet of more than 1,100 mobility aircraft.  The 618th AOC operates combat delivery, strategic airlift, air refueling, and aeromedical evacuation operations around the world. Funding for this exhibit contained in program element (PE) 0401840F. 

a. MOBILITY AIR FORCE (MAF) COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2) INFRASTRUCTURE:  Provides base wired/wireless infrastructure equipment supporting AMC's 618th AOC and AMC's 12 bases to assure connectivity to AMC's command and control (C2) systems and to ensure they remain operational at AMC bases and operating locations.  MAF C2 Infrastructure ensures connectivity with critical Air Force systems such as the Information Transport System (ITS), Global Combat Support System (GCSS) and the Global Decision Support System (GDSS); AMC's C2 systems such as the Consolidated Air Mobility Planning System (CAMPS) and Advanced Computer Flight Planning (ACFP) system and the infrastructure for Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems across AMC providing intra-base command and control for base security, emergency management, flightline operations/maintenance, and crash response.  

b. DEPLOYED SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS (DSATCOM):  Provides C2 communications capabilities for deployed Mobility C2 forces and mission support team C2 operations.  These operations rapidly install mission support communications at austere base locations where communications to support air mobility operations are nonexistent or insufficient.  The DSATCOM program is the primary funding vehicle for procuring communications equipment supporting these components.  The resources directly support C2 and In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of deployed and enroute personnel, aircraft, and cargo providing critical communications to Contingency Response Groups (CRGs).  CRGs are self-sufficient groups of multi-skilled, highly-trained airmen, representing different Air Force specialty codes, who can rapidly deploy anywhere in the world with little notice to open air bases for any follow-on mission.  The Hard-side Expandable Lightweight Air Mobile Shelter (HELAMS) is the primary weapon system providing this support.  It is a rapidly deployable, self-contained C2/ITV command center.  This shelter functions as the base command post during the initial phases of airbase build-up and contains integrated communications equipment such as radios, computers, printers and fax machines.

Special Operations Forces PE 0404011F - P-40A
PE 0404011F Special Operations Forces:

Command and Control (C2) Air Rapid Response Kits (ARRKs) are tailored packages providing temporary base operating support (BOS)(i.e., SOF living facilities, command and control (C2), armory, fuel storage, water purification, and cold weather protection), which allow Air Force Special Operations Forces (AFSOFs) to perform expeditionary deployments to austere environments before conventional/service-common BOS packages become available.  FY16 funding totals include $2M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.

FY16 funding totals include $2M for Overseas Contingency Operations.

SPECIAL TACTICS / COMBAT CONTROL PE 0408011F - P-40A
PE 0408011F AFSOC SPECIAL TACTICS/COMMAND &amp; CONTROL:

AFSOC TAC C2 program purchases enhanced communications systems and equipment essential for Special Tactics (ST) combat controllers, pararescue personnel, combat weather operators, and tactical air control parties to perform their mission.  The ST operators use this equipment to gather and transmit assault zone suitability and weather data and to perform tactical airfield/assault landing/drop zone operations.</proc:Description>

PE 0401840F MOBILITY COMMAND AND CONTROL

MOBILITY AIR FORCE (MAF) COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2) INFRASTRUCTURE:  FY17 funding continues procurement of wired and wireless base network infrastructure equipment to include cabling, routers, bridges, hubs, repeaters and switches as well as Land Mobile Radio (LMR) trunking systems to ensure information technology remains current and interoperability with AMC C2 systems is maintained to meet the needs of the warfighter and AMC's worldwide mobility mission.

DEPLOYED SATCOM (DSATCOM):  FY17 funding will be used to continue refurbishment/capital equipment replacement supporting Hard-side Expandable Lightweight Air Mobile Shelters (HELAMS).

This line also funds mitigation efforts for Air Force vulnerabilities identified in Air Force and Joint higher headquarters inspections and vulnerability assessments, procurement of intrusion detection systems which greatly enhance the effectiveness of AF antiterrorism program efforts to detect, deter, and defend service members, civilian employees, family members, facilities, and other AF resources around the globe against terrorist attacks.

General Skill Training PE 0804731F - P-40A
BASIC MILITARY TRAINING (BMT) SURVEILLANCE SECURITY SYSTEM: Due to allegations of misconduct by Military Training Instructors (MTIs) at BMT, AETC/CC directed an investigation to identify issues that place Airmen at risk in their training environment. This investigation was led by AF/CVS and revealed weaknesses in existing detection measures. SECAF/CSAF support findings and actions AETC is taking to prevent misconduct from reoccurring.

The purpose of the camera surveillance effort is to deter, monitor, and act upon the misconduct of Basic Trainees and/or Military Training Instructors. The goal is the surveillance of all common areas throughout all BMT facilities to include Airman Training Complexes (ATC) and Dining/Classroom Facilities (DCF). The surveillance system monitors personnel within all training facilities and provides a central storage solution expandable to maintain three years of video data.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>INTEGRATED BASE DEFENSE SECURITY SYSTEM (IBDSS): Funding is provided for procurement, design &amp; engineering, modeling &amp; simulation, infrastructure and allied support, installation, integration,
training, acceptance testing, Interim Contractor Support (ICS) and interim spares for Base Physical Security Systems (BPSS) Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The funding also procures, installs and sustains a variety of electronic security alarms, sensors, and related systems to detect and provide early warning of potential threats against Air Force Protection Level (PL) 1,2,3. and 4 mission critical assets. Funding also supports the Nuclear (PL-1N) Weapon Storage Areas (WSAs) located throughout the CONUS and vault storage areas at main operating bases in Europe to meet long tern physical security requirements in the face of enduring and emerging threats. This also includes upgrading existing system to ensure required capability for vault storage areas and associated intrusion detection, access control and assessment systems requirements, In Accordance With(IAW) USAF, EUCOM and NATO/SHAPE requirements. The funds also provide for upgrades, refurbishment, replacement or installation of new fences (required for sensor platforms) and/or lighting systems (to support the surveillance/assessment functions).

We are currently restructuring IBDSS into discrete block upgrades.

Milestone/Development Status

For Force Protection Commercial Off The Shelf (FP COTS) market research, evaluation and testing. The FP COTS testing applies to all available technologies (delay, denial, detection, assessment, communication display, access control and power) which are considered effective for AF physical security use. This program supports the maintenance and test support at Site C 3 and the Cold Weather Test Site (CWTS), as annotated in DoD Directive 3200.11, listing the 46th Test Wing (TW) as a Major Range and Test facility, conducting developmental and operational testing as the primary mission.

            <proc:Description>The Combat Training Range program procures electronic telecommunication and instrumentation equipment and threat systems for training ranges worldwide to satisfy EW training capability requirements. It also procures range scoring systems and replacement equipment for electronics no longer logistically supportable. This P-1 line also procures Target Control System (TCS) ground subsystems for target drones.

PE 0207429F COMBAT TRAINING RANGE EQUIPMENT 

JOINT THREAT EMITTER (JTE): The Joint Threat Emitter is designed to train aircrews to survive in a combat environment against Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) and Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA) threats. The JTE simulates SA-2, SA-3, SA-6, SA-13 and AAA threat signals which interact with the aircraft Radar Warning Receiver and Electronic Countermeasure system to provide realistic Electronic Warfare training environments for pilots and crew members. The JTE is intended to reduce range manpower and resource requirements by replacing legacy systems as they face increasing supportability issues. The JTE leverages Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) where possible. The JTE system uses either a mobile command-and-control unit (MC2U) or a Fixed Command and Control Unit (FC2U). Funding will also be used to purchase services applicable to the acquisition, site activation and implementation of the ground system including range site surveys, installation and training.

RANGE EQUIPMENT: This effort delivers range infrastructure and equipment. One such effort is the Joint Advanced Weapon Scoring System (JAWSS) program, which consists of Navy-developed scoring systems that upgrade the weapon (bombing and gunnery) and laser spot scoring on ranges. The equipment provide multiple new capabilities, to include scoring of day or night operations, production of a data stream with immediate displays, and results transmission to the pilot providing immediate feedback previously unavailable to aircrew. Other Electronic Warfare (EW) threat subsystems such as noise and spoofing jammers as well as radar and detection systems, data link connectivity and target shells will be procured in order to monitor and control an extended, realistic target environment for simulated ordnance delivery and aircrew training for airborne laser designators 

RANGE COMMUNICATIONS: The Range Communication (RIMCOM) program provides communication systems to connect various simulated surface-to-air (SAM) threat systems on Air Force ranges to simulate an integrated air defense system (IADS) and to provide blue force command and control for range operations. Infrastructure modernization includes replacing obsolete equipment, establishing a Live Mission Operations Center (LMOC) to support improved mission debriefs and future Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) aircrew training, and standardization of all training range communications systems to support LVC training missions.  In FY17, this program focuses on procurement of the LMOC, in addition to fiber optic cabling, microwave, UHF, and VHF radios and antennas, data links and repeater stations, power subsystems, control systems, and cryptological equipment for unclassified and secure communications for all Combat Training Ranges, in addition to studies, analysis, and integration efforts for the LMOC.  

LEGACY SYSTEMS: This program procures modifications for multiple obsolete legacy range threat systems (RTS) to extend their serviceable life. Legacy RTS including Miniature Multiple Threat Emitter System (Mini-MUTES); Multiple Threat Emitter System (MUTES); Modular Threat Emitter (MTE); Tactical Range Threat Generator (TRTG); Unmanned Threat Emitter (UMTE); and Band Simulator (Band Sim); and their associated mission support equipment/software. 

PE 0305116F AERIAL TARGETS
 
TARGET CONTROL SYSTEMS (TCS): Data Link System Replacement (DLSr): The current Data Link system units in use at Tyndall AFB contain many obsolete parts and are no longer repairable due to lack of replacement parts. Repairs are made today through cannibalization of other units currently in use or intended as backup units, and the population of these units is becoming depleted with less than 3 "full up spares”  left. The DLSr will be compatible with legacy targets operation on the Tyndall range. The DLSr will integrate into current Gulf Range Drone Control System (GRDCS) system. The DLSr will be able to be remotely configured to function as a relay, master, or slave to better enable the dynamic weapon system evaluation program (WSEP) environment and incorporate advancements in targets such as the QF-16

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>This program, RIMCOM P-5, is a new start.

JOINT THREAT EMITTER (JTE): FY17 funding requested is to procure additional JTE fixed command and control unit and the associated equipment.

RANGE COMMUNICATIONS (RIMCOM):  FY17 funding is requested for range communications equipment to provide an integrated air defense system (IADS) capability on Air Force ranges.  FY17 expenditures will focus on studies, analyses to support integration efforts for the Live Mission Operations Center (LMOC) as well as procurement of equipment for all combat training ranges.  RIMCOM is an FY17 new start.

RANGE EQUIPMENT:   FY17 funding requested to replace equipment that is no longer logistically supportable.

LEGACY SYSTEMS: FY17 funding requested to modify UMTEs to replace the obsolete electronic attack receivers with the common electronic attack receiver (CEAR).

            <proc:Description>The Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) portfolio modernizes the systems necessary to effectively provide assured communications connectivity between the President and the strategic deterrence forces in stressed environments.
 
Global Aircrew Strategic Network Terminal (Global ASNT) replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces, Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS), and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).  Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs), Force Management messages, and Force Direction messages and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews. 
 
Global ASNT is being fielded in separate capability increments. 

Global ASNT Inc 1 fields required Extremely High Frequency/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (EHF/AEHF) capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals and Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical - Terminal (SMART-T) equipment. FY15 was the first year of Increment 1 procurement funding to support pre-production activities. The majority of pre-production support activities will be conducted in FY16 and FY17 in advance of the Milestone C decision in 2QFY17.

Global ASNT Inc 2 delivers an Aircrew Alerting System (AAS) consisting of personal and general alerting equipment, and High Frequency (HF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) capabilities.  Increment 2 replaces inadequate, unsustainable Electromagnetic Pulse Hardened Dispersal Communication (EHDC) systems and Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE) systems.  Procurement funding begins in FY20 to perform pre-production activities in support of Milestone C decision in 1QFY21. 
   
Global ASNT Inc 3 is planned to deliver a Very Low Frequency (VLF)/Low Frequency (LF) receive capability. 

Common Very Low Frequency (VLF)/Low Frequency (LF) Receiver (CVR) Increment 2 (CVR Inc 2) will deliver a survivable, beyond-line-of-sight path for Emergency Action Message (EAM) reception. The intent of CVR Inc 2 is to develop and produce a common VLF/LF receiver with an interoperable waveform for future platform integration to include airborne and ground based nodes and to improve system performance and reduce supportability costs through commonality.  Procurement funding begins in FY20 to perform pre-production activities in support of a Milestone C decision in 1QFY21.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0303131F.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Global Combat Support System (GCSS) is a family of information technology systems that provide integration and interoperability between combat support functions and command and control to support the operational needs of the warfighter.  It directly supports Command, Control, Communication, Computers, and Information (C4I) for the warfighter and Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Joint Vision 2020.  The GCSS-Air Force Family of Systems (FOS) includes standard base-level combat support applications which provide warfighters with a "one update-one time" processing environment.  The following systems provide the key support foundation for the Air Force's global engagement strategy and evolution to DoD Joint Information Environment (JIE) leveraging Core Data Centers (CDCs) and DISA-brokered cloud capabilities through GCSS-AF.

PE 0303141F GLOBAL COMBAT SUPPORT SYSTEM

GLOBAL COMBAT SUPPORT SYSTEM-AIR FORCE (GCSS-AF):  This program element encompasses GCSS-AF's Integration Framework and its presentation layer for operational users.  This infrastructure and provided Air Force enterprise common services are a critical basis for the target common computing environment (CCE) effort which Air Force Guidance Memorandum has directed for all new and modernizing IT applications.  This effort is the Air Force evolution to DoD Joint Information Environment (JIE) leveraging Core Data Centers (CDCs) and DISA-brokered cloud capabilities in compliance with the Air Force Information Technology (AF IT) baselines.  This framework is a set of baseline-driven platform and infrastructure services in both physical and virtual hosting environments.  It is comprised of development tools, an initial set of enterprise services, and governance processes critical to JIE management.  As the customer interfaces on GCSS-AF, the presentation layer provides the worldwide standard security and single sign-on for accessing a variety of functional systems. The framework uses additional security features of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and AF Directory Services, negating duplication of security features in each of the functional systems being modernized within the GCSS-AF Family of Systems (FoS). This effort procures application, security, web, and proxy servers, software and associated licenses, and engineering support.

PE 0708012F LOGISTICS SUPPORT ACTIVITY

CARGO MOVEMENT OPERATIONS SYSTEM (CMOS): CMOS supports base-level and theater distribution management.   More than 235 Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, Army, NSA, and DCMA activities employ CMOS through its web-based and deployable configurations. CMOS continues to provide effective traffic management support to the warfighter for both peacetime and contingency operations. CMOS prepares and manages all movement documentation, electronically interfaces with shippers, commercial carriers, and receiving activities, and provides bar code/radio frequency identification (RFID) capability.  It provides in-transit visibility to DOD and commercial carriers, aids planning and managing force deployment, and supports the deployed Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) warfighter through deployable and standard CMOS architectures.

            <proc:Description>Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System Increment 1 (DEAMS Inc 1).

To enhance transparency, in FY 2015 DEAMS Other Procurement Air Force (OPAF) funding was transferred from Weapon System Code (WSC) 834430, Global Combat Support System - Air Force Family of Systems (GCSS-AF FOS) to WSC 834470 DEAMS.  Prior to FY 2015, DEAMS OPAF funding was shown in WSC 834430, GCSS-AF FOS. 

Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will bring the Air Force in compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.

DEAMS Inc 1 is planned as an eight-release program:
 
Release 1 - Air Mobility Command (AMC) without Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)
Release 2 - AMC with TWCF, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Rome
Release 3 - Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Education and Training Command (AETC)

            <proc:Description>Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS) is an integrated battle management system used to plan, execute, and assess an air campaign.  It provides automated planning tools enabling consistent, coordinated battle management at entities ranging from the force level (Air Operations Centers [AOC]) to the unit level (wings/squadrons) for operations and intelligence functions.  TBMCS is a United States Air Force system with Joint interest responsible for generation and dissemination of the air tasking order and interoperates with allied units. 

Unit Command and Control (UC2): Provides the wing and base commanders, and their battle staffs with timely and accurate information for effective decision making.  UC2 also provides secure, automated, deployable, and distributed wing-level command and control system with connectivity to TBMCS - Force Level (TBMCS FL) systems. 

Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2): Provides PRC2 services supporting all Combatant Commands, Joint Services and other government agencies.  Capabilities include web-based access to isolated personnel reports for all Department of Defense (DoD) personnel, C2 tools for performing command and control of recovery efforts for downed airmen/isolated ground troops, and rapid identification of personnel in distress.  PRC2 is used within AOC/Areas Of Responsibility (AOR), Joint Personnel Recovery Centers, and Rescue Coordination Centers to provide the capabilities and services for planning and executing recovery of isolated personnel, and rapidly collaborate, disseminate, and store time-sensitive personnel recovery information. 

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

            <proc:Description>The Air Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS), AN/USQ-163 Falconer, the senior element of the Theater Air Control System, is the weapon system that the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) provides the Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) for monitoring, planning, executing and assessing theater-wide air and space operations in support of the air battle campaign to meet the Combined/Joint Force Commander's (C/JFC) objectives. 

The AOC WS funding provides system hardware, software, technical documents, capital equipment replacement, core radio and initial training to standardize and sustain the AOC WS.  The fielding and capital equipment replacement consist of AOCs and their associated support sites (e.g., help desk, Formal Training Unit, experimental sites, and Air Reserve Component sites). 

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities. 

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0207410F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>1.  FIELDING: The AOC WS contains over 40 Command and Control (C2) systems/applications that are continually being updated.  The AOC WS 10.1 integrates these changes as well as provides periodic Capital Equipment Replacement to keep the AOC WS interoperable, supportable, and compliant (e.g., certification and accreditation).  Fielding will provide Joint C2 interoperability, and respond to the highest priority Combatant Command (CCMD) interoperability problems including: (a) incorporating fixes to shortfalls in interactions with CCMD targeting support systems, (b) enhancing the effectiveness of the operational picture to respond to the proliferation of sensors and (c) handling data interface changes being experienced with older third party program deliveries.  Major subsystems have enhanced their security profile and this fielding will serve as a reaccreditation of the overall AOC Weapon System baseline.  This sustainment profile provides an excellent transition point for the AOC WS 10.2 modernization baseline.  Primary efforts in fielding include Capital Equipment Replacement and Recurring Events (RE).  
 
There are three distinct categories of AOCs:  Geographic, Functional (planned name change to Global), and assorted AOC Support Functions (Help Desk, Formal Training Unit, Operational Support Facility (OSF) and Air Reserve Component sites).  While all sites start with the standardized 10.1 baseline, each is specifically tailored to the needs of the associated Geographic CCMD or Functional (planned name change to Global) Command.  Thus, as no two AOCs are alike when a Capital Equipment Replacement or RE is accomplished, each site is unique and requires its own specifically designed site-engineered fielding plan and associated hardware, which drives differences in site specific (i.e., unit) costs.

Funding may be used to alleviate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.

     a.  CAPITAL EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT: FY17 funds will be used to keep the AOCs and their associated support sites up-to-date by replacing end-of-life/end of support components with solutions that will bridge between 10.1 and 10.2 (e.g., core radio package).  FY17 Capital Equipment Replacement will address numerous commercial end-of-life and DMS components that must be resolved.  Differences in site specific setup (due to variations between Geographic CCMD or Functional (planned name change to Global) Command needs) will drive differences in site specific requirements.  Therefore, there is no meaningful way to measure quantities as the Capital Equipment Replacement of each site is significantly different.

     b.  RECURRING EVENTS (RE): REs are regularly scheduled third party application updates to keep the AOC interoperable, supportable, and compliant (e.g., certification and accreditation).  They are normally comprised of hardware/software changes/updates and security patches.  Each RE is based on warfighter-validated needs that require updates to the AOC WS 10.1.  FY17 will fund REs, periodic maintenance upgrades, emergency fixes, and other activities (e.g., security fixes, testing activities) potentially affecting some or all AOCs (Geographical/Support/Functional (planned name change to Global)) and their associated support sites.  Additionally, differences in site specific setup (due to variations between Geographic CCMD or Functional (planned name change to Global) Command needs) will drive differences in site specific requirements.  Therefore, there is no meaningful way to measure quantities as the fielding of an RE to each site is significantly different.

     c.  FIELDING SYSTEM PROGRAM OFFICE (SPO) SUPPORT: FY17 funds will be used to provide government oversight, technical expertise, and program office support associated with the fielding of AOC.  Differences in site specific setup (due to variations between mission specific needs and differences in site type i.e., Geographic vs. Functional (planned name change to Global) vs. Associated Support Site vs. Reserve Components) will drive differences in site specific requirements (e.g., time required, hardware required and software required).

     d.  TEST SUPPORT (46 Test Squadron [46TS]): FY17 funds will be used to provide government oversight and technical expertise associated with the testing of AOC.

2.  PROGRAM MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION (PMA): The breakdown of this activity includes the following:

     a.  PROGRAM SUPPORT: FY17 funding includes provisions for government contract oversight, technical expertise, and program management office support associated with standardization of the AOC WS 10.1 baseline.

     b.  TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION: No FY17 funding requested.

                    <proc:Remarks>1).  Due to different levels of complexity, differences in equipment to be updated and length of required time necessary for modification total cost will fluctuate between fiscal years.

2).  Differences in site specific setup (due to variations between mission specific needs and differences in site type i.e., Geographic vs. Functional (planned name change to Global) vs. Associated Support Site vs. Reserve Components) will drive differences in site specific requirements (e.g., time required, hardware required and software required).  This makes quantification impossible, as there is no single baseline to produce a quantity against.  Per DoD Financial Regulation 7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 4, Exhibit P-5 Instruction, the quantities in the P-5 are left blank as there is no way to report applicable quantities.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>The Air Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS), AN/USQ-163 Falconer, the senior element of the Theater Air Control System (TACS), is the weapon system the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) provides the Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) for planning, executing, and assessing theater-wide air and space operations.  The C/JFACC provides air, space and cyber support to the Combined/Joint Forces Commander (C/JFC) by coordinating, deconflicting and assessing the progress of various weapon systems to advance the C/JFC's campaign.  The AOC WS develops operations strategy and planning documents.  The weapon system also disseminates tasking orders; executes day-to-day peacetime and combat air, space and cyber operations; and provides rapid reaction to immediate situations by exercising positive control of friendly forces.

Relative to AOC 10.1, the AOC 10.2 system is expected to provide faster speed of command, improved cyber security and data integrity, and afford easier and faster integration of 3rd Party capabilities.  The AOC 10.2 funding provides system hardware, software, technical documents, and initial training to field the weapon system 10.2 program baseline. The fielding efforts focus on, but are not limited to, six Geographic AOCs.

The AOC 10.2 is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. The program completed contractor System Acceptance Test (SAT) in July 2015 and Developmental Test 1 (DT1) in September 2015; Developmental Test 2 (DT2) is projected in May 2016.  Milestone C (MS-C) is projected for June 2016. Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) Phase 1 is projected to begin August 2016 and continue through November 2016. IOT&amp;E Phase 2 is projected to begin December 2016 and continue through February 2017.  Full Deployment Decision (FDD) is projected for June 2017. These efforts are using Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funds under PE 0605458F.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207410F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>1. PACKAGE FIELDING: The breakdown of this activity includes the following: 

a. INITIAL FIELDING: FY17 funds will be used to support the procurement of hardware, software, warranties, support, and installation of the 10.2 baseline system to Geographic AOCs. 

b. SITE INSTALLATION TESTING: FY17 funds will be used to prepare and conduct site testing, primarily conducted by the 46th Test Squadron (46TS).  46TS conducts functional and cyber testing of fielded systems.

c. FIELDING SUPPORT: FY17 funds will be used to provide technical expertise required to field AOC. 

d. TRAINING: In conjunction with the 10.2 fielding, FY17 funds will be used for initial training on the 10.2 weapon system, which will be provided to site operators, network administrators, and system administrators.

2. SUPPORT: The breakdown of this activity includes the following: 

a. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION (PMA): FY17 funding includes provisions for government contract oversight, technical expertise, and program management office support associated with 10.2 baseline standardization of the AOC WS.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Remarks>Due to variations between mission specific needs, differences in site specific setup will drive differences in site specific requirements (e.g., time required, hardware required and software required).  The calculated unit costs are representative but not actual.

The FY16 PB described the Geographic AOC fielding plan with installations of 1 / 4 / 1 in FYs 16 / 17 / 18.  AOC 10.2 development slips caused the Air Force to reconsider the fielding plan.  The 
revised Geographic AOC fielding plan is 1 / 2 / 3 in FYs 16 / 17 / 18.  The Air Force is evaluating the FY18 funding needs to complete this plan.</proc:Remarks>

The calculated unit costs are representative but not actual.

The FY16 PB described the Geographic AOC fielding plan with installations of 1 / 4 / 1 in FYs 16 / 17 / 18.  AOC 10.2 development slips caused the Air Force to reconsider the fielding plan.  The 
revised Geographic AOC fielding plan is 1 / 2 / 3 in FYs 16 / 17 / 18.  The Air Force is evaluating the FY18 funding needs to complete this plan.</proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>

            <proc:Description>In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the armed forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities. 

BASE INFORMATION TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE (BITI), formerly known as INFORMATION TRANSPORT SYSTEM (ITS): BITI delivers the Air Force cyberspace network and integrated infrastructure for over 170 fixed Air Force installations (active duty, reserve, and Air National Guard (ANG)) and Geographically Separated Units (GSU) at approved locations. Integrated BITI will have a consolidated cyber capability addressing emerging cyber threats to infrastructure. BITI capabilities encompass all optical systems, digital voice/data/video systems, commercial devices, unified capabilities and wireless capabilities. The end result of a Turnkey project is a high-speed packet switching and circuit transport of critical information among core buildings and mission areas on a base. Additionally, BITI provides a robust and secure wireless infrastructure that incorporates high-availability and multi-tiered network connections at approved facilities requiring remote access. The efforts in this program budget line through its various increments and major projects, coupled with the efforts from the Air Force Network budget line enable the fielding, support and sustainment of standard, enterprise solutions for the entire Air Force Intranet from the individual base communications closets to the Air Force gateways and all the components and systems in-between in cyberspace. As Unified Capabilities (UC) evolves, BITI will respond with expanded bandwidth to provide the throughput necessary.

BITI will ensure that Air Force operating locations have sufficient infrastructure, bandwidth, and overall network capability to support the current and future communication needs of the Air Force and Joint-Command warfighter via reliable and survivable information transport with sufficient capacity and capability to meet the classified and unclassified data, voice, video, imagery, and telemetry requirements at each installed location. 

BITI Turnkey: Deploys complete BITI system/sub-system infrastructure/equipment for over 170 fixed Air Force installations (active duty, reserve, and ANG) and GSU at approved locations. 

BITI Turnkey Modification: Follow on full base internal network modifications for system/sub-system infrastructure. Turnkey Modifications are completed on bases that have already received a Turnkey. As requirements have evolved, base missions have changed and some bases that have already received an earlier Turnkey may not have the fiber needed for the current Base Area Network spec. The Turnkey Modifications expands on the existing outside and inside plant, but not to the extent of an initial Turnkey. The last three Turnkey Modifications started in FY15 and will finish in FY17. After completion of these last Turnkey Modifications, all BITI base work will be Recapitalizations. 

BITI Recapitalization: Replaces critical "backbone" infrastructure of network equipment installed as part of Turnkeys on a routine basis for fielded systems for over 170 fixed Air Force installations (active duty, reserve, and Air National Guard (ANG)) and Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) at approved locations. 

Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0303112F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>BITI:  FY17 funding includes, but is not limited to, implementation and upgrades to broadband, fiber-optic digital information transport networks to provide mission-critical information transfer capabilities at fixed Air Force bases (Active Duty, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard) and selected geographically separated unit locations.  Procurement efforts include, but are not limited, site surveys, installations, and interim contractor support (ICS).

BITI Turnkey Modification:  FY17 delivery will modify the complete system infrastructure/equipment on bases that have already received a Turnkey.  The last six installations started taking place in FY15 and will finish in FY17.

BITI Recapitalization:  FY17 replace BITI Turnkey fielded systems for over 170 fixed Air Force installations.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Remarks>Unit cost has significant variability due to size and complexity of bases/projects. A quantity is defined as a base location site survey or install and is projected based on mission requirements and funding availability.

Manpower (consisting of DMS &amp; PMA) is combined Operations &amp; Support and Acquisition cost.
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION (PMA): PMA BITI program supports the operation of the program office in its management and oversight role. PMA supports the BITI and the Base Information Infrastructure (BII) Program with engineering and technical support, as well as, support activities for the program.

DIRECT MISSION SUPPORT (DMS): DMS for BITI includes all support associated with equipment installation, engineering technical orders, sustainment engineering, and implementation. This includes the initial bed down and operability testing, technical interchange meetings, interim contractor support and events associated with fielding both hardware and software products, and maintaining configuration control of fielded products.

Funding for Turnkey projects end in 2015, all other funding line items continue through 2027. 2016 and beyond are solely recapitalizations.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>No efforts within this exhibit are new starts. 

The AFNet exhibit includes both weapon system and non-weapon system requirements. In FY16, all AFNet weapon systems began a transition into new PEs. AFNet Weapon Systems in this exhibit are defined as follows: (1) Air Force Cyberspace Defense (ACD),(2) Cyberspace Security and Control System (CSCS), and (3) Air Force Intranet Control (AFINC). Requirements for ACD are transitioning to PE 0208088F and CSCS &amp; AFINC are transitioning to 0303089F. 

AFNet provides Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions to implement, deliver and upgrade installation processing nodes and boundaries, AF Gateways, enterprise network security, network situational awareness and C2 capabilities, and allows for the interface with and assured movement of information from terrestrial, air and space-based networks, thus enabling Air Force Information Operations (AFINOps). All funds used for AFNet Systems support the continued establishment and transformation of the AFINOps construct toward the standards and specifications of the DoD Joint Information Environment (JIE). The procurement efforts in this program budget line includes, but are not limited to, equipment purchase, engineering/integration, certification and accreditation, deployment, training equipment/systems, associated training and interim contractor support. Procurements implement technology and capabilities within the AFNet in accordance with the DoD IT Road map, AF Information Dominance Flight Plan, AF Cyber blueprint and the AF Network Action Plan. All activities may incorporate support to other program elements across the Air Force Information Enterprise in accordance with SAF/A6 CIO direction, the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) and the Joint Information Environment (JIE) strategy.

PE 0207425F, AF NETWORK OPS AND COMMAND COMM 

This PE was an FY16 single year PE placeholder specifically set up to execute AFNet requirements until transition to Weapon System PEs 0208088F &amp; 0303089F in FY17.

PE 0208088F, AF DEFENSIVE CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS (ACD) WEAPON SYSTEM
This PE is not a new start. Requirements for ACD have been funded previously in 0303112F and 0207425F as part of the AFNet 835080 P-Doc. Funds may be used for other AFNet requirements if required.

Procures and installs active defensive counter cyberspace operations and situational awareness capabilities in a Defensive Cyberspace Operations role to achieve cyberspace superiority for assigned missions. ACD procurements allow for 24/7/365 monitoring and defense of US Air Force and US Central Command, and Third Party SIPR/NIPR computer networks against hostile attacks as well as intrusion detection, network traffic analysis, network forensics analysis, countermeasure development and execution, and incident response. ACD provides indication and warning, correlation, logging, vulnerability remediation, assessment, process management, blocking, vulnerability identification, investigation and containment. In addition, the ACD provides CNDSP (Computer Network Defense Service Provider) service system upgrades to the AFNet and several third party entities including Joint Strike Fighter, USTRANSCOM, and others. Efforts include, but are not limited to: 

Host Based Security System upgrades, Next Generation Firewall and Full Packet Capture and Data Analytics Enterprise.

PE 0301400F, SPACE SUPERIORITY INTELLIGENCE

This PE executes requirements for SSI. Funds may be used for other AFNet requirements if required.

Cyber Situational Awareness Weapon System (CSAWS): Procures and installs equipment to connect 24th AF unfiltered traffic flow to 25th AF for PAD (Processing, Analysis and Distribution) enabling the first AF Cyber ISR collection and processing capability. Provides ISR based adversary cyber activity Indications and Warnings (I&amp;W) for Situational Awareness (SA). The effort procures a dedicated AF Cyber ISR platform (Remote Data Collector and Remote Data Processor) array that connects to the highest level at the network gateway locations to obtain unfiltered net-flow and packet capture (PCAP). This data is moved via long-haul to the 25th AF El Dorado PAD systems for analysis. The fusion of all source intelligence and net flow analysis provides actionable CTA (Cyber Threat Advisories) reports to cyber operators for the appropriate and proactive actions.

PE 0303089F, CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS SYSTEMS

This PE executes requirements for both AFINC and CSCS weapon systems. Funds may be used for other AFNet requirements if required.

(1) AFINC: Procures and installs equipment for network operations, network defense and overall management of the AF NIPRNet Gateways as well as the Air Force discrete requirements associated with the Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS). Efforts include, but are not limited to:
AFNet NIPR Gateways (MAC-1 system) and SIPR Gateways (GW), which deliver critical network defense capabilities for the AF enterprise with over 800k users directly supporting flying, maintenance, space and cyber operations across the full range of military operations. GWs prevent and detect unauthorized network infiltration attempts, automatically initiating network defense countermeasures eliminating adversary ability to gain access to the enterprise which would diminish the AF information defense posture. GWs directly support cyber operations worldwide enabling war-fighting missions. Funding enables modification and equipment replacement for the system and its sub-components to respond to growing mission requirements and evolving cyber threats. Includes recapitalization of the Integrated Management System (IMS), which provides for real-time centralized management of network devices, and unifies the management/defense of AF networks and assets, as well as procures equipment upgrades that directly relate to the migration of AF traffic and technology transition from the AFNet NIPR Gateways to the Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS). 

(2) CSCS: Procures and installs capabilities contributing to cyber mission assurance, including proactive defense and persistent network operations for the Air Force and the Air Force-provisioned portions of the DoD Information Network (DoDIN) and the Air Force Information Network (AFIN). CSCS modifications support the following activities: fault resolution activities to maintain operational capabilities; lead-in coordinating activities at base-level Network Control Centers for necessary network security actions; monitoring of AF network services; managing of boundary protection devices and the Air Force network infrastructure; and continuous network situational awareness. Efforts include, but are not limited to: 

Data Center Consolidation and migration to the Joint Information Environment (JIE); upgrade to the Core Services and the Air Force Vulnerability Management (AFVM) and Network Management.

PE 0303112F, AIR FORCE COMMUNICATION (AIRCOM)

In FY17, funding in this PE will reallocate to the CSCS, ACD, and AFINC weapon system PEs to fund their block mods. As part of the transition of AFNet to the three weapon systems, AF will realign funding into the weapon system PEs in a future budget cycle.

Funding for this exhibit contained in PEs 0204725F, 0208088F, 0301400F, 0303089F, 0303112F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY17 AFNET (835080) funding provides for, but is not limited to, procurement &amp; modification of the installed and supported critical classified and unclassified information equipment capabilities for the Air Force Network (AFNet) Systems and modification efforts within all three major weapon system components (ACD, AFINC &amp; CSCS).

                    <proc:Description>No efforts within this exhibit are new starts. 

The AFNet exhibit includes both weapon system and non-weapon system requirements. 

This PE executes requirements for both CSCS and AFINC weapon systems. Funds may be used for other AFNet requirements if required.

(1) AFINC: Procures and installs equipment for network operations, network defense and overall management of the AF NIPRNet Gateways as well as the Air Force discrete requirements associated with the Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS). Efforts include, but are not limited to:
AFNet NIPR Gateways (MAC-1 system) and SIPR Gateways (GW), which deliver critical network defense capabilities for the AF enterprise with over 800k users directly supporting flying, maintenance, space and cyber operations across the full range of military operations. GWs prevent and detect unauthorized network infiltration attempts, automatically initiating network defense countermeasures eliminating adversary ability to gain access to the enterprise which would diminish the AF information defense posture. GWs directly support cyber operations worldwide enabling war-fighting missions. Funding enables modification and equipment replacement for the system and its sub-components to respond to growing mission requirements and evolving cyber threats. Includes recapitalization of the Integrated Management System (IMS), which provides for real-time centralized management of network devices, and unifies the management/defense of AF networks and assets, as well as procures equipment upgrades that directly relate to the migration of AF traffic and technology transition from the AFNet NIPR Gateways to the Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS). Includes recapitalization of the Integrated Management System (IMS), which provides for real-time centralized management of network devices, and unifies the management/defense of AF networks and assets.

(2) CSCS: Procures and installs capabilities contributing to cyber mission assurance, including proactive defense and persistent network operations for the Air Force and the Air Force-provisioned portions of the DoD Information Network (DoDIN) and the Air Force Information Network (AFIN). CSCS modifications support the following activities: fault resolution activities to maintain operational capabilities; lead-in coordinating activities at base-level Network Control Centers for necessary network security actions; monitoring of AF network services; managing of boundary protection devices and the Air Force network infrastructure; and continuous network situational awareness. Efforts include, but are not limited to: 
Data Center Consolidation and migration to the Joint Information Environment (JIE); upgrades to Core Services and Air Force Vulnerability Management (AFVM) and Network Management.

FY17 will procure upgrades for CSCS and AFINC base on 1067 requests. CSCS includes, but is not limited to, ACAS upgrades, Area Processing Center and Regional Data Center Consolidations, and Installation Processing Note (IPN) Boundary Effort modification. AFINC includes, but is not limited to, Gateway e-mail security/DNS upgrades.

            <proc:Description>JOINT COMMUNICATIONS SUPPORT ELEMENT (JCSE): JCSE, assigned under Joint Enabling Capabilities Command, US Transportation Command, is the only joint Department of Defense (DoD) unit specifically formed to provide command, control, communications, and computers (C4) systems support for Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) contingency operations worldwide. The Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE) mission is to provide, on short notice, those critical communications required to support Joint Task Force support (JTF) and Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF) headquarters. These assets support the war-fighter's ability to deploy rapidly and immediately provide the positive command and control required. This support includes contingency and crisis communications for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Combatant Commands, Services, Defense agencies, non-Defense agencies, and foreign governments. The program goals include meeting emerging real-world operational requirements with the maximum capabilities, smallest footprint, lowest operations and maintenance costs, and seamless integration with the global information grid. Per Defense Planning Guidance (DPG), the Air Force is mandated to fund 1 /3rd fair share of JCSE's validated equipment replacement plan.  

Funding for this exhibit in contained in PE 0207422F, Deployable Command, Control, and Communications (C3) Systems.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>JCSE: FY2017 base funding in the amount of $5.182M procures communications equipment based on Strategic Planning Guidance; which includes the maximum capabilities for large and small aperture mobile satellite systems, Everything over Internet Protocol (EoIP), Airborne/En-Route, and terrestrial and single-channel equipment. Currently employed commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment is approaching the end of its life cycle and requires replacement to meet the program goals which include meeting emerging real-world operational requirements with maximum capabilities, smallest possible footprint, lowest operations and maintenance costs, and seamless integration with the global information grid. This equipment is a critical part of Command and Control communications packages that provide direct operational support to joint forces and HQ elements deployed to austere locations around the globe. Per the Planning Guidance, the Air Force is mandated to fund one-third of the fair share of JCSE's validated equipment replacement plan. JCSE's Program is built/restructured based on Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service Components' requirements and emerging technologies. Service's influence JCSE's spending plan through recommendations in concert with MDAP schedules, ensuring that Service dollars meet Joint Service requirements.</proc:Justification>

HQ USCENTCOM's mission is to work with its national and international partners in promoting development and cooperation among nations, responding to crises, and deterring or defeating state and transnational aggression in order to establish regional security and stability across its entire Area of Responsibility (AOR). Since USCENTCOM's AOR, covering the Middle East, includes the challenges of regional stability and violent extremists, this Combatant Command's mission is critical in regards to the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). To meet its mission responsibilities across this geographical expanse, HQ USCENTCOM must rely heavily on Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) systems capable of achieving full spectrum information superiority. 

USCENTCOM COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEMS: Effort will provide end of life cycle replacement for, but not limited to, Command and Control (C2) systems (thin client, server, etc), Joint Information Environment (JIE), classified and unclassified voice, data and video dissemination, storage area network (SAN) infrastructure, establishment of the CENTCOM Partner Network (CPN) which provides a new secure network for bilateral / multilateral information sharing up to the SECRET RELEASABLE level. Support maximum data storage capacity requirements for HQ war records collection, Modeling &amp; Simulation Systems (J8MS), and uninterrupted power supply (UPS) required for the command's collateral classified and unclassified data networks. This equipment provides HQ USCENTCOM with effective C4 systems to effectively conduct current and future operations throughout the AOR.

Air Forces United States Central Command (AFCENT) is the ACC component designated to support USCENTCOM operations in deployed theaters for the AF. Funds C4 systems throughout the area of responsibility (AOR). Procurement efforts include: communications infrastructure requirements, satellite terminal equipment, data network servers and associated information assurance tools, information transfer nodes and routers, joint radio relays, as well as deployed air traffic control and landing systems and navigational aid systems.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>This program, PE 0205219F P-40A Item Contractor Service, is a new start.

PE 0201122F USCENTCOM COMMUNICATIONS 

USCENTCOM COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEMS: FY17 funding will procure C4 equipment items required for HQ USCENTCOM, MacDill AFB, FL, Disaster Recovery Site (Site X), and CENTCOM Forward HQ at Al Udeid, Qatar, to effectively conduct communications support missions impacting Command and Control (C2) and operational missions conducted by the Commander and staff. The C4/Information Technology (IT) supporting the command must be replaced to meet the ever increasing demands of current, ongoing contingency operations, and the growth of data storage requirements. Without OPAF funding, the vital end of life replacement of communications equipment directly supporting all C2 and C4 operations will be at significant risk and will catastrophically affect the ability of the ongoing contingency operational missions across the AOR. 

STORAGE CAPABILITIES: HQ CENTCOM and CENTCOM Forward HQ require maximum storage capabilities to maintain a level of readiness, reduce server footprint, and continue capabilities as they are implemented. 


PE 0201131F AIR COMBAT COMMAND (ACC) COMMUNICATIONS FY17 funds will provide:

BASE COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS, AND INTELLIGENCE (C4I) INFRASTRUCTURE. This FY17 effort will support communications CENTCOM Theater Posture Plan (TPP) locations identified for post OEF support. This effort is required at several AFCENT locations in the AOR and will provide critical infrastructure to support the transition to the Joint Information Environment, as required by DoD CIO mandate.


SWA-THEATER ENTERPRISE REQUIREMENTS - To meet Unified Capabilities (UC) requirements as required by DoD mandate, and USCENTCOM FRAGO directing components to transition to an IP-converged architecture by 2017, AFCENT must replace legacy Promina equipment at GSUs. AFCENT must also procure new systems to support contingency operations and base opening/closure requirements, which average 2 base openings and/or closures per year regardless of new or ongoing contingencies. 

JOINT INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT: Implementation of JIE at MacDill AFB with CENTCOM acting as the possible regional node. 


FY17 effort will continue to support infrastructure and services essential secure networks for bilateral and multilateral information up to the secret releasable level. Support the networks and cross domain solution necessary to securely and safely integrate coalition sensors and C2 capabilities with or C2 efforts. Includes integration of Coalition LNOs into our Combined Air Operations Center at AUAB

                    <proc:Remarks>USCENTCOM:  FY17 procurement funds in the amount of $2.921M will procure C4 equipment items required for HQ USCENTCOM, MacDill AFB, FL and CENTCOM Forward HQ at Al Udeid, Qatar. Funding is vital to effectively conduct communications support missions impacting Command and Control (C2) and operational missions conducted by the Commander and staff supporting the Command's CONPLAN/OPLANs.  The C4/Information Technology (IT) supporting the command must be replaced to meet the ever increasing demands of enduring operations and the growth of data storage requirements, as well as emergent cyber threats.  Without OPAF funding, the vital life cycle replacement of communications equipment directly supporting all C2 and C4 operations will be at significant risk and will catastrophically affect the ability of enduring operational missions across the AOR.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>The Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T) program replaces legacy Milstar terminals and will provide Extremely High Frequency (EHF), protected high data rate communication for nuclear and conventional forces to include Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC). FAB-T will provide this new, highly secure, state-of-the-art capability for DoD platforms to include strategic platforms and airborne/ground command posts via Milstar, AEHF, and Enhanced Polar System (EPS) satellites. FAB-T terminals will also support the critical command and control (C2) of the Milstar, AEHF and EPS satellite constellations.  In June 2014 the Air Force down-selected to Raytheon for production of FAB-T Command Post Terminals (CPT).  Production contract options to produce CPT terminals were exercised after a successful Milestone C decision was approved September 1, 2015.
 

There are two P-5s contained in this document because there are two distinct Program Elements(PE) encompassed within this document. In FY15 FAB-T transferred to this current Line Item Number 836700.  In FY16, FAB-T transferred from PE 0303601F to PE 0303001F. Therefore both PE 030601F and 0303001F have a P-5 document. 

In the prior years through FY14, FAB-T was in Line Item Number 836780.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Funding in FY17 will continue program office support and production activities including full rate production. In June 2014 the Air Force down-selected to Raytheon for production of FAB-T Command Post Terminals (CPT). Production contract options to produce CPT terminals were exercised  after a Milestone C decision was approved September 1, 2015.</proc:Justification>

To complete cost is for the Force Element Terminals (FET) which is a sub-program under FAB-T.  Cost information is based solely on the Air Force Service Cost Position estimate for the FETs. Currently there is no approved acquisition strategy or funding for the FAB-T FETs</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>Note 1:  In the FY16 Consolidated Appropriations Act, selected space programs funded with Other Procurement, Air Force (OPAF) were transferred to Space Procurement, Air Force (SPAF) in FY16 and beyond. This exhibit will display values for FY15 and prior; funding for FY16 and beyond are displayed in SPAF.  Total 3080/3021 procurement funding is $380.320M.

This exhibit will display values in "Prior Years, PY, and Total (for 3080)" only; FY16 and beyond is displayed in the corresponding SPAF/3021 exhibits. 

Note 2:  The flyaway unit cost is not included on the P-40 exhibit because there are multiple P-5 Cost Analysis exhibits. 

The Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) consolidates national and DOD infrared detection systems into a single overarching architecture that fulfills the nation's security needs in the areas of missile warning, missile defense, technical intelligence and battlespace awareness. SBIRS enables global, simultaneous surveillance, tracking and targeting of multiple targets in multiple areas of responsibility, and surveillance of infrared sources of operational, intelligence or national significance. SBIRS consists of Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites, satellites in Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO), payloads hosted on Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) satellites, an integrated centralized Mission Control Station (MCS), full MCS backup, and relay and mobile ground stations. Development funding is in RDT&amp;E AF Program Element 0604441F, SBIRS High. Production funding for SBIRS satellites is in MPAF and SPAF PE 0305915F.

1. SBIRS MOBILE AND FIXED SITE COMMUNICATIONS/ELECTRONIC Upgrades: This effort procures DSP and SBIRS assets to maintain the Data Processing Sub-System.  Fixed site examples include, but are not limited to, legacy receiver, antenna drive system, Spacecraft Simulator RF, MCS display, Rapid Delog (instantaneous translation of computer data to a human-readable format), Sybase database obsolescence, communications and network routers, and switches and time server replacements. Mobile system examples include, but are not limited to, aging radio frequency communications equipment, aging antenna equipment, aging electrical equipment and cabling, and unsupportable data processing subsystem components.  Funding for this effort is in program element 0305915F. 

2. SBIRS High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP):   This effort provides for upgrades, hardness assurance and verification testing, to gain and maintain USSTRATCOM certification.  AFSPC HEMP program supports the USSTRATCOM Integrated Nuclear Survivable and Endurable Report (INSER) to the Joint Staff, Secretary of Defense, and Congress.  Funding was provided in FY15 only.  

3. SBIRS SURVIVABLE ENDURABLE EVOLUTION (S2E2): The S2E2 effort recapitalizes the DSP Mobile Ground System (MGS)DSP Mobile Ground Terminals with SBIRS Mobile Ground Terminals (SMGT). The MGS is the only US Survivable and Endurable (S/E) Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (TW/AA) system (S/E TW/AA). It is the critical Situation Monitoring element in three national-level architectures: Integrated TW/AA System, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Critical Nodes, and Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS). USSTRATCOM needs AFSPCs global S/E TW/AA operational capabilities to meet President of the United States, Joint Staff, Combatant Commander and Forward User (FU) requirements for continuous, persistent, and enduring TW/AA non-imaging infrared (NIR) for Missile Warning and static events, and Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) detection and reporting across all phases of military operations. The current MGS can only process DSP data for strategic Missile Warning and NUDET detection.  This effort will address long-standing obsolescence/supportability concerns of the MGS and enable the MGS to process SBIRS and DSP satellite data. Training software, spares and integration of Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs) are included.  The shelters will also be upgraded for increased protection from high altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) per MIL-STD-188-125-2.  Funding for this effort is in program element 0305915F.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) provides highly accurate time, three-dimensional position, and velocity information to an unlimited number of users anywhere on or above the surface of the earth, in any weather. GPS satisfies validated joint service requirements for worldwide, accurate, common grid navigation for military aircraft, ships, ground vehicles and personnel. The system is comprised of three segments: (1) satellites, (2) a ground control, and (3) user equipment. The satellites broadcast high-accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals that are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. The ground control network updates the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to provide system vectors to target location or navigational way points. Funds in this line support various GPS specific production efforts associated with the ground control and user equipment segments. 

In the FY16 Consolidated Appropriations Act, selected space programs funded with Other Procurement, Air Force (OPAF) were transferred to Space Procurement, Air Force (SPAF) in FY16 and beyond. This exhibit will display values for FY15 and prior.

            <proc:Description>In the FY16 Consolidated Appropriations Act, selected space programs funded with Other Procurement, Air Force (OPAF) were transferred to Space Procurement, Air Force (SPAF) in FY16 and beyond. This
exhibit will display values for FY15 and prior.

The United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) provides a near real-time worldwide, highly survivable/endurable capability to detect, locate, and report any nuclear detonations in the atmosphere of the earth or in near space. The USNDS Operational Requirements Document (ORD), dated 21 Jan 2004, documents the requirements for space-based NUDET detection.  Space-based NUDET detection is also mandated by Public Law 110-181, dated 28 Jan 2008, which directs the Secretary of Defense to maintain the capability for space-based nuclear detection at or above 2008 capability levels.  USNDS supports NUDET detection requirements across five mission areas: Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA), Nuclear Force Management (NFM), Space Control (SC), Treaty Monitoring (TM) and a classified mission.

The USNDS 6 program is jointly sponsored and funded by the Department of Defense (DoD), through the US Air Force (AF), and the Department of Energy (DOE), through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its Nuclear Detonation Detection (NA-22) office, respectively. NNSA/NA-22 supplies, at no cost to DoD, USNDS space sensors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the AF USNDS Program Office, which is responsible for all acquisition and systems engineering, integration and test (SEIT) activities on space vehicles (SVs), to include Global Positioning System (GPS) and additional hosts, and their supporting ground control segments. The AF directly funds the procurement of the USNDS 6 ground segment (described below).

DoD funds its contribution to the NDS program in PE 0305913F with RDT&amp;E, OPAF, SPAF and O&amp;M dollars. NDS payload integration onto GPS satellites is funded in the GPS Space &amp; Control PE 0305165F for GPS IIF SVs and GPS III Space Segment PE 0305265F for GPS III SVs.  NDS payload integration onto Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites is funded by NNSA/NA-22.

USNDS consists of space sensors and complex ground segments. The space segment sensors, funded by DOE, consists of three nuclear detection sensor payloads: the Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) payload for Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites, the Global Burst Detection (GBD) payload for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) platforms (GPS satellites), and the Space Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) payload for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit platforms (classified GEO hosts). Together, these sensors and associated communications capability provided by the host satellites comprise the global NUDET space segment detection capability for the USNDS. Space sensors communicate NUDET indications to the fixed ground segment (the RADEC Data Processor (RDP) and the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS)) and the deployable mobile ground segment (survivable Ground NDS Terminals (GNTs), and the survivable/endurable Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs), when fielded). These ground systems perform data analysis and provide a decision support tool to the Air Force controllers concerning probability of NUDET occurrence. The ground segment provides ground receiving analysis and reporting capabilities to national authorities, commands, and forward users as well as Department of State for Treaty Monitoring and Verification mission. The ground control segment is being modernized and continuously improved through an incremental evolution acquisition approach.

The upgrade to the GNT is the survivable/endurable Universal Ground Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) Terminal (UGNT) which is funded with AF RDT&amp;E in this PE. The UGNT provides NUDET Detection Reports to end users through survivable and endurable USNDS communications via Milstar/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) circuits.  The GNT supports Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) and Nuclear Force Management (NFM) missions.  The UGNT program modifies the baseline of the GNT program and deploys as an integral part of the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Survivable / Endurable Evolution (S2E2) Mobile Ground System (SMGS) units also in support of ITW/AA and NFM. The UGNT, when integrated with the SMGS, will perform NUDET event processing with fused NDS data from GPS and DSP. SMGS capability refers to the result of the S2E2 upgrade program for the MGS mission processing capability, including the integration of UGNT. The intended end state of UGNT integration is delivery of enhanced missile warning and NUDET detection capabilities that meet survivable/endurable ITW/AA requirements directed by the President, SECDEF, Joint Staff, and USSTRATCOM delivering long-term, cost effective, multi-role, multi-mission space effects to the war fighter across the range of military operations.

Funding for this effort is in PE 0305913F NUDET DETECTION SYS SPACE.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) is a satellite ground terminal network comprised of two communication nodes (Schriever AFB &amp; Vandenberg AFB) and 15 antenna systems. The antennas are distributed around the world at seven locations -- Vandenberg Tracking Station (VTS), Diego Garcia Station (DGS), Guam Tracking Station (GTS), Hawaii Tracking Station (HTS), New Hampshire Tracking Station (NHS), Thule Tracking Station (TTS), and Telemetry and Commanding Station (TCS) at RAF Oakhanger, England -- to ensure global coverage for 140 satellites in various orbits. The AFSCN conducts an average of 450 satellite contacts per day supporting Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT); Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); Missile Warning; Communications; Weather; and Research and Development (R&amp;D) satellites for Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operations. While most of the 450 satellite contacts/day are routine command and control activities, the AFSCN is also used for satellite emergencies (e.g. tumbling satellite) because its high power antennas are often the only earthbound assets that can contact a non-responsive satellite to re-establish command &amp; control. During FY14 and FY15, the AFSCN supported 28 space vehicle emergencies resulting in the preservation of over $8.5B worth of satellites. In addition to routine and emergency satellite operations C2, the AFSCN provides support to launch vehicle and early orbit operations, ensuring worldwide antennas receive telemetry and transmit commands to newly orbiting satellites to initiate early orbit checkout. Finally, the AFSCN provides Factory Compatibility Testing (FCT) to ensure satellites and launch vehicles can communicate via the AFSCN before the satellite is launched. These efforts include systems engineering and integration (SE&amp;I) activities.  
  
These funds are used to procure modernized equipment for the AFSCN to ensure the capability is available to support DoD, Intelligence community, and civil users. 

Principal efforts include: 

1) AFSCN Interim Supply Support: procures support services, peculiar and common support materials, and required re-procurement data for the Satellite Control Network Contract, and to transition to government supply support. 

2) Remote Tracking Station (RTS) Block Change (RBC): The RBC Program was initiated in Dec 2001 to modernize the legacy system. The RBC program replaces legacy remote ground antenna systems that have reached end of life. To date, RBC systems have been installed at VTS, DGS, TCS, GTS, HTS, and NHS. TTS is projected to complete in 1Q FY16. In addition, the Air Force is upgrading the electronics in the remaining eight serviceable systems. This "hybrid" architecture couples the RBC electronics with existing antennas and normalizes electronics across the network. A prototype effort was implemented in FY12 to validate the approach and the first two hybrid articles were awarded in FY13 to upgrade legacy systems at GTS and HTS. A third article was awarded in FY14 to upgrade the legacy system at VTS.  Funds in FY15 (DGS, TTS), FY16 (TCS, NHS) and FY17 (TCS, a station with three antenna systems) continue RBC Hybrid procurement for the remaining locations; completion is projected by FY20. Finally, the Enhanced High Power Amplifier (EHPA) spacecraft anomaly resolution system is scheduled for first-article delivery in 4Q 2016 at GTS. Future EHPA buys include VTS in FY16, NHS and DGS in FY18.  Upon completion, EHPA will provide high-power anomaly resolution capability at four sites. The EHPA enables emergency satellite operations and is needed to replace obsolete parts.

3) AIR FORCE SATELLITE CONTROL NETWORK RECAPITALIZATION: The Air Force will use various contract vehicles to address the highest priority upgrades.  Obsolescence and sustainment "worst actors" are prioritized annually in order of criticality to the mission. The potential for failed satellite contacts drives priority. In FY17, funds are planned to be used for Cyber Defense solutions, Wide Area Network Interface (WANIF) implementation and Electronic Scheduling Dissemination 3.0 Standard Space Training environment for external users. Other FYDP projects include: Authentication, Authorization, Auditing/Host Based Security System (AAA/HBSS) implementation to external users, AFSCN test bed upgrades, continued cyber defense work, network automation, moving the AFSCN Test Bed (ATB) from a leased contractor facility to a government facility, Range/Network/Communication obsolescence upgrades, and Multi-band &amp; Phased Array projects.

Funding for this effort is contained in PE 0305110F. As of the FY16 PB submission, space programs procurement funding has been re-categorized from appropriation 3080, Other Procurement Air Force (OPAF) to appropriation 3021, Space Procurement Air Force (SPAF), in FY16 and beyond.  This exhibit will display prior year and FY15 values. While FY16 and beyond will be displayed in the corresponding SPAF/3021 exhibits. Total 3080/3021 procurement funding is $370.095M.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>1) AFSCN Interim Supply Support (P-5): FY17 funding provides peculiar and common support material, required re-procurement data, and interim supply support management. In addition, funds procure the most urgently needed capital equipment replacements for items that exceed the O&amp;M dollar threshold. This equipment replaces items such as, but not limited to, high power amplifiers, processors, archival event recorders, and router switches, AFSCN Link Projection System (ALPS) equipment, legacy Electronic Scheduling Dissemination (ESD) 2.7 equipment and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) items which are at the top of the sustainers "worst actors" list and account for significant maintenance effort, down time, and lost or failed contacts. 

2) RBC and AFSCN Recapitalization Projects (P-3As): These efforts are critical to ensuring telemetry, tracking, and commanding are provided for over 140 satellites and that satellite emergencies requiring high-power antennas can be supported.

FY17 funds continue Advisory &amp; Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) to procure other support for the system program office including, but not limited to cost estimating, contract reconciliation, and configuration management. These Advisory and Assistance Services and FFRDC efforts support the functions of government personnel in managing the production activities to upgrade the AFSCN system, and include FFRDC analyses to support installation, integration, and testing, as well as the installs and integration of equipment for the ongoing upgrades.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Spacelift Range System (SLRS), also known as the Launch and Test Range System (LTRS), provides public safety and assured access to space.  SLRS operates at the Eastern Range (ER) at Patrick AFB/Cape Canaveral AFS, FL and the Western Range (WR) at Vandenberg AFB, CA.  SLRS provides tracking, telemetry, communications, flight safety, and other capabilities to support launch of national security space (NSS), civil and commercial space payloads, Intercontinental and Sea Launched ballistic missile and missile defense evaluations, and aeronautical and guided weapon tests.  SLRS enables national security, civil, and commercial spacelift operations to be conducted safely; together with national security space launch capability, SLRS provides assured access to space for the nation.  The ER and WR are part of the Department of Defense Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).

SLRS is comprised of twelve subsystems that together provide this capability to the ranges. The Range Safety and Command Destruct subsystems provide the capability to destroy an errant rocket, if necessary to protect public safety. These subsystems rely on the Telemetry, Radar, and Optics subsystems to provide tracking data.  The Weather and Surveillance subsystems allow range operators and customers to determine if conditions are safe for launch. The Communications, Data Handling, and Timing &amp; Sequencing subsystems ensure critical data is expeditiously routed from remote sensors (e.g., radars, optics, etc.) to range operators and customers. Finally, the Planning and Scheduling subsystem ensures all assets are available when needed for a launch or test operation.
 
The Air Force prioritizes procurement funds to ensure aging range equipment is modernized to support mission requirements. Sustainment trends are continuously analyzed and assessed across all twelve subsystems and procurement funds are used to modernize the most critical mission equipment. 

1) SLRS Interim Supply Support (P5): Provides peculiar and common support material, required re-procurement data, and interim supply support management. 

2) SLRS Support Services (P5): FY17 funds pay for FFRDC mission assurance activities to ensure all twelve subsystems are compatible with mission rules and do not pose a risk to safe and cost-effective satellite launches. Funds are also used for Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) to ensure baseline documentation and modernization activities remain synchronized with the sustainment baseline. 

3) Range Command Destruct Modernization (RCDM) (P3a): Modernizes the Eastern and Western Range Command Destruct Systems. The Range Command Destruct modernization will provide the capability to use a new secure Command Destruct code, the Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS), mandated by the NSA for cyber security on both the Eastern and Western Ranges. The Eastern Range Command Destruct system will replace a sustainment "worst actor" that has been the cause of an expensive launch scrub as well as several near scrubs. The Western Range effort will replace the outdated command destruct codes with the new EFTS capability and meet the NSA mandate. 

4) Modernization of Eastern Range Network (MEN) (P3a): Upgrades the communications subsystem on the Eastern Range from outdated Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology to Internet Protocol (IP) version 4/6 (IPV4/IPV6). MEN resolves obsolescence issues facing the program starting in 2018, addresses high-priority sustainment issues, and provides improved cyber security for range operations. The contract was awarded as a small business set aside. 

5) Western Range Modernization of Network (WMN) (P3a): Upgrades the communications subsystem on the Western Range from Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology to IPV6. WMN resolves remaining ATM obsolescence issues, numerous high-priority sustainment issues, and provides improved cyber security for range operations. The WMN contract will be awarded in FY16 as a small business set aside. 

6) SLRS Recapitalization Projects (P3a): The Air Force will use various contract vehicles (LTRS Integrated Support Contract (LISC), General Services Administration (GSA), Design Engineering Support Program (DESP) III, competitively-awarded contracts) to address the highest priority requirements. Obsolescence and sustainment "worst actors" in all twelve subsystems are prioritized annually in order of their criticality to the mission; priority is driven by likelihood of causing a launch delay/scrub.

Funding for this exhibit is in PE 0305182F. As of the FY16 PB submission, space programs procurement funding has been re-categorized from appropriation 3080, Other Procurement Air Force (OPAF) to appropriation 3021, Space Procurement Air Force (SPAF), in FY16 and beyond.  This exhibit will display prior year and FY15 values. While FY16 and beyond will be displayed in the corresponding SPAF/3021 exhibits. Total 3080/3021 procurement funding is $779.550M.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Spacelift Range System Space (P-5): For SLRS Interim Supply Support, FY17 funds will pay for interim supply support, to include supplies and associated interim supply support management. In addition, funds procure the most urgently needed capital equipment replacements for items that exceed the O&amp;M dollar threshold. For SLRS SUPPORT SERVICES, FY17 funds pay for FFRDC mission assurance activities to ensure all twelve subsystems are compatible with mission rules and do not pose a risk to safe and cost-effective satellite launches. Funds are also used for SE&amp;I to ensure baseline documentation and modernization activities remain synchronized with the sustainment baseline. 

MEN, WMN, RCDM, and Recapitalization Projects (P-3As): These modifications are required to enable the safe conduct of national security, civil, and commercial launches at the Eastern and Western Ranges. Further, they ensure continued support to test range customers.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>PE 0303601F MILSATCOM TERMINALS

MILITARY SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS (MILSATCOM) joint-service systems collectively provide a broad range of satellite communication capabilities, including secure, jam-resistant, 24-hour worldwide communications to meet essential strategic, tactical and general-purpose operational requirements. MILSATCOM terminals support communications requirements for the President and Secretary of Defense, unified and specified combatant commanders, uniformed services and defense agencies. Procurement funding is in program element (PE) 0303601F, MILSATCOM Terminals, except where otherwise noted. There are also research and development efforts related to some of these efforts, and that RDT&amp;E AF funding is also in PE 0303601F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>PE 0303601F MILSATCOM TERMINALS  
 
SECURE MOBILE ANTI-JAM RELIABLE TACTICAL TERMINALS (SMART-T) UPGRADE: SMART-T is a ground fixed and mobile extremely high frequency (EHF) terminal providing survivable, jam-resistant, worldwide, continuous secure communications to tactical war-fighters. Currently, SMART-T terminals inter-operate with the Milstar satellite constellation in low data rate (LDR) mode at 2.4 Kbps and medium data rate (MDR) mode at 1.5 Mbps. The Air Force leveraged an Army contract to upgrade and repair the SMART-T Terminals to be compatible with the AEHF satellite system. No FY17 funding requested.  
 
AIR FORCE WIDEBAND ENTERPRISE TERMINALS (AFWET): AFWET terminals form the Satellite Communications (SATCOM) backbone of the DoD Information Network (DoDIN), operating over Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS), Defense Satellite Communications System, commercial and Allied satellites. These Enterprise terminals support the command and control requirements of Combatant Commanders worldwide and the communication requirements of the President, Secretary of Defense, Department of State (DoS), US strategic and tactical forces, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Air Force is responsible for sustaining facilities and terminal equipment at Air Force operated and maintained Enterprise ground terminal locations. AFWET upgrades include modifications and life extensions to: baseband equipment, interconnect facilities, radomes, supporting facilities and antennas. AFWET funding includes: Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS), Product Support, and other related activities worldwide to ensure operational viability in accordance with the Joint Staff, DoD Chief Information Officer and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) directives. In FY17, the Air Force will procure and install major modernization kits as Government-Off-The-Shelf (via the Army's Modernization of Enterprise Terminals program), conduct numerous targeted sustainment actions to extend the life of the system, sustain operational suitability, safety and effectiveness, and maintain high interoperability with other DoS, Army, Navy, and Air Force strategic and tactical terminals. Procurement includes ground terminal modernization, baseband equipment, installation and integration, site preparation, and facilities. Unit cost for MET procurement changes substantially depending on specific versions purchased (small, fixed, transportable, protected, etc). Installation, integration and site preparation costs also change substantially based on location. Life extension and modernization efforts also provide incidental increases in capability, allowing for full utilization of WGS capabilities, compliance with directives on the usage of Internet Protocol, adherence to Unified Capabilities Requirements, compliance with National Security Agency directives on cryptographic equipment, and more efficient and effective usage of satellite resources for jam-resistant and anti-scintillation wideband links.  
 
GLOBAL BROADCAST SERVICE (GBS): This AF-led joint program implements a worldwide high-capacity satellite broadcast information system to provide a continuous, one-way, high-speed, high-volume flow of classified and unclassified data and imagery to garrisoned, deployed or moving forces. GBS provides DoD some relief from reliance on leased commercial satellite communications. GBS Receive Suites provide lower-echelon AF users with efficient high-data-rate in-theater to many distributed information sources via satellite-hosted GBS packages. In addition to Prime Mission Equipment, FY17 funds will fund integration and installation, technical manual updates, spares, systems engineering, test, training, A&amp;AS, upgrades, and other related activities to provide a non-transmission security (TRANSEC) solution until a TRANSEC modem is available.  
 
a. GBS RECEIVE SUITES: The receive suites link users to information sources via GBS, offering worldwide service.  
 
b. JOINT INTERNET PROTOCOL MODEM (JIPM): On 13 Nov 14, DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) re-directed the JIPM acquisition strategy to a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution.  
 
c. TRANSEC MODEM: GBS working with DoD to identify TRANSEC Modem for GBS. Interim non-TRANSEC solution has been identified. Modification is being processed. Government testing will begin 4th Qtr 2015 and concludes 4th Qtr 2016.  Following an operational trial period, operational acceptance will occur 1st Qtr 2017.  
 
d. GBS PORTABLE RECEIVE SUITES: These are Rucksack and Suitcase variants of the GBS terminals required by Special Operations Forces in forward operating areas.   
 
e. GBS BROADCAST MANAGER: The Satellite Broadcast Manager (SBM) systems at two of DISA's Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECC) that provide the GBS broadcast to the GBS Receive Suites worldwide.   
 
GROUND MULTIBAND TERMINAL (GMT): GMT terminals support war-fighter tactical communications requirements utilizing WGS, DSCS and commercial satellite systems. GMT provides flexible, lightweight, modular, scalable, and integrated tactical quad-band SATCOM terminals which operate in X, C, Ku and military Ka frequency bands. The GMT replaces ground mobile force terminals that are reaching end of life. No FY17 funding requested.  
 
MILSATCOM SUSTAINMENT MODIFICATIONS: Provides minor modifications for MILSATCOM systems currently in sustainment and those currently fielded. Funding FY17 continues sustainment for MPE 0303605F SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS (SATCOMS). 
 
FAMILY OF ADVANCED BEYOND LINE OF SIGHT TERMINALS (FAB-T):  In FY16 FAB-T transferred to PE: 0303001F.  
 
HIGH DATA RATE-RADIO FREQUENCY (HDR-RF): The ground terminal program will provide the high data rate SATCOM needed to support the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) community with high bandwidth and high throughput capability. HDR-RF ground terminals will be used for command &amp; control ISR, and will support the full spectrum of operation from humanitarian support /disaster relief to a major theater war. HDR-RF terminals will be interoperable with WGS satellites to support air intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance data rates up to 274 Mbps. HDR-RF ground terminals will provide quad-band C-, X-, Ku-, and Ka Band SATCOM. HDR-RF ground terminals will be interoperable with legacy tactical terminals and operate worldwide with existing military and commercial spacecraft. The user of HDR-RF ground terminals is to support ISR missions. No FY17 funding requested.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Space Mods Space enables the development of advanced Command and Control (C2) Battle Management, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems to conduct effective predictive battle space awareness, facilitate precision attack, and compress the sensor-to-shooter kill chain. Permanent modifications are configuration changes to in-service systems and equipment that correct materiel or other deficiencies, or that add or delete capability. Safety modifications correct deficiencies that produce hazards to personnel, systems, or equipment. This budget line covers both new and on-going modification efforts for space equipment and systems. Modification installation funding is budgeted in the year the installation occurs. 

PE 0305160F DEF METEOROLOGICAL SAT PROG (SPACE) 

The DEFENSE METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE PROGRAM (DMSP) is a fully operational program supporting a broad range of national security users who require timely and accurate global weather information. DMSP is the only DoD assured source of global weather data providing visible and infrared cloud cover imagery (1/3 nautical miles (nm) constant resolution) and other meteorological, oceanographic, land surface, and space environmental data. DMSP satellites are flown in sun-synchronous, 450nm polar-orbits to meet mission requirements (sun-synchronous means the satellites cross the equator at the same local sun time on each of their 14 orbits/day). 

Key elements of the DMSP constellation command and control (C2) ground system have not been re-capitalized since the equipment was transferred to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Satellite Operations in 1998. Critical C2 component spares have been depleted and parts cannibalization is no longer sustainable. Therefore, DMSP re-established a 3080 funding line beginning in FY15 to enable continued C2 ground segment sustainment through a selective re-capitalization effort. C2 subsystems to be addressed include but are not limited to the Telemetry and Commanding System, flight configuration management, Mission Planning and Scheduling System, and communication tracking station interface units. This selective re-capitalization effort is intended to ensure the DMSP C2 system remains viable through the planned DMSP mission fly-out no later than 2027. 

PE 0305165F NAVSTAR GPS (SPACE AND CONTROL SEGMENTS) 

NAVSTAR GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) provides highly accurate time and three dimensional position and velocity information to an unlimited number of users anywhere on or above the surface of the earth, in any weather. This system supplies highly accurate position, velocity, timing, and Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) information to properly equipped air, land, sea, and space-based users worldwide. The GPS system consists of three segments: space, control, and user equipment. The Operational Control System (OCS) is part of the control segment and requires modifications to replace high failure rate parts and preclude system operational degradation. Without these mods, aging and obsolete equipment will excessively degrade, ultimately resulting in system failure. System failure or even partial system failure will cause a loss of operational availability and the transmission of inaccurate navigation data to worldwide users, resulting in potential loss of life and/or operational equipment, including multi-million dollar satellites. OCS is required to operate until the Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) transitions to operations. 

PE 0305614F JSPOC MISSION SYSTEM 

JOINT SPACE OPERATIONS CENTER (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS) provides integrated space situational awareness information and C2 of space forces for the Joint Functional Component Commander for Space (JFCC-SPACE). It will allow JFCC-SPACE to plan, direct, coordinate, and control operations of assigned forces. The JMS provides a net-centric, Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) along with space mission applications to meet the needs above. It implements a Space User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) to provide the capability to create, visualize, and share decision-relevant views of space operational environment at all echelons. 

PE 0305912F SLBM RADAR WARNING SYSTEM 

SEA-LAUNCHED BALLISTIC MISSILE (SLBM) DETECTION AND WARNING SYSTEM: The primary mission of the 474N SLBM Detection and Warning System is to provide United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) with credible Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) data on all SLBMs penetrating the coverage area. This data includes an estimation of launch and predicted impact (L&amp;PI) locations and times. The secondary mission is to provide the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station, CO (CMAFS) and other users with ITW/AA data on Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) penetrating the coverage area. Additionally, Perimeter Acquisition Radar Attack Characterization System (PARCS) and PAVE Phased Array Warning Systems (PAVE PAWS) support the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) mission by providing near earth satellite surveillance, tracking and identification as required by the Space Control Center, Alternate Space Control Center, and the Joint Intelligence Center. The sensors have an operational availability requirement of 98 percent. The 474N SLBM Detection and Warning System currently consists of: a) the AN/FPQ-16 PARCS and b) the AN/FPS-123 PAVE PAWS System (Phased Array Radars for SLBM Detection and Warning System). 

PE 0305940F SPACE SITUATION AWARENESS OPERATIONS 

GROUND-BASED ELECTRO OPTICAL DEEP SPACE SURVEILLANCE (GEODSS) SERVICE LIFE EXTENSION PROGRAM (SLEP) Phase II: The GEODSS SLEP Phase II will replace aging unsupportable mission critical sub-systems with modern sustainable components, allowing continued mission operations through 2025. GEODSS is a three-site optical telescope system dedicated to the Space Surveillance Network (SSN). The GEODSS sites, located in Socorro, New Mexico; Maui, Hawaii; and Diego Garcia (British Indian Ocean Territories), provide time critical deep-space tracking information for the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC). The GEODSS SLEP Phase II will modernize the Sensor Controller, Data Processing, and other unsustainable subsystems as required for all sites. The program will replace the obsolete, diminishing supportable components of the GEODSS Sensor Controller Group (SCG) with sustainable hardware/software technology. 


NET-CENTRIC SENSORS AND DATA SOURCES (N-CSDS): The N-CSDS program, through net-centric exposure, provides data from traditional Space Surveillance Network (SSN) sensors and non-traditional space situational awareness sensors, and data sources. It enables legacy sensors and data sources to distribute information net-centrically while also providing additional data.  RDT&amp;E funding for this effort is in PE 0604425F.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Counter Communications System (CCS) Pre-planned Product Improvement (P3I) program provides expeditionary, deployable, reversible offensive Counterspace effects applicable across the full spectrum of conflict. It prevents adversary satellite communications (SATCOM) in the Area of Responsibility (AOR) including Command and Control (C2), Early Warning, and Propaganda; and hosts Rapid Reaction Capabilities in response to Urgent Needs. Acquisition Decision Memorandum (24 April 2009) directed all capabilities identified in the October 2006 CCS Block 20, JROC-approved Capability Development Document (CDD) shall be accomplished as P3I upgrades to the CCS Block 10.

Funding for this exhibit and developmental funding for CCS is in Program Element 0604421F, Counterspace Systems.

In the FY16 Consolidated Appropriations Act, selected space programs funded with Other Procurement, Air Force (OPAF) were transferred to Space Procurement, Air Force (SPAF) in FY16 and beyond. This exhibit will display values of funding prior to FY16.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Tactical Airborne Control Systems PE 0207418F - P-5
PE 0207418F TACTICAL AIRBORNE CONTROL SYSTEM EQUIPMENT 

Tactical airborne control system equipment encompass three types of simulators that provide scenario based training for Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs), Combat Control Teams (CCTs), Tactical Air Control Party (TACPs), Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) and various CAS Platforms. 

Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS): TACP Fixed and Portable Simulators comprise JTC TRS.  This simulator project trains personnel controlling air support for combat operations by providing both a stand-alone and Distributed Mission Operations (DMO)-capable high-fidelity JTAC, and Combat Control Team (CCT) simulation system.  The JTC TRS will be able to connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity close air support platforms, JTACs and CCTs to train together in a risk-free environment. The Fixed simulator enables operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the simulator will be capable of providing tactical air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application of austere airbase operations.  The JTAC simulators provide DMO capability to network with aircrew full mission trainers, mission training centers, and Air Support Operations Centers (ASOC).   Its primary focus is to provide an air-ground virtual training environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop both JTAC and CCT skills and train aircrew to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to friendly ground forces. JTAC simulators will be fully interoperable with joint/sister Service air ground simulation using industry standards.  Training with simulators has the potential to reduce civilian casualties, collateral damage and fratricide by improving coordination skills between air and ground personnel, and increasing JTAC and aircrew proficiency.  The acquisition strategy for production of the fixed configuration of the JTC TRS will be executed as an evolutionary acquisition approach using incremental development. Until the production system is ready for fielding, interim simulators will be fielded to support JTAC qualification training and readiness for deployable JTACs.  

TACP C2 Simulator:  The Joint Theater Air-Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS) is the TACP C2 Simulator.  The simulator is for training ASOC and Special Operations Forces (SOF) personnel to perform command and control (C2) battlestaff operations.  The C2 simulator will operate in either a stand-alone mode, or connected to other DMO-capable high-fidelity simulation facilities to allow geographically-separated Theater Air Control System C2 elements, CAS platforms, and JTAC and CCT personnel to train in an integrated virtual environment.  The simulator will enable operators to conduct C2 training and mission rehearsal of JCAS assets using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are relevant to current real-world mission taskings.  Scenarios will cover the full range of military operations.  Training with the simulator will improve mission effectiveness by reducing the risk of civilian casualties, collateral damage, and fratricide by improving C2 skills in rapidly changing and uncertain combat environments.  The JTAGSS program will enable procurement of an estimated three JTAGSS for air support operations training. The acquisition strategy for the TACP C2 simulator will be to field advance technology demonstration units in two increments.  Increment 1 will field initial capability to perform proof of concept and technology validation of mission simulations for all ASOC crew positions including detailed communications planning, asset deconfliction, integration of joint fires, and other critical mission areas required for integrated TACP/ASOC C2 mission success.  At the completion of the technology validation, a contract will be competitively awarded to complete simulator development, deployment and integration.

Security Forces (SF)Tactical Communication Radios - 0207588F - P40A
FY17 funds are required to replace, reconstitute, and update critical communication equipment that's forward deployed from stateside bases and AFCENT to support missions within the AOR.  Transformation to a wideband networking radio is required to communicate with joint and coalition forces.  Additionally, SATCOM reach-back is inherent to SF operations. Funding is also required to ensure radios are compatible with SATCOM waveforms like Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) and the new Navy-led Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), which legacy radios are not compatible with wideband networking, BGAN, or MUOS.

Deployable C3 Systems PE 0207422F - P-40A
PE 0207422F DEPLOYABLE COMMAND, CONTROL, and COMMUNICATIONS (C3) SYSTEMS

THEATER-DEPLOYABLE COMMUNICATIONS (TDC) PROGRAM: TDC is used to extend network data, voice and video services to expeditionary and battlefield forces. The TDC system provides stand-alone communications support for the full range of military operations and communications capability for Command and Control (C2) reach back at and above the tactical level for a variety of Air Force missions. TDC provides rapidly deployable communication infrastructure package which provides deployed users with secure and non-secure voice service, internet access, local area network, network management, information assurance, e-mail services (NIPR/SIPRNET), and intra/inter-base connectivity services similar to those established on a fixed base. The TDC package uses commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components to support a wide scope of expeditionary missions ranging from a small C2 and airfield mission supporting 1 to 150 users and up to the stand-up of an Air Expeditionary Wing supporting 3,000 users. TDC package also supports Special Missions, to include noncombatant evacuation and disaster relief efforts, US Secret Service support, and Homeland Defense Operations. TDC as directed in Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF) Program Action Directive (PAD) 12-07 is employed to provide and support  22 Large Communications Package missions at Combat Communication squadrons, 27 Medium Communications Package missions at Combat Communications and Global Mobility Readiness squadrons and 39 Small Communications Package missions at Air Mobility Command units and Air Control squadrons. 

The TDC program reached full operational capability in 2008 and is currently providing sustainment and modernization efforts to maintain full operational capability. Modernization efforts focus on addressing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) associated with COTS components. Funding of the TDC program will procure hardware and software targeted to alleviate interoperability and software issues that arise from the constant evolution of technology. Controlled item will be funded with investment funds to purchase military communications equipment classified as critical protection items. Funding will also ensure TDC equipment maintains compliance with DOD security mandates/directives and cryptographic modernization standards. The program has three components: 

a. SPOKE SATELLITE TERMINALS: Satellite terminals provide two-way communications connectivity between expeditionary bases and reach back, through Defense Information System Agency (DISA) teleports, to the global information grid. These terminals augment limited DOD X-Band (Super High Frequency) resources by providing access to commercial satellite services. By augmenting the X- Band terminals, TDC's Spoke Satellite terminals transparently improve the expeditionary workforce's bandwidth throughput for high-speed voice, data, video, and imagery transmissions. Small aperture SATCOM terminals supporting direct internet protocol connection capable of supporting multi-commercial and military transmission bands significantly reduce airlift requirements and provide flexibility during expeditionary operations. 

b. INTEGRATED COMMUNICATIONS ACCESS PACKAGE (ICAP): ICAP provides the distributed base backbone which includes: hubs/routers, switches, multiplexers, secure/non-secure telephones, secure conferencing, cryptographic and timing equipment, and intra-base connectivity using fiber and/or point-to-point radios. ICAP packages include accessories and configuration kits to tailor the capability of voice and data modules (i.e. cards to interface to the host nation postal telegraph and telephone). ICAP packages are modular which allows assets to be deployed incrementally and provides the capability to expand the network as the base population increases.

c. NETWORK CONTROL CENTER-DEPLOYED (NCC-D): NCC-D provides deployed network management, information protection, and network planning capabilities similar to those at fixed bases. Specific functions include data management, intrusion detection, and firewall capabilities for both the classified and unclassified networks.

PE 0207423F  JOINT TACTICAL RADIO SYSTEMS/JTRS

The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) is a family of software programmable tactical radios that provide voice, data, and video communications for military users in the air, on the ground, and at sea. Common radio architecture and programmable software waveforms will provide joint interoperability between the services. The JTRS program is built around an open system software communications architecture (SCA), a critical set of rules that make software programmable radios function properly and ensure interoperability.  Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207423F.

Tactical Air Control Party-Mod PE 0207444F - P-5
TACTICAL AIR CONTROL PARTY-MODERNIZATION (TACP-M): TACPs are Air Force units manned by airmen who advise Army Ground Commanders and plan, request and control air power in support of army ground maneuver operations. 

The purpose of the TACP-Modernization program is to upgrade TACP voice, data and video communications capabilities, upgrade targeting capabilities, and improve TACP battlefield awareness capabilities. These capabilities are employed at all echelons of Army organizations by: Air Support Operation Centers (ASOCs), Division TACPs, Brigade TACPs, Battalion TACPs, and Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs) deployed with Army companies or scout teams on the front lines. Improved targeting and data communications capabilities provide more accurate target coordinates, reduce close air support (CAS) response times, and reduce the probability of fratricide or collateral damage through the use of networked data communications. 

TACPs also coordinate, request, and control airlift support and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support for Army combat operations, and they provide ground communications support for federal disaster response and Homeland Defense operations. TACPs deploy with their aligned Army units and operate in a variety of environments including fixed operations from tactical operations centers (TOCs), mobile operations in tactical vehicles, and dismounted (on foot) operations with Army infantry patrols. 

The TACP-M program provides and modernizes capabilities in the following major areas: (1) Tactical Operation Center (TOC) Systems (used in fixed operations centers), (2) Vehicle Mounted Systems (used in TACP tactical vehicles), (3) Dismounted Systems (used by JTACs during dismounted infantry operations), and (4) Close Air Support System (CASS) software. The TACP-M program also works closely with the Battlefield Airmen Office program to procure dismounted JTAC equipment. This teaming arrangement helps standardize battlefield airmen equipment, improve efficiency by consolidating acquisition efforts, and often reduces unit costs by increasing procurement quantities.  Frequent TACP combat deployments sometimes lead users to change equipment procurement priorities to support urgent operational needs and respond to evolving threat environments.

 The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $19.4M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

            <proc:Description>This program procures and integrates SCOPE Command High Frequency (HF) radio equipment, network infrastructure, and transmit/receive antennas for 13 strategically located ground stations worldwide. All hardware and software, including radios and antennas, is commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) with the exception of the integrating software that provides the military functionality required for the COTS equipment to operate. This integrating software is a COTS-based product that has been modified for the DoD to provide the unique capabilities required. The need for modern, robust, and dependable stations with beyond line of sight radio coverage has been identified to ensure HF radio communications is available in additional areas of interest to the United States.

High Frequency Global Communications System (HFGCS) is the only global high-power HF C2 network serving the Department of Defense (DoD). HFGCS consists of two major components: the radio/ network infrastructure (SCOPE Command) and the antennas (Antenna Program Support) which communicate with mobile assets (aircraft, Navy ships, Coast Guard ships). HFGCS supports aircrews, ground forces, naval operations, and control stations and is the primary C2 resource for Air Mobility Command cargo and tanker aircraft. Additional customers include White House Communications Agency (WHCA), Defense Communications System HF Entry, US Navy High Command Network, and other US government agencies. HFGCS supports war plan dissemination and daily operational requirements for WHCA, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), US Strategic Command, National Military Command Center's Emergency Action Message distribution, Special Air Mission communications, Major Air Force Commands and Combatant Commanders. HFGCS provides radio connectivity to other governmental organizations such as the Civil Air Patrol, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration, and the State Department. The HFGCS network supports Overseas Contingency Operations by providing secure, robust, physically diverse terrestrial and airborne transmission paths, providing information services between fixed and deployed operating locations. The HFGCS has also been identified as a key communications component in supporting operations in an anti-access area-denial (A2AD) environment.

The HFGCS program has recently completed the Alternate Network Control Station at Grand Forks AFB, ND, eliminating a major single point of failure of the HFGCS network. Additionally, the program has modernized the system consoles to provide increased system security and operations capabilities and has installed additional radios at HFGCS stations to consolidate with US Navy operations, allowing the Navy to close obsolete HF stations. FY17 funds Direct Mission Support/Program Management Administration (DMS/PMA), System Engineering, JITC Installation Testing and Shipping costs for these procurement efforts.

Funding for this effort is in program element 0303133F</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The HFGCS FY17 program supports two main projects within the SCOPE Command Radio/Network Infrastructure Modernization and continues the Antenna Replacement program.

1. SCOPE Command Radio/Network Infrastructure Modernization continues the implementation of improved COTS radio and console capabilities into the HFGCS network. The current projects improve the system efficiencies within radio operations and mission control, as well as maintain interoperability and compatibility with the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the Defense Information System Network (DISN). FY17 funds Direct Mission Support/ Program Management Administration (DMS/PMA), System Engineering, JITC Installation Testing and Shipping costs for these procurement efforts.

A. HIGH FREQUENCY GLOBAL NEXT GENERATION CONSOLE (HFG NGC) Modernization: FY17 continues HFG NGC Modernization by funding the installation of Increment 4, Efficiencies. NGC Efficiencies increment production was funded in FY15. The NGC Efficiencies increment eliminates Any Console/Any Station (ACAS) operator control inefficiencies and limits degradation of HF services due to HFGCS operator manpower restrictions and workload. NGC redesigns the operator user interface to make it more intuitive to support today's radio operator, realigned under the computer client system administrator career field.

B. HFGCS Network Modernization (Unified Capabilities/Audio Communications Functionality): FY17 continues the modernization of the HFGCS network from an analog based to internet protocol (IP) based network. HFGCS must ensure their circuit interfaces are compatible with DISA architecture evolution as identified in the DISN Technical Evolution Plan dated 25 May 2010 and the DISN Overarching Technical Strategy 2011 dated 31 Aug 2011.The Unified Capabilities (UC) will migrate the HFGCS network away from Legacy interfaces and aligns HFGCS with the DISA vision. In addition to the DISA transition from an analog to IP based network, the audio subsystem switching system is past its end of life. The Audio Communications (AC) functionality will replace/eliminate the Digital Electronic Switch (DES) as neither the DES nor Liberty Star-3 (LS-3) switch is on the Approved Product List. The use of these switches also limits the HFGCS ability to develop advanced capabilities. Removing the LS-3 and IDPX-1000 DES from the HFGCS and/or replacing them with Open Architecture, non-proprietary, commercially available, modular components maintains compatibility with the DISN Technical Evolution Plan and DISN Overarching Technical Strategy. This modernization will also position the program to leverage wideband/digital HF.

2. HIGH FREQUENCY GLOBAL ANTENNA REPLACEMENT: A majority of the HFGCS system antennas have been in operation for 25 to 40 years and have been subjected to degradation due to exposure to severe environmental conditions, salt water, and hurricane force winds. FY17 funds continue the replacement of critical antennas at HFGCS sites; actual locations and antenna selections will be based on technical assessment of the antenna condition and the operational requirements of the weapon system during execution. Planned replacements for FY17 have been identified at Hawaii, with Elmendorf, Ascension Island, Joint Base Andrews, West Coast, Guam, Croughton, Lajes, Sigonella, Offutt, Yokota, and Hawaii scheduled for follow-on efforts.</proc:Justification>

Each site has unique site installation requirements (i.e. terrain, weather, environmental laws, international/NATO coordination). Locations range from Diego Garcia, Ascension Island, Lajes, and Guam (mid-ocean locations, volcanic terrain and weather issues); Maryland and California (environmental laws); Yokota, Croughton, and Sigonella (international/NATO coordination). As such, unit cost varies from year to year.</proc:Remarks>

Imagery Acquisition and Audiovisual (AV) systems and their products are used throughout the Air Force to inform and train warfighters and to document combat operations and other events of historical significance. Combat video documentation is used for operational reporting and analysis, situational awareness, battle damage assessment, intelligence and operational analysis, casualty identification, and the historical record. In addition, video and multimedia based products are developed for warfighter operations, readiness training, medical videography, public and internal information, testing and evaluation, and corporate communications. Commanders recognize that imagery quickly conveys very accurate and unbiased information, and are requiring greater amounts of video imagery to help meet the challenges of a very active warfighting force. The Air Force is meeting this challenge by dedicating funding to procure and sustain this important capability by replacing older video studio systems with newer and more capable equipment and systems for both Air Force video production and combat/contingency documentation teams. Imagery acquisition systems are centrally managed to establish and maintain standardization of systems, as well as to ensure full interoperability with all other electronic image acquisition, transmission system formats, and presentation systems used in the Air Force.

WESTERN TEST RANGE DIGITAL IMAGING SYSTEMS: This program replaces obsolete, 35 year-old high-speed engineering film cameras with high-speed digital imaging systems. This capital equipment replacement procures items to maintain current capability. These cameras are mounted on mobile optical tracking systems and on camera towers next to the launch pad to provide detailed slow motion photography of the launch events. The cameras support satellite, ballistic, missile defense, and aeronautical missions on the Western Test Range and at Kodiak Island, Alaska. The optical data acquired by these engineering camera systems is a vital part of post flight performance analysis of all space and ballistic launch operations and is critical for Test and Evaluation programs now being conducted by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) at Vandenberg AFB. Optical tracking provides detailed engineering sequential photography for anomaly resolution and accident reconstruction at distances up to 60 kilometers, and is required for all current and future MDA tests and Delta IV, Atlas IV, Delta II, Peacekeeper, Minuteman, Airborne Laser, Kinetic Kill Vehicle, and commercial space launches. These digital systems replace film camera systems that are no longer logistically supportable.</proc:Description>

FY17 Funds procure items to meet AF mandates from CJCSI 3205.01C, DODI 5040.02, and AFI 35-109. These policy documents exist to ensure DoD and AF compliance with public laws: 36 CFR 1237/1220 and Title 44 Chapters 3301/3101. These funds are used for audio/visual equipment funding at the only three AF active duty COMCAM squadrons, which provide lobal/deployable rapid response during wartime operations, worldwide crises, contingencies, joint exercises, and humanitarian operations. Additionally, these funds procure audio/visual equipment supporting AF-wide(garrison and deployed) needs for photo, graphics and video products that aid public diplomacy, internal/external communication, information operations, operational/planning efforts, and effective/efficient training.

            <proc:Description>MINUTEMAN Communications PE 0101323F - P-40A
This equipment supports the Minuteman Minimum Essential Communication Network (MEECN) Program (MMP) with Very Low Frequency (VLF) cable infrastructure.  The underground cables at Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Launch Control Centers (LCCs) are aging and require replacement.

            <proc:Description>Shared Early Warning (SEW) PE 0308699F - P-40A
The Shared Early Warning System (SEWS) - SEWS provides accurate and timely ballistic missile warning information generated by space-based infrared sensors.  This information is distributed to three combatant commanders (USEUCOM, USCENTCOM, USPACOM), NATO, and multiple foreign partner nations located within each of the serviced COCOMs. U.S. forces and foreign partner nations receive missile warning data via a dedicated communications network flowing from the Centralized Distribution Facility (CDF) at Peterson AFB, CO to secondary distribution facilities located with the COCOMs and distribution hubs located in foreign partner nation operations centers.  Data segregation for the foreign nation partners is maintained through the use of approved cross domain solutions with unique rule sets that reflect Office of the Secretary of Defense policy regarding the dissemination of missile warning data to foreign nations.  SEWS received funding to support incremental technical upgrades to replace outdated components and accommodate newer software products. SEWS requires substantial upgrades in both commercial off the shelf (COTS) and government off the shelf (GOTS) hardware and software in order to support new Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) mandated data processing capabilities, new missile warning message formats, and cyber security requirements set forth in Department of Defense Instruction 8500.1 (DODI 8500.1).  SEWS will not be able to sustain the missile warning message delivery accuracy and timeliness required by policy or program directives without these hardware and software upgrades. FY17 funding will be used to replace outdated hardware and software component such as, but not limited to, virtual processors, routers, intrusion detection software, network logging software and other material solutions required for operational and cyber security continuity.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>AN/GRN-29,INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM (ILS) MODIFICATION: The ILS consists of two subsystems which provide horizontal (localizer) and vertical (glide slope) guidance to allow aircraft to make a precision approach to a runway in inclement weather. The current 1970s era ILS systems are approaching the end of their intended life cycle, yet these systems will be required until approximately 2030. The AN/GRN-29 modification includes new localizer electronics, glide slope electronics, and glide slope antennas. The localizer antennas have already been replaced. The new equipment will also provide improved reliability and reduce manpower through remote adjustment and flight inspection capabilities. Equipment procurement and installation are being accomplished through a turnkey contract, that will be followed with interim contractor support and stand-up of an organic depot. 

FY17 funds will procure/install 17 modification kits (17 AD/0 ANG/0 AFR).

The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $4.259 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

                    <proc:Description>This program, PE 0305114F, P-3A Mod ATCALS, Deployable TACAN Retrofit/Refurbishment, is a new start.
The  Deployable TACAN (D-TACAN) system provides navigation and night/adverse weather  landing capability to military aircraft at deployed locations and is critical to the AFCENT combat flying mission. The D-TACANs are used to set up bare base airfields and to restore airfields that have been damaged, destroyed, or sabotaged. Systems have been deployed in extreme environmental conditions since 2008 and require major overhaul/refurbishment prior to any re-deployments. These systems also require an extensive modification/retrofit to meet the configuration of the current AF Deployable TACAN the AN/TRN-48.

FY17 OCO funds modify/refurbish 3 Deployable TACANs (3 AD/0 ANG/0 AFR)

Milestone/Development Status

TRN-48 Deployable TACAN modification/refurbishment kit proof complete. Three system previously upgraded with prior year funds.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>This program, PE 0305137F Mods, P-3A NAS Mod 1, National Airspace System (NAS) Mod 1, is a new start.
The DAAS System, also known as the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) was fielded in three different hardware configurations and three distinct software builds. This upgrade, establishes a standard system configuration and ensures continued system supportability and availability by upgrading current DAAS/STARS Gen 1 and Gen 2 locations to the DAAS/STARS Enhanced Local Integrated Tower Equipment (ELITE) or Gen 4 (G4) configuration, enabling them to operate with latest FAA/DoD software. Current DAAS/STARS Gen 1 and Gen 2 processors and associated network equipment have gone end of life. Configuration consolidation also reduces multiple, simultaneous efforts associated with system software development and test while reducing cost outlays. 

FY17 funds will procure 4 upgrade kits (4 AD/0 ANG/0 AFR).

Milestone/Development Status

Modification kits have already been kit proofed by FAA and are available off FAA contract.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) Protection Program: HEMP Protection modification implements OSD, CJCS &amp; USSTRATCOM HEMP survivability requirements for all Ground Based Radars (GBRs).  GBR upgrades are advocated by the USSTRATCOM/CC and downward directed and funded by the DepSecDef. Upgrades for various GBR complexes have been performed and are planned to be completed as part of HEMP modernization program for critical Air Force Space Command sites. This program will install and upgrade HEMP protection of main radar, power plant emergency power, and SATCOM antennas. Once HEMP protection is installed and upgraded, there will be Verification tests conducted IAW MIL-STD-188-125 as the basis-of certification by USSTRATCOM.  Once Certification is granted, the annual Integrated Nuclear Survivability and Endurability Report (INSER) will be updated to show survivability status and reported to the JCS and Congress.

                    <proc:Description>The Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) is a ground-based radar system whose primary mission of missile warning (MW) provides United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) with credible Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) data on all Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) penetrating the coverage area. This data includes an estimation of launch and predicted impact (L&amp;PI) locations and times. Additionally, BMEWS provides USSTRATCOM and other users with ITW/AA data on Sea-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) penetrating the coverage area. The Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR) sites at Thule and Fylingdales have a co-primary mission of Missile Defense (MD) supporting the Missile Defense Agency (Clear scheduled for UEWR upgrade in 2016). The secondary mission of BMEWS supports the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) mission by providing near-earth satellite surveillance, tracking and identification as required by the Joint Space Operations Center, Alternate Space Operations Center, and the National Air and Space Intelligence Center. The BMEWS consists of: Thule Air Base, Greenland; Clear Air Force Station, AK; and Royal Air Force (RAF) Fylingdales, UK. Additionally there is a fourth site for testing (System Program Agency) located in the Centralized Integration Support Facility (CISF) at Peterson AFB, CO. This effort is funded in PE0305909F.

DATA PROCESSOR/SIGNAL PROCESSOR (DP/SP) SUITE REPLACEMENT.  (formerly BMEWS Evolutionary SGI Replacement Modification Program)  replaces obsolete or unsupportable system components and subsystems to address evolving space and missile threats.  The BMEWS mission equipment and associated sustainment suites consist of a mix of unique custom-built components that are increasingly more difficult t maintain due to availability of replacement parts and obsolete COTS based subsystems that are no longer supported by the original equipment manufacturers.  Without these modifications there is a high risk that Information Assurance issues and equipment failures will cause unacceptable mission downtime in order to troubleshoot and repair.  FY17 will fund replacement of unsupportable mission and sustainment equipment (with any required initial spares) to include, but not limited to, Display and Signal Processors, associated processors, and display hardware.

                    <proc:Description>Formerly part of SPACE MOD SPACE mod BPAC 836790 FY15 and prior in OPAF and appropriated in Space Procurement Air Force in FY16. PAVE PHASED ARRAY WARNING SYSTEM (PAVE PAWS): PAVE PAWS radar is a ground based system with missions to support the Missile Correlation, Space Surveillance and Missile Defense Centers. These radars are located at Beale AFB, CA and Cod AFS, MA. The primary mission is to provide United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) with credible Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) data on all Sea-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) penetrating the coverage area and predicted impact (L&amp;PI) data for attack assessment and response determination. The secondary mission is to provide credible data on all Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) penetrating the coverage area. The tertiary mission is to support the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) network providing near-earth satellite surveillance and tracking, reporting observational (metric), SOI on man-made satellites and maintenance of the space catalog to prevent the significantly increasing potential for collisions with national assets, including manned space platforms. The PAVE PAWS mission equipment and associated sustainment suites consist of a mix of unique, custom-built components that are increasingly more difficult to maintain due to availability of replacement parts and obsolete COTS based subsystems that are no longer supported by the original equipment manufacturers. In addition, radar transmit &amp; receive components, processing equipment, and power distribution elements, and other radar front-end equipment are 30+ years old, highly inefficient, and require replacement. Without these replacements there is a high risk that equipment failures will cause unacceptable mission downtime in order to troubleshoot and repair. FY17 will fund replacement of unsupportable mission and sustainment equipment to include (with any required initial spares), but not limited to, processing equipment, power supplies, beam steering/shaping units, test sets, and analysis hardware.

                    <proc:Description>Formerly part of Space Mods Space mod BPAC 836790 in OPAF for FY15 and prior, appropriated in Space Procurement Air Force in FY16.  Perimeter Acquisition Radar Attack Characterization System (PARCS) Program Office plans for and procures replacement components for unsupportable, unobtainable, and unreliable system components. PARCS equipment is composed of custom built components that became obsolete in the 1980's. Most spare parts for this system are no longer available and have no logistics tail. Without replacements there is a high risk of mission failure and/or unacceptable downtime for repair. To best ensure operational availability, replacement projects are performed in phases targeting the highest risk components of the subsystems. 

FY17 will fund ongoing program management administrative costs supporting PARCS modification efforts funded in Space Procurement Air Force in FY16.

                    <proc:Description>Formerly part of SPACE MOD SPACE mod BPAC 836790 FY15 and prior in OPAF and appropriated in Space Procurement Air Force in FY16. PAVE PHASED ARRAY WARNING SYSTEM (PAVE PAWS) radar is a ground based system with missions to support the Missile Correlation, Space Surveillance and Missile Defense Centers. These radars are located at Beale AFB, CA and Cod AFS, MA. The primary mission is to provide United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) with credible Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) data on all Sea-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) penetrating the coverage area and predicted impact (L&amp;PI) data for attack assessment and response determination. The secondary mission is to provide credible data on all Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) penetrating the coverage area. The tertiary mission is to support the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) network providing near-earth satellite surveillance and tracking, reporting observational (metric), SOI on man-made satellites and maintenance of the space catalog to prevent the significantly increasing potential for collisions with national assets, including manned space platforms. PAVE PAWS MODIFICATION (formerly PAVE PAWS Front-End Replacement) replaces obsolete or unsupportable system components and subsystems to address evolving space and missile threats. The PAVE PAWS mission equipment and associated sustainment suites consist of a mix of unique, custom-built components that are increasingly more difficult to maintain due to availability of replacement parts and obsolete COTS based subsystems that are no longer supported by the original equipment manufacturers. In addition, radar transmit &amp; receive components, processing equipment, and power distribution elements, and other radar front-end equipment are 30+ years old, highly inefficient, and require replacement. Without these replacements there is a high risk that equipment failures will cause unacceptable mission downtime in order to troubleshoot and repair. FY17 will fund ongoing program management administrative costs supporting PAVE PAWS modification efforts funded in Space Procurement Air Force in FY16.

                    <proc:Description>Formerly part of Space Mods Space mod BPAC 836790 in OPAF for FY15 and prior, appropriated in Space Procurement Air Force in FY16.  Perimeter Acquisition Radar Attack Characterization System (PARCS) Program Office plans for and procures replacement components for unsupportable, unobtainable, and unreliable system components. PARCS equipment is composed of custom built components that became obsolete in the 1980's. Most spare parts for this system are no longer available and have no logistics tail. Without replacements there is a high risk of mission failure and/or unacceptable downtime for repair. To best ensure operational availability, replacement projects are performed in phases targeting the highest risk components of the subsystems. 

FY17 funds will be used to modify the PARCS system for the replacement of unsupportable and unreliable components to include (with any required initial spares), but not limited to, the PARCS Mission Data Processor, Radar Transmitter, Antenna Group, Exciter Group, Radio Frequency Signal Processor Group, Performance Monitor Group, Radar Return Generator Group, Digital Data Group, and Radar Controller Group.

FY16 funding includes $3.580M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations (Guardian Angel Fusion Goggle-Enhanced).

Modern warfare resulted in an increase in airborne combat under the cover of darkness. Night missions include ground operations, preparation of the aircraft for take-off and landings in complete darkness, lights-off air refueling, and visual identification of enemy targets hidden under the night sky. Consequently, ground personnel and aircrew require the capability to see in very low visibility conditions at night and high ambient light conditions such as full moon or heavily lighted residential areas. The use of Night Vision Goggles (NVG) is critical for combat rescue, special operations, and homeland security missions. 

A lack of night vision capability would significantly decrease combat effectiveness in night operations, risk flight safety, and increase the probability of fratricide. Aircraft such as HH-60 helicopters, HC-130s, F-16s, and special mission C-130s primarily operate in low altitude environments during covert night operations. Hence, NVGs are vital to the success of these missions, providing a dramatic increase in safety, situational awareness, and survivability during the execution of near daytime tactics, including visual formation criteria. Furthermore, the proliferation of NVG-equipped adversaries underscores the urgent need to supply ground and air forces with night vision equipment.

Funding for this exhibit contained in Program Elements (PEs) 0702833F, 0207227F, and 0207588F.

Ground crew Goggles:

AN/PVS-14 Ground crew Goggle: This monocular night vision device is a hand-held, head-mounted, helmet-mounted, or weapon-mounted night vision system, which enables walking, weapon firing, short-range surveillance, map reading, vehicle maintenance, and first-aid administration during moonlight and starlight conditions. The AN/PVS-14 supports a vast spectrum of ground and air operations to include aircraft maintenance, civil engineering, emergency response, security, and other missions.   

AN/PVS-15 Ground crew Goggle: This binocular NVG is a helmet-mounted or hand-held night vision system, which is primarily used by Special Forces during night drop operations. The AN/PVS-15 can be used for all nighttime ground operations. An added benefit of this particular binocular goggle is the back-up capability in the event one of the two tubes fails.   

Guardian Angel Fusion Goggle - Enhanced (FGE):  The FGE is a helmet mounted dual waveband goggle which will increase identification and discrimination of combatants in most battlefield conditions and light levels through the use of image intensification fused with thermal imagery.  Continued procurement of systems are required for combat rescue until the next generation of multi-spectral NVGs are developed and available for ground crew operators. Due to rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements.
 
    
Aircrew Goggles:     

AN/AVS-9 (F4949G-TG) Aircrew Goggle: This night vision goggle provides aircraft and ground personnel with the capability to see the horizon, terrain features and enemy ground fire, thereby reducing the potential for air-to-ground fratricide and mid-air collisions during night operations. The AN/AVS-9 (F4949-TG) is a light-weight, helmet-mounted goggle equipped with pinnacle tube technology that mitigates effects of sudden bright light exposure. 

Test Sets: 

ANV-20/20 Test Set, Infinity Focus: The ANV-20/20 is a portable instrument, which allows quick and accurate evaluation and adjustment of all goggle parameters. All NVGs require operational checkout.  

ANV-126A Test Set, Infrared Viewer: The ANV-126A is a commercial upgrade to the ANV-126, which is suitable for field operational checks and depot level NVG maintenance. This test set provides accurate checks for NVG resolution, gain, power drain, binocular goggle collimation, image quality, and image distortion. The ANV-126A uses state of the art technology and provides enhanced capabilities to the user.

ANV-126A-UGF Test Set, Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) Kit: The ANV-126A-UGF is a commercial TCTO kit that converts the ANV-126 to the ANV-126A Test Set.

            <proc:Description>This program provides a wide variety of base support and safety of flight items for warfighters with worldwide application. 

Procures safety and rescue equipment, developed in Program Element (PE) 0604706F, Life Support Systems, for increased protection of aircrew personnel operating manned, non-space aircraft to optimize weapon system effectiveness and capability throughout the full spectrum of military operations. In general, the purpose of the PE is to expand the combat capabilities of a weapon system an airman supports while balancing functionality, comfort, and safety. Representative items include flight helmets, oxygen breathing equipment, flame resistant/retardant and blast protective gear, laser eye protection, personnel locator beacons, nuclear flash blindness devices, personnel parachutes, ejection seats/equipment, survival radio test sets, life rafts, life preservers, anti-exposure coveralls, and other air/ground crew equipment. 

Guardian Angel Family of Systems:
Guardian Angel is an Air Force non-aircraft weapon system within the overarching Battlefield Airman Modernization Program. Guardian Angel is a family of systems based on human and equipment capabilities formulated to execute Air Force Combat Search and Rescue and personnel recovery across a full spectrum of military operations. Guardian Angel family of systems is employed by three distinct Air Force Specialties: Pararescuemen (PJ), Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) and Combat Rescue Officer (CRO). Representative items include but are not limited to parachute equipment, technical rescue equipment, information management systems, rescue craft and a Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) Training Simulator (simulator, maintenance &amp; mobile shelter costs) to supplement,  augment, and optimize current training events, independent of aircraft availability to align with strategic plans of the Next Generation LVC for training within the DoD.. Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements. This includes applicable training, spares, and repairs. Due to rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements.  Due to rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements.
Guardian Angel Enhanced Night Vision Systems:  Continued Procurement of Night Vision solutions that improve personnel recovery night visions systems with wider field of view, lower SWAP, and/or enhanced vision in at least one spectral band other than Near-IR. Procurement is required to meet mission needs until the next generation of multi-spectral NVGs are developed and available for ground crew operators. Due to rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements.
All funding and tasks from FY17-FY21 have been moved from Project 842140 Night Vision Goggles to Project 842990, Items Less than $5 Million.  


Special Tactics/Combat Control Battlefield Airmen program funds Air Force standardized equipment within the overarching Battlefield Airman Modernization program for Special Tactics combat  controllers, pararescue personnel, combat weather operators and tactical air control parties to
perform their Air Force Special Operations Command mission. Funding for this effort is in program element 0408011F.  FY17 funds purchase of new DoD standardized  Military Freefall Parachutes
for USAF Special Tactics units.   

Modern warfare resulted in an increase in airborne combat under the cover of darkness. Night missions include ground operations, preparation of the aircraft for take-off and landings in complete darkness, lights-off air refueling, and visual identification of enemy targets hidden under the night sky. Consequently, ground personnel and aircrew require the capability to see in very low visibility conditions at night and high ambient light conditions such as full moon or heavily lighted residential areas. The use of Night Vision Goggles (NVG) is critical for combat rescue, special operations, and homeland security missions. 

A lack of night vision capability would significantly decrease combat effectiveness in night operations, risk flight safety, and increase the probability of fratricide. Aircraft such as HH-60 helicopters, HC-130s, F-16s, and special mission C-130s primarily operate in low altitude environments during covert night operations. Hence, NVGs are vital to the success of these missions, providing a dramatic increase in safety, situational awareness, and survivability during the execution of near daytime tactics, including visual formation criteria. Furthermore, the proliferation of NVG-equipped adversaries underscores the urgent need to supply ground and air forces with night vision equipment.

Ground crew Goggles:

AN/PVS-14 Ground crew Goggle: This monocular night vision device is a hand-held, head-mounted, helmet-mounted, or weapon-mounted night vision system, which enables walking, weapon firing, short-range surveillance, map reading, vehicle maintenance, and first-aid administration during moonlight and starlight conditions. The AN/PVS-14 supports a vast spectrum of ground and air operations to include aircraft maintenance, civil engineering, emergency response, security, and other missions.   

AN/PVS-15 Ground crew Goggle: This binocular NVG is a helmet-mounted or hand-held night vision system, which is primarily used by Special Forces during night drop operations. The AN/PVS-15 can be used for all nighttime ground operations. An added benefit of this particular binocular goggle is the back-up capability in the event one of the two tubes fails.   

 
    
Aircrew Goggles:     

AN/AVS-9 (F4949G-TG) Aircrew Goggle: This night vision goggle provides aircraft and ground personnel with the capability to see the horizon, terrain features and enemy ground fire, thereby reducing the potential for air-to-ground fratricide and mid-air collisions during night operations. The AN/AVS-9 (F4949-TG) is a light-weight, helmet-mounted goggle equipped with pinnacle tube technology that mitigates effects of sudden bright light exposure. 

Test Sets: 

ANV-20/20 Test Set, Infinity Focus: The ANV-20/20 is a portable instrument, which allows quick and accurate evaluation and adjustment of all goggle parameters. All NVGs require operational checkout.  

ANV-126A Test Set, Infrared Viewer: The ANV-126A is a commercial upgrade to the ANV-126, which is suitable for field operational checks and depot level NVG maintenance. This test set provides accurate checks for NVG resolution, gain, power drain, binocular goggle collimation, image quality, and image distortion. The ANV-126A uses state of the art technology and provides enhanced capabilities to the user.

ANV-126A-UGF Test Set, Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) Kit: The ANV-126A-UGF is a commercial TCTO kit that converts the ANV-126 to the ANV-126A Test Set.

            <proc:Description>The Mechanized Materiel Handling Equipment line provides funding for Mechanized Materiel Handling Systems (MMHS) and Storage Aids Systems (SAS). 

MMHS and SAS equipment provide bases worldwide with automated and static equipment to store, receive, and ship materiel. MMHS and SAS equipment involves the design and acquisition of mechanized and non-mechanized materiel handling systems such as receiving, storage, and distribution systems; high density storage systems; and a variety of SAS equipment including racks, bin shelving, modular cabinets, and mezzanines. 

Transportation systems generally include equipment such as heavy duty freight handling 463L conveyors, pallet buildup/breakdown lift conveyor stations, cargo staging racks, and overhead bridge cranes for air freight terminal systems; roller conveyors and overhead cranes for aerial delivery facility systems; narrow aisle vehicle replacements; and external aircraft fuel tank storage systems. Adequately equipped facilities are essential to the storage and handling of weapon system components, and the processing of personnel, baggage, and freight to reduce pipeline time and to provide Air Force capability to respond to crises and threats whenever they occur in the world. 

The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $0.077 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.

Program elements associated with this P-1 Line are 0202834F, 0702834F, 0802834F, 0402834F, 0502834F, 0502844F, 0207597F, and 0401221F.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY17 procurement funds MMHS/SAS equipment which increases the productivity of Air Force operations, enhances management control of assets, reduces multiple handling of logistics materiel by consolidating assets, increases flexibility at a minimum investment cost, enhances safety, reduces losses due to damage of materiel in transport, and reduces congestion and delays in the receiving, storage and issue operations in supply, base level maintenance, and transportation facilities.

            <proc:Justification>Base Procured Equipment: 

Power Conditioning &amp; Continuation Interfacing Equipment (PCCIE): 
The PCCIE Program Office procures, replaces and modernizes uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems to meet Air Force requirements.  Many of these systems have exceeded the life expectancy of 12-15 years.  PCCIE program is structured into small projects (from 3 - 125 kilovolt amps (kva)) and large projects (greater than 125 kva) and includes associated ancillary equipment.

PE 84731F - funds procure: 

a). Keesler Trainer/Simulator for Expeditionary Combat Support Radio Course: TS-4528A/U Multi-Channel DOCCT/S System (2x 3U), Two Channel, Lab/Class Local RF; Includes redundant power supply, training &amp; IW Phase II channel control capability. This item simulates a UHF satellite terminal 
control station as well as the satellite system itself. It enables two-satellite ground terminals to establish a connection and pass data and voice communications to each other. It is used to certify objective completion in the Expeditionary Combat Support Radio course. 

b). Goodfellow AFB Fire Training Burn Trainers: New Fire Cause and Fire Inspection Trainers, Structural Burn Training Fire Box and SBCA Compressor and Air Pack Fill Station Replacement. 

c). Parachute System for Pararescue and Combat Rescue Officer training (Lackland AFB): Purchase of RamAir (RA-1) Parachute System  

PE 84752F - funds procure Laboratory equipment for AF Institute of Technology. 

Power Conditioning &amp; Continuation Interfacing Equipment (PCCIE):
The new systems collectively satisfy critical user requirements and will:
1. Reduce overall footprint and weight by 50-60%.
2. Reduce operating and sustainment costs by 30%-50%.
3. Reduce acquisition costs as it applies to installation since many newer systems consist of more internal pre-wiring.
4. Lower parts count dramatically improves reliability by reducing the potential points of failure within the system.
5. Produce greater energy savings and higher operating efficiency in all configurations, typically between 92% and 93.5%; with all types of loads.
The Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) systems protect sensitive electronic equipment/systems such as command and control centers, intelligence missions, radars, etc.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>FY17 Baseline Funding EOD: Program Elements Codes (PECs)associated with P-1 Line are PEC 0204424F (Explosive Ordnance Disposal Forces)for $7.971M and PEC 0208028F Airfield Damage Repair (ADR) program for $0.397M funding were zeroed out by an OSD Resource Management Decision (RMD) INV-001.

FY17 OCO Funding JCREW - 0205671F and the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) for the Airfield Damage Repair (ADR)- 0208028F PECs associated with P-1 Line:

FY17 OCO funding of $51.900M in PEC 0205671F will procure Joint Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (JCREW) Mounted and Dismounted systems. JCREW systems are critical self-protection of Mine Resistant, Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle mounted, EOD dismounted and airbase Entry Control Point operations. 

FY17 OCO funding of $2.0M in PEC 0208028F will procure European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) for the Airfield Damage Repair (ADR) program. The funding provides civil engineers specialized airfield damage repair equipment to rapidly repair and recover airfields after attack.  The time required to accomplish runway repairs is operationally unacceptable with the current Rapid Runway Repair capability.  Current efforts under ADR are intended to bring the repair time into operational acceptable limits in support of COCOM post attach Air Tasking Orders.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY17 Baseline procurement dollars procures EOD Specialized Equipment and Airfield Damage Repair Kits. 

FY17 PEC 0204424F Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) forces and PEC 0208028F Airfield Damage Repair (ADR) program funding were zeroed out by an OSD Resource Management Decision (RMD) INV-001.


FY17 OCO funding: 

FY17 OCO funding of $51.900M in PEC 0205671F will procure Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (JCREW)systems in the following quantities: 49 JCREW Dismounted systems and 218 JCREW Mounted systems. JCREW systems are critical self-protection for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle mounted, EOD dismounted and airbase Entry Control Point operations.

FY17 OCO funding of $2.0M in PEC 0208028F funds the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) for Airfield Damage Repair (ADR) program and will procure support equipment items for the Major Repair component of Air Field Damage Repair Training/Small Size Kits. The support equipment items include ADR Tool Trailers (hand tools and small equipment items required for crater repair), Small Repair Kits (hand tools and saws for expeditious and semi-permanent repairs), Inclement Weather Kits (tools and materials to place rapid setting materials in cold, hot, and wet weather), water skids (provides supplemental weather for rapid setting materials), and light carts (support night operations). The Basic/Small kit is used to provide basic repair equipment/materials in order to repair approximately 18 small (10ft diameter) craters or three, 25 diameter craters in 6.5 hours. Additional airfield damage can be repaired based on the availability of time and materials. Basic/Small kits will also be used at training locations.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>FY15 funds Air Force Productivity Capital Investment (PCI) projects in the Productivity Investment Fund (PIF) program.  Funds are available to all Air Force organizations to encourage productivity enhancements for more efficient operations, focus on labor cost savings, and reductions in unit costs of operations.  This program conserves critical resources, enhances unit capability, and improves combat effectiveness.  

Program element associated with this line is 0901215F.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY15 procurement dollars will procure qualifying projects that must cost $250,000 or more, and amortize in less than four years.  Projects are approved based on shortest payback and highest rate of return on investment.  Projects continue to yield life cycle savings of over $3 for every $1 invested.  Productivity Capital Investments is an ongoing program.

Major Commands provide their own offsets from projected savings to sustain future investments for this program.  This funding improves the capability to implement productivity improvements and enhancements in the work place, throughout the Air Force. 

No Budget Year FY2017 funding requested.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This program funds procurement of Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR). It includes equipment to support the bed down of deployed forces (personnel, aircraft and support equipment) at austere and semi-austere locations. BEAR assets are a critical Agile Combat Support enabler for the Expeditionary Air Force. BEAR is composed of five types of air base capability packages: housekeeping, feeding, hygiene, power generation and flight line. Flight line packages consist of airfield lighting, aircraft hangars, fire stations, and numerous additional systems to support airfield operations. The program provides funding to procure new and replacement equipment items, and multi-media packages required to support BEAR training facilities at Silver Flag Sites, Regional Training Sites, Technical Schools, Technical Certification Centers, Services Combat Center Training, 49MMG, and Eagle Flag. Costs include inventory reconstitution, spares and consumables, repairs, and procurement of new equipment for upgrades or full UTC's replacement. BEAR demonstrated its critical role in support of Operations Enduring Freedom and other operations worldwide. 

The AF continues to modernize major BEAR components to replace obsolete and inefficient items (e.g. Power Generation, Hygiene, Refrigeration,EALS, MAAS, Shelters, and Feeding): 

Force Module Water System: Water System takes non-potable water and converts it into potable water. The system is modular and scalable in design and consists of Source Run, Water Production, Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU), Initial, Follow-on, and Industrial Operations, Flight line Extension, freeze protection, grey water recovery, pumping, piping, and storage equipment; applicable fittings; and other components such as fluid control valves. 

Power System: Consists of prime and secondary power equipment which provides the capability to generate and distribute power to billeting, feeding, flight line and industrial operations at forward deployed sites. The primary power source for BEAR bed down locations is the BEAR Power Unit (BPU). The BPU is an 800 kilowatt (kW) Tier II compliant diesel generator. The power from the BPU is distributed through buried high voltage cabling and stepped down to facility power through the Secondary Distribution Center (SDC). The SDC is a 150 kilovolt-ampere (KVA) transformer capable of supporting twelve (12) billeting shelters via the Primary Distribution Panels (PDP). 

Expeditionary Airfield Lighting System (EALS): Light Emitting Diode (LED) and incandescent runway lighting system designed to be rapidly installed at contingency airfields and at other locations that need temporary airfield lighting. The lighting kit for runways includes runway edge and threshold lights, precision approach path indicator (PAPI), and strobe approach lights, distance to go marker lamps, taxi way lamps and battery-operated obstruction lights. The EALS also includes the generators, cables, control cables, transformers and regulators. The entire system is packaged on six (6) mobile trailers. 

Mobile Aircraft Arresting System: This air transportable barrier arresting Bak-12 mounted on a mobile trailer to accommodate the recovery of fighter aircraft returning to battle damaged airfield. 

Hygiene: Hygiene includes Shower, Shave and Latrine, and Self Help Laundry system which provides personal hygiene facilities in support of BEAR bases. 

Hygiene Shelters: Hygiene Shelters are designed to be used as changing rooms connecting to the BEAR Hygiene System. The shelters support personnel utilizing BEAR Hygiene Systems. 

Refrigeration: Refrigeration units designed for the carriage of deep frozen, frozen, chilled and general cargo by road, rail, air, and sea (above or below deck), suitable for austere environmental conditions. It is used to support the BEAR services, feeding and mortuary operations. 

Shelters: Shelters vary in sizes and are needed for billeting, kitchen, hygiene, and aircraft and equipment maintenance. Includes lighting, electrical equipment, environmental control units, remote area lighting, Shelter Flies, Shelter Flooring/matting for various shelter sizes, Shelter liners. 

Shelter Flooring: Shelter flooring varies in size for small and large shelters (ACH, LAMS, Mortuary). 

Feeding: BEAR Feeding includes kitchen and all applicable equipment. BEAR Feeding system provides the capability to prepare, and then serve, 500 meals over a two hour serving period, twice per day (24 hour period). The Feeding system is worldwide deployable and supports numerous basing options. This system supports initial mission requirements and follow-on high mobility feeding requirements for rapidly deployable mobility packages and other contingencies in all theaters of operation. 

10K Fuel Bladder: Collapsible, coated fabric fuel bladders are often used as an auxiliary fuel source for MEP generators. This is especially true for high fuel-consumption prime power generators. 

Training/Multi-Media Training - Provides BEAR and items for all training sites and funds for all required BEAR multi-media training requirements.

            <proc:Description>This program provides a wide variety of base support items with worldwide application, to include but not limited to: aircraft arresting systems; IPE Equipment; Fuels Support Equipment (FSE)//and Fuels Operational Readiness Capability Equipment (FORCE); Generator Power plants, and Deployable Debrief Facilities (DDF). This equipment provides prime support for all base missions. Lack of funding for these equipment items limits maintenance capabilities, testing functions, anti-terrorism/security missions, communications capabilities, flight operations, and the ability of Air Force units to meet deployment requirements. 

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities. 

Program elements associated with this P-1 Line are: 0202834F, 0207142F, 0208031F, 0208534F, 0208550F, 0401221F, 0402834F, 0502834F, 0502844F, 0702834F, 0802834F.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS)/PE0305208F is the Combat Air Force (CAF) weapon system architecture for planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination (PCPAD) of data from Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Since AF DCGS is also a major component of the DoD DCGS, the system is designed to complement and interoperate with the DoD, Army, Navy and Marine Corps DCGS. The AF DCGS mission is to provide Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, Air Component Commanders, Unified Commands, and other directed organizations with global, time-sensitive ISR PCPAD across the spectrum of military operations. AF DCGS is a multi-INT network linked weapon system (AN/GSQ-272) capable of exploiting intelligence data from manned platforms, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), non-traditional ISR platforms, national and commercial satellites, and other collection systems. AF DCGS is designed to support joint operational requirements by providing a common PCPAD means to provide time-sensitive intelligence to field commanders and in support of the Air Operations Center (AOC) mission requirements. Currently, the AF DCGS worldwide architecture is composed of two worldwide core sites, three regional core sites, two remote Air Force Forces (AF FOR) sites, four National Mission Partner (NMP) sites, three support sites, and multiple National Guard Bureau (NGB) sites. Currently, AF DCGS is supporting ongoing operations from forward deployed and in-garrison CONUS and OCONUS based locations. The system employs a concept of data distribution, information sharing and collaborative work centers. AF DCGS provides the national leadership and the warfighter with integrated and interoperable national and airborne reconnaissance by providing quality and fused Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) tailored to the warfighter for all levels of conflict.  

AF DCGS is transforming by integrating the necessary technologies and tools to provide increased capabilities and meet emerging and urgent operational needs. These efforts will also integrate commercial-off-the-shelf and government-off-the-shelf upgrades to provide current technologies and achieve necessary application services.  The next series of upgrades will meet the operational need to integrate new and/or improved sensor capabilities, as well as enhance interoperability by migrating to an Open Architecture (OA) to improve data sharing ability per DoD direction.

AF DCGS was previously managed by four primary efforts: Geospatial Intelligence-1, Systems Release-1 (SIGINT Intelligence), Net Comms-1 (Network/Comm Infrastructure), and Data Links-1.  Beginning in FY16, to better align with ACC focus areas and associated capabilities, AF DCGS management has evolved into eight efforts consisting of: GEOINT (GB 4.1), GEOINT Transformation, Systems Release (SR 3.0), SIGINT Transformation, Sensor Integration, Multi-INT, Infrastructure Transformation, and DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT): 

1. GB 4.1: The GEOINT Baseline 4.1 (GB4.1) effort completes the Bulk Release process and provides a common baseline across the weapon system.  It also integrates Airborne Cuing and Exploitation System, Hyper Spectral ACES-HY (MQ-1) and Global Hawk Block 40 capability into AF DCGS.
2. GEOINT Transformation-1: The GEOINT Transformation effort rapidly integrates new capabilities and migrates GEOINT-specific applications &amp; capabilities into the open architecture framework.
3. *SR 3.0: The Systems Release (3.0) effort completes SIGINT Bulk Release process and provides a common baseline across the weapon system. Provides the ability to PCPAD the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) family of systems and integrates the Common Intelligence Collections System (CICS) capability. 
4. SIGINT Transformation-1: Rapidly integrate new capabilities, leverage mission partner methods and tools, exchange data, and migrate the SIGINT-specific applications/capabilities into the open architecture framework. 
5. *Sensor Integration-1: The Sensor Integration effort rapidly integrates AF, Joint, &amp; Coalition Sensor data into DCGS Enterprise to ingest data, perform sensor planning, and Command &amp; Control.
6. Multi-INT-1: Provides and supports Open Architecture-based Enterprise Services, moves to commodity hardware, a virtual desktop environment, and facilitates enterprise-wide collaborative tools.
7. Network Infrastructure Transformation-1: The Infrastructure Transformation effort modernizes the AF DCGS infrastructure to improve data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities while migrating the network toward a cloud architecture.
8. DRT: The Air Force DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT) effort provides data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities for NGA reference imagery data.  

NOTE: *Since FY17 appropriation is under $5M in the budget year, system limitations prevent the P-3A from being displayed.

                    <proc:Description>The GEOINT Baseline 4.1 (GB4.1) effort completes the Bulk Release process and provides a common baseline across the weapon system.  It also integrates Airborne Cuing and Exploitation System, Hyper Spectral ACES-HY (MQ-1) and Global Hawk Block 40 capability into AF DCGS.  Furthermore, GB 4.1 provides the capability for planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination (PCPAD) of imagery intelligence. Within this segment are the GEOINT front-end data processors and the imagery exploitation systems. The GEOINT front-end data processors receive the raw data from the sensors via the data relay systems and provide initial processing of the imagery data. The imagery exploitation systems provide analysts the basic capability to exploit, analyze, produce, and disseminate imagery.

Justification:
AF DCGS's Other Procurement Air Force (OPAF) focus is the procurement and fielding of proven technologies for multiple efforts including GEOINT GB4.1, which provides an updated common baseline.  This common baseline is the platform in which all future upgrades will be integrated.   Additionally, future upgrades will also integrate new and/or improved sensor capabilities and enhance interoperability by migrating to an open architecture to improve information sharing in compliance with DoD direction (e.g. Dl2E, ICITE, VIP-C).

In FY17 $.800 Million of Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) modifies storage (controller heads, software, software maintenance, shelves of disks ($.400 Million) and infrastructure (SAN switch on the SIPR) ($.400 Million) for distributed mission system (DMS) capability located at NASIC, Wright-Patterson AFB.

                    <proc:Description>The GEOINT Transformation effort rapidly integrates new capabilities and migrates GEOINT-specific applications &amp; capabilities into the open architecture framework.
Furthermore, GEOINT Transformation provides continuous and incremental improvement to the capability for planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination (PCPAD) of advanced imagery intelligence. GEOINT Transformation builds upon GB4.1 to integrate new sensors, provide enhanced processing techniques, and provide imagery analysts the advanced capability to exploit, analyze, produce, and disseminate imagery.

Justification:
AF DCGS's Other Procurement Air Force (OPAF) focus is the procurement and fielding of proven technologies for multiple programs including GEOINT Transformation.  The GEOINT Transformation leverages an agile infrastructure to use modern information technology (IT) practices and sets the stage from which to accomplish the goals of the AF DCGS architecture roadmap in manageable increments.  GEOINT Transformation builds on the GB4.1 foundation to provide enhanced front-end image processing and advanced exploitation tools, which improve the timeliness and quality of GEOINT products, making them more useful to the war-fighter while simultaneously reducing the workload on the DCGS operator.

Milestone/Development Status

AF DCGS is in the Operations and Sustainment phase of the acquisition lifecycle.  The weapon system has been declared FOC, and all modifications are being implemented in accordance with AFI 63-101.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>The Infrastructure Transformation effort modernizes the AF DCGS infrastructure to improve data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities while migrating the network toward a cloud architecture. Furthermore, the Infrastructure Transformation program adds capabilities to the baseline of the FOC weapon system already fielded and does not replace it.

Justification:  
AF DCGS's Infrastructure Transformation program's main focus is the procurement and fielding of proven technologies for network communications, centralized storage of imagery and full motion video, communication modernization, demilitarized zone, weapon system trainer, x86 infrastructure and address diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) weapons system issues. This program will continue to deliver an integrated net-centric upgrade to the network communications infrastructure; and address any other DMS issues that are identified with legacy systems/components that AF DCGS must interface with. Additionally, upgrades will meet the operational need to store and disseminate new and/or improved sensors, and enhance interoperability by migrating to a service oriented architecture construct and improving data sharing ability in compliance with DoD direction (e.g. Dl2E, VIP-C).

Milestone/Development Status

AF DCGS is in the Operations and Sustainment phase of the acquisition lifecycle.  The weapon system has been declared FOC, and all modifications are being implemented in accordance with AFI 63-101.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>Provides and supports Open Architecture-based Enterprise Services, moves to commodity hardware, a virtual desktop environment, and facilitates enterprise-wide collaborative tools. Furthermore, the Open Architecture (OA), which consists of segment agnostic x86-based hardware workstations capable of supporting the Virtual Desktop Environment to facilitate both Imagery intelligence (IMINT) and SIGINT segment specific software applications; and an enterprise crew communications with Beyond Line of Sight/Line of Sight (BLOS/LOS) voice and data link connectivity between airborne ISR crews and AF DCGS operators.

Justification:
This effort will continue to deliver sustained/modernized Multi-INT Communications, and address any other issues that are identified with other legacy systems/components that AF DCGS must interface with. Additionally, upgrades will meet the operational need to integrate new and/or improved sensor capabilities and storage and architecture requirements to support DCGS OCONUS and enhance interoperability by migrating to an OA construct to improve information sharing and compliance with DoD direction.

Milestone/Development Status

AF DCGS is in the Operations and Sustainment phase of the acquisition lifecycle.  The weapon system has been declared FOC, and all modifications are being implemented in accordance with AFI 63-101.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>The Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Transformation effort rapidly integrates new capabilities, leverage mission partner methods and tools, exchange data, and migrate the SIGINT-specific applications/capabilities into the open architecture framework. 
Furthermore, it develops connectivity directly to NSANET leveraging national SIGINT and the System Release 3.0 (SR3.) architecture to improve the tactical SIGINT available to the warfighter.  The current SR3.0 architecture is comprised of multiple core, Distributed Mission Sites (DMS), and National Guard Bureau sites. Currently, AF DCGS SIGINT is supporting ongoing operations from forward deployed and in-garrison CONUS and OCONUS based locations. The system employs a concept of data distribution, information sharing and collaborative work centers. AF DCGS provides the national leadership and the warfighter with integrated and interoperable national and airborne reconnaissance capabilities in support of SIGINT processing and exploitation capability that can be tailored for all levels of conflict.

Justification:
AF DCGS SIGINT Transformation's focus is AF DCGS connectivity to NSANET. In order to accomplish this, SIGINT modernization must take place within the OA DCGS environment. This includes migration of SR3.0 software to an X86 environment and SIGINT workstation modernization. The NSANET project consist of SIGINT Ops on United States Cryptologic System (USCS) network, streaming special signal audio onto NSA domain for DMS sites, AF DCGS near real time tactical capabilities, DCGS/RJ weapons system interoperability, automated language and speak ID, AF DCGS demultiplexing capability and providing DMS sites with NSANET connectivity.

Milestone/Development Status

AF DCGS is in the Operations and Sustainment phase of the acquisition lifecycle.  The weapon system has been declared FOC, and all modifications are being implemented in accordance with AFI 63-101.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>The Air Force DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT) effort provides data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities for NGA reference imagery data.  This effort will transition AF DCGS reference imagery from the Direct Feed Image Product Library (DFIPL) to a centralized storage solution and distribute imagery across the DCGS Enterprise through a cloud architecture consisting of multiple data hubs, known as Data Storage and Dissemination (DSDs). This effort will also deliver new, and resize the current, low side DSDs to deploy a high side DSD capability for the enterprise. Furthermore, this project will enhance the Peregrine network of AF DCGS to allow the cloud architecture throughout several sites within the weapon system.

Justification:
The AF DRT effort's main focus is the procurement and fielding of proven technologies to centralize the storage and dissemination of imagery for the AF DCGS weapon system. This effort is necessary to transfer the reference imagery data path from the current retiring data path to the long term ACC vision for the weapon system. This effort will enhance the network backbone for the weapon system as it moves toward a cloud architecture for the distribution of data. The foundation will be capable of being expanded upon to store and transport future data requirements.

Milestone/Development Status

AF DCGS is in the Operations and Sustainment phase of the acquisition lifecycle.  The weapon system has been declared FOC, and all modifications are being implemented in accordance with AFI 63-101.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Initial Spares consist of reparable components, assemblies, subassemblies, and consumable items required as initial stock (including readiness spares package requirements) in support of newly fielded vehicles, communications electronics and telecommunications equipment, and other base maintenance and support equipment items.  Requirements are determined by applying established factors against the acquisition cost of the end items.  The factors are based on historical data of similar equipment, employment/deployment concepts, production schedules, and other related information.
