            <proc:Description>Program Overview

The Department of Defense Dependents Education (DoDDE) programs are the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), the Family Advocacy/Assistance Program (FA/FAP), and the Relocation Assistance Programs (RAP).

DoDEA is the Presidential and National showcase for education excellence.  The DoDEA provides a world-class education program that inspires and prepares all students in military communities around the world to be successful and responsible citizens in a dynamic global environment.  Courses of study in DoDEA schools are often more rigorous than those found in public schools in the United States.  The DoDEA schools’ diverse curriculum offerings fully support the DoDEA Community Strategic Plan.  DoDEA schools are an important quality of life issue for military families and impacts the level of military retention.  The DoDEA is a DoD field activity operating under the direction, authority and control of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (P&amp;R) and Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Military Community and Family Policy (MC&amp;FP).  The DoDEA is comprised of the Management Headquarters, the Consolidated School Support, the Educational Partnership Program, (EPP), the Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS), and the DoD Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS).
