                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Through the Theater Enterprise Deployment and Distribution (TED2) analysis, the Geographic Combatant Commanders (GCC) identified several gaps between United States Transportation Command's strategic lift processes and GCCs' distribution processes.  Highlighted is a lack of capability to (1) manage transportation planning and execution processes for cargo/passenger movement within their respective theaters of operation or (2) match global movement requirements against available lift assets to produce an optimized transportation schedule that meets delivery requirements.  AT21 Theater Capability, through the implementation of process improvements, integration of commercial transportation management/optimization tools, and the development of deployment/distribution supporting technologies, will provide the capability for Combatant Commanders to manage theater transportation operations from the port of debarkation to the point of need.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program supports the development of a responsive, world-class manufacturing capability to affordably meet the warfighters’ needs throughout the defense system life cycle.  IP ManTech: Provides the crucial link between invention and product application to speed technology transitions.  The program matures and validates emerging manufacturing technologies to support low-risk implementation in industry and Department of Defense (DoD) facilities, e.g. depots and shipyards.  It addresses production issues early by providing timely solutions, thereby reducing risk and positively impacting system life cycle affordability by providing solutions to manufacturing problems before they occur.  

Beginning in FY 16 DLA ManTech was realigned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial base Manufacturing Processes; 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply; and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information.  
•	The Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products. This SFA subsumed the former supply chain oriented efforts in  Subsistence Network (formerly Combat Rations Network for Technology Implementation), Procurement Readiness Optimization—Advanced Casting Technology (PRO-ACT), Procurement Readiness Optimization—Forging Advance System Technology (PRO-FAST), and Battery Network (BATTNET). New manufacturing processes within the scope of this SFA include emerging technologies such as Additive Manufacturing.  
•	Maintaining Viable Supply Sources includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements. This SFA subsumed the Material Acquisition Electronics ManTech efforts.  In the future it will include other DLA efforts to maintain a viable industrial capability in areas such as Strategic Materials. 
•	The Improving Technical and Logistics Information SFA include efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA industry partners and customers. It includes the MANTECH program Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) (formerly Customer Driven Uniform Manufacturing) and the Defense Logistics Information Research Program from P.E. 0603712S.  A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging “Model Based Enterprise” paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected.    

Over the FY 17- FY 21 Planning Period, $9.606M per year was realigned within the ManTech PE, from the DLA Log R&amp;D PE (0603712S) and DLA Procurement Defense-Wide Fund.  These funds will address critical shortfalls in the Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes and Maintaining Viable Supply Sources.  The largest requirement was in the Maintaining Viable Supply Sources to develop a long-term, reliable source of linear microcircuits.  These devices are critical to maintaining the readiness of front line weapon system electronics.  High priority requirements in the Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA included additional funding for battery technology, castings and forging manufacturing technology.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Material Availability (MA) Strategic Focus Area (SFA) are R&amp;D efforts undertaken with DLA’s industrial base to reduce material costs, reduce the length and variability of Production Lead-Times, assure the DLA managed products meet requirements, and continuously improve quality and reliability. Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable Customer Wait Times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs.  This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Combat Rations Program, the Battery Program, the Castings and the Forgings programs.  

This SFA is comprised of five roadmaps for Batteries, Subsistence Network, Castings, Forgings, and Additive Manufacturing.  

The Battery network objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. The network conducts R&amp;D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher MRLs for specific groups of batteries. For FY2014, DLA received 139,163 orders for 2.85 million batteries at $183M net value - compared to FY13 $176M and FY12 $216M. The Battery network focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of batteries. Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&amp;D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.

The 'Subsistence Supply Chain' which consists of the supply chain for military subsistence including combat rations, field feeding equipment, garrison feeding and 'market fresh.'  The Subsistence Network (SUBNET) Program is a Manufacturing Technology Program and is the successor to the CORANET R&amp;D program. SUBNET will form a community of practice to research and promote manufacturing improvements in the Subsistence Supply Chain with the goals of maximizing capability and capacity to produce, and to encourage innovation and modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies.

The Castings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the metalcasting industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain castings. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the metalcasting supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DOD weapon systems.

The Forgings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the forging industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain forgings.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the forging industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the forging supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DOD weapon systems.

The Additive Manufacturing (AM) objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits.  DLA needs to exploit AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

DLA will work STPs with the community of practice partners of the military services, industry and academia.  SUBNET plans to improve process capabilities by identifying targets for product, automation and business operation changes, and implementing solutions in the Subsistence Supply Chain to produce such improvements as shorter lead times, higher throughput, reduced inventory and overhead cost, and improved quality. The STPs are required to have a business case, developed in advance to include specific metrics for success as well as return on investment where applicable to ensure that all SUBNET STPs are fully documented, all projects have the potential for implementation in industry; and all projects address a specific DoD/DLA need.  

The Castings program will receive a significant increase in funding starting in FY17 to cover most of the unfunded requirements identified during the PBR 17 process. Projects identified will investigate, develop and deploy innovative enterprise and technical solutions to improve casting supply chains for the Department of Defense and the Defense Logistics Agency to support the warfighter.  Contracts will be competitively awarded in FY17.  Proposals are required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success.

The Forging program will receive an increase in funding to cover most of the unfunded requirements identified during the PBR17 process.  Proposals are required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success. The Forging consortium will also pursue additional forging manufacturing advances from successful DLA SBIR projects selected in FY2014.

The Battery Network funding will be applied to pursue additional projects including production readiness of lithium conformable soldier batteries, military ground vehicle batteries, and aviation batteries; manufacturing transition of legacy and obsolete lead acid and nickel cadmium batteries to advanced lithium-ion batteries; and battery manufacturing automation and optimization technologies. These projects will address pressing supply chain issues by migrating from declining manufacturing to a high growth industrial base, and will achieve cost reduction by optimizing the manufacturing design, assembly, and test processes.

The Additive Manufacturing plan is for DLA to partner with the Military Services to use AM to produce parts. DLA and the Services will identify candidate parts, convert technical data to 3D format to facilitate AM, procure the parts, and document the process for AM benefits. The Services will review newly created technical data packages (TDP), test the parts, and qualify AM as an acceptable process to produce the parts.

FY 16 – FY 20: Funding for Additive projects will be reallocated from other MA SFA thrusts and classified into the Additive Manufacturing Thrust.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Subsistence Network acquisition strategy is delivery orders against competitively awarded IDIQ R&amp;D contracts via the forthcoming BAA.  The current contracts will reach the end of their base period of performance by December 2016.  A new BAA has been drafted and will be released in January 2016 with award of contracts in FY16 and FY17. A Joint Steering Group made up of government representatives from the Military Services, DLA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Public Health Center, and the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center will review ongoing projects, identify new areas for investment, assess proposed projects, examine procedures and processes, keep abreast of new technologies, and understand DLA and DoD subsistence needs and requirements.

The Castings involved a competitive Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Evaluations were completed and two contracts were awarded competitively September 2011.  The current contracts reached the end of their base period of performance on September 30, 2016.  A new BAA has been drafted and will be released in FY16 with award of contracts(s) in FY17.

The Battery Network plan is to establish contract partners through a competitive Broad Area Announcement (BAA) based upon proposals that demonstrated knowledge, experience, and expertise in the following areas of interest: Automation, Diminishing Manufacturing &amp; Supply, Battery Safety, Reducing Acquisition Costs, Shelf Life, Supply Chain Logistics, Surge/Sustainment, and Technology Transition/Insertion. A Government Steering Group (GSG) of power source technical experts from the military services R&amp;D groups will inform general R&amp;D requirements for supply chain and technology improvement. The plan also includes awarding Phase 2 and 3 projects from DLA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) in advanced battery manufacturing technology. 

The Acq. Strategy for Forgings involved a competitive Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Evaluations were completed and a contract awarded September 2014.  

The Additive Manufacturing plan will partner with the Military Services and use organic and commercial AM parts production capabilities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The Battery Network plan is to report returns on investments and achievements to the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) for evaluation. 

The Subsistence  Network plan is to execute reductions in cost for shipping, storage, supply chain process, inventory, waste and inspections, as well as reduced lead times for combat ration production, field feeding equipment, garrison feeding and “market fresh."

For example, SUBNET will provide the following technical achievements: 1) a microwave-assisted capability to sterilize group-sized entrees and components, packaged in Institutional Sized Pouches (ISP) and Polymeric Trays and 2) identify and produce at least one or more alternate sealant layers that can be used by the rations industry to pack high acidic food products and to ensure uninterrupted supply of MRE rations. 

The Castings consortium plan is to report returns on investments and achievements to the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) for evaluation. 

The Forgings consortium plan is to report returns on investments and achievements to the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) for evaluation.  

The Additive Manufacturing metric is the number of parts qualified for AM and the lead-time savings achieved to make small quantities of items.  

At least 30% of the completed projects will transition.   

OSD-C financial metrics (obligation and disbursement) will be achieved.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The High Quality Sources SFA are projects undertaken to assure that the industrial base can respond to DLA requirements and DLA can fill military customers’ material requirements reliably and consistently.  Benefits include eliminating cancelled requisitions returned to customers as “non-procurable.” This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Material Acquisition Electronics program.  

The Material Acquisition Electronics roadmap has four major thrusts in Digital Microcircuits: Advanced Schottky TTL, TTL Compatible CMOS, 512 Kilobit RAM/ROM and Mega Gate ASIC.  The Roadmap also includes a new major thrust area: Linear Microcircuits.  Over the past several years, obsolescence in this class of microcircuits has greatly increased and has become a significant concern.  These are classes of microcircuits that are expected to become non-procurable in FY 17 and beyond.  Without the technologies planned on the MAE Roadmap, DLA will not be able to support DoD’s requirements for high quality spare parts for critical electronic systems and subsystems.  

The Strategic Materials roadmap is a new thrust for the DLA Mantech program.  It is designed to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently process or recover strategic materials. Domestic capabilities can enhance national security and potentially reduce Defense Stockpile requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

MAE will begin a major new thrust in emulation to address Linear Microcircuits in addition to its traditional focus on Digital.  Several efforts will address basic design, manufacturing, electrical test and quality/reliability requirements for establishing a basis for product-oriented developments across the FYDP. MAE will also complete development and transition Advanced Schottky TTL Digital Microcircuit Emulation capability into full-scale production increasing DLA’s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs.  The newly transitioned emulation capabilities will address several discontinued device families and will increase the potential emulation production envelope by several hundred NSNs.  MAE will also continue development of additional emulation capabilities including TTL-Compatible CMOS. MAE will also initiate several new implementations including development of a 1 million gate Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and 512K Read-Only and Random-Access Memory Emulation Capabilities. It will complete prototyping 350 nanometer emulation circuitry, bringing emulation capability that re-establishes sources for additional NSNs.

Strategic Materials: A request for white paper proposals was recently added to DLA’s Emerging R&amp;D Requirements BAA for critical initial manufacturing technology requirements in domestic high strength carbon fibers.  Additional targeted requirements will be determined with DLA Strategic Materials.  Targeted requests for proposals will be conducted to address specific needs and opportunities to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently produce strategic materials. Manufacturing technologies and capabilities are expected to transition to Title III or specific Weapon System Program funds for industrial base qualification.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Transition of one technology implementation (base array) to low-rate initial production or full-scale production.  Each technology implementation increases the breadth of microcircuit part types which can be returned to a procurable status; improving readiness and avoiding the need to redesign at the next-higher level.  Potential benefit to hundreds of weapon systems.

Strategic Materials: Develop roadmap and transition targeted manufacturing technologies.  

At least 30% of the completed projects will transition.   

OSD-C financial metrics (obligation and disbursement) will be achieved.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Improving Technical and Logistics Information Strategic Focus Area (SFA) projects improve and facilitate the communication of technical and logistics information among industry, DLA’s military customers and DLA. This SFA includes Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) and the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) (P.E. 0603712S) within its scope. The movement of the DLIR related work from P.E. 0603712S to the DOD ManTech Program aligns the funding to the critical interface between DLA and industry and away from internal DLA operations.

The MUST focus addresses GAO Report 12-707 recommendations that DOD to establish a “knowledge-based approach” to collaborate on define and communicate of military unique requirements. DLA has the responsibility to communicate and manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time between Individual Item and Equipment (IIE) development and sustainment from years to months. The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military IIE supply chain from an “electronic paper” (i.e. PDF/MS Word) based, manual environment into a knowledge based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end to end supply chain.

The DLIR Model Based Enterprise effort will develop capabilities to systematically accept engineering and design data from the Military Services, validate and store item technical data in 3D models. There are two classes of data that must be addressed: newly designed parts for systems still in development and legacy parts for systems that are in sustainment. The problem with newly designed parts is capturing the complete and accurate designs. The legacy parts do not have digital engineering models which recreating the design in contemporary engineering systems.   

The Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability will pioneer methods to capture data from military Services, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and suppliers to form a seamless thread of interoperable and linked data models.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency is responsible for providing to the Military Services, and other Federal Agencies, as well as combined and allied forces the full spectrum of logistics, acquisition and technical services. DLA sources and provides nearly 100 percent of the consumable items the military forces need to operate – including food, fuel and energy, uniforms, medical supplies as well as construction and barrier equipment. DLA supplies more than 85 percent of the military’s spare parts, provides logistics information data and products, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and offers document automation and production services. DLAs Research and Development (R&amp;D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are available in order to accomplish the agency’s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure, using the best commercial and government sources and applying most effective business processes. The Logistics R&amp;D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at lower costs than would be otherwise attainable. The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits. 

In December 2013, the DLA Director called for greater flexibility within the R&amp;D program in support of the agency’s efforts to achieve its mission. As a result, the R&amp;D program is evolving from single supply chain efforts to Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs). The SFAs will support DLA’s efforts to make the improvements needed to maintain mission readiness rates in a constrained budget environment. 

The three Strategic Focus Areas were renamed in FY 17-FY 21 to more clearly capture their focus and scope:  

1. Enhancing Analysis, Modeling, and Decision Support (formerly Analytic and Decision Support): R&amp;D efforts to develop decision support tools, such as modeling, simulation, and other analytics to improve operational strategy decision-making, forecasting, and procurement, which support more effective and efficient responses to emerging market and customer requirements.
2. Improving Logistics Processes (formerly Logistics Processes): R&amp;D efforts to develop and implement advanced technology in logistics processes over and above current baseline systems.
3. Emergent Logistics R&amp;D Requirements (formerly Innovative Products and Services for Customers): R&amp;D Efforts to support emergent Logistics R&amp;D requirements that arise out of the budget cycle. These out of cycle requirements always occur.  The SFA begins new projects in a timely manner without disrupting ongoing projects by funds reallocation.  This SFA includes all DLA supply chains and logistics processes.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>During FY 2017 – FY 2021  funds were realigned from PE LOG R&amp;D (0603712S) to the Industrial Preparedness – Manufacturing Technology Program (PE 0708011S). This realignment was needed to accommodate high priority requirements within DLA to improve the industrial base that supports critical weapon systems. In FY17, $4.646M was realigned from LOG R&amp;D to MANTECH for these high priority requirements. 

The consequences to the realignment include: The Medical On-Demand Business Analytics (ODBA) capability will be delayed depriving DLA end-users the ability to easily access and navigate the data from a single interface without requiring the knowledge of database access language (SQL). The Supply Chain management project reductions means additional anti-counterfeiting technology will not be fully developed and implemented, increasing the risk that counterfeit parts will enter the DOD supply system. Reductions to the Energy readiness program mean cost increases to the Services for fuel because fewer alternative fuel additives will be available. Modeling and Simulation tools will not be available for DLA to optimize operations and logistics processes.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

The Medical Logistics Network (MLN)  program supports the Medical Directorate’s mission to develop and implement the critical logistics and medical supply chain business practices that ensure the cost-effective and efficient distribution of medical materiel to the full range of Military Health System operations.

The Medical Logistics Network (MLN) program anticipates future medical logistical requirements and develops strategies and tools to meet these requirements.  Operating in the unique DoD-Commercial medical logistics environment, the Medical Logistics Network program develops processes for management of DoD Medical Logistics to ensure effective and safe medical supplies support the warfighter. These business process improvements may have potential extensions to other supply chains.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

MLN Success: The Trade Agreement Act (TAA) requires the Government to acquire end-products which are Manufactured or Substantially Transformed in either the U.S. or a Qualifying or Designated Country, unless there are no offers of such end-products or the offers of such end- products are insufficient to fulfill the Government’s requirements. In FY2015 MLN undertook the development of an improved and comprehensive web based custom software solution to automate and support the TAA Compliance Management business function of Customer Pharmacy Operations Center (CPOC) team.</r2:Text>

On-Demand Business Analytics (ODBA), in year 3 of 3, is planned to transition in FY2016. 

Additionally, the Medical Object Oriented Data Sustainment (MOODS) Project will be initiated in FY2016. MOODS will improve processes and tools to sustain Joint Task-Time-Treater (JTTF) data which will be used by military services to create medical supply forecasts that are based on expected patient treatments. The JTTF helps to define supplies and equipment to treat a population at risk in terms of specific medical conditions.  The current processes to sustain JTTF are extremely complex, improvement will help to optimize the standard of care that Warfighters receive.</r2:Text>

Support Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Strategic Plans Goals 1.)  Warfighter Support) and 2.)  Stewardship Excellence.  The program spans multiple weapon systems and supply chains to improve internal processes, provide new methods, reduce costs and lead times, and ultimately, improve readiness for DLA customers.  

The program is focused in three initiatives:
1.)  Planning Process Improvement:  The program improves elements of current inventory policy models, assesses potential benefits of new technologies and seeks more efficient approaches to deliver customer requirements while reducing inventory and order fulfillment costs.  

2.)  Technical/Quality Process Improvement:  The program improves internal efficiency and customer satisfaction through new tools and methods to proactively address supply issues resulting from current technical/quality processes.  

3.)  Procurement Process Improvement:  The program will demonstrate tailored data collection and business processes for well-defined subsets of suppliers and procurement types to improve supplier responsiveness, cycle time and cost.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Substantial cost reductions and improved performance are being realized.  Transition to other Aviation weapon systems is on hold until DLA J6 resources are available to move forward with the implementation of the SIO automated workflow. The FINISIM, Returns and Peak/Next Gen enhancements projects were completed and transition efforts started by J343.  Peak/Next Gen is being used to set inventory levels for more than 500,000  items, and continues to allow PLFAs to meet stringent Material Availability goals.  A project was initiated to improve the accuracy of PLT estimates which will improve support to warfighters and reduce overstocking. A project was initiated to pilot the use of Vendor Owned Inventory, a commercial practice known to reduce costs through more effective inventory management. A new project will develop techniques to link parts in indentured bills of materials to Service maintenance and parts usage data, and use modeling and simulation to provide a better estimate of demand for those parts.  A Weapon System Demand Mapping project was established to link sales, orders and requisition information to the weapon system the ordered items are used on, which will enable improved collaboration among DLA, its suppliers and its customers. Collaborative efforts were continued with the Planning team to develop new projects for FY 2016 awards. 

Technical/Quality Process Improvements: Three new projects were started in FY 2015. Technical Data Availability will initiate an  attack on the problem of lengthy delays in determining if technical data is current by assessing Services’ systems for configuration          management could be automatically accessed by EBS or some other method. As part of DLA’s initiative in Additive Manufacturing
(AM), a project was awarded to take parts from identification of applicability through final approval by the appropriate Service, which will clarify the issues associated with obtaining Service approvals and identify some approaches to resolving those issues. The Cost of Quality in Procurement project will identify and document the specific contractor/bidder characteristics that distinguish the need for oversight, the appropriate oversight actions, and the associated cost of performing the actions. Collaborative efforts were continued with the Technical/Quality team to develop new projects for FY 2016 awards.

Procurement Process Improvements: The Performance-Based Logistics (PBL) Process Improvement project provided recommendations to DLA senior leadership for how to improve DLA’s use of PBL in its operations. A project was initiated to determine the issues and potential benefits of moving PBL storage and distribution functions from commercial sites to DLA Distribution Centers. A project was awarded to develop improvements to the automated bid evaluation process to reduce the number of manual reviews in order to reduce cost of DLA’s operations and reduce the time to award purchase orders.  Collaborative efforts were continued with the Procurement Process Owner and his team to develop new projects for FY 2016 awards.</r2:Text>

This change will better align the technical work with the OSD Manufacturing Technology Program initiative for the Model Based Enterprise (MBE). The MBE will help DOD move to a completely digital environment for design and engineering data needed to conceive, design, build and support weapon systems.

The Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) program objective is to research, identify, and implement potential or existing technologies using high-risk, high payoff tools, methods, techniques, and products. The DLIR program partners with commercial industry to perform short-term projects (STPs) in various logistics business areas which align with the DLA strategic vision. DLIR improves functional and business processes using the latest technologies available to support the nation’s warfighter. The technical areas of interest is the development of Logistics Data Interoperability &amp; Availability. Enhances the functionality and compatibility of data in a complex data environment using supply chain relationships and lifecycle management to allow flexible visibility.

DLIR is working several short term projects in the area of interest. These efforts are positioning DLA to move towards a model-based enterprise (MBE), using and acquiring 3-Dimensional model-based data instead of 2-Dimensional hardcopy for weapon system sustainment and support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These tools will improve DLA forecasting and procurement strategy decisions and lead to faster and more flexible response to emerging market and customer requirements. Currently there are three major analytical thrusts: Planning Processes, Medical Supply Chain, and Distribution/Disposition.  Planning processes model and simulate item and customer demand patterns to improve customer support, lower inventories, acquisition costs, and acquisition lead-times for hardware (Class IX items).  Medical Supply Chain Modeling will provide DLA the capability to integrate DLA logistics data and commercial data with satellite and political maps; it will automate for DLA Medical planners the ability to identify entities such as suppliers, customers and vendor distribution centers to enhance spatial awareness of incidents such as catastrophic events and military contingencies.  The Distribution/Disposition thrust will develop and implement analytical tools, models, and simulations of logistics and supply chain processes related to distribution and disposition.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Logistics Processes are R&amp;D efforts undertaken to develop and implement advanced technology in the internal DLA logistics processes. To qualify for R&amp;D funding, the R&amp;D effort must develop and apply technology and processes over and above current baseline IT systems and continuous improvements efforts. 
This strategic focus area has 4 thrusts: Technical/Quality Process Improvements, Selected Process Improvements, Medical Processes, and Distribution/Disposition Processes.  

T/Q process improvements to reduce material and internal costs and improve support to warfighters.  Services have engineering responsibility for most Class IX parts. Many T/Q sub-processes involve interactions with Service engineering functions, which often are time-consuming and costly.  Other key T/Q sub-processes are essential to the procurement function, such as analysis of parts content, source capabilities and problem resolution.

Selected process improvements cover processes outside the scope of the Technical/Quality (T/Q) function. Although all DLA processes are in scope, the focus for FY 2016 is on the Procurement process, especially aspects driving internal costs and delays in awards.

Medical Processes will expand work in critical mechanisms to guarantee product quality of temperature-sensitive medical materiel distributed to our customers, and identify the most efficient and cost-effective means to deliver those medical products in accordance with FDA-labeled and other regulatory requirements.  

Distribution and Disposition logistics processes deal with improving distribution and disposition capabilities, operational effectiveness, and efficiency. While numerous technologies and applications have been developed and exploited, DLA has not kept pace with the commercial industry in regards to modernizing its technology systems infrastructure, processes, or mobilizing information for personnel, customers, and processes.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In addition, a new effort will begin in expanding DNA Marking and developing methods to guard against malicious code entering the supply system through acquired items.  

Selected Process initiatives for FY 16 in the T/Q area include Cost of Quality in Procurement, Technical Data Availability, processes for Service approval of substituting Additive Manufacturing for selected parts, develop and demonstrate and approach to making information systems containing data on chemical content of parts interoperable to aid in identifying material risk, and creation of a decision support tool to identify problematic parts procurement much earlier.Initiatives in the Procurement area include Reducing Manual Reviews to cut cost and time, Proactive No-Bid Modeling to reduce time to award and improve support to warfighters, and eCommerce to cut internal and parts costs and reduce Production Lead Time.

Medical Processes will continue to execute projects that support Advancing Cold Chain Management (ACCM).
 
The Distribution and Disposition initiative will leverage emerging distribution and disposal technologies and state of the art reverse logistics. One promising new project is the DLA Disposition Customer Kiosk. The project will explore the feasibility of using self-service unmanned kiosk type collection points to improve efficiency, and eliminate and/or reduce appointment wait times for customers that use this new service, thereby creating just-in-time disposition services.</r2:Text>

Saving the lead-time allows the Agency to begin to realize the benefits of implementing new technology sooner than would otherwise be the case and maintain continuity of funding and activity for baseline programs. 

Energy Readiness will focus on providing additional alternatives for military unique fuels, working with the Service customers to improve specifications and standards for fuel quality, engage in modeling and simulation of the energy supply chain and identifying alternative energy sources for Military Customers.</r2:Text>

Additional targeted requirements will be determined with DLA Strategic Materials. Targeted requests for proposals will be conducted to address specific needs and opportunities to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently produce strategic materials. Manufacturing technologies and capabilities are expected to transition to Title III or specific Weapon System Program funds for industrial base qualification. Funding will be reallocated based on project requirements and reclassified into the Strategic Material Thrust.

Energy Readiness will continue to focus on providing additional alternatives for military unique fuels, working with the Service customers to improve specifications and standards for fuel quality, engage in modeling and simulation of the energy supply chain and identifying alternative energy sources for Military Customers.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>USTRANSCOM is tasked to provide globally integrated, agile deployment and distribution solutions as well as related enabling capabilities to support national security, force readiness and sustainability within an increasingly constrained defense budget. Unpredictable/extended global distribution routes, limited visibility of sustainment requirements, force packaging limitations, lift constraints, anti-access/area denial concerns, complex supply chains, as well as non-networked battlefield command and control, planning, and decision support tools impede timely customer logistical support.  To project unimpeded global power and influence, USTRANSCOM must have access to relevant, real-time information, invest in enabling capabilities that contribute to mission success, ensure the viability of our capabilities, and implement a relevant transportation strategy.  Effective knowledge sharing, decision support and transparency across the joint logistics enterprise, facilitated by secure enterprise-wide visibility into logistical processes as well as the ability to effectively collaborate/operate in a contested cyberspace, is required to promote the effective/efficient/responsive global management of force projection and sustainment resources.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This requires investigation into next generation Automated Information Technology (AIT)/Total Asset Visibility (TAV) technologies and/or container security to improve end-to-end distribution visibility, enhance planning/execution, and transform sustainment operations.  Includes the ability to determine immediate, reliable, and accurate shipment status through system access or event management.  Develop an over-arching process/system architecture which will integrate existing and innovative new programs across the supply chain to provide complete In Transit Visibility (ITV) data, to include visibility of non-DoD cargo during humanitarian/disaster relief operations. The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Additionally need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DoD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by the disparity of systems, differing data standards, and insufficient interfaces.  Queries and retrieval of status and shipment information cannot be executed due to lack of connectivity between the various components of the supply chain.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct "what -if" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset’s course, speed or departure/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.  The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Also need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DOD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Projects in this area address the following: decision support tools, distribution process simulations/analytics, distribution demand forecasting/execution monitoring, training, automated decision-maker support (e.g., queuing, alerting, courses of action), automated status monitoring with information fusion to include drilldown capability, and resilient C2 infrastructure capabilities. Current planning/forecasting/collaboration capabilities do not permit full synchronization of people, processes and assets to execute planned operations. Automated tools must be able to dynamically analyze/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems to include the capability for Combatant Commanders to manage theater transportation operations from the port of debarkation to the point of need. Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by disparate systems, multiple data standards and insufficient interfaces. The ability to rapidly determine the impact of any delays/changes and conduct "what -if" impact assessments on the closure of force packages is required. This project addresses the required mission support to combatant commanders and other customers in the area of C2, Optimization, and Modeling and Simulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department has found it critical to National Security to maintain an ability to produce legacy microelectronics long after they are available from commercial foundries which move to more advanced technology levels based upon the global market. The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) uniquely accomplishes this mission for the Department by providing both a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics parts that are no longer available from, or bid by, commercial sources but are essential to combat operations. This is a critical capability in an atmosphere of diminishing domestic semiconductor manufacturing capability and increasing worldwide supply chain risks with threats to defense microelectronics. The threats include risks that include counterfeiting, Trojan horses, specific reliability issues in military environments and rapid obsolescence coming from an unpredictable and unsecured supply chain. As fiscal pressures force the Department to maintain its weapon systems longer than originally planned and their extended combat use increases attrition, the need for DMEA’s unique capabilities increases.

Microelectronics is a crucial technology and central for all operations within the Department. Yet, as vital as this technology is to Department operations, the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market. The Department frequently requires legacy microelectronics long after commercial foundries have moved on to advanced technology levels. As such, the semiconductor industry does not respond to the Department’s particular needs of ultra-low volumes, long availability time frames, or its high-level security concerns. To meet these requirements, DMEA procures commercial licenses to organically produce semiconductor technologies that are no longer commercially manufactured or are unavailable due to no-bids owing to low volume requirements. These licenses enable DMEA to be the Department’s microelectronics supplier of last resort, providing the Department with a long-term, trusted, and assured source.

DMEA provides increasingly rare microelectronics design and fabrication expertise to ensure that the Department can field systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides decisive, quick turn solutions for defense, intelligence, special operations, cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market. DMEA’s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions—along with its unique technical perspective—allows it to develop, manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability. DMEA then uses these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele. After many years of performing analogous efforts, the technical experience, mission knowledge, and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key tool in the intelligent and rapid development and application of advanced technologies to identified military needs.

Working alongside industry, DMEA has created a model partnership that provides this capability for the Department. DMEA’s uniquely flexible foundry supports the Department with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now assured to remain in one location for as long as they are needed. To obtain these processes, DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses. These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed intellectual property (IP) and the related processes for Department needs. These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry’s right to bid first on resulting production volumes. DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components. If industry cannot or will not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production order. A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners’ valuable IP and processes. DMEA is Government owned and operated, providing the structure and confidence necessary in an industry partner to ensure them that their IP is protected from potential competitors. This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring, installing, and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems, combat operations, and support needs. As such, DMEA serves the Department, other US Agencies, industry and Allied nations.

DMEA assists hundreds of Department programs every year. DMEA has provided its specialized engineering assistance and capabilities to older systems, current systems, and even to programs not yet in the production phase. This includes the F-18 Super Hornet, F-22 Raptor, F-35, RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-9 Reaper, AEGIS Advanced Surface Missile System, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), among many other programs. DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Ops, Cyber, Intelligence, and the Radiation-Hard communities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Technology Development funds provide DMEA with the core resources to execute its primary mission of providing an in-house ability to quickly develop and execute appropriate solutions to keep a weapon system operational, elevate its sophistication level or to meet new threats. These solutions use high mix, low volume, unique microelectronics that are endemic to military requirements but are not commercially available. These funds provide for the development and support necessary to ensure rapid prototyping, insertion, and support of microelectronics technologies into fielded systems, particularly as the technologies advance. DMEA maintains critical microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides an in-house capability to support these strategically important microelectronics technologies within the Department with distinctive resources to meet the Department’s requirements across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support. This includes producing components to meet the Department’s requirements for ultra-low volume, an extended availability timeframe, and a trusted, assured, and secure supply of microelectronics. These funds provide basic infrastructure upgrades as well as an in-house technical staff of skilled and experienced microelectronics personnel working in state-of-the-practice facilities providing technical and application engineering support for the implementation of advanced microelectronics research technologies from inspection and analysis through design, fabrication, test, assembly, integration and installation. These funds also provide for the recapitalization and modernization of aging microelectronic infrastructure, acquisition and implementation of design and test tools, the development of advanced techniques to inspect and analyze circuits, the adaptation of tools and processes to detect increasingly sophisticated counterfeit microelectronics in the defense supply chain, and the incorporation of the process technologies that are necessary to keep pace with the needs of the Department as weapon system support requirements migrate toward current state-of-the-art technologies. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key resource in the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements in response to the newest asymmetric threats and to modernize aging weapon systems. DMEA designs, develops, and supports vital classified assets for ongoing and time-sensitive specialized intelligence operations and missions of the Department and the Special Operations Commands.

Today’s weapon systems experience extended field operations and are required to remain in service beyond planned replacement schedules, driving the need for growth in DMEA’s unique capabilities. This need, along with the continual contraction of commercial resources, makes DMEA the only available resource allowing many systems to remain operational. As such, DMEA and its capability are considered a National Critical Asset.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department and the National Security Agency (NSA) require uninterruptible access to state-of-the-art design and manufacturing processes to produce custom integrated circuits designed specifically for military purposes. Under DODI 5200.44, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical/essential systems must be procured from Trusted sources in order to avoid tampered or sabotaged parts. Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities continues to greatly reduce the number of U.S. semiconductor fabrication facilities that might be Trusted sources. The prevalence of sophisticated offshore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies have resulted in the outsourcing of electronics component and integrated circuit services to these offshore facilities. This production capability is of increasing importance as domestic semiconductor manufacturing resources continue to decline, especially in the scarce domestic production capacity of high performance and state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies as illustrated by the recent acquisition of IBM’s semiconductor manufacturing capability by GlobalFoundries. This acquisition, caused by economic pressures, has again highlighted the fact that commercial sources of microelectronics remain inherently unpredictable and constitute a continued supply chain risk regardless of Government investment. This trend threatens the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic suppliers and reducing access to Trusted fabrication sources for advanced technologies. This trend is of acute concern to the defense and intelligence communities. Secure communications and cryptographic applications, among other areas of defense interest, depend heavily upon high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement can translate into a significant force multiplier and capability advantage. Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors.

The Trusted Microelectronics program provides the Department with access to the Trusted state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities necessary to meet their confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs. The program also provides the Services with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components. The Trusted Access Program Office has contracted with commercial sources to satisfy state-of-the-art semiconductor requirements. DMEA will focus on fostering all viable alternatives to continue the vital supply of Trusted and assured microelectronics, including the work of the DMEA Trusted Access Program Office with commercial state-of-the-art industry. It is imperative for a wide range of technologies in ongoing and future Department systems that access to Trusted suppliers continues. Most importantly, Trusted Microelectronics access is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs requiring state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The BEIS utilized the mature, existing infrastructure of Defense Corporate Database/Defense Corporate Warehouse (DCD/DCW), Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS), and Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) to provide timely, accurate, and reliable business information from across the DoD to support auditable financial statements as well as provide detailed information visibility for management in support of the Warfighter.  The goals of BEIS are to ensure data compliance with Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) standards; provide security-defined, enterprise-level access to information for ad hoc management queries; and produce external financial management reports/statements based on standardized data.  BEIS provides solutions to these goals by:
- Establishing the authoritative source for SFIS values and providing for standardization by implementing SFIS and United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) compliant financial reporting capabilities for Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports.
- Providing an enterprise-wide information environment that will serve as the single source for enterprise-wide financial information.
- Serving as the DoD-wide system for Treasury Reporting.
- Providing decision makers with significantly greater access to financial information through data visibility and business intelligence (e.g., Executive Dashboard).
The BEIS functional baseline encompasses a family of services organized into six distinct lines of business, four of which have achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC).  The remaining two services, Financial Reporting Services and Cash Accountability Reporting Services, will provide DoD enterprise-wide financial visibility and will serve as the centralized financial data source and the single source for enterprise Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports, as well as Treasury Reporting.  The BEIS financial management capabilities will be used by the Military Services, Defense Agencies, and the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller).  These modernization efforts will complete deployment/implementation of BEIS capabilities and will serve the Department Auditability goals and objectives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>BEIS leveraged existing infrastructure in DoD’s investment in DCD/DCW, DDRS, and DCAS. BEIS formally implemented a portfolio management approach to program management that helped to ensure a management strategy was in place to better reallocate assets within the portfolio. BEIS has and will continue to deliver needed capabilities more rapidly and efficiently using a Family of Systems (FoS) concept providing a functional baseline organized into six distinct lines of business: General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, Enterprise Level Business Intelligence Services, Cash Accountability and Reporting Services, and Financial Reporting Services. These services are provided by individual IT systems that collectively, make up the BEIS FoS. The BEIS FoS program is composed of four core systems; Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS), Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI), and Defense Corporate Database/Defense Corporate Warehouse (DCD/DCW). Capabilities are being developed incrementally with multiple releases per year to meet the Enterprise Transition Plan milestones provided to Congress. BEIS has achieved FOC for the following system components/services: DCD/DCW, to include General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, and Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI) and transitioned these to DFAS for operations and sustainment.   Based on the list of remaining requirements for BEIS DDRS Financial Reporting Services and BEIS DCAS Cash Accountability and Reporting Services an overall schedule including integrated activities as well as identified products and milestones has been developed. Contracts are competitively awarded to keep costs down. Intra-governmental services are being used where possible for infrastructure support by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Technical Services Organization and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Information Processing Center.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Information System for Security (DISS) is a family of systems solution that specifically addresses the security clearance and suitability determinations requirements of Section 3001 of Public Law 108-458, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) which requires 90% of all clearances – whether Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential – to be completed within 60 days, as well as supports Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) compliance across the DOD.  The DISS will electronically collect, review, and share relevant data, government-wide, as mandated by the IRPTA and, guided by relevant Executive Orders, Congress, and GAO recommendations, deliver and maintain an appropriately vetted world-class workforce.  

As a secure, end-to-end IT system, the DISS will be the authoritative source for the management, storage, and timely dissemination of and access to personnel security, HSPD-12, and suitability information and will accelerate the clearance process, reduce security clearance vulnerabilities, decrease back-end processing timelines, and support simultaneous information sharing within various DOD entities as well as among a number of authorized federal agencies.  

The DISS family of systems is comprised of two components: the Case Adjudication Tracking System (CATS) and the Joint Verification System (JVS).  Once fully deployed, the DISS family of systems will replace the Joint Personnel Adjudication System, which contains approximately six million active security clearance records and supports over 80,000 users.  The DISS has also been designated as the repository for adjudicative results for Suitability and HSPD-12 determinations by the 13 July 2011 USD(I) memo “Storage of Adjudicative Results in the Defense Information System for Security.”</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The DISS CATS has been designated as the DoD non-Intelligence Community IT system for case management and adjudications by the 10 April 2009 USD(I) memo “Designation of the DoD Case Management and Adjudication Systems.”  Currently, CATS processes over 500,000 cases annually; electronically producing favorable adjudicative decisions for approximately 24% of Secret level cases.

Further, the 3 May 2012 Deputy Secretary of Defense Memo “DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Consolidation” consolidated all DoD CAF into one consolidated DoD CAF responsible for personnel security adjudicative functions as well as favorable Suitability and HSPD-12 adjudications.  The DISS (CATS) is the DOD CAF’s designated IT case management system.

Achieving the above goals will significantly enhance the operational readiness of the national security community and the Federal government.  It will decrease the time required to get an individual through the investigation process.  It will strengthen and reinforce reciprocity throughout the federal community by eliminating redundant or incomplete investigations by standardizing adjudicative decisions and by making available to all agencies adjudicative determinations of the Federal government.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Defense Information System for Security (DISS) is being fielded as a Family of Systems (FoS) employing an evolutionary acquisition approach by fielding incremental capabilities.  On May 09, 2013, the DISS CATS received a Full Deployment (FD) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which acknowledged that CATS was operationally fielded at the five adjudication facilities and authorized the DISS PMO to enhance and field a consolidated CATS (CATS v4) and its associated portal in order to improve the lifecycle management of the CATS by consolidating the existing CATS applications into a consolidated CATS application that uses a single database.  The July 11, 2014 “DISS Acquisition Strategy Revision Acquisition Decision Memorandum” revised the DISS acquisition strategy to field the remaining JVS capability not contained in the CATS.  The  JVS Milestone B Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was signed in FY15 Q2 and this initiated the Engineering Development phase in which the program will refine system requirements, configure the software, build functionality, conduct developmental testing, and plan for operational testing.  These activities will continue until a Full Deployment Decision (FDD) is made in Q2 FY16.

The DISS PMO is responsible for program execution and will employ contract types as directed by the agency contracts policies in order to support the delivery and sustainment of the DISS Capabilities. DISS development contractors employ an agile development methodology to allow for a flexible approach that incorporates user requirements and feedback throughout the development lifecycle while meeting delivery requirements as prescribed by the associated development contract. The Agile development methodology allows for the fielding of incremental capabilities IAW the program’s acquisition approach.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Travel System (DTS) is a fully integrated, electronic, end-to-end financial management system that automates temporary duty travel for the Department of Defense (DoD). DTS meets unique DoD mission, security and financial system requirements within the guidelines of Federal and DoD travel policies and regulations. DTS automates travel authorizations, reservations and arrangements, voucher processing, payment, reconciliation, accountability and archiving. DTS employs Digital Signature and Login/Authentication which requires users to provide a signed response using a valid DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate to gain access to the DTS application. Travel documents created in DTS are digitally signed with the user’s PKI certificate to provide a means of identifying the signer, verifying the document’s integrity, and enforcing non-repudiation of the signature by the signer.

DTS is a Major Automated Information System (MAIS), Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1AC program. DTS delivers capability by evolutionary acquisition utilizing incremental development; recognizing up front the need for future capability improvements. DTS has a flexible design so that each increment builds upon its core functionality, dependent on available, mature technology providing increasing capabilities to travelers, travel administrators, and process owners. Full Operational Capability (FOC) was declared in March 2010. Future capability improvements will be implemented as P3I beginning FY 2011.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

-Simplified User Interface/Usability Enhancements
-Completed User functionality enhancements based upon user community requirements
-Addressed system changes if needed in support of DoD Audit Readiness objectives
-Integrated the existing Services' Defense Lodging Systems (DLS) with the DTS to allow display and booking of available, on-base military lodging at all installations, via travel industry standard formatted transactions used by DLS. DTS will also incorporate the Preferred Lodging initiative which will provide the capability to search, display, and book preferred lodging
-Implemented changes to Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) that will allow Air Force, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve personnel to travel on a DTS/DEAMS Line of Accounting (LOA) that includes the Reimbursable Funding Document Number. This process change will maximize automation and minimize manual tasks while achieving Financial Improvement  and Audit Readiness (FIAR) standards</r2:Text>

DRAS 2 will replace the current Defense Retiree and Annuitant Systems (DRAS) and selected manual processes with proven state of the market technology using Clinger-Cohen guidance for selection of the solution.  Rapid fielding techniques will be used to close business process gaps by delivering incremental capability that provides clear financial benefits.  This modernization will allow for the consolidation of disparate DRAS systems and processes, the reduction of system redundancies and inefficiencies, increased customer satisfaction and compliance to Department of Defense (DoD) and federally mandated Information Assurance (IA) requirements.  The DRAS2 modernization is in keeping with the DoD Strategic Management Plan for FY2014-2015 goals and the White House CIO Council 2.0 initiatives.  In FY2015, DRAS 2 has it's own PE 0605090S separate from the PE referenced in this submission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD) is a multi-service/multi-agency solution established as a key initiative to provide full visibility of funds distributed through echelon I and II for the Military Departments and at all levels for the Defense Agencies to improve and modernize the OUSD(C) funds distribution process.   Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place.  

Within the current DoD environment, progress has been made streamlining a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems.  Efforts continue to improve the visibility of funding information, eliminate manual efforts and  undue complexities to the management of budget authority, and to eliminate impediments in the flow of funding documents.  The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions.   This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous.  

The envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow.  Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data.  Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.

The operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment.  The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department’s budget focuses on institutionalizing and financing our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face in the years ahead, while at the same time mitigating risk and providing for contingency operations. It also includes a fundamental overhaul of the DoD’s approach to procurement, acquisition, and contracting. As such, the complex details of budgeting and tracking of funds become increasingly critical to senior leader decision making and to provide accountability to the taxpayer. Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.

Today, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) and the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) use various distinct automated systems (Comptroller Information System (CIS), Program Resource Collection Process (PRCP), Supplemental Resource Collection Process (SRCP), Budget Exhibits Generator and Standard Data Collection System (SDCS)) to formulate, justify, and execute DoD budgets. These six or more systems interact with at least several computer-based systems controlled by external organizations and agencies. These systems manage very similar financial information, yet each uses its own scheme for representing information. Much of the information managed by these systems is redundant. Cross-system data representations and redundancies make it difficult to exchange and to reconcile information. The capabilities provided by Comptroller systems, in some cases, fail to deliver services needed by its users, or fail to operate in ways that complement current and emerging business practices. They fail to give executives information in a comprehensible form, making it difficult to draw
conclusions. Data disparities and functional redundancy make these systems more costly to maintain than they need to be.

There is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements. The Comptroller’s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.

This initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administer and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C). Funded efforts will improve the timeliness of resource management reviews and decisions for senior leaders and Congress.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DAI mission is to deliver auditable Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliant business environments for Defense Agencies providing accurate, timely, authoritative financial data supporting the DoD goal of standardizing financial management practices improving financial decision support, and supporting audit readiness. Currently, Defense Agencies use more than 10 different non-compliant financial management systems supporting diverse operational functions and the warfighter in decision making and financial reporting. These disparate, non-integrated systems do not meet statutory requirements to produce timely, auditable reports.

The DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies’ financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of agencies and field activities across the DoD. DAI will support a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision making.  The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a “.mil” environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.

The DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), Release 12.2.3 (R12).  DAI implemented an Oracle Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards.  The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative source).

DAI supports the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Strategy 5, “Reform the business and support functions of the Defense enterprise”. DAI is also aligned to the  DOD Agency Strategic Fiscal Years 2015-2018, Goal 5: Reform and Reshape the Defense Institution, Key Strategic Initiative - Improving competitiveness through accountability and efficiency and SO 5.2: Improve financial processes, controls, and information via audit readiness. The objective of the DAI system is to achieve auditable, CFO Act compliant business environments for the Defense Agencies with accurate, timely, authoritative financial data.

The primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS)/Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements. Common business functions within budget execution include the Department’s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report; Procure to Pay (P2P); Acquire to Retire (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (Time and Labor reporting only); and Order to Cash.  Release (Rel) 1 provided an application upgrade to Oracle R12 along with (P2P) enhancements facilitating SFIS/SLOA compliance and automated Time and Labor absence management.  Rel 2 introduced Grants Financial Management accounting and the start of a phased implementation of Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) capabilities. Future capabilities will support Rel 3 Direct Treasury Disbursing and Budget Formulation as well as Rel 4 Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).


DAI is currently implemented at 18 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, (OUSD(C)) (Time and Labor only) and supporting over 24,922 users. The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system. Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, and initiate the annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16 (SSAE 16) assertion packages.

The benefits of DAI are:
•	Common business processes and Enterprise data standards (i.e., SFIS and SLOA);
•	Access to real-time financial data transactions;
•	Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;
•	Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities; and
•	Use of United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.


The DAI PMO completed the Oracle R12 application upgrade.  The DAI PMO also provides system integration services that include: acquisition/financial management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows (RICE-FW) objects; testing (cyber security/information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated enterprise resource planning system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support.  

DLA Information Operations provides the program executive officer, program manager and PMO staff.  The DAI PMO relies on DLA Acquisition for most contracting.  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs) provide application, development and test as well as Continuity of Operations (COOP) hosting, Technical Contracting Office for development task orders, and the Joint Interoperability Test Command for Interoperability testing.  While the DAI PMO serves as systems integrator, niche activities; i.e. P2P, development, are contracted.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The DAI PMO completed development of Rel 1 Oracle Release 12 Upgrade providing P2P enhancements.  Automated absence management was implemented in two follow-on smaller releases: Rel 1.1 for DoD Educational Activity, Defense Acquisition University and Defense Security Cooperation Agency; and Rel 1.2 for Defense Contract Management Agency and Defense Microelectronics Activity.  DAI PMO also procured new user licenses and technology software licenses. DAI was granted Authority to Operate (ATO) from the Designated Accrediting Authority (DAA). The PMO developed a Rel 2 Workforce Preparation Strategy; Rel 1 associated Analysis/ Planning and Reporting Strategy; and a study of hardware hosting options. A plan for a Test &amp; Development (T&amp;D) environment at DISA DECC Mechanicsburg, PA was initiated and later discarded as the center did not have capacity. The PMO conducted Rels 1 and 2 pre- deployment planning and Business Process Reengineering (BPR) with current and prospective agencies and completed Rels 1 and 2 Systems Engineering (SE) Technical Reviews including five Rel 1 simulation mocks with the agencies.  DAI PMO was awarded DAI Inc 2 Rel 1 Interim Joint Interoperability Certification, a Rel 1 limited fielding decision by Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) April 21, 2015 and an Acquisition Program Baseline on February 8, 2015.  DAI PMO migrated all existing users and their data to the DAI Increment 2 Rel 1 production baseline on May 4, 2015.  After Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) revised the DoD’s Federal Financial Management Requirements (FFMRs) in DFAS Blue Book (August 2014), DAI successfully completed an independent review of a regression test of a sample the revised basket of FFMRs (95% compliant).  Later, DAI PMO began an assessment against all 797 applicable Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) requirements (91% complete as of September 8, 2015).  DAI PMO successfully completed an independent Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM) Test of Design/Test of Effectiveness. The PMO deployed Rel 2 to existing users and to additional users within these agencies.  DCMA. DAU, DODEA and DMEA began using DAI for financial management. Also in FY15, Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) completed an operational assessment of with several using agencies.  JITC found that DAI is making satisfactory progress towards meeting Operational Effectiveness, Suitability, Interoperability, and Cybersecurity (OESIS).  For Usability, Training, Sustainment, and Auditability, users reported no major issues or discrepancies during the OA. Survey comments were generally favorable in the areas of system Usability, Training, Help Desk, Configuration Management, Audit Trails, and Business Process accomplishment. Users demonstrated interoperability through successful completion of all mission tasks in all Business Process areas. Reliability and Operational Availability metrics were favorable; however, the prevalent issue reported by users was excessive system response time.  PMO also conducted system tuning during Q1 to address this issue and reduced Rel 2 average response time from just over 5 seconds to 2.04 seconds as of December 3, 2015.</r2:Text>

NR-KPP Att B - Managed in the Network	
1) Type of Networks that are connected: 
- The DAI application supports multiple Defense Agencies, and thus is accessible from multiple network points. A typical user accesses the application via the web browser from his/her agency specific LAN/WAN and/or local site firewall configurations, traversing through the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Routing Network (NIPRNet) to reach the secure DAI application hosted within the DoD Demilitarized  Zone (DMZ) which is controlled and managed by DISA.
- The DAI production application is hosted in a DISA DECC environment located in Ogden, UT and is managed by DAI Program Management Office


2) Measures of Performance (MOPs) to measure network entrance and management performance:
a) Network related (DISA) – as per DISA Catalog of Services 
-Interactive Availability - Portion of network/system controlled by DISA CSD available to the partner during the interactive window
-Batch Throughput – Completion rate and delivery by specified time during batch window specified in SLA
b) Database related (DAI Program Management Office)
-System Availability 
-On Line user system response


3) Network Management:
-The Agency (user) being supported is responsible for the communications infrastructure necessary for leaving their location to connect users to the NIPRNet 
-DISA is responsible for communications on NIPRNet between the end user and the main DAI environment
-DAI Program Management Office is responsible for activities occurring within the application and the Oracle Database

4) Systems Management 
-NIPRNet and Infrastructure  - Centralized within DISA CSD 
-DAI System – centralized within DAI Program Management Office


5) Network Configuration Parameters – N/A (within the realm of DISA management) DAI will measure the percentage of success for:
*   Supports secure Internet/NIPRNET access to solution. Interactive Availability. Objective-98.5%;
*   Supports secure Internet/NIPRNET access to solution.  Batch Throughput. Objective-95%;
*   Provides adequate system response and availability to support operations.	System Availability.  (Condition: 5000 users/hour)  Objective-95%; and
*   Provides adequate system response and availability to support operations. On-line system response. (Condition: 5000 users/hour) Objective-95%.

NR-KPP Att C - Effectively Exchange Information.  
DAI will satisfy all top-level critical Information Exchange Requirements (IERs) with all required DoD Enterprise, DFAS, Defense Agencies, and Federal Systems, as documented in SV-6.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA's) ability to deliver Americans the right logistics solution in every transaction requires more than successful management of the Department's wholesale supplies and suppliers.  It requires supply chain excellence.  Our military's ability to generate and sustain combat readiness indefinitely, anywhere on the globe requires that DLA-managed materiel flow seamlessly and as needed from the nation's industrial base to where it is ultimately used.

DLA's Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program seeks to solicit high-risk research and development proposals from the small business community.  All selections shall demonstrate and involve a high degree of technical risk with yet to be determined technical feasibility.  Phase I proposals should demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology and the merit of a Phase II for a prototype or at least a proof-of-concept demonstration.  Future market possibilities and demonstrated commercialization potential have a strong influence on Phase II selections.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project explores innovative concepts pursuant to Public Law 106-554 (Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000) and Public Law 107-50 (Small Business Technology Transfer Program Reauthorization Act of 2001), which mandates a two-phase competition for small businesses with innovative technologies with a defense application as well as a commercial value.  The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technologies for possible future Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) needs.  Dual-use means the technologies will be judged on their potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new DLA technologies, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products.  DLA will conduct the competition as well as award and manage the contracts.

The Defense Logistics Agency`s SBIR/STTR investments are divided into multiple Research Areas identified from within several DLA Elements:

J3 R&amp;D
- Advanced Battery Manufacturing (BATTNET): Manufacturing Improvements for DLA Lithium Batteries
- Advanced Castings and Forgings (PRO-Fast):

2.  Commercialization:  The Congressional language defines “Commercialization,” which is clarified by the Office of Secretary of Defense Office of Small Business Programs (OSD/OSBP) Re-Authorization Policy Directive:
- (Investment) The process of developing products, processes, technologies, or services; and/or 
- (Sales) The production and delivery (whether by the originating party or by others) of products, processes, technologies, or services for sale to or use by the Federal Government or commercial markets    

The Small Business Administration and OSD/OSBP assign a Commercialization Index based on progression within the Phases and reported successes</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Industrial Preparedness Manufacturing Technology (IP ManTech) Program supports the development of a responsive, world-class manufacturing capability to affordably meet the warfighters’ needs throughout the defense system life cycle.  IP ManTech: Provides the crucial link between invention and product application to speed technology transitions.  The program matures and validates emerging manufacturing technologies to support low-risk implementation in industry and Department of Defense (DoD) facilities, e.g. depots and shipyards.  It addresses production issues early by providing timely solutions, thereby reducing risk and positively impacting system life cycle affordability by providing solutions to manufacturing problems before they occur.  

Beginning in FY 16 DLA ManTech was realigned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial base Manufacturing Processes; 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply; and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information.  
•	The Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products. This SFA subsumed the former supply chain oriented efforts in  Subsistence Network (formerly Combat Rations Network for Technology Implementation), Procurement Readiness Optimization—Advanced Casting Technology (PRO-ACT), Procurement Readiness Optimization—Forging Advance System Technology (PRO-FAST), and Battery Network (BATTNET). New manufacturing processes within the scope of this SFA include emerging technologies such as Additive Manufacturing.  
•	Maintaining Viable Supply Sources includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements. This SFA subsumed the Material Acquisition Electronics ManTech efforts.  In the future it will include other DLA efforts to maintain a viable industrial capability in areas such as Strategic Materials. 
•	The Improving Technical and Logistics Information SFA include efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA industry partners and customers. It includes the MANTECH program Military Uniform System Technology (MUST) (formerly Customer Driven Uniform Manufacturing) and the Defense Logistics Information Research Program from P.E. 0603712S.  A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging “Model Based Enterprise” paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The Subsistence Network plan is to execute reductions in cost and/or as applicable improve processes in the subsistence supply chain related to shipping, storage, inventory, waste and inspections, and quality of products, as well as reduce lead times for combat ration production, field feeding equipment, garrison feeding and market fresh (bread and dairy) products.

Specific technical achievements of the Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization (MATS) project will include demonstrating MATS production capability to sterilize group-sized entrees and components, packaged in institutional sized pouches and polymeric trays. Rations processed through MATS should offer substantial cost benefits over current retorted or thermally processed rations due to fast heating rate, high energy efficiency, increased production, reduced labor, improved quality, and a flexibility of differential heating for multi-components trays or pouches to preserve the optimal quality of individual components.  MATS will also produce products with better taste and texture, higher nutrient retention, longer shelf life, greater menu variety, and ultimately greater consumption of rations and less food waste.  

Specific technical achievements of the MRE Alternate Chemical Resistant Pouch Laminate will include evaluating various alternate sealant layers and test them for acid resistance, as well as overall performance in the MRE ration ultimately leading to the identification and production of alternate sealant layers for high acidic foods. The project will mitigate current risks in the material supply chain and establish reliable production for advanced pouch materials. Additionally, through this project the use of glass bottles for hot sauce and eliminating pouches for more viscous products such as ketchup and mustard that might not have a three-year shelf life.  

Specific technical achievements of the Combat Rations Shelf Life Temperature Monitoring will include achieving a level of new regulatory compliance via monitoring temperature variations in the San Joaquin, CA warehouse where subsistence is being stored and assembled into Unitized Group Rations. The results will identify a range of cost effective device solutions and storage mediation practices. The solution sets will determine shelf life (food quality and safety) degradation to ration components (pre and post assembly) and improve information to the customer.

Specific technical achievements of the Optimize Combat Rations Inspection Costs will include reducing inspection cost performed by two government agencies and ration producer through the elimination of duplicate tests for the same quality attribute that is performed.  Based on internal reviews and assessments, proposed solutions will be identified and further evaluated for optimal inspection frequencies and sample sizes in order to minimize cost while maintaining quality and safety goals. The optimized inspection methods that show the most promising strategies and solutions (biggest cost impacts) and quickest return on investment without sacrificing overall product quality for the customer will be verified.

At least 50% of the completed short-term projects will transition in 2016, and OSD-C financial metrics (obligation and disbursement) will be achieved.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense, through the Defense Logistics Agency, spends upwards of $2 billion per year on military uniforms and individual equipment. The lead-time is up to 15 months for these items. The CDUM program concluded in October 2014, and the results have been implemented DOD wide for recruit items. Residual CDUM projects have been transitioned into the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) Program. The MUST Program was initiated in 4th quarter 2014. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time between Individual Item and Equipment (IIE) development and sustainment from years to months. The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military IIE supply chain from an “electronic paper” (i.e. PDF/MS Word) based, manual environment into a knowledge based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end to end supply chain.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Castings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the metalcasting industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain castings. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the metal casting supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DOD weapon systems. The increase in funding will help develop new technology for casting suppliers, including inspection, materials, modeling, and design.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Forgings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the forging industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain forgings.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed, these capabilities will support the forging industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the forging supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DOD weapon systems.  The increase in funding will help develop new technology for forging suppliers, including new methods for making forge dies (typically the longest lead time and most expensive item) and for simulation of metal flow inside the forge die (to eliminate trial and error development of the die).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Develop a capability to emulate most obsolete digital integrated circuits (ICs) in the Federal catalog using a single, flexible manufacturing line.  DoD has estimated $2.9 billion is spent every five years redesigning circuit card assemblies.  Many of these circuit card redesigns are performed to mitigate IC obsolescence.  Commercial ICs have short Product Life Cycles (often only 18 months).  IC Manufacturers subsequently move on to later generations of ICs, leaving little to no sources for their previous IC products.  DoD maintains weapons systems much longer than IC lifecycles, resulting in an obsolescence problem.  In order to avoid costs and potential readiness issues associated with buying/carrying excess inventories acquired before commercial availability ceases, or redesigning the next higher assembly to mitigate the obsolete IC, DLA (as the manager of 88% of the IC Federal Stock Class) must have the capability to manufacture needed IC devices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The first NSNs produced, support 42 weapon systems, including B-52, A-10, Arleigh Burke DDG, F-16, AWACS, F/A-18, &amp; E/A-18; additional NSNs will be produced across the FYDP and beyond.  MAE also made significant progress in the development of higher density Read-Only and Random-Access Memory, Advanced Emitter-Coupled Logic and Closed-Cell CMOS capabilities which, when transitioned into full-scale production, will further increase DLA’s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs. The newly transitioned emulation capabilities will address several discontinued device families and will increase the potential emulation production envelope by several hundred NSNs.  MAE also initiated new implementations including development of an Advanced Schottky TTL Capability. It will continue prototyping 350 nanometer emulation circuitry, bringing emulation capability that re-establishes sources for additional NSNs</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>BATTNET is focused on improving the supply and reducing the cost of procured batteries used in fielded weapon systems such as communication radios and armored vehicles. Batteries exhibit dynamic challenges for military logistics. BATTNET is a community of practice of battery supply chain members, engineering support activities, researchers, and users. BATTNET conducts R&amp;D to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher MRLs for specific groups of batteries.  For FY2014, DLA received 139,163 orders for 2.85 million batteries at $183M net value - compared to FY13 $176M and FY12 $216M.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

R&amp;D initiated joint work with US Army AMCOM to replace obsolete nickel cadmium batteries on TOW2 system, initiated additional manufacturing technology cost/risk reduction work on lithium-ion battery for MH-60 helicopter, and continued work on new non-solvent equipment for coating lithium-ion cathodes and anodes.  All projects require executive approval with business case and transition plan. The program is also managing several SBIR projects expected to transition into BATTNET activities.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The BATTNET R&amp;D partners were established by contract September 2009 through a competitive Broad Area Announcement (BAA) allowing for maximum competition. Partner Contracts were based upon proposals that demonstrated knowledge, experience, and expertise in the following areas of interest: Automation, Battery Maintenance, Competition &amp; Contracting Requirements, Diminishing Manufacturing &amp; Supply, Lithium Battery Safety, Reducing Acquisition Costs, Shelf Life, Supply Chain Logistics, Surge/Sustainment, and Technology Transition/Insertion. The BATTNET, which includes a Government Steering Group (GSG) of power source technical experts from the military services R&amp;D groups, is informed of general R&amp;D requirements for supply chain improvement. The partners develop among themselves related R&amp;D projects, which are then formally evaluated by the GSG. Selected projects are then chartered within DLA and planned for contract STP awards when funds are available.  Additional projects were awarded to BATTNET partners from FY12 Industrial Base Innovation Fund (IBIF).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>At least 30% of the completed projects will transition. The program achieved production readiness of lithium batteries that have more than two-times the energy capacity, three-times the shelf-life, and one-third of the weight compared to the batteries they replace.   

OSD-C financial metrics (obligation and disbursement) will be achieved.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Material Availability (MA) Strategic Focus Area (SFA) are R&amp;D efforts undertaken with DLA’s industrial base to reduce material costs, reduce the length and variability of Production Lead-Times, assure the DLA managed products meet requirements, and continuously improve quality and reliability. Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable Customer Wait Times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs.  This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Combat Rations Program, the Battery Program, the Castings and the Forgings programs.  

This SFA is comprised of five roadmaps for Batteries, Subsistence Network, Castings, Forgings, and Additive Manufacturing.  

The Battery network objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy. The network conducts R&amp;D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher MRLs for specific groups of batteries. For FY2014, DLA received 139,163 orders for 2.85 million batteries at $183M net value - compared to FY13 $176M and FY12 $216M. The Battery network focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of batteries. Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&amp;D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.

The Subsistence Supply Chain consists of military subsistence, which includes combat rations, field feeding equipment, garrison feeding and market fresh products. The Subsistence Network (SUBNET) program is a manufacturing technology program and is the successor to the Combat Rations R&amp;D program. SUBNET’s community of practice will research and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain with the goals of maximizing capability and capacity to produce, and to encourage innovation and modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies. The desired outcomes of the current short-term projects Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization (MATS), MRE Alternate Chemical Laminate, Optimize Combat Ration Inspection Costs, and Combat Rations Shelf Life Temperature Monitoring Project  include testing of low risk, high-impact technology and process improvements that will improve the quality of individual and group combat rations, reduce cost, and provide efficiencies, then transitioning these improvements to industrial base suppliers and government suppliers.   

The Castings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the metalcasting industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain castings. Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the metalcasting supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DOD weapon systems.

The Forgings consortium objective is to develop new materials and technologies for the forging industry to help DLA improve the supply of parts that contain forgings.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered up to 10% are forgings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design.  Once developed these capabilities will support the forging industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the industry associations.  These advancements will improve the forging supply chains for the DOD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  This is achieved through investments in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DOD weapon systems.

The Additive Manufacturing (AM) objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits.  DLA needs to exploit AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                            <r2:Text>The Subsistence Network (SUBNET) plans to identify and award new STPs through a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) with an expected duration of 12-24 months and an average annual funding of $100K-$250K. The government plans to invest up to $18 million during Fiscal Years 2016-2021 for funding research in response to this BAA.  Through the SUBNET STPs, research and development projects will be conducted and directed toward improving existing DLA processes and to improve manufacturing and delivery of combat rations and other subsistence products. Two of the STPs will be completed and transitioned in FY16. That is, the Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization (MATS) and the MRE Alternate Chemical Laminate Project. The Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization (MATS) goal is to reduce the cost of current combat ration entrees using MATS versus Retort, which is projected to be a 40% reduction in cost based on the energy savings per pouch of 50% MATS versus Retort. The cost reduction is projected to be higher when ration waste is considered as a result of poor reception of retorted ration entrees by the warfighters.  For the project optimize combat rations inspection costs, the objective is to establish an inspection system that captures the cost of quality that includes inspection of incoming material, in-process and end item inspections. The baseline for inspection was established for two retort products and one assembled meal. Analytical testing protocols have been reassessed for two products leading to a 58% reduction in cost. The combat ration shelf life temperature monitoring through data loggers provided a method to monitor the temperature distribution in the warehouse where unitized group rations are stored. The project includes tasks to develop solution sets for an optimal method of determining the rate of the shelf life degradation of rations and contents and a method to convey information to the receiver of the product at time of shipment. A 9 F degree reduction in temperature was achieved during the summer of 2015 as compared to 2014, leading to significant shelf life retention. The MRE Alternate Chemical Resistant Pouch Laminate will mitigate the risks in the material supply chain and establish reliable production for advanced pouch materials.  Investments in these projects and future short-term projects will improve quality of individual and group combat rations, reduce costs, increase production, and provide efficiencies. 

The Castings consortium plan is to complete some existing projects towards the end of FY16 and into FY17. The new BAA will be released in FY16, with award(s) planned for 1st quarter FY17.  Plan to complete new welding procedures and post-weld heat treatments to restore mechanical properties of the welded areas of Eglin Steel, a high strength steel, and hence its strength and integrity.

The Forgings consortium plan is to continue working projects recently awarded in FY15.  The Forging consortium will also pursue additional forging manufacturing advances from successful DLA SBIR projects selected in FY2014 using additional funds planned to begin in FY16.

The Battery Network plan is to identify and award new Short Term Projects (STP) with an expected duration of 18-24 months and an average annual funding of $200K-$500K. Proposals are required to include a business case with specific metrics and transition plan for success. The Battery Network will also pursue additional battery manufacturing advances from successful DLA SBIR projects selected in FY2014.  

The Additive Manufacturing plan is for DLA to partner with the Military Services to use AM to produce parts. DLA and the Services will identify candidate parts, convert technical data to 3D format to facilitate AM, procure the parts, and document the process for AM benefits. The Services will review newly created technical data packages (TDP), test the parts, and qualify AM as an acceptable process to produce the parts.

FY 16 – FY 20: Funding for Additive projects will be reallocated from other MA SFA thrusts and classified into the Additive Manufacturing Thrust.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Battery Network plan is to establish contract partners through a competitive Broad Area Announcement (BAA) based upon proposals that demonstrated knowledge, experience, and expertise in the following areas of interest: Automation, Diminishing Manufacturing &amp; Supply, Battery Safety, Reducing Acquisition Costs, Shelf Life, Supply Chain Logistics, Surge/Sustainment, and Technology Transition/Insertion. A Government Steering Group (GSG) of power source technical experts from the military services R&amp;D groups will inform general R&amp;D requirements for supply chain and technology improvement. The plan also includes awarding Phase 2 and 3 projects from DLA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) in advanced battery manufacturing technology. 

The Subsistence Network acquisition strategy is delivery orders against competitively awarded IDIQ R&amp;D contracts via the forthcoming BAA.  The current contracts will reach the end of their base period of performance by December 2016.  A new BAA has been drafted and will be released in January 2016 with award of contracts in FY16 and FY17. A Joint Steering Group made up of government representatives from the Military Services, DLA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Public Health Center, and the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center will review ongoing projects, identify new areas for investment, assess proposed projects, examine procedures and processes, keep abreast of new technologies, and understand DLA and DoD subsistence needs and requirements.

The Castings involved a competitive Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Evaluations were completed and two contracts were awarded competitively September 2011.  The current contracts reached the end of their base period of performance on September 30, 2016.  A new BAA has been drafted and will be released in FY16 with award of contracts(s) in FY17.

The Forgings involved a competitive Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Evaluations were completed and a contract awarded September 2014.  

The Additive Manufacturing plan will partner with the Military Services and use organic and commercial AM parts production capabilities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The Battery Network plan is to report returns on investments and achievements to the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) for evaluation. 

The Subsistence  Network plan is to execute reductions in cost for shipping, storage, supply chain process, inventory, waste and inspections, as well as reduced lead times for combat ration production, field feeding equipment, garrison feeding and “market fresh."

For example, SUBNET will provide the following technical achievements: 1) a microwave-assisted capability to sterilize group-sized entrees and components, packaged in Institutional Sized Pouches (ISP) and Polymeric Trays and 2) identify and produce at least one or more alternate sealant layers that can be used by the rations industry to pack high acidic food products and to ensure uninterrupted supply of MRE rations. 

The Castings consortium plan is to report returns on investments and achievements to the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) for evaluation. 

The Forgings consortium plan is to report returns on investments and achievements to the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) for evaluation.  

The Additive Manufacturing metric is the number of parts qualified for AM and the lead-time savings achieved to make small quantities of items.  

At least 30% of the completed projects will transition.   

OSD-C financial metrics (obligation and disbursement) will be achieved.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The High Quality Sources SFA are projects undertaken to assure that the industrial base can respond to DLA requirements and DLA can fill military customers’ material requirements reliably and consistently.  Benefits include eliminating cancelled requisitions returned to customers as “non-procurable.” This strategic focus area includes within its scope the former Material Acquisition Electronics program.  

The Material Acquisition Electronics roadmap has four major thrusts in Digital Microcircuits: Advanced Schottky TTL, TTL Compatible CMOS, 512 Kilobit RAM/ROM and Mega Gate ASIC.  The Roadmap also includes a new major thrust area: Linear Microcircuits.  Over the past several years, obsolescence in this class of microcircuits has greatly increased and has become a significant concern.  These are classes of microcircuits that are expected to become non-procurable in FY 17 and beyond.  Without the technologies planned on the MAE Roadmap, DLA will not be able to support DoD’s requirements for high quality spare parts for critical electronic systems and subsystems.  

The Strategic Materials roadmap is a new thrust for the DLA Mantech program.  It is designed to ensure that critical strategic materials are available from domestic sources and that process innovations are in place to efficiently process or recover strategic materials. Domestic capabilities can enhance national security and potentially reduce Defense Stockpile requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

MAE will complete development and transition higher density Read-Only and Random-Access Memory, Advanced Emitter-Coupled Logic and Closed-Cell CMOS capabilities into full-scale production further increasing DLA’s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs. The newly transitioned emulation capabilities will address several discontinued device families and will increase the potential emulation production envelope by several hundred NSNs.  MAE will also initiate several new implementations including development of TTL-Compatible CMOS Emulation Capability. It will continue developing 350 nanometer Digital Emulation circuitry, bringing emulation capability that re-establishes sources for additional NSNs.  AME will also continue initial development and capability assessments to support a new major emulation thrust to support Linear Microcircuits beginning in FY2017.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Improving Technical and Logistics Information Strategic Focus Area (SFA) projects improve and facilitate the communication of technical and logistics information among industry, DLA’s military customers and DLA. This SFA includes Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) and the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) (P.E. 0603712S) within its scope. The movement of the DLIR related work from P.E. 0603712S to the DOD ManTech Program aligns the funding to the critical interface between DLA and industry and away from internal DLA operations.

The MUST focus addresses GAO Report 12-707 recommendations that DOD to establish a “knowledge-based approach” to collaborate on define and communicate of military unique requirements. DLA has the responsibility to communicate and manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders. The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly reduce the lead-time between Individual Item and Equipment (IIE) development and sustainment from years to months. The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military IIE supply chain from an “electronic paper” (i.e. PDF/MS Word) based, manual environment into a knowledge based automated environment. The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end to end supply chain.

The DLIR Model Based Enterprise effort will develop capabilities to systematically accept engineering and design data from the Military Services, validate and store item technical data in 3D models. There are two classes of data that must be addressed: newly designed parts for systems still in development and legacy parts for systems that are in sustainment. The problem with newly designed parts is capturing the complete and accurate designs. The legacy parts do not have digital engineering models which recreating the design in contemporary engineering systems.   

The Technical and Logistical Data Interoperability will pioneer methods to capture data from military Services, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and suppliers to form a seamless thread of interoperable and linked data models.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The project will develop and demonstrate a digital specification authoring tool, an automated piece-part design and 3D visualization tool, and technology to streamline the transition of requirements from the Services to DLA.  MUST will show how DLA, its customers and suppliers can access, manage and share technical requirements in a common format. 

The DLIR MBE and data interoperability efforts will begin to extract info from product lifecycle management systems and link the data to specifications and standards via semantic data models and concepts. A new approach to distribution of specs and standards will be evaluated that enables industrial companies to have access to the precise specification requirement without having to extract it from the reference document.

Testing the Model Based Enterprise (MBE) Conops developed in FY 15 with actual procurement using the standard supply system.

The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) has been in operation since February 1996. The PDC is a public/private partnership managed by the University of Hawaii (UH) under a cooperative agreement with the Department of Defense.  The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) function, manpower, and budget resources transferred to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (OUSD(AT&amp;L)) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)in October 2011.

 The USD(P) will continue to be the Operational Sponsor and functional OSD Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for the program.  The PDC is a world-recognized authority and leader in science and information technology applications relating to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR). PDC’s applications and information products enhance preparedness, situational awareness, and civil-military communications for humanitarian missions worldwide, while its national-level socio-economic Risk and Vulnerability Assessments help inform strategies by measuring indicators for national resiliency using scientific methods.

The PDC Program Office’s (USD(P),  ASD(HD&amp;GS), and DASD(DC&amp;MA)) primary responsibility is for management and stewardship of governmental funds provided in Defense Department appropriations for DoD missions associated with DoD CrM, HA/DR, Theater Security Cooperation, and Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA). In doing this, the Program Office develops and provides policy, oversight and guidance, and jointly develops strategic guidelines, programmatic content and priorities with the UH and PDC. The PDC Program Office also serves as a support element of the Hawaii-based organization especially in the area of gaining Federal agency support and resources, as well as business opportunities.</r2:Description>

PDC's products and services enhance foundational and global services supporting civil-military humanitarian assistance operations by the US Military and US agencies, state agencies, United Nation agencies, ASEAN, national governments, and International/Non-Governmental Organizations (I/NGO).  Foundational and Global Services include projects supporting development, analysis, and delivery of relevant and actionable information.  These activities fall into three categories:  Global Information Services; Anticipatory Sciences and Socio-Economic Risk and Vulnerability Assessment; and Decision Support Platforms and Applications.

Emphasis areas in FY 2016 include:

•  Improve the simplified DisasterAWARE/RAPIDS user interface (a.k.a. "dashboard") for increased ease-of-use and situational awareness, while allowing the system to accommodate "low bandwidth" operational mode (enabling better support to mobile platforms, as well as, degraded communications) 
• Extend and enhance mobile computing and situational awareness platform for DisasterAWARE/RAPIDS to include:
   a) limited "down range" data collection &amp; sharing capabilities (e.g., damage photos, voice memos, etc.)
   b) investigate and implement degraded but functional/operational "off-grid" capabilities
   c) investigate and implement degraded but operational "low bandwidth" capabilities
• Enhance DisasterAWARE's social media/network visualization capabilities, in collaboration with partners such as ONR-funded research in the subject matter
•  Extend and enhance Bio Surveillance capabilities in collaboration with Navy and Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA)Bio Surveillance Portal (BSP) Joint Program Executive Office
•  Extend collaboration with DTRA &amp; other data providers in enhancing data fusion capabilities
•  Continue to emphasize and participate jointly- and externally-funded research and application programs to enhance the Center's capabilities and experiences which in turn can be operationalize and applied in direct support of DoD HA/DR and DSCA missions
•  Continue to grow competitive grants and proposals as a means to expand the center’s capabilities, and leverage these new capabilities in support of DoD missions</r2:Text>
