                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications.  It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, biological and materials sciences.

     The Bio/Info/Micro Sciences project will explore and develop potential technological breakthroughs that exist at the intersection of biology, information technology and micro/physical systems to exploit advances and leverage fundamental discoveries for the development of new technologies, techniques and systems of interest to the DoD.  Programs in this project will draw upon information and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple biological architectures and functions, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels.  Programs in this project also lay the groundwork for advances in military medicine and combat casualty care.

     The Math and Computer Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in new computational models and mechanisms for reasoning and communication in complex, interconnected systems.  The project is exploring novel means to exploit computer capabilities; enhance human-to-computer and computer-to-computer interaction technologies; advance innovative computer architectures; and discover new learning mechanisms and innovations in software composition.  It is also fostering the computer science academic community to address the DoD's need for innovative computer and information science technologies.  Additionally, this project explores the science of mathematics for potential defense applications.

      The Cyber Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber-security.  Networked computing systems control virtually everything, from power plants and energy distribution, transportation systems, food and water distribution, financial systems, to defense systems.  Protecting the infrastructure on which these systems rely is a national security issue.   The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD cyber-capabilities survive adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Basic research in cyber security is required to provide a basis for continuing progress in this area. Promising research results will transition to both technology development and system-level projects.

     The Electronic Sciences project explores and demonstrates electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits and processing concepts that will provide: 1) new technical options for meeting the information gathering, transmission and processing required to maintain near-real time knowledge of the enemy and the ability to communicate decisions based on that knowledge to all forces in near-real time; and 2) provide new means for achieving substantial increases in performance and cost reduction of military systems providing these capabilities.

     The Materials Sciences project is concerned with the development of: high power density/high energy density mobile and portable power sources; processing and design approaches for nanoscale and/or bimolecular materials, interfaces and microsystems; and materials and measurements for molecular-scale electronics.

     The Transformative Sciences project supports scientific research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in the areas of computing and the computing-reliant subareas of social sciences, life sciences, manufacturing, and commerce as a means of improving military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging converging trends.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This unique interaction will develop new mathematical and experimental tools for understanding biology in a way that will allow its application to a myriad of DoD problems.  These tools will help exploit the advances in the complex modeling of physical and biological phenomena.  It is also expected that understanding the fundamentals of biology will aid in developing tools to understand complex, non-linear networks and force structures.  This program will also explore the fundamental nature of time in biology and medicine.  This will include mapping basic clock circuitry in biological systems from the molecular level up through unique species level activities with a special emphasis on the applicability to human biology.  Operational relevance of this research activity includes improving our understanding of sleep-wake cycles, increasing the scientific understanding of deployment cycle lengths, and enhancing our ability to model the dynamics of disease outbreaks.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Biological Adaptation, Assembly and Manufacturing program is examining the structure, function, and informational basis underlying biological system adaptation, and the factors employed by the organism to assemble and manufacture complex biological subsystems.  The unique stability afforded biological systems in their ability to adapt to wide extremes of physical and endurance (e.g., heat, cold, and sleeplessness) parameters will be examined and exploited in order to engineer stability into biological systems required for the military (such as blood, bioengineered tissues or other therapeutics).  In addition, the fault tolerance present in biological systems will be exploited in order to assemble and manufacture complex physical and multi-functional systems, both biological and abiotic (such as tissue constructs designed for reconstructive surgery).  These systems include novel load-bearing bio-interactive materials and composites for repair of severe hard tissue trauma, including complex bone fractures.  A key new antibody technology will develop the ideal antibody master molecule for use in unattended sensors that maintains high temperature stability and controllable affinity for threat agents.  Using the Freytag triangle structure, the interplay of narratives or stories may reveal how they tap into an array of mechanisms implicated in memory, reasoning, and strategy behavior.  Applications to Defense systems include the development of chemical and biological sensors; tools for strategic military decision-makers involved in public relations and information operations, and improved warfighter battlefield survivability.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Human Assisted Neural Devices program is developing the scientific foundation for understanding the language of the brain for application to a variety of emerging DoD challenges, including improving performance on the battlefield and returning active duty military to their units after injury.  This requires an understanding of neuroscience, significant computational efforts, and new material design and implementation.  Key advances expected from this research include determining the nature and means through which short-term memory is encoded, and discovering the mechanisms and dynamics underlying neural computation and reorganization.  These advances will enable memory restoration through the use of devices programmed to bridge gaps in the injured brain.  Further, modeling of the brain progresses to an unprecedented level with this novel approach.  The programs funded under the Human Assisted Neural Devices are continued in Budget Activity 6.1 Medical Program Element 0601117E, in FY 2012 and subsequent years.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Young Faculty Award (YFA) program is to encourage new faculty members at academic institutions to participate in sponsored research programs that will augment capabilities for future defense systems.  This program focuses on speculative technologies for greatly enhancing microsystems technologies, innovative information technologies, and defense sciences.  The long-term goal for this program is to develop the next generation of academic scientists, engineers, and mathematicians in key disciplines who will focus a significant portion of their careers on DoD and National Security issues.  Current activities include research in twelve topic areas: Quantum Science and Technology; New Physical Methods for Biological Characterization and Control; Mathematics; Structural Materials; Functional Materials; Power and Energy; Advanced Electronics; Micro/Nano Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS/NEMS); Photonics and Lasers; Digital Direct Manufacturing; Neuroscience; and Computational and Quantitative Social, Decision, and Behavioral Sciences.  For YFA 2012 a new topic on Robotics will be added and the three historic materials science and power &amp; energy topics will be replaced with three revised materials science topics.

                                    <r2:Description>The Strategic Social Interaction Modules (SSIM) program will improve military training to include the social interaction skills and abilities warfighters need for successful engagement with local populations.  In the current operational environment, it is imperative to develop rapport with local leaders and civilians as their cooperation and consent will be necessary for successful operations.  SSIM will emphasize the foundational social skills necessary to achieve cultural understanding in any social setting and the skills necessary for successful interactions across different social groups.  These core skills do not require soldiers to have knowledge of a specific culture prior to contact but emphasizes skills for orienting toward and discovering patterns of meaningful social behavior.  SSIM will develop the requisite training technology including advanced gaming/simulation techniques that incorporate new methods for practicing social agility in social encounters, as well as how to discover and adapt to unfamiliar culturally-specific conduct, manners, and practices.  SSIM will enhance military effectiveness by enabling close collaborative relationships with local peoples and leaders.</r2:Description>

Such a theory would incorporate techniques from diverse mathematical disciplines such as Stochastic Process Theory, Harmonic Analysis, Formal Languages and Theoretical Computer Science to construct a common framework wherein the quantitative value of data acquisition may be assessed relative to dynamically-varying context.  In addition, the structure will accommodate the notion that data acquisition and information processing are coupled, requiring some degree of feedback and control, while simultaneously admitting the possibility of different logics, such as those that allow for incomplete and time-varying states of knowledge.  The result of this effort will produce advances in fundamental domains of mathematics with the potential to reshape current DoD approaches to managing the battlespace.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Math for Social Networks

While the DoD has been extremely effective in deploying rigorous analytical and predictive methods for problems involving continuously valued variables (tracking, signals processing), analytical methods for discrete data such as graphs and networks have not kept pace.  Recent evidence has shown that social network analysis can provide critical insight when used in DoD-relevant scenarios.  In this paradigm, nodes represent people of interest and their relationships or interactions are edges; the result forms a network or graph.  Current analysis of social networks, however, is just in its infancy:  the composition of real-world networks is understood only at the most coarse and basic details (diameter, degree distribution).  In order to implement social network techniques efficiently and usefully, a better understanding of the finer mathematical structure of social networks is needed.  This includes the development of a comprehensive and minimal mathematical set which characterizes social networks of DoD interest, and includes a description of how these quantities vary in both space and time.  This also necessitates creation of fundamental theory of how heterogeneous social networks of different media (Facebook, Twitter, Picasa) interact.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Unconventional Computation program is a broad-based effort to develop new methods of computing by investigating, exploiting, and advancing novel computation models - such as those found in neuro-biological systems - that are currently unavailable in conventional microprocessors and can theoretically boost processing efficiency by three orders of magnitude for certain important classes of DoD-critical applications.  The program will require cross-disciplinary collaboration to exploit and advance unique computational models and connectivity architectures which minimize power, processing time, and/or instruction complexity in DoD-critical applications such as image/pattern detection, signal filtering/data reduction, and change detection.  Some example approaches include, but are not limited to, co-opting neuro-biological material to implement a specific function or mapping biological functions to electronic circuitry.  Bayesian inference engines, specialized processors, approximate computation, and DNA computing are explicitly of interest.  The ultimate goal of the Unconventional Computing program is to develop devices, architectures, and systems capable of exploiting innovative computation models to enhance the computation capabilities of the DoD.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Foundational Machine Intelligence program supported research on the foundations of artificial intelligence and machine learning and reasoning.  One focus was on techniques that can efficiently process and "understand" massive data streams.  Deeply layered machine learning engines were created that use a single set of methods in multiple layers (at least three internally) to generate progressively more sophisticated representations of patterns, invariants, and correlations from data inputs.  These will have far-reaching military implications with potential applications such as anomaly detection, object recognition, language understanding, information retrieval, pattern recognition, robotic task learning and automatic metadata extraction from video streams, sensor data, and multi-media objects.  Foundational Machine Intelligence also examined the human aspects of computing, with interest in collaboration, interaction and information exchange; non-symbolic representation/reasoning paradigms based upon a universal "cortical" algorithm; and modeling of human language acquisition by associating words with the real-world entities perceived through multiple modes of sensory input.</r2:Description>

Issues addressed included quantifying network performance in terms of throughput, delay, reliability, and other critical parameters as a function of node mobility, network topology, channel access protocol, bandwidth efficiency, and the overhead incurred through the exchange of channel and network state information.  The revolutionary new and powerful information theory developed under ITMANET will enable the next generation of DoD wireless networks and provide insight concerning the acquisition and deployment of nearer-term systems.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Cyber Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber-security.  Networked computing systems control virtually everything, from power plants and energy distribution grids, transportation systems, food and water distribution systems, and financial networks to defense systems.  Protecting the infrastructure on which these systems rely is a national security issue.  Cyberspace is not only critical to our national security, it is fundamental to our way of life: over the past decade information technologies have driven the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Unfortunately, during the same period, cyber-adversaries, which include nation-states, criminal/terrorist groups, transnational actors, and miscreants, have grown rapidly in sophistication and number.  The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD cyber-capabilities survive adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Basic research in cyber security is required to provide a basis for continuing progress in this area.  Promising research results will transition to both technology development and system-level projects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Active Authentication program will develop more effective user identification and authentication technologies.  Current authentication approaches are typically based on long, complex passwords and incorporate no mechanism to verify the user originally authenticated is the user still in control of the session.  The Active Authentication program will address these issues by focusing on the unique aspects of the individual (i.e., the cognitive fingerprint) through the use of software-based biometrics that continuously validate the identity of the user.  Active Authentication will integrate multiple biometric modalities to create a system that is accurate, robust, and transparent to the user.</r2:Description>

Research areas include new electronic and optoelectronic device and circuit concepts, operation of devices at higher frequency and lower power, extension of diode laser operation to new wavelength ranges relevant to military missions, development of uncooled and novel infrared detector materials for night vision and other sensor applications, development of innovative optical and electronic technologies for interconnecting modules in high performance systems, research to realize field portable electronics with reduced power requirements, and system and component level improvements to provide greater affordability and reliability.  Additionally, electronically controlled microinstruments offer the possibility of nanometer-scale probing, sensing and manipulation for ultra-high density information storage "on-a-chip," for nanometer-scale patterning, and for molecular level analysis and synthesis.  These microinstruments may also offer new approaches to integration, testing, controlling, manipulating and manufacturing nanometer-scale structures, molecules and devices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Optical Radiation Cooling and Heating in Integrated Devices (ORCHID)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>Many Department of Defense (DoD) systems use micro- and nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS).  These devices are used in compact accelerometers and gyroscopes for stability control in inertial navigation and in switches for optical communication and data routing.  These devices operate many orders of magnitude away from their ultimate limits.  Techniques to reduce or overcome thermal noise in MEMS/NEMS devices are critical for realizing their full potential.

Opto-mechanical devices offer a novel, noncryogenic path toward sensing at the standard quantum limit (SQL).  Ultimately, quantum (shot) noise limits the performance of many sensitive optical instruments including force sensors, trace gas detectors, and laser gyroscopes.  However, opto-mechanical devices can also control the quantum fluctuations of optical probes to reduce readout sensitivity below SQL, via a technique known as squeezing.

The ORCHID program will leverage recent successes within the field of cavity-opto-mechanics to broadly explore the application space while driving technological development toward smaller and more robust devices capable of deployment in the field.  It is envisioned that such devices, once demonstrated, will find broad application across DoD, particularly in the areas of force sensing and optical communication.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The objective of the Advanced X-Ray Integrated Sources (AXIS) program is to develop tunable mono-energetic X-ray sources that are spatially coherent with greatly reduced size, weight and power while dramatically increasing their electrical efficiency through application of micro-scale engineering technologies such as MEMS and NEMS.  Such X-ray sources will enable new versatile imaging modalities based on phase contrast which are 1000X more sensitive than the conventional absorption contrast imaging.  Such imaging modalities should enable reverse engineering of integrated circuits to validate trustworthiness as well as battlefield imaging of soft tissues and blood vessel injuries without the injection of a contrast enhancing agent in blunt trauma.  It will also reduce radiation dose required for imaging.

The Basic Research component of this effort will focus on defining the fundamental science necessary for the creation of compact and highly efficient synchrotron X-ray sources.  These sources may lead to future developments in the tunable imaging field.  This program also has related applied research efforts funded under PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Prior DARPA efforts have demonstrated the ability to monolithically integrate inherently different semiconductor types to achieve near-ideal "mix-and-match" capability for DoD circuit designers.  Specifically, the Compound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon (COSMOS) program, in which transistors of Indium Phosphide (InP) can be freely mixed with silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to obtain the benefits of both technologies (very high speed and very high circuit complexity/density, respectively).  The Diverse &amp; Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) effort will take this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (e.g., GaN, InP, GaAs, ABCS), microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures.  This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true "systems on a chip" (SoCs) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions for a wide array of system applications.

The Basic Research part of this program  will focus on the development of new hetero-integration processes and capabilities that, if successful, will ultimately be demonstrated in application-specific circuits and transferred into the manufacturing flow.

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Microscale Plasma Devices (MPD) program is to design, develop, and characterize MPD technologies, circuits, and substrates.  The MPD program will focus on development of fast, small, reliable, carrier dense, microplasma switches capable of operating in extreme conditions, such as high-radiation and high-temperature environments.  Specific focus will be given to methods that produce efficient generation of ions, radio frequency energy, and light sources over a range of gas pressures.  Applications for such devices are far reaching, including the construction of complete high-frequency plasma-based logic circuits, and integrated circuits with superior resistance to radiation and extreme temperature environments.  It is envisaged that both two and multi-terminal devices consisting of various architectures will be developed and optimized under the scope of this program.  MPDs will be developed in various circuits and substrates to demonstrate the efficacy of different approaches.

The Basic Research part of this effort is focused on fundamental MPD research and will advance scientific knowledge based on the study of several key MPD design parameters.  These parameters include ultra-high pressure and carrier densities regimes.  MPD will focus on expanding the design space for plasma devices enabling revolutionary advances in microplasma device performance.  It is expected that MPD will develop innovative concepts and technologies that are clearly disruptive with respect to the current state of the art.  Fundamental scientific knowledge derived from MPD is also expected to drive developments in commercialization of MPD technology developed and funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Microsystems Research Consortium (MRC) program is a continuation and expansion of the FCRP industry-government partnership that will combine the expertise and resources from select defense, semiconductor, information systems, and automotive companies with DARPA.  For every $3 from industry DARPA will provide $2.  This funding will collectively support a well-focused community of the most talented academic research teams around the country to make the discoveries that will comprise microsystems of the future.  For industry, the pre-competitive research produced by MRC represents the building blocks upon which they will grow their business to the next level.  For government, it will accelerate the time frame from design to production of the new generation of defense systems, providing the high performance devices and applications needed by warfighters in the field.  Research in the MRC program is divided into the broad categories of technology discovery and system discovery.  Technology discovery efforts will be focused on providing a pipeline of innovative devices and basic discovery.  In contrast, the system discovery efforts will focus on integration of existing technologies to provide new capabilities.  These include, among many others, producing new opportunities for functionality beyond digital CMOS, and developing anticipatory technology, where systems interact actively with their environment and/or users, adapting their response to execute the most advantageous and effective actions.  MRC is unique in that government participates as a partner on an equal ground as industry, with contracting function to pursue its goals directly rather than extracting indirect benefits from subsidizing technology.  The program has a definite five year duration, with its leadership turning over periodically.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Quantum Entanglement Science and Technology (QuEST) program is exploring the research necessary to create new technologies based on quantum information science.  Technical challenges include loss of information due to quantum decoherence, limited communication distance due to signal attenuation, protocols, and larger numbers of quantum bits (qubits) and their entanglement.  A key challenge is to integrate improved single and entangled photon and electron sources and detectors into quantum computation and communication networks.  Error correction codes, fault tolerant schemes, and longer decoherence times will address the loss of information.  Expected impacts include highly secure communications, algorithms for optimization in logistics, highly precise measurements of time and position on the earth and in space, and new image and signal processing methods for target tracking.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Fundamentals of Nanoscale and Emergent Effects and Engineered Devices program seeks to understand and exploit physical phenomena for developing more efficient and powerful devices.  This includes developing devices and structures to enable controllable photonic devices at multiple wavelengths, engineering palladium microstructures with large deuterium loadings to study absorption thermodynamics and effects, enabling real-time detection as well as analysis of signals and molecules and origin of emergent behavior in correlated electron devices, and developing stabilization and scale-up methods to fabricate high pressure crystal structures at low pressures.  Arrays of engineered nanoscale devices will result in an order of magnitude (10 to 100 times) reduction in the time required for analysis and identification of known and unknown (engineered) molecules.  This program will develop novel nanomaterials for exquisitely precise purification of materials, enabling such diverse applications as oxygen generation and desalination, ultra-high sensitivity magnetic sensors, and correlated electron effects such as superconductivity.  This program will compare the phenomenology of various biological, physical and social systems and abstract the common features that are responsible for their properties of self-organization, emergent behavior, and physical intelligence.</r2:Description>

For example, one motivating, widespread and currently intractable problem is that of corrosion/materials degradation - a challenge that costs the DoD nearly $23 billion per year and has no near term solution in sight.  Living Foundries offers the potential to program and engineer biology, and enable the capability to design and engineer systems that rapidly and dynamically prevent, seek out, identify and repair corrosion/materials degradation.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling distributed, adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value materials, devices and capabilities in the field or on base.  Such a capability will decrease the DoD's dependence on tenuous material and energy supply chains that could be cut due to political change, targeted attack or environmental accident.   

Living Foundries aims to do for biology what very-large-scale integration (VLSI) did for the semiconductor device industry - i.e. enable the design and engineering of increasingly complex systems to address and enhance military needs and capabilities.  Living Foundries will develop and apply an engineering framework to biology that decouples biological design from fabrication, yields design rules and tools, and manages biological complexity through simplification, abstraction and standardization.  The result will be to enable the design and implementation of complex, higher-order genetic networks with programmable functionality and DoD applicability.  Research thrusts include developing the fundamental tools, capabilities and methodologies to accelerate the biological design-build-test cycle, thereby reducing extensive cost and time it takes to engineer new systems and expanding the complexity and accuracy of designs that can be built.  Specific tools and capabilities include: interoperable tools for design, modeling, and automated fabrication; modular regulatory elements devices and circuits for hierarchical and scalable engineering; standardized test platforms and chassis; and novel approaches to process measurement, validation and debugging.  Applied research for this program continues in FY 2013 in PE 0602715E, project MBT-02.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Cognitive Cloud program combines cloud computing (internet-based utility computing) and crowd-sourcing (large-scale, human-centered networks of web-enabled individuals working towards a unified goal) to create solutions for highly complex military problems.  Examples of such problems include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance of denied areas; modeling foreign societies, governments, and militaries; debugging large, complex software systems; and real-time understanding of activity patterns indicative of imminent cyber-attack.  A social compiler which views people, computer, and network ensembles as elements of a single architecture and enables crowd sourced developers to write social programs in a high-level language would automatically decompose the task and organize, incentivize, and outsource appropriate aspects to peer production.  The resulting social computing systems could be applied both within the military and across larger communities to achieve capabilities ranging from highly responsive development of tactics, techniques, and procedures to open-source intelligence and strategic communications.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Bits to Behavior via Brains (B3) program extends recent work indicating avatar activity in virtual worlds can result in measurable differences in real-world behavior on the part of users.  One example of this observation is an increase in physical exercise undertaken by humans when their virtual avatar begins an exercise regimen.  Understanding the neural mechanisms that govern the transfer of virtual behavior into actual behavior will enable optimization of virtual resources to train and educate soldiers, and could lead to therapeutic and preventative capabilities.  B3 will examine how virtual world interactions influence neural mechanisms of learning (both one-shot and traditional) and executive function (especially judgment).  This will be used to enable designers of virtual worlds to determine the methods and themes that will result in the most effective avatar-based virtual environment for military training and decision making.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly part of Synthetic Biology

The Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program develops technologies to rapidly respond to a disease or threat, and improve individual readiness and total force health protection.  This program utilizes synthetic genetic circuits to control cellular machinery and includes research to optimize orthogonality and modularity of genetic control elements, identify methods to increase sensitivity and specificity, and demonstrate methods to control cellular machinery in response to changes in physiological status.  ADEPT enables the production of RNA-based vaccines, potentially eliminating the time and labor required for traditional manufacture of a vaccine while improving efficacy and safety.  ADEPT also develops methodologies for measuring health-specific biomarkers from a collected biospecimen to enable diagnostics at the point-of-need (similar to home-use settings) or in resource-limited clinical facilities (i.e., point-of-care), in-garrison or deployed.  The ADEPT program continues in FY 2012 in PE 0601117E, Project MED-01.  Applied research for this program is funded in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Basic Operational Medical Science Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Activity because it will explore and develop basic research in medical-related information and technology leading to fundamental discoveries, tools, and applications critical to solving DoD challenges.  Programs in this project address the Department's identified medical gaps in taking care of the warfighter such as blast-induced traumatic brain injury.  Efforts will draw upon the information, computational modeling and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels.  This project will establish a fundamental understanding of brain function, short-term memory and the mechanism(s) of injury induced by exposure to blast.  Basic research that aims at new methods and medical devices includes the ability to perform in-theater, continuous analysis of a warfighter's health as a preventative measure to mitigate widespread disease and development of biomaterials that allow long-term interfaces with neural tissue, electronics that provide sound attenuation and processes to remove harmful bacteria and their toxins in blood to prevent sepsis.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Programs in this project address the Department's identified medical gaps in taking care of the warfighter such as blast-induced traumatic brain injury.  Efforts will draw upon the information, computational modeling and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels.  This project will establish a fundamental understanding of brain function, short-term memory and the mechanism(s) of injury induced by exposure to blast.  Basic research that aims at new methods and medical devices includes the ability to perform in-theater, continuous analysis of a warfighter's health as a preventative measure to mitigate widespread disease and development of biomaterials that allow long-term interfaces with neural tissue, electronics that provide sound attenuation and processes to remove harmful bacteria and their toxins in blood to prevent sepsis.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Human Assisted Neural Devices program will develop the scientific foundation for understanding the language of the brain for application to a variety of emerging DoD challenges, including improving performance on the battlefield and returning active duty military to their units after injury.  This will require an understanding of neuroscience, significant computational efforts, and new material design and implementation.  Key advances expected from this research include determining the nature and means through which short-term memory is encoded, and discovering the mechanisms and dynamics underlying neural computation and reorganization.  These advances will enable memory restoration through the use of devices programmed to bridge gaps in the injured brain.  Further, modeling of the brain will progress to an unprecedented level with this novel approach.</r2:Description>

The Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program will develop the underlying technologies to rapidly respond to a disease or threat, and improve individual readiness and total force health protection by providing centralized laboratory capabilities at non-tertiary care and individual settings.  ADEPT will develop and exploit synthetic biology for the in vivo creation of nucleic acid circuits that continuously and autonomously sense and respond to changes in physiologic state and for novel methods to target delivery, enhance immunogenicity, or control activity of vaccines, potentially eliminating the time to manufacture a vaccine ex vivo.  ADEPT advancements to control cellular machinery include research to optimize orthogonality and modularity of genetic control elements; identify methods to increase sensitivity and specificity; and demonstrate methods to control cellular machinery in response to changes in physiological status.  ADEPT will develop methodologies for measuring health-specific biomarkers from a collected biospecimen to enable diagnostics at the point-of-need or resource limited clinical facilities (point-of-care), in-garrison or deployed.  Additionally, ADEPT will initiate techniques to characterize natural signal transduction pathways, such as electrical and mechanical, that are not conventionally used to guide diagnosis, or as a therapeutic measure.  The signals will be studied in detail and their physiological function validated for measurement and modulation to determine diagnostic and therapeutic benefit.  Applied research efforts are budgeted in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Sepsis, a bacterial infection of the blood stream, is a significant cause of injury and death among combat-injured soldiers.  The goal of this program is to develop a portable device capable of controlling relevant components in the blood volume on clinically relevant time scales.  Reaching this goal is expected to require significant advances in sensing in complex biologic fluids, complex fluid manipulation, separation of components from these fluids, and mathematical descriptions capable of providing predictive control over the closed loop process.  The envisioned device would save the lives of thousands of military patients each year by effectively treating sepsis and associated complications. 

Initial basic research will develop the component technologies that will ultimately make up the integrated device. Included in this effort will be the development of non-fouling, continuous sensors for complex biological fluids; design of high-flow microfluidic structures that do not require the use of anticoagulation; development of intrinsic separation technologies that do not require pathogen specific molecular labels or binding chemistries; and predictive modeling and control (mathematical formalism) with sufficient fidelity to enable agile adaptive closed-loop therapy.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element is budgeted in the applied research budget activity because it will focus on medical related technology, information, processes, materials, systems, and devices encompassing a broad spectrum of DoD challenges.  Biowarfare defense includes the capability to predict and deflect pathogen evolution of natural and engineered emerging threats and therapeutics that increase survivability within days of receipt of an unknown pathogen.  Continued understanding of infection biomarkers will lead to developing a detection device that can be self-administered and provide a faster ability to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater.  Other battlefield technologies includes a soldier-portable hemostatic wound treatment system, capability to manufacture field-relevant pharmaceuticals in theater, and a rapid after-action review of field events as a diagnostic tool for improving the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection.  Improved medical imaging will be approached through new physical properties of cellular metabolic activities.  New neural interface technologies will reliably extract information from the nervous system to enable control of the best robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  To allow medical practitioners the capability to visualize and comprehend the complex relationships across patient data in the electronic medical record systems, technologies will be developed to assimilate and analyze the large amount of data and provide tools to make better informed decisions for patient care.  In the area of medical training, new simulation-based tools will rapidly teach increased competency in an open and scalable architecture to be used by all levels of medical personnel for basic and advanced training.  Advanced information-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare and the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).   This project will also pursue the applied research efforts for dialysis-like therapeutics.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element is budgeted in the applied research budget activity because it will focus on medical related technology, information, processes, materials, systems, and devices encompassing a broad spectrum of DoD challenges.  Biowarfare defense includes the capability to predict and deflect pathogen evolution of natural and engineered emerging threats and therapeutics that increase survivability within days of receipt of an unknown pathogen.  Continued understanding of infection biomarkers will lead to developing a detection device that can be self-administered and provide a faster ability to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater.  Other battlefield technologies includes a soldier-portable hemostatic wound treatment system, capability to manufacture field-relevant pharmaceuticals in theater, and a rapid after-action review of field events as a diagnostic tool for improving the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection.  Improved medical imaging will be approached through new physical properties of cellular metabolic activities.  New neural interface technologies will reliably extract information from the nervous system to enable control of the best robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  To allow medical practitioners the capability to visualize and comprehend the complex relationships across patient data in the electronic medical record systems, technologies will be developed to assimilate and analyze the large amount of data and provide tools to make better informed decisions for patient care.  In the area of medical training, new simulation-based tools will rapidly teach increased competency in an open and scalable architecture to be used by all levels of medical personnel for basic and advanced training.  Advanced information-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare and the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).   This project will also pursue the applied research efforts for dialysis-like therapeutics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This thrust is developing unique and unconventional approaches to ensure that soldiers are protected against a wide variety of naturally occurring, indigenous or engineered threats.  This program will develop approaches to counter any natural or man-made pathogen within one week.  This includes development of countermeasures that do not require prior knowledge of the pathogen and are broadly applicable to multiple unrelated bacterial and/or viral infectious agents.  The integration of academic research programs with pharmaceutical development efforts will result in reducing the traditional drug development cycle timeframe.</r2:Description>

Pathogens are well known for the high rate of mutation that enables them to escape drug therapies and primary or secondary immune responses.  The Pathogen Defeat thrust area will provide capabilities to predict and deflect future threats.  Pathogen Defeat focuses not on the threats that are already known but rather on the threats of newly emerging pathogens and future mutations, allowing pre-emptive preparation of vaccine and therapy countermeasures.</r2:Description>

The overarching goal of the Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program is to increase our ability to rapidly respond to a disease or threat and improve individual readiness and total force health protection by providing centralized laboratory capabilities at non-tertiary care settings.  ADEPT will focus on the development of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)-based vaccines, potentially eliminating the time and labor required for traditional manufacture of a vaccine while at the same time improving efficacy.  ADEPT will also focus on advanced development of key elements for simple-to-operate diagnostic devices.  A companion basic research effort is budgeted in PE 0601117E, Project MED-01.</r2:Description>

The Tactical Biomedical Technologies thrust will develop new approaches to deliver life-saving medical care on the battlefield.  Uncontrolled blood loss is the leading cause of preventable death for soldiers on the battlefield.  While immediate control of hemorrhage is the most effective strategy for treating combat casualties and saving lives, currently no method other than surgical intervention can effectively treat intracavitary bleeding.  A focus in this thrust is the co-development of a materials-based agent(s) and delivery mechanism capable of damaged tissue-targeted hemostasis and wound control.  This system will effectively treat compressible and non-compressible wounds regardless of geometry or location.  Additionally, rapid response to emerging biological threats on the battlefield is impacted by logistical delays of delivering the necessary therapeutics.  Creating a "pharmacy on demand" will enable far-forward medical providers to manufacture and produce small molecule drugs and biologics in order to ensure that the therapeutics are available when they need them.  This project will also develop new algorithms, protocols, and methods to allow registration and comparison of disparate sources of data in biology (across species, experimental systems, hierarchies and populations).</r2:Description>

The Military Medical Imaging thrust will develop medical imaging capabilities to support military missions and operations.  The emergence of advanced medical imaging includes newly recognized physical properties of biological tissue, or metabolic pathway, or physiological function in order to map it into an image of diagnostic utility and performance.  This need is ever increasing as researchers and scientists seek to better understand anatomical, functional and cellular level interactions.  This thrust will also address how to improve the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection by building a simulated environment for rapid after-action review of field events generated from current military systems.  The advanced development of these tools will provide a formidable arsenal of diagnostic tools for warfighter performance and care.</r2:Description>

Wounded warriors with amputated limbs cannot fully exploit recent advances in prosthetic-limb technology because the neural interfaces used to extract limb-control information are low-performance and unreliable.  The goal of the Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program is to develop the technology and systems needed to reliably extract information from the nervous system at the scale and rate necessary to control state-of-the-art high-performance prosthetic limbs.  The program will increase the channel-count (amount information) of reliable peripheral-nervous-system interfaces and increase the operational lifetime (reliability) of central-nervous-system interfaces.  In support of these efforts, the RE-NET program is developing methods to quantitatively assess, model, predict, and accelerate the leading causes of neural interface degradation and failure.  Through this focus on reliability, the RE-NET program will enable clinically relevant technology transitions in support of wounded warriors.</r2:Description>

The goal of this program is to develop a portable device capable of controlling relevant components in the blood volume on clinically relevant time scales.  Reaching this goal is expected to require significant advances in sensing in complex biologic fluids, complex fluid manipulation, separation of components from these fluids, and mathematical descriptions capable of providing predictive control over the closed loop process.  The envisioned device would save the lives of thousands of military patients each year by effectively treating sepsis and associated complications.

Applied research under this program further develops and applies existing component technologies and then integrates these to create a complete blood purification system for use in the treatment of sepsis.  Included in this effort will be development, integration and demonstration of non-fouling, continuous sensors for complex biological fluids; implementation of high-flow microfluidic structures that do not require the use of anticoagulation; application of intrinsic separation technologies that do not require pathogen specific molecular labels or binding chemistries; and refinement of predictive modeling and control (mathematical formalism) with sufficient fidelity to enable agile adaptive closed-loop therapy.

Warrior Web represents an expansion of capability beyond "lightening the load."  Warrior Web's capability space is between biomechanics, robotics, physiology, and combat clothing.  This program will result in technology that reduces the injuries sustained by soldiers.  Allowing soldiers to perform their missions with reduced risk for injuries will have immediate effects on mission readiness, soldier survivability, and mission performance.

Component technologies will be in areas such as regenerative kinetics at joints and energy harvesting to offset power/energy demands; human performance, system, and component modeling; novel materials and dynamic stiffness; actuation; controls and human interface; and power distribution/energy storage.

The Detection and Computational Analysis of Psychological Signals (DCAPS) program will develop automated information systems that identify group and individual trends indicative of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI), anomaly detection algorithms to identify emerging physical and psychological crises, and provide guided access to information and educational materials.  This will complement commercial on-line resources, interactive media, and social networks that supplement traditional healthcare options but have not focused on issues specific to the warfighter.  DCAPS recognizes that security and privacy are critical to user acceptance and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance and so will incorporate strong authentication and other security mechanisms as needed to protect patient data.  The program will also develop partnerships with key DoD organizations working in this area, including the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury, the Defense Medical Research and Development Program, the Army Telemedicine &amp; Advanced Technologies Research Center, and the National Center for TeleHealth and Technology.</r2:Description>

The goal of this thrust is to radically improve the state of the art for upper limb prosthetics, moving them from crude devices with minimal capabilities to fully integrated and functional limb replacements.  Current prosthetic technology generally provides only gross motor functions, with very crude approaches to control.  This makes it difficult for wounded soldiers to re-acquire full functionality and return to military service if so desired.  The advances required to provide fully functional limb replacements will be achieved by an aggressive, milestone driven program combining the talents of scientists from diverse areas including: medicine, neuroscience, orthopedics, engineering, materials science, control and information theory, mathematics, power, manufacturing, rehabilitation, psychology and training.  The results of this program will radically improve the ability of combat amputees to return to normal function.</r2:Description>

Research will create a model that can be directly correlated to the epidemiology and etiology of injury seen in returning warfighters, and attempt to determine the physical and physiological underpinnings and causes of the injury.  The program will combine raw data collected from in-theater blast gauges with medical and event reports to conduct a complete analysis.  As part of the mitigation and treatment strategy, candidate therapeutics are being tested in order to alleviate inflammation from both acute and chronic injury.  This program continues efforts previously funded in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Information and Communications Technology program element is budgeted in the applied research budget activity because it is directed toward the application of advanced, innovative computing systems and communications technologies.  

     The High Productivity, High-Performance Responsive Architectures project is developing the necessary computing hardware and the associated software technology base required to support future critical national security needs for computationally-intensive and data-intensive applications.  These technologies will lead to new multi-generation product lines of commercially viable, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications; it will include supercomputer, embedded computing systems, and novel design tools for manufacturing of defense systems.

     The Information Assurance and Survivability project is developing the technology required to make emerging information system capabilities (such as wireless and mobile code/mobile systems) inherently secure, and to protect DoD's mission-critical systems against attack upon or through the supporting information infrastructure.  These technologies will enable our critical systems to provide continuous correct operation even when they are attacked, and will lead to generations of stronger protection, higher performance, and more cost-effective security and survivability solutions scalable to several thousand sites.  

     The Language Translation project will develop and test powerful new Human Language Technology that will provide critical capabilities for a wide range of national security needs.  This technology will enable systems to a) automatically translate and exploit large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a variety of means; b) to have two-way (foreign-language-to-English and English-to-foreign-language) translation; c) enable automated transcription and translation of foreign speech and text along with content summarization; and d) enable exploitation of captured, foreign language hard-copy documents.

     The Cyber Technology project supports long term national security requirements through the development and demonstration of technology to increase the security of military information systems.  This involves networking, people, platforms, weapons sensors, and decision aids to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.  The results are networked forces that operate with increased speed and synchronization and are capable of achieving massed effects without the physical massing of forces as required in the past.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

One of the major challenges currently facing the DoD is the prohibitively high cost, time, and expertise required to build large complex software systems.  Powerful new approaches and tools are needed to enable the rapid and efficient production of new software, including software that can be easily changed to address new requirements and can adjust dynamically to platform and environmental perturbations.  The project will ensure accessibility and usability to a wide range of application developers, not just computational science experts.

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the META program is to develop novel design flows, tools, and processes to enable a significant improvement in the ability to design complex defense and aerospace systems that are correct-by-construction.  The program seeks to develop a design representation of meta-language and a domain-specific component model library from which system designs can quickly be assembled and their correctness verified with a high degree of certainty.  Such a "fab-less" design approach is complemented by a foundry-style manufacturing capability, consisting of a factory capable of rapid reconfiguration between a large number of products and product variants through bitstream reprogramability, with minimal or no resultant learning curve effects.  Together, the fab-less design and foundry-style manufacturing capability is anticipated to yield substantial---by a factor of five to ten---compression in the time to develop and field complex defense and aerospace systems.

The META effort will also explore the initial design of a next generation ground vehicle by employing a novel, model-based correct-by-construction design capability, a highly-adaptable foundry-style manufacturing capability, and crowd-sourcing methods to demonstrate 5x-10x compression in the timeline necessary to build an infantry fighting vehicle.  Beginning in FY 2012, the specific ground vehicle application work will be funded in PE 0602702E, Project TT-04, Advanced Land Systems.</r2:Description>

The warfighting problem this program will solve is the inability to process future real time data streams.  This is a challenge for embedded applications, from Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems on unmanned air vehicles through combat and control systems on submarines.  The PERFECT program will overcome processing power efficiency limitations using threshold voltage operation, massive and heterogeneous processing concurrency, new architecture concepts, hardware and software approaches to address system resiliency, combined with software approaches to effectively utilize resulting system concurrency to provide the required embedded system processing power efficiency.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Military Critical Clouds (MCC) program will bring the advantages of the cloud computing paradigm to mission-critical military applications and combat systems.  The advantages of cloud computing have been demonstrated in civilian and Government applications to include the efficient utilization of computing resources, enabling deployed systems to be upgraded in the field, and reduced recurring and non-recurring costs.  With cloud computing, myriad one-of-a-kind, single platform specific processing implementations are eliminated and replaced with application effective computing on common hardware.  To date, the cloud computing paradigm has not been effectively exploited in embedded military applications, for reasons related to performance and correctness constraints.  In order to apply the cloud paradigm to military systems, MCC will make significant advances in the areas of virtualization, real-time responsiveness, reliability and verifiability, and security, while taking advantage of the cloud computing paradigm's inherent cost efficiency, manufacturing agility, maintainability, and programming democratization.  Fully realizing these capabilities will open the door to "platform clouds" that provide dramatically improved effectiveness in our military combat systems.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The U.S. military now consumes only approximately one percent of the total integrated circuit (IC) production in the world and increasingly relies on foreign foundry and supplier sources for ICs used within its systems.  Given the relatively low consumption, the U.S. military IC requirements are not a factor that can influence IC production or the assurance that parts are delivered as specified.  With the majority of ICs used in modern military systems fabricated offshore, this situation presents a potential future risk that the parts acquired will not operate only in the specified manner.  The objective of the Integrity and Reliability of Integrated CircuitS (IRIS) program is to develop the technology to derive the functionality of an IC to determine unambiguously if malicious modifications have been made to that IC, and to accurately determine the IC's useful lifespan from a physical perspective.  The IRIS program will develop nondestructive scientifically based techniques for full functionality identification and functionality modification detection for ICs utilized in military systems.  In addition, the IRIS program will develop innovative test technologies and processes that can determine an IC's useful lifespan based on a significantly reduced number of samples.  Once developed, the resulting technologies may be deployed to Government or appropriate organizations that can provide critical IC functionality and reliability inspection services to the DoD, thereby ensuring that a scientific means is available to determine functionality and reliability in the various ICs deployed in DoD systems.</r2:Description>

The Cyber Fast Track program will create more flexible, responsive methods for securing computing systems that operate in challenging environments and will reduce security risk without requiring lengthy development cycles.  Under Cyber Fast Track, small agile teams will work under rapid development cycles to create cyber-security applications responsive to pop-up threats identified by DoD.  This is in contrast to the current commercial security paradigm of large, highly complex, security systems that add layer upon layer of functionality and that, in themselves, are difficult to maintain and are vulnerable to attack.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Clean-slate design of Resilient, Adaptive, Secure Hosts (CRASH) program will develop cyber security technologies using the mechanisms of biological systems as inspiration for radically re-thinking basic hardware and system designs.  Higher level organisms have two distinct immune systems: the innate system is fast and deadly but is only effective against a fixed set of pathogens; the adaptive system is slower, but can learn to recognize novel pathogens.  Similarly, CRASH will develop mechanisms at the hardware and operating system level that eliminate known vulnerabilities exploited by attackers.  However, because novel attacks will be developed, CRASH will also develop software techniques that allow a computer system to defend itself, to maintain its capabilities, and even heal itself.  Finally, biological systems show that diversity is an effective population defense; CRASH will develop techniques that make each computer system appear unique to the attacker and allow each system to change over time.</r2:Description>

SAFER creates automated processes and technologies enabling military users to send and receive content on the Internet, utilizing commercially available hardware and software, in ways that avoid efforts to deny, locate, or corrupt communications.  SAFER is also developing technology for performing computations on encrypted data without decrypting it first through fully homomorphic encryption and interactive, secure multi-party computation schemes.  This will enable, for example, the capability to encrypt queries and to create an encrypted search result without decrypting the query.  This technology will advance the ability to run programs on untrusted hardware while keeping programs, data, and results encrypted and confidential.  This mitigates the important aspect of supply chain compromise.</r2:Description>

The High Assurance Cyber Military Systems program will develop and demonstrate the technologies required to secure mission-critical embedded computing systems.  The DoD is making increasing use of networked computing in systems such as military vehicles, weapon systems, ground sensors, smartphones, personal digital assistants, and other communication devices.  This dependence makes it critically important that the embedded operating system provides high levels of inherent assurance.  This operating system must also integrate the computational, physical, and networking elements of the system while running on a processor with very limited size, weight, and power.  Consequently, it can only devote a limited share of its computational resources to security while satisfying hard real-time constraints.  Recent advances in program synthesis, formal verification techniques, low-level and domain-specific programming languages, and operating systems mean that fully verified operating systems for embedded devices may be within reach at reasonable costs.  Systems that admit static verification can provide both high assurance and high performance to avoid the many dynamic checks otherwise necessary to provide high assurance.  The program will develop, mature, and integrate these technologies to produce an embedded computing platform that provides a high level of assurance for mission-critical military applications.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are physical and engineered systems that integrate computing, communication, and storage capabilities with monitoring and/or control of entities in the physical world.  CPSs are at the core of all modern weapons systems, critical infrastructure, transportation, and manufacturing environments.  Due to the real-time and mission-critical nature of these systems, past and present CPS designs have focused on safety and performance with little-to-no emphasis given to resilience or assurance in the context of malicious intent.  This leaves these systems vulnerable to exploitation and attack.  The Cyber-Physical Assurance and Resiliency (CYPHAR) program will develop the scientific foundations that enable the design and implementation of fundamentally or highly secure systems that are capable of maintaining state awareness and an accepted level of operation in the presence of CPS threats.  Scientific developments will include the definition of measures, metrics, and algorithms needed to optimize the security, safety, and performance of next generation CPS designs and will also allow for the holistic assessment of current systems in a quantitative manner.  This program will develop technologies to provide provably secure protection mechanisms needed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of system resources to support the design, testing, and implementation of highly assured and resilient CPSs.</r2:Description>

These network-based functions support the real-time, fast-reaction operations of senior leadership, major commands and field units.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Intrinsically Assured Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (IAMANET)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Intrinsically Assured Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (IAMANET) program completed a series of successful research programs to design a tactical wireless network that is secure and resilient to a broad range of threats which include cyber attacks, electronic warfare and malicious insiders (or captured/compromised radios).  Previous programs included the Dynamic Quarantine of Computer-Based Worms (DQW) and Defense Against Cyber Attacks on Mobile Ad-hoc Network Systems (DCAMANET). 

IAMANET built upon the successes achieved in both the DQW and the DCMANET programs.  IAMANET directly supports the integrity, availability, reliability, confidentiality, and safety of Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) communications and data.  In contrast, the dominant Internet paradigm is intrinsically insecure.  For example, the Internet does not deny unauthorized traffic by default and therefore violates the principle of least privilege.  In addition, there are no provisions for non-repudiation or accountability and therefore adversaries can probe for vulnerabilities with impunity because the likelihood of attributing bad behavior to an adversary is limited.  Current protocols are not robust to purposely induced failures and malicious behavior, leaving entire Internet-based systems vulnerable in the case of defensive failure.  IAMANET, on the other hand, uses a deny-by-default networking paradigm, allowing only identifiable authorized users to communicate on the network.  While the objective transition path for IAMANET technologies is to the Services to support mobile tactical operations, the IAMANET systems are interoperable with fixed networks and may also have potential applicability to the broader DoD network architecture.</r2:Description>

The program focuses on identifying ongoing adversary missions rather than a person, program, or particular piece of malware.  Current cyber defenses are primarily based on network and host intrusion detection and look for "break-ins" and abnormal behavior without context.  The CINDER program is building tools and techniques that apply mission templates of advanced cyber espionage onto seemingly normal internal system and network activity.  Through this, CINDER will uncover ongoing advanced persistent cyber threats and espionage that exist within our own cyber environments.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is developing powerful new technologies for processing foreign languages that will provide critical capabilities for a wide range of military and national security needs, both tactical and strategic.  The technologies and systems developed in this project will enable our military to automatically translate and exploit large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a variety of means.  Current U.S. military operations involve close contact with a wide range of cultures and peoples.  The warfighter on the ground needs hand-held, speech-to-speech translation systems that enable communication with the local population during tactical missions.  Such tactical applications imply the need for two-way (foreign-language-to-English and English-to-foreign-language) translation.  Because foreign-language news broadcasts, web-posted content, and captured foreign-language hard-copy documents can provide insights regarding local and regional events, attitudes, and activities, language translation systems also contribute to the development of good strategic intelligence.  Such strategic applications require one-way (foreign-language-to-English) translation.  Exploitation of the resulting translated content requires the capability to automatically collate, filter, synthesize, summarize, and present relevant information in near real-time.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Robust Automatic Translation of Speech (RATS)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Robust Automatic Transcription of Speech (RATS) program addresses conditions in which speech signals are degraded by distortion, reverberation, and/or competing conversation.  Robust speech processing technologies will enable soldiers to hear or read clear English versions of what is being said in their vicinity, despite a noisy or reverberant environment.  RATS technology will isolate and deliver pertinent information to the warfighter by detecting periods of speech activity and discarding silent portions, determining the language spoken, identifying the speaker, and recognizing key words in challenging environments.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Multilingual Automatic Document Classification, Analysis and Translation (MADCAT) program will develop and integrate technology to enable exploitation of foreign language, hand-written documents.  This technology is crucial to the warfighter, as documents including notebooks, letters, ledgers, annotated maps, newspapers, newsletters, leaflets, pictures of graffiti, and document images captured in the field may contain extremely important time-sensitive information.  The MADCAT program will address this need by producing devices that will convert such captured documents from Arabic into readable English in the field.  MADCAT will substantially improve applicable technologies, in particular document analysis and optical character recognition/optical handwriting recognition.  MADCAT will tightly integrate these improved technologies with translation technology and create prototypes for field trials.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Cyber Technology project supports long term national security requirements through the development and demonstration of technology to increase the security of military information systems.  Over the past decade the DoD has embraced net-centric warfare to enable geographically dispersed forces to attain a high level of shared battlespace awareness that is exploited to achieve strategic, operational, and tactical objectives.  This involves networking people, platforms, weapons, sensors, and decision aids to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.  Adversaries seek to limit this force multiplier effect through cyber attacks intended to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  These cyber attacks often aim to exploit vulnerabilities and defects in military software systems.  Technologies developed under the Cyber Technology project will ensure DoD cyber-capabilities survive adversary cyber attacks.  Promising technologies will transition to system-level projects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This includes intelligence preparation of the cyber battlespace, indications and warning of adversary actions, detection of attack onset, attacker identification, and cyber battle damage assessment.  Cyber situational awareness is made difficult by the efforts of attackers to elude detection.  Approaches to cyber situational awareness will include forensic techniques to exploit data derived from events on hosts and networks that might appear innocuous when examined in isolation but reveal patterns indicative of a threat when correlated in time and space across an enterprise.  CSA will also create new graphical interfaces that enable intuitive visualization of events on hosts and networks to aid in the detection of cyber attacks.  This is an area where metrics are difficult to obtain, and so CSA will extend operationally-meaningful measures such as mean-time-to-detect and false-alarm rate to estimate the efficacy of proposed schemes.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Cyber Camouflage, Concealment, and Deception (C3D) program will develop novel approaches for protecting cyber systems that mimic camouflage, concealment, and deception in the physical world.  These will make attackers expend more resources to achieve their goals and provide an asymmetric advantage for the defender.  C3D will enable the creation, deployment, management, and control of synthetic entities, objects, resources, and identities that produce uncertainties for attackers and make their task significantly more difficult, perhaps even intractable.  With C3D, infrastructure and other enterprise resources such as switches, servers, and storage could be virtually replicated to confound enemy targeting.  Decoy file systems could confuse attackers thereby greatly decreasing their odds for success.</r2:Description>

The Crowd-Sourced Formal Verification (CSFV) program will develop technologies and tools to enable private citizens to participate in securing cyberspace.  Private citizens already collaborate on cyber-defense through participative media dedicated to issues such as diagnosing problems on networks and remediating the effects of malware on commercial systems.  CSFV will create technologies that enable crowd-sourced approaches to securing software systems through formal verification.  Formal software verification is a rigorous method for proving that software has specified properties, but formal verification does not currently scale to the size of software found in modern weapon systems.  CSFV will enable non-specialists to participate productively in the formal verification process by transforming formal verification problems into games that are intuitively understandable.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Cognitive Computing Systems program element is budgeted in the Applied Research budget activity because it is developing the next revolution in computing and information processing technology that will enable computational systems to have reasoning and learning capabilities and levels of autonomy far beyond those of today's systems.  The ability to reason, learn and adapt will raise computing to new levels of capability and powerful new applications. 

The Cognitive Computing project will develop core technologies that enable computing systems to learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience, and respond intelligently to things that have not been previously encountered.  These technologies will lead to systems demonstrating increased self-reliance, self-adaptive reconfiguration, intelligent negotiation, cooperative behavior and survivability with reduced human intervention.

The Collective Cognitive Systems and Interfaces project will dramatically improve warfighter and commander effectiveness and productivity using advanced cognitive approaches that enable faster, better informed, and more highly coordinated actions than those of our enemies.  This will be accomplished by developing revolutionary methods that increase our information processing capabilities, enhance our situational awareness, and enable more cohesive group action by our forces.  Critical technical areas addressed in this project include automated coordinated decision support, information sharing, and ensured communications.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Cognitive Computing project will develop core technologies that enable computing systems to learn and apply knowledge gained through experience, and to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events.  These technologies will lead to systems with increased self-reliance, cooperative behavior, and the capacity to reconfigure themselves and survive with reduced programmer intervention.  These capabilities will make the difference between mission success and mission degradation or failure, even in the event of cyber-attack or component attrition resulting from kinetic warfare or accidental faults and errors.  Systems that learn and reason will reduce the requirement for skilled system administrators and dramatically reduce the overall cost of system maintenance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Autonomous Robotic Manipulation (ARM)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Autonomous Robotic Manipulation (ARM) program is developing advanced robotic technologies that will enable autonomous (unmanned) mobile platforms to manipulate objects without human control or intervention.  A key objective is intelligent control of manipulators to independently perform subtasks over a broad range of domains of interest to the warfighter, thereby reducing operator workload, time on target, training time, bandwidth, and hardware complexity.  Current manipulation systems have many limitations.  For example, while they perform well in certain mission environments, they have yet to demonstrate proficiency and flexibility across multiple mission environments; they require burdensome human interaction and the full attention of the operator; and the time required to complete tasks generally exceeds military users' desires.  ARM will create manipulators with a high degree of autonomy capable of serving multiple military purposes across a wide variety of application domains including, but not limited to, counter-improvised explosive device, countermine, search and rescue, weapons support, checkpoint and access control, explosive ordnance disposal, and combat casualty care (including battlefield extraction).  ARM will enable autonomous manipulation systems to surpass the performance level of remote manipulation systems that are controlled directly by a human operator.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Collective Cognitive Systems and Interfaces project will dramatically improve warfighter and commander effectiveness and productivity using advanced cognitive approaches that enable faster, better informed, and more highly coordinated actions than those of our enemies.  This will be accomplished by developing revolutionary methods that increase our information processing capabilities, enhance our situational awareness, and enable more cohesive group action by our forces.  Critical technical areas addressed in this project include automated decision support, information sharing, ensured communications, and advanced informatics.  Cognitive decision support tools reason about tasks, timings, and interactions so that when plans change or the enemy does not respond as anticipated, U.S. forces can quickly adapt.  The quality of such decisions and the effectiveness of our actions depend critically on our ability to take full advantage of all available information in a rapid and flexible manner.  This requires the capability to share information and to automatically integrate distributed information bases for broad tactical battlespace awareness.  Finally, the use of advanced informatics will help guide user's to information most relevant to them, assist caregivers with treatment, destigmatize the psychological health process, and help alert DoD to emerging psychological health trends and crises.  The suite of programs under this project will significantly advance the military's ability to successfully deal with complex situations in operational environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Additionally, appropriate middleware services and libraries will be developed to facilitate shared capabilities such as map viewing, apps management, and collection of logs, usage statistics and user feedback.  Apps, together with handhelds and networks, will be tested in different training environments as well as in deployed environments.  Performance and usage will be carefully tracked and user feedback collected to guide rapid enhancement of apps.  The effort will create a military apps development community by reaching out to non-traditional performers and will explore new models for software acquisition based on end-user empowerment.

                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Healing Heroes - Medical

The Detection and Computational Analysis of Psychological Signals (DCAPS) program will develop automated information systems that identify group and individual trends indicative of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI), anomaly detection algorithms to identify emerging physical and psychological crises, and provide guided access to information and educational materials.  This will complement commercial on-line resources, interactive media, and social networks that supplement traditional healthcare options but have not focused on issues specific to the warfighter.  DCAPS recognizes that security and privacy are critical to user acceptance and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance and so will incorporate strong authentication and other security mechanisms as needed to protect patient data.  The program will also develop partnerships with key DoD organizations working in this area, including the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury, the Defense Medical Research and Development Program, the Army Telemedicine &amp; Advanced Technologies Research Center, and the National Center for TeleHealth and Technology.  This effort will be funded in PE 0602115E, Biomedical Technology beginning in FY 2013.</r2:Description>

GUARD DOG will consist of two segments: a handheld/portable digital assistant to support dismounted soldiers patrolling neighborhoods and villages; and a laptop/desktop computer system that integrates data from multiple patrols and supports battalion/brigade-level analysts.  GUARD DOG will provide automated support for the collect-update-analyze-prioritize process by supporting data collection and advanced analytics to evaluate the current local/regional situation, identify gaps in the knowledge base, and generate information requirements.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Advanced Soldier Sensor Information System and Technology (ASSIST) program developed an integrated information system that exploits soldier-worn sensors to augment the soldier's ability to capture, report, and share information in the field.  This includes an integrated system using advanced technologies for processing, digitizing and analyzing information captured and collected by soldier-worn sensors.  ASSIST drew heavily on the experiences and lessons learned from previous Operation Iraqi Freedom missions and other surveillance and reconnaissance missions.  A baseline system demonstrated the capture of video/still images together with voice annotations and location-stamping.  The advanced system demonstrated automatic identification and extraction of key objects, events, activities and scenes from soldier-collected data.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Machine Reading and Reasoning Technology program will develop enabling technologies to acquire, integrate, and use high performance reasoning strategies in knowledge-rich domains.  Such technologies will provide DoD decision makers with rapid, relevant knowledge from a broad spectrum of sources that may be dynamic and/or inconsistent.  To address the significant challenges of context, temporal information, complex belief structures, and uncertainty, new capabilities are needed to extract key information and metadata, and to exploit these via context-capable search and inference.  Cognitive inference has traditionally emphasized deduction via theorem-proving and induction via statistical techniques, but abduction - also known as "inference to the best explanation"- is also likely to play a large role.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Previously Web-Scale Information Integration

The Visual Media Reasoning (VMR) program will create technologies to automate the analysis of enemy-recorded photos and videos and identify, within minutes, key information related to the content.  Such identification will include the names of individuals within the image (who), the enumeration of the objects within the image and their attributes (what), and the image's geospatial location and time frame (where and when).  Large data stores of enemy photos and video are available but cannot be easily leveraged by a warfighter or analyst attempting to understand a specific new image.  The VMR program will enable users to gain insights rapidly through application of highly parallelized image analysis techniques that can process the imagery in massive federated image stores.  VMR technology will serve as a force-multiplier by rapidly and automatically extracting tactically relevant information for the human analyst and alerting the analyst to scenes that warrant the analyst's expert attention.  This effort will be funded in PE 0602702E, Project TT-13 beginning in FY 2013.</r2:Description>

This project funds programs supporting revolutionary new approaches to biological warfare (BW) defense and is synergistic with efforts of other Government organizations.

Efforts to counter the BW threat include countermeasures to stop pathophysiologic consequences of biological or chemical attack, host immune response enhancers, medical diagnostics for the most virulent pathogens and their molecular mechanisms, collection of atmospheric trace constituents to support chemical mapping, tactical and strategic biological and chemical sensors, and integrated defensive systems.  This program also includes development of a unique set of platform technologies and medical countermeasures synthesis that will dramatically decrease the timeline from military threat detection to countermeasure availability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This thrust is developing unique and unconventional approaches to ensure that soldiers are protected against a wide variety of naturally occurring, indigenous or engineered threats.  Past successes in this effort have come from developing therapeutics that are designed to work against broad classes of pathogens.  Work in this area has also uncovered new approaches to therapeutics that, rather than attacking specific pathogens, enhance innate human immune mechanisms against broad classes of pathogens.  Integral to these efforts is the development of methods that rapidly identify a broad spectrum of pathogens.  Not only will these approaches be more effective against known pathogens, they also promise to offer substantial protection against unknown pathogens including engineered and emerging pathogens from third-world environments.

A current emphasis is on the discovery and development of technologies that will allow a rapid response (within weeks) to unanticipated threats, whether they are naturally encountered emerging diseases or agents from intentional attack.  This thrust has a goal of radically transforming the protein design process by researching and developing new mathematical and biochemical approaches to the in silico design of proteins with specific functions.  This significantly decreases the time needed and increases the probability of success for biological warfare vaccine development.  An additional focus is the development of entirely new technologies that will allow the rapid, cost-effective manufacture of complex therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies and vaccine antigens; these technologies will reduce the time for biologics manufacture from years (or even decades) to only weeks.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because it supports the advancement of concepts and technologies to enhance the next generation of tactical systems.  The Tactical Technology program element funds a number of projects in the areas of Naval Warfare, Advanced Land Systems, Advanced Tactical Technology, Aeronautics Technology and Network Centric Enabling technologies.

The Naval Warfare Technology project develops advanced enabling technologies for a broad range of naval requirements.  Technologies under development will increase survivability and operational effectiveness of small and medium surface vessels in rough seas and demonstrate advanced technologies for hypersonic flight.  New areas to be investigated include ship self defense techniques, novel underwater propulsion modalities, vessels for estuary and riverine operations and unmanned sea vehicles for anti-submarine warfare.

The Advanced Land Systems project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations.  The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that will enhance the military's effectiveness while decreasing the exposure of U.S. or allied forces to enemy fire.  Advanced manufacturing demonstration activities are also funded.

The Advanced Tactical Technology project is exploring the application of compact and solid state lasers; high performance computational algorithms to enhance signal processing, target recognition and tracking, electromagnetic propagation, and processing of advanced materials and microelectronics; precision optics components for critical DoD applications; aerospace electronic warfare systems; new tactical systems for enhanced air vehicle survivability, advanced airbreathing weapons, and enabling technologies for advanced space systems; and Training Superiority programs that will create revolutionary new training techniques.

The Aeronautics Technology project explores technologies to reduce costs associated with advanced aeronautical systems and provide revolutionary new capabilities for current and projected military mission requirements. This project funds development of a hybrid ground/air vehicle, an advanced helicopter rotor capable of being optimized for each mission, and robust study efforts.

The Network Centric Enabling Technology project funds sensor, signal processing, detection, tracking and target identification technology development required for true network-centric tactical operations.  Technologies developed in this project will enable localized, distributed and cross-platform collaborative processing so that networks of sensors can rapidly adapt to changing force mixes, predictive modeling tools to evaluate failing nation states and identify potential hot spots, and social networking approaches to identify and track potential terrorist cells.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) program has three primary goals: (1) to build and demonstrate an experimental unmanned vessel with beyond state-of-the-art platform performance based on clean sheet design for unmanned operation, (2) demonstrate the technical viability of operating autonomous unmanned ships at theater or global ranges under a sparse remote supervisory control model, and (3) leverage unique ACTUV characteristics to transition a game changing ASW capability to the Navy.  By establishing the premise that a human is never intended to step on board at any point in the operational cycle, ACTUV concepts can take advantage of an unexplored design space that eliminates or modifies conventional ship design constraints such as internal arrangement, reserve buoyancy, and dynamic stability in order to achieve disproportionate speed, endurance, and payload fraction.  The resulting unmanned naval vessels must possess sufficient situational awareness and autonomous behavior capability to operate in full compliance with the rules of the road and maritime law to support safe navigation for operational deployments spanning thousands of miles and months of time.  When coupled with innovative sensor technologies, the ACTUV system provides a low cost unmanned system with a fundamentally different operational risk calculus that enables game changing capability to detect and track even the quietest diesel electric submarine threats.  Key technical areas include unmanned naval vessel design methodologies, ship system reliability, high fidelity sensor fusion to provide an accurate world model for autonomous operation, novel application of sensors for ASW tracking, and holistic system integration due to unique optimization opportunities of the ACTUV system.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Tactically Expandable Maritime Platform (TEMP) concept, an outgrowth of the ACTUV program, seeks to develop and demonstrate macroscopic integrated systems built up from International Organization for Standardization (ISO) modular technologies that can be operated from unmodified commercial container ships and deliver credible naval capability for high priority missions.  TEMP will develop critical enabling modular technologies and evaluate the feasible range of naval missions that can be serviced from this highly flexible and cost effective unconventional force structure model.  An initial mission to be explored will be the modular sea depot concept to enable a remote unmonitored refueling capability for small craft; enabling independent operation from host ships.  TEMP will also evaluate a Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA/DR) mission, engineering a modular first responder capability that allows the rapid force closure capability of TEMP to deliver immediate lifesaving operations in the hours and days following a disaster event, prior to the time that conventional platforms and organizations are able to respond.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Sea Change is a portfolio of disruptive approaches to critical operational challenges in the maritime domain.  The goal of the Sea Change program is to develop integrated system technologies that offer fundamentally new capabilities to address long-standing operational limitations of naval forces.  Sea Change focus areas include platform concepts to increase operational capability and efficiency of maritime systems and development of standoff technologies for rapid defeat of anti-access mines through a hydroacoustic anti-mine array.  The hydroacoustic anti-mine array effort will explore the technical feasibility of a novel mine clearance approach using coordinated high energy density acoustic sources to deliver standoff clearance of mines throughout the water column and on the ocean bottom.  By eliminating all explosive neutralizers and maintaining effectiveness with uncertain mine identification and location, the hydroacoustic anti-mine array concept has the potential to achieve dramatic reductions in area mine clearance timelines.</r2:Description>

Due to retreating Arctic ice in the coming decades there is an expectation for increased shipping traffic during the summer months, and increased interest in exploiting natural resources along the Arctic continental shelf.  Given the unique physical challenges and stressful environmental conditions, Arctic operations today are mainly limited to expeditions requiring specialized platforms, support infrastructure, and preparation.  This program will exploit unique physical attributes and emergent environmental trends in the Arctic to create surprising new capabilities, and will develop technologies for persistent and affordable sensing and communication both above and below the ice to ensure responsive operations.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Super-Fast Submerged Transport (Underwater Express) program explored the application of supercavitation technology to underwater vehicles, enabling high speed transport of personnel and/or supplies.  The inherent advantages of traveling underwater are: the ability to transit undetected, no radar or visible signature, and avoidance of rough sea conditions that may limit or deny mission execution.  Supercavitation places the vehicle inside a cavity where vapor replaces the water, and drag due to fluid viscosity is reduced by orders of magnitude, thus reducing the power requirement dramatically.  This program used modeling, simulation, experiments and testing to develop the understanding of the physical phenomena associated with supercavitation and the application to underwater vehicles.  The program culminated in an at-sea demonstration of a scaled vehicle.</r2:Description>

The program investigated new approaches which exploit special acoustic phenomena and techniques, through advanced active sonar signal processing to achieve advanced active sonar.

                                    <r2:Description>The goals of the Fast, Adaptable, Next-Generation Ground Combat Vehicle (FANG) program are to employ a novel, model-based correct-by-construction design capability, a highly-adaptable foundry-style manufacturing capability, and crowd-sourcing design methods to demonstrate 5X-10X compression in the timeline necessary to build an infantry fighting vehicle.  The program seeks to create an open-source development infrastructure for the aggregation of designer inputs applicable to complex electromechanical systems as well as software, and to exercise this infrastructure with a series of design challenges, leading to prize awards and builds of winning designs in a foundry-style, rapidly configurable manufacturing facility.  The design challenges will culminate in a complete build of a next generation infantry fighting vehicle to a requirements set loosely analogous to an existing program of record -but executed on a roughly one-year timescale.  Additionally, the program will pursue an explicit outreach activity to high school-age students to teach the principles of model-based design and distributed foundry-style manufacturing to build a next-generation cadre of manufacturing innovators.  Initial ground vehicle design work is funded under the META program in PE 0602303E, Project IT-02.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Key advancements in telepresence and remote operation of ground systems are being made towards the ultimate goal of developing remotely operated robotic systems that can operate in dismounted environments.  In order to demonstrate the utility of bi-pedal machines on real missions and accelerate their development, the synergistic partnership between machine and operator must be leveraged.  The Avatar program will develop interfaces and algorithms to enable a soldier to effectively partner with a semi-autonomous bi-pedal machine and allow it to act as the soldier's surrogate.  Once developed, Avatar will allow soldiers to remain out of harm's way while still leveraging their experience and strengths to complete important missions such as sentry/perimeter control, room clearing, combat casualty recovery, and, eventually, dismounted combat maneuver.  Anticipated service users include the Army, Marines and Special Forces.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Based on promising results obtained under the Crosshairs program, the C-Sniper effort will develop the capability to detect and neutralize enemy snipers before they can engage U.S. Forces.  The program will deliver a field testable prototype suitable for experimentation on a compatible vehicle such as the Stryker.  The C-Sniper system will identify threats before they can fire.  Enemy snipers may be operating both with and without telescopic sights and other optical systems in highly cluttered urban environments.  The C-Sniper system will operate day and night from a static or mobile military vehicle and will provide the operator with sufficient information to make a timely engagement decision.  Once a decision is made, the C-Sniper will provide data and control to point and track the on-board weapon to the selected target.  The final decision to fire the weapon will be left to the operator.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Crosshairs program developed a vehicle mounted threat detection and countermeasure system that detected, located, and engages enemy shooters against a variety of threats to include bullets, Rocket Propelled Grenades (RPGs), Anti-Tank Guided Missiles, and direct fired mortars, both stationary and on the move.  Threat identification and localization is accomplished in sufficient time to enable both automatic and man-in-the-loop responses.  Phase I of the program focused on initial development and testing of the Crosshairs sensor system.  Phase IA culminated with a static live fire test to determine the most effective candidate sensor system.  During Phase IB, enhancements were made to the sensor system for on the move performance, and on the move testing against multiple threats was conducted.  DARPA and the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) entered into an MOA for Phase IIA.  Phase IIA consisted of a moving demonstration of the hardened, packaged, and enhanced Phase I sensor system on two networked HMMWVs, integration with candidate response systems, and testing and evaluation of the complete systems in relevant environments.  In Phase IIB, the Crosshairs sensor system was integrated with the Iron Curtain Active Protection System (IC-APS) on four up-armored vehicles.

DARPA worked with the Army REF and the Project Manager Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles to validate the capabilities and initiate transition to combat forces.</r2:Description>

Successful candidates have been installed on vehicles for evaluation in an operational context.

                                    <r2:Description>The Excalibur program will develop high-power electronically-steerable optical arrays, with each array element powered by a fiber laser amplifier.  These fiber-laser arrays will be sufficiently lightweight, compact, and electrically efficient to be fielded on a variety of platforms with minimal impact to the platform's original mission capabilities.  Each array element will possess an adaptive-optic capability to minimize beam divergence in the presence of atmospheric turbulence, together with wide-field-of-view beam steering for target tracking.  With each Excalibur array element powered by high power fiber laser amplifiers (at up to 3 kilowatts (kW) per amplifier), high power air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements will be enabled that were previously infeasible because of laser system size and weight.  In addition, this program will also develop kilowatt-class arrays of diode lasers which will provide an alternate route to efficiently reaching mission-relevant power levels, and they will test the ultimate scalability of the optical phased array architecture.  Excalibur arrays will be conformal to aircraft surfaces and scalable in size and power by adding elements to the array.  By defending airborne platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles against proliferated, deployed, and next-generation man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), Excalibur will enable these reconnaissance platforms to fly at lower altitude and obtain truly persistent, all-weather ground reconnaissance despite low-lying cloud cover.  Proliferated and emerging threats will be evaluated for the potential of developing a near-term capability utilizing a single high-power fiber laser amplifier.  Further capabilities include multichannel laser communications, target identification, tracking, designation, precision defeat with minimal collateral effects as well as other applications.

The Excalibur Budget Activity 2 program will develop the core set of laser components for efficiently driving elements of high-power electronically steerable optical arrays, namely, high-power coherently- and spectrally-combinable fiber laser amplifiers, high-brightness laser diodes for efficiently pumping the fiber laser amplifiers, and kW-class single-mode laser diode arrays.  In addition, advanced techniques (packaging, thermal and power management, beam control, target tracking, etc.) will be developed for light-weight (300-500 lb), high power (3 kW - 10 kW) fiber-laser based and podded High Energy Laser Countermeasure (HELCM) systems enabling near-term options for low-altitude self-defense against MANPADS.  The vulnerabilities of MANPADS and their potential to incorporate counter-countermeasures to HELCM systems will also be measured and assessed.  These techniques and measurements will be designed to work in tandem with and to support the HELCM prototype subsystems developed under the Budget Activity 3 Excalibur program in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.

The Excalibur Budget Activity 2 program will also conduct several analytical studies relevant to scaling and applications of high-efficiency (30% - 40% wall plug efficient) high power electric lasers, that will examine: the potential to scale the output power of diode pumped alkali lasers (DPALs) to tactical and strategic levels (100's kW - MW class); the potential for integrating low-cost, high-sensitivity, wide-field-of-view imaging seekers and directional acoustic cueing into extended-altitude MANPADS; and the potential to use high power fiber lasers for long range target identification and tracking.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System (HELLADS) program is to develop a high-energy laser weapon system (150 kW) with an order of magnitude reduction in weight compared to existing laser systems.  With a weight goal of &lt;5 kg/kW, HELLADS will enable high energy lasers (HELs) to be integrated onto tactical aircraft, and will significantly increase engagement ranges compared to ground-based systems, enabling high precision, low collateral damage, and rapid engagement of fleeting targets for both offensive and defensive missions.  The HELLADS program has completed the design and demonstration of a revolutionary prototype unit cell laser module.  That unit cell demonstrated power output and is demonstrating optical wavefront performance that supports the goal of a lightweight and compact 150 kW high energy tactical laser weapon system.  Two unit cell module designs with integrated power and thermal management systems were fabricated and tested; they demonstrated an output power exceeding 34 kW.  Based on the results of the unit cell demonstration, additional laser modules will be replicated and connected to produce a 150 kW laser that will be demonstrated in a laboratory environment.  The 150 kW laser will then be integrated with beam control, prime power, thermal management, safety, and command and control subsystems all based upon existing technologies to produce a ground-based laser weapon system field demonstrator.  The capability to shoot down tactical targets such as surface-to-air missiles and rockets and the capability to perform ultra-precise offensive engagements will be demonstrated in a realistic ground test environment.  Additional funding for this integration effort will be provided for HELLADS testing in Project NET-01, PE 0603766E.  The HELLADS laser will then be transitioned to a tactical platform for performance demonstration of ground, sea, or airborne precision engagements.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Aero-Adaptive/Aero-Optic Beam Control (ABC) program is to improve the performance of high-energy lasers on tactical aircraft, against targets in the aft field-of-regard.  In order to achieve a large field-of-regard, current optical turret designs protrude into the flow.  This causes severe optical distortions in the aft field-of-regard due to turbulence in the wake and the unsteady shock movement over the aperture.  These distortions decrease the power flux on target (the measure of lethality for a directed energy system) and consequently limit the utility of directed energy systems to targets in the forward field-of-regard.  This program will optimize flow control strategies for pointing angles in the aft field-of-regard.  The program will also explore the ability to synchronize the flow control system with adaptive optics.  This effort will initially focus on wind tunnel testing to prove the feasibility of steady and periodic flow control techniques to reduce or regularize the large scale turbulent structures surrounding an optical turret.  These tests will culminate in a hardware-in-the-loop demonstration utilizing flow control with an adaptive optics system in a full-scale wind tunnel test for the turret.  Following successful wind tunnel demonstrations, a preliminary design of a flight test turret incorporating flow control will be undertaken.  Completion of detailed design and fabrication will be carried on under the HELLADS program budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01.</r2:Description>

Because the system is scalable and distributed, a warfighter can practice by himself, in a small group, or with as many other warfighters as needed for the mission over a local or distributed network, and across all relevant platforms (dismounts, vehicles, helicopters, and fast movers).  Most important is the understanding that RealWorld is not a static simulation; it is a simulation builder with applications across the spectrum of modern kinetic and non-kinetic warfare.  The program created tools that allow warfighters to rapidly and easily build their own missions through the introduction of new methodology for building simulation software.

                                    <r2:Description>The Transformer (TX) Vehicle program will develop a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), road-worthy vehicle that can carry a 1,000 lb payload at a range of 250 nautical miles on a single tank of fuel.  With a flyable/roadable vehicle, the warfighter has the ability to avoid road obstructions as well as improvised explosive devices and ambush threats, providing flexibility for tactical military and personnel transport missions.  The primary focus of this program is to demonstrate the ability to build a ground vehicle that is capable of configuring into a VTOL air vehicle that provides sufficient flight performance and range, while carrying a payload that is representative of four troops with gear.  The enabling technologies of interest include hybrid electric drive, advanced batteries, stowable wing structures, ducted fan propulsion, lightweight materials, and advanced sensors and flight controls for stable transition from vertical to horizontal flight.  TX vehicles could be dispatched for downed airman recovery, for evacuating injured personnel from difficult-to-access locations, or to resupply isolated small units.  TX will also be suitable for enhanced company operations concepts which would provide the warfighter/team increased situational awareness for operations in an urban environment.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Mission Adaptive Rotor (MAR) program is to develop and demonstrate the capability to achieve dramatic improvements in rotor performance, survivability, and availability through the use of technologies that enable adaptation of the rotor throughout military missions and/or mission segments.  Recent research indicates that significant performance benefits could be achieved by actively morphing the shape or properties of the rotor system; additionally, active rotors with on-blade control could eliminate the need for a rotor swashplate.  MAR capability will result in dramatic improvements in system performance, operational availability, sustainability, and survivability, including reduction in acoustic susceptibility and rotor vibration while increasing useful payload fraction and range.

The MAR program will mature active rotor technologies that enable the effective operation of military rotorcraft in performance-limited environments of high-altitude mountainous terrain and deserts.  The MAR program will also focus on development of advanced technologies for application to future helicopter, tiltrotor, and other rotorcraft platforms and demonstrate the benefits of adaptation on a fielded system to facilitate upgrade of current multi-service rotorcraft systems.</r2:Description>

Processing here includes a number of critical steps including conditioning of unstructured data, content analysis, behavioral modeling, pattern-of-life characterization, economic activity analysis, social network analysis, anomaly detection, and visualization.  Operational benefits include deeper understanding of the evolving operational environment tailored to the needs of commanders at every echelon.

                                    <r2:Description>The Nexus 7 program applies forecasting, data extraction, and analysis methodologies to develop tools, techniques, and frameworks for the automated interpretation, quantitative analysis, and visualization of social networks.  Social network theory has emerged in recent years as a promising approach for understanding groups of individuals connected through a variety of shared interests and collaborative activities.  For the military, social networks provide a promising model for understanding terrorist cells, insurgent groups, and other stateless actors whose connectedness is established not on the basis of shared geography but rather through the correlation of their participation in coordinated activities such as planning meetings, training/mission rehearsal sessions, sharing of materiel/funds transfers, etc.  The Nexus 7 program will develop and apply emerging methods for edge finding and cluster analysis to detect, characterize, and predict the dynamics of social networks.  The resulting capabilities have important application in tactical contexts to aid analysts and operators in connecting the dots amid complex, conflicting, and incomplete data sets.  They also establish a foundation for cultural intelligence - understanding the stability, governance, and economic indicators of a region - and the capability to better focus stability, security, transition, and reconstruction operations on high-payoff initiatives.  The Nexus 7 program is an outgrowth of the data analysis tools explored in the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) program and previous information integration work in the cognitive computing and transformative sciences areas.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Network Flow Analytics (NFA) program develops quantitative approaches for detecting illicit activities such as terrorist financing by monitoring flows in international financial networks.  Such terrorist financing often supports drug trafficking or other criminal activities.  NFA will address some of the most challenging aspects of detecting illicit money flows including correlating individual transactions that have been intentionally structured by the adversary to defy easy detection and correctly identifying the small number of illicit flows within the large background of legitimate flows.  In addition, to detecting illicit activities the program will focus on the development of systems to combat corruption and ensure the integrity of networked financial systems.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Web-Scale Information Integration.  Previously funded in PE 0602305E, Project MCN-01. 

The Visual Media Reasoning (VMR) program will create technologies to automate the analysis of enemy-recorded photos and videos and identify, within minutes, key information related to the content.  Such identification will include the names of individuals within the image (who), the enumeration of the objects within the image and their attributes (what), and the image's geospatial location and time frame (where and when).  Large data stores of enemy photos and video are available but cannot be easily leveraged by a warfighter or analyst attempting to understand a specific new image.  The VMR program will enable users to gain insights rapidly through application of highly parallelized image analysis techniques that can process the imagery in massive federated image stores.  VMR technology will serve as a force-multiplier by rapidly and automatically extracting tactically relevant information for the human analyst and alerting the analyst to scenes that warrant the analyst's expert attention.</r2:Description>

Stability, security, transition, and reconstruction operations are enhanced by the creation of democratic institutions and the elimination of systematic corruption within newly formed governments.  These goals depend on the ability of users to speak freely without fear of reprisal and to participate in public referendums with privacy protections.  CAS will create technology to enable safe discourse and trustworthy elections over the internet.  This will require addressing all three elements of the traditional security triad - confidentiality, integrity, and availability - while also providing for new auditing mechanisms such as the capability for individuals to confirm their vote was correctly recorded and for stakeholder organizations to confirm only legitimate votes were counted.  The program will expand traditional encryption algorithms and protocols to encompass auditability in systems requiring public trust.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Video and Image Retrieval and Analysis Tool (VIRAT) program will develop and demonstrate a system for video data exploitation that enables an analyst to rapidly find video content of interest from archives and provides alerts to the analyst of events of interest during live operations.  The ability to quickly search large volumes of existing video data and monitor real-time video data for specific activities or events will provide a new capability to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies.  Currently, video analysis is very labor intensive, limited to metadata queries, manual annotations, and "fast-forward" examination of clips.  The software tools developed under VIRAT will radically improve the analysis of huge volumes of video data by: 1) alerting operators when specific events or activities occur at specific locations or over a range of locations and; 2) enabling fast, content-based searches of existing video archives.  The final product of the VIRAT program is a system that can be transitioned to an integrated, operational military system, such as the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) program develops and integrates a set of data analysis tools into a unified information system to support Theater Security Cooperation.  The ICEWS system monitors, assesses and forecasts leading indicators of events that make countries vulnerable to crises.  ICEWS technologies include quantitative and computational social science modeling and simulation, scenario generation, ontological modeling of security problems, advanced interactive visualization techniques, and agent-based programming.  ICEWS will also develop a collaborative, open-source testbed that will facilitate the integration and evaluation of alternative, operationally relevant social theories.  Natural language processing is required to identify and extract information that is predictive from text and speech-based media and to distill that information into a form that is actionable by civilian and military leadership.  ICEWS will develop a large body of test cases (source data and outcomes) against which the social science theories can be evaluated.  When integrated, these tools will allow combatant commanders and their staff to understand and anticipate conditions that precipitate instability and conflict while there is still time to influence them.  ICEWS will also help commanders anticipate unintended consequences of actions taken to influence or remediate situations, consequences that may be delayed by months or years.</r2:Description>

The EXACTO system is comprised of an advanced targeting optic, the first ever guided, power-generating, small caliber bullet, innovative guidance and control software, and a conventional sniper rifle.  The EXACTO 50-caliber bullet and brass-board optical sighting technology greatly extends the day and night ranges over current state-of-the-art sniper systems allowing sniper teams to engage tactically important moving targets including accelerating vehicle-borne targets, in high crosswind conditions.  EXACTO enhances survivability by allowing greater shooter standoff range and reduces target engagement timelines by a factor of 5.</r2:Description>

Persistent, wide area surveillance imagery is an ever increasing source of operational data, but exploitation of this data at present is mostly manual and requires hours to days to produce results.  PerSEAS addressed the need for tools to automatically detect potentially significant adversary activities and to discriminate these from nominal background activity.  Additionally, the program established prototype libraries of activity patterns, logic to generate hypotheses about which activities are being observed, and mechanisms to quantitatively score the consistency of the data with each activity hypothesis to detect and defeat threats in real-time.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its objective is to develop material, biological and energy technologies that make possible a wide range of new military capabilities.

The major goal of the Materials Processing Technology project is to develop novel materials, materials processing techniques, mathematical models and fabrication strategies for advanced structural and functional materials and components that will lower the cost, increase the performance, and/or enable new missions for military platforms and systems.  Included in this project are efforts across a wide range of materials including: structural materials and devices, functional materials and devices, and materials that enable new propulsion concepts for land, sea, and space vehicles and low distortion optical lenses.

The Biologically Based Materials and Devices project acknowledges the growing and pervasive influence of the biological sciences on the development of new materials, devices and processes, as well as the commensurate influence of materials, physics and chemistry on new approaches to biology and biochemistry.  Contained in this project are thrusts in the application of biomimetic materials and devices for Defense, the development of biochemical materials to maintain performance, the use of biology's unique fabrication capabilities to produce structures that cannot be made any other way, and the development of manufacturing tools that use biological components and processes for material synthesis.  It also supports a major thrust that will revolutionize the development of prosthetics for the wounded soldier.

The Tactical and Strategic Energy Technology project is focused on the unique challenges facing the DoD in developing and demonstrating advanced power generation and energy storage technologies.  It will address critical military needs for improved energy efficiency and availability to support a range of military missions that include individual warfighter and small unit operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Functional Materials and Devices thrust will address problems with high performance functional materials development.  Functional materials deployed for applications are most often bulk structures and performance is limited to those properties found in nature.  Improved materials require deliberate control at the scale of the relevant phenomena.  This thrust will leverage the advanced fabrication capabilities currently available, coupled with design of material and structure, to drive functional materials to high performance for DoD applications by design.  Novel optical materials exploiting three-dimensional degrees of freedom to increase wavefront control, and IR emissive materials are examples of near-term materials in which design of structure at the scale of the critical phenomena can have significant impact on their performance.  To eliminate the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capability gap that currently exists at the soldier-scale, capability will be developed to provide high space/time resolution throughout the soldier-scale, space/time sphere of influence by developing task-specific functionality.  These functions include hands-free zoom, automated brightness adjustment, threat detection, targeting assistance, change detection, and supplementary data overlay.  This thrust will also explore newly emerging areas where structure may play an important role.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Based upon technology development from the Materials Processing and Manufacturing thrust, the Manufacturable Gradient Index Optics (M-GRIN) program seeks to advance the development of GRIN lenses from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 8.  The program will expand the application of gradient index optics (GRIN) by providing compact, lightweight, and cost-effective lenses with controlled dispersion and aberrations that will replace large assemblies of conventional lenses.  The ability to create entirely new optical materials and surfaces creates the potential for new or significantly improved military optical applications, such as solar concentrators, portable designators, highly efficient fiber optics, and imaging systems.  The program also seeks to extend GRIN manufacturing technologies to glass, ceramic, and other inorganic materials in order to allow for small, lightweight, customized optical elements for mid-wave and longwave infrared (MWIR and LWIR) applications.  A key component of the program is to develop new design tools that enable optics designers to incorporate dynamic material properties, fabrication methods, and manufacturing tolerances.  The integration of new materials, design tools, and manufacturing processes will enable previously unattainable 3-D optical designs to be manufactured.  This new manufacturing paradigm will enable flexible production of GRIN optics in quantities of one unit to thousands of units.</r2:Description>

A pathway to affordable self-sustainable agriculture-sourced production of an alternative to petroleum-derived JP-8, that meets all DoD needs, were investigated.

Additional efforts expanded the spectrum of convertible feedstocks to cellulosic, algal, and other similar materials, enabling a diversified feedstock portfolio that can meet the entire DoD need within a sustainable commercial framework.  An important variant of this latter category is the development of man- and vehicle-portable technologies that produce substantial quantities of JP-8 and other useful liquid fuels from indigenously available or harvestable resources near desired locations worldwide.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Maintaining Combat Performance thrust utilizes breakthroughs in biology and physiology to sustain the peak physical and cognitive performance of warfighters operating in extreme conditions.  Today, warfighters must accomplish their missions despite extraordinary physiologic stress.  Examples of these stressors include temperature extremes (-20 degrees F to 125 degrees F), oxygen deficiency at high altitude, personal loads in excess of 100 lbs, dehydration, psychological stress, and even performance of life-sustaining maneuvers following combat injury.  Not only must troops maintain optimum physical performance, but also peak cognitive performance, which includes the entire spectrum from personal navigation and target recognition, to complex command and control decisions, and intelligence synthesis.  The Maintaining Combat Performance thrust leverages breakthroughs in diverse scientific fields in order to mitigate the effects of harsh combat environments ranging from fundamental research elucidating the biological mechanisms of adaptation to application of novel body-worn actuation materials to reduce soldier loads.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Neuroscience Technologies thrust leverages recent advances in neurophysiology, neuro-imaging, cognitive science and molecular biology to sustain and protect the cognitive functioning of the warfighter faced with challenging operational conditions.  Warfighters experience a wide variety of operational stressors, both mental and physical, that degrade critical cognitive functions such as memory, learning, and decision making.  These stressors also degrade the warfighter's ability to multitask, leading to decreased ability to respond quickly and effectively.  Currently, the long-term impact of these stressors on the brain is unknown, both at the molecular and behavioral level.  This thrust area will utilize modern neuroscientific techniques, in conjunction with emerging solutions in neurally enabled human-machine interface technologies, to develop quantitative models of this impact and explore mechanisms to protect, maintain, complement, or restore cognitive functioning during and after exposure to operational stressors.  In addition, new approaches for using neural signals to make human-machine systems more time efficient and less workload intense will be identified, developed, and evaluated.  This project will also investigate the integration of recently characterized properties of human brain function and real-time signal processing to enable rapid triage of target-containing imagery.  This thrust area will have far-reaching implications for both current and future military operations, with the potential to protect and improve cognitive performance at the individual and group level both prior to and during deployment.</r2:Description>

It will employ system engineering methods in combination with biotechnology and synthetic chemical technology to create novel beneficial attributes.  BioDesign mitigates the unpredictability of natural evolutionary advancement primarily by advanced genetic engineering and molecular biology technologies to produce the intended biological effect.  This thrust area includes designed molecular responses that increase resistance to cellular death signals and improved computational methods for prediction of function based solely on sequence and structure of proteins produced by synthetic biological systems.  Development of technologies to genetically tag and/or lock synthesized molecules would provide methods for prevention of manipulation ("tamper proof" synthetic biological systems).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of Living Foundries is to create a revolutionary, biologically-based manufacturing platform to provide new materials, capabilities and manufacturing paradigms for the DoD and the Nation.  The program seeks to develop the new tools, technologies and methodologies to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  The goal is to enable the rapid development of previously unattainable technologies and products, leveraging biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials, novel capabilities, fuels and medicines and providing novel solutions and enhancements to military needs and capabilities.  For example, one motivating, widespread and currently intractable problem is that of corrosion/materials degradation challenge that costs the DoD nearly $23 billion per year and has no near term solution in sight.  Living Foundries, with its ability to truly program and engineer biology, will enable the capability to design and engineer systems to rapidly and dynamically prevent, seek out, identify and repair corrosion/materials degradation.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling distributed, adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value materials, devices and capabilities in the field or on base.  Such a capability will decrease the DoD's dependence on tenuous material and energy supply chains that could be cut due to political change, targeted attack or environmental accident.   

Research thrusts will focus on the development and demonstration of open technology platforms, or bio-foundries, that integrate the tools and capabilities developed in PE 0601101E/TRS-01 to prove out capabilities for rapid (months vs. service-oriented architecture years) design and construction of new biological production systems.  The ultimate vision is to develop point-of-use, on-demand, distributed and customized production of strategic materials and systems that exploit the capabilities and programmability (through DNA) of biology.  Activities in this area will accelerate the development of DoD-focused applications and shift the field from simple, isolated genetic circuits to whole genome engineering.  Such a platform spans from the ability to design, optimize and simulate (in silico) a synthetic genetic regulatory network to the automated fabrication and validation of the synthetic design in a biological system.  Demonstration platforms will be challenged to build a variety of military-relevant and complex functionalities, such as the ability to withstand harsh environments, to synthesize complex mixtures of chemicals, or to rapidly and dynamically prevent, seek out, identify and repair corrosion/materials degradation.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of this thrust is to radically improve the state of the art for upper limb prosthetics, moving them from crude devices with minimal capabilities to fully integrated and functional limb replacements.  Current prosthetic technology generally provides only gross motor functions, with very crude approaches to control.  This makes it difficult for wounded soldiers to re-acquire full functionality and return to military service if so desired.  The advances required to provide fully functional limb replacements will be achieved by an aggressive, milestone driven program combining the talents of scientists from diverse areas including: medicine, neuroscience, orthopedics, engineering, materials science, control and information theory, mathematics, power, manufacturing, rehabilitation, psychology and training.  The results of this program will radically improve the ability of combat amputees to return to normal function.  This effort will be funded in PE 0602115E, Biomedical Technology beginning in FY 2013.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Recent advances in computational and neural sciences indicate it is possible to push the visual threat detection envelope to enable more response choices for our soldiers than ever before.  The objective of the Cognitive Technology Threat Warning System (CT2WS) program is to drive a breakthrough in soldier-portable visual threat warning devices by leveraging discoveries in the disparate technology areas of flat-field, wide-angle optics, large pixel-count digital imagers, visual processing pathways, neurally based target detection signatures and ultra-low power analog-digital hybrid signal processing electronics.  This program will lead to the development of prototype soldier-portable digital imaging threat cueing systems capable of effective detection ranges of 1-10 km against dismounts and vehicles.  Simultaneously, the system will survey a 120-degree or greater field of view, enabling the warfighter to detect, decide and act on the most advantageous timeline in complex operational environments.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Biological vision systems have the exquisite ability to recognize, categorize, and learn new objects in fractions of a second.  While animals and humans accomplish this seemingly effortlessly and constantly, computational vision systems have, to date, been unable to replicate this feat of biology.  The Neovision2 program is pursuing an integrated approach to developing an advanced object recognition capability based on the visual pathways in the mammalian brain.  Specifically, this program will develop a cognitive sensor technology with limited size, weight, and power that transforms data from an imaging sensor suite into communicable knowledge for mobile, autonomous surveillance systems.  To achieve the vision, the program will utilize advanced device design, signal processing and mathematical techniques across multiple brain regions to revolutionize the field and create an electronic neuro-biological (neuromorphic) vision system.</r2:Description>

Implicit in this thrust is the fact that there are unique, warfighter-specific challenges in acute and chronic treatment that are not addressed by civilian research and development.  Today, more than half of American battlefield fatalities are due to hemorrhage, particularly due to improvised explosive devices (IEDs).  To prevent these deaths, there is an urgent need for technologies that enable relatively unskilled personnel (battlefield medics) to diagnose and treat injuries, including the ability to locate and coagulate non-compressible sites of bleeding in the thorax or abdomen.

                                    <r2:Description>Wounded warriors with amputated limbs cannot fully exploit recent advances in prosthetic-limb technology because the neural interfaces used to extract limb-control information are low-performance and unreliable.  The goal of the Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program is to develop the technology and systems needed to reliably extract information from the nervous system at the scale and rate necessary to control state-of-the-art high-performance prosthetic limbs.  In support of this goal, the RE-NET program is developing methods to quantitatively assess, model, predict, and accelerate the leading causes of neural interface degradation and failure.  The program will also increase the channel-count (amount information) of reliable peripheral-nervous-system interfaces and increase the operational lifetime (reliability) of central-nervous-system interfaces.  Through this focus on reliability and high-level performance, the RE-NET program will enable clinically relevant technology transitions in support of wounded warriors.

The Pathogen Defeat thrust area will provide revolutionary capabilities to predict future threats and to deflect pathogen evolution to non-human spaces such as animals, insects, and bacteria.  This area will also determine malicious intent by monitoring key technology acquisitions and commercialization of potential dual-use technologies.  Pathogen Defeat focuses not on the threats that are already known but rather on the threats of newly emerging agents and mutations in the future, allowing pre-emptive preparation of vaccine and therapy countermeasures.  This will include novel vaccine delivery systems.  This program continues in FY 2012 in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Preventing Violent Explosive Neurologic Trauma (PREVENT) program seeks to understand the causes of blast-induced traumatic brain injury (TBI), an injury that while previously described in the warfighter population, has been referred to as a potential "hidden epidemic" in the current conflict.  PREVENT will use a variety of modeling techniques based on in-theater conditions to assess potential TBI caused by blast in the absence of penetrating injury or concussion.  Research will create a model that can be directly correlated to the epidemiology and etiology of injury seen in returning warfighters, and attempt to determine the physical and physiological underpinnings and causes of the injury.  Mitigation and treatment strategies will be formulated based on our new knowledge of blast-induced brain injury with the eventual goal of reducing injury severity across the forces by over fifty percent, improving recovery time, and preventing future injuries.  This program continues in FY 2012 in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01.</r2:Description>

The goal of the Vulcan program is to design, build, and ground test a pressure gain combustion (PGC) technology system that demonstrates a 20% reduction in specific fuel consumption for power generation turbine engines.  PGC technology has been under development for more than a decade and considerable progress has been made in key enabling technology areas.  The technology is believed mature enough to permit a dramatic new system capability.  PGC, when combined with turbine engines, offers the ability to design a new class of hybrid turbine power generation engines and Mach 4+ air breathing propulsion systems.  The Vulcan system consists of a full scale PGC, a compressor, and a turbine, and has direct application to ship power generation and propulsion turbine engines, aviation turbine engines, high-mach air breathing engines, as well as commercial turbine engines of the same variety.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Microscale Power Conversion (MPC) program will address the fundamental limitations of power conversion by enabling a new technology and approach that exploits advances in basic power devices that can operate at very high frequencies with low losses.  A key benefit of these new devices is that they can be integrated into very compact circuits and assemblies that will provide dramatic advances to the power bus of a platform.  Specifically, this program will develop the technology to enable DC to DC power conversion for military applications at the scale of an integrated circuit so it can be embedded within the electronics subsystem and a new distributed power architecture can be realized.  The focus of this program is on attaining 100MHz internal operation frequencies of power circuits since the size of the passive elements (inductors and capacitors) in a power converter scales inversely as the fourth power of the internal operating frequency.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research budget activity because its objective is to develop electronics that make a wide range of military applications possible.

Advances in microelectronic device technologies, including digital, analog, photonic and MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) devices, continue to have significant impact in support of defense technologies for improved weapons effectiveness, improved intelligence capabilities and enhanced information superiority.  The Electronics Technology program element supports the continued advancement of these technologies through the development of performance driven advanced capabilities, exceeding that available through commercial sources, in electronic, optoelectronic and MEMS devices, semiconductor device design and fabrication techniques, and new materials and material structures for device applications.  A particular focus for this work is the exploitation of chip-scale heterogeneous integration technologies that permit the optimization of device and integrated module performance.

The phenomenal progress in current electronics and computer chips will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology in the early 21st century, a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue.  Another thrust of the program element will explore alternatives to silicon-based electronics in the areas of new electronic devices, new architectures to use them, new software to program the systems, and new methods to fabricate the chips.  Approaches include nanotechnology, nanoelectronics, molecular electronics, spin-based electronics, quantum-computing, new circuit architectures optimizing these new devices, and new computer and electronic systems architectures.  Projects will investigate the feasibility, design, and development of powerful information technology devices and systems using approaches for electronic device designs that extend beyond traditional Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) scaling, including non silicon-based materials technologies to achieve low cost, reliable, fast and secure computing, communication, and storage systems.  This investigation is aimed at developing new capabilities from promising directions in the design of information processing components using both inorganic and organic substrates, designs of components and systems leveraging quantum effects and chaos, and innovative approaches to computing designs incorporating these components for such applications as low cost seamless pervasive computing, ultra-fast computing, and sensing and actuation devices.  

This project has five major thrusts: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research budget activity because its objective is to develop electronics that make a wide range of military applications possible.

Advances in microelectronic device technologies, including digital, analog, photonic and MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) devices, continue to have significant impact in support of defense technologies for improved weapons effectiveness, improved intelligence capabilities and enhanced information superiority.  The Electronics Technology program element supports the continued advancement of these technologies through the development of performance driven advanced capabilities, exceeding that available through commercial sources, in electronic, optoelectronic and MEMS devices, semiconductor device design and fabrication techniques, and new materials and material structures for device applications.  A particular focus for this work is the exploitation of chip-scale heterogeneous integration technologies that permit the optimization of device and integrated module performance.

The phenomenal progress in current electronics and computer chips will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology in the early 21st century, a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue.  Another thrust of the program element will explore alternatives to silicon-based electronics in the areas of new electronic devices, new architectures to use them, new software to program the systems, and new methods to fabricate the chips.  Approaches include nanotechnology, nanoelectronics, molecular electronics, spin-based electronics, quantum-computing, new circuit architectures optimizing these new devices, and new computer and electronic systems architectures.  Projects will investigate the feasibility, design, and development of powerful information technology devices and systems using approaches for electronic device designs that extend beyond traditional Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) scaling, including non silicon-based materials technologies to achieve low cost, reliable, fast and secure computing, communication, and storage systems.  This investigation is aimed at developing new capabilities from promising directions in the design of information processing components using both inorganic and organic substrates, designs of components and systems leveraging quantum effects and chaos, and innovative approaches to computing designs incorporating these components for such applications as low cost seamless pervasive computing, ultra-fast computing, and sensing and actuation devices.

                                    <r2:Description>The Quantum Information Science (QIS) program will explore all facets of the research necessary to create new technologies based on quantum information science.  Research in this area has the ultimate goal of demonstrating the potentially significant advantages of quantum mechanical effects in communication and computing.  Expected applications include: new improved forms of highly secure communication; faster algorithms for optimization in logistics and wargaming; highly precise measurements of time and position on the earth and in space; and new image and signal processing methods for target tracking.  Technical challenges include: loss of information due to quantum decoherence; limited communication distance due to signal attenuation; limited selection of algorithms and protocols; and larger numbers of bits.  Error correction codes, fault tolerant schemes, and longer decoherence times will address the loss of information.  Signal attenuation will be overcome by exploiting quantum repeaters.  New algorithm techniques and complexity analysis will increase the selection of algorithms, as will a focus on signal processing.  The QIS program is a broad-based effort that will continue to explore the fundamental open questions, the discovery of novel algorithms, and the theoretical and experimental limitations of quantum processing as well as the construction of efficient implementations.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The objective of the Short-range Wide-field-of-regard Extremely-agile Electronically-steered Photonic Emitter and Receiver (SWEEPER) program is to develop chip-scale dense waveguide modular technology to achieve true embedded phase array control for beams equivalent to 10W average power, less than 0.1 degree instantaneous field of view (IFOV), greater than 45 degree total field of view (TFOV), and frame rates of greater than 100 hertz (Hz) in packages that are "chip-scale."  Such performance will represent a three order of magnitude increase in speed, while also achieving a greater than two orders of magnitude reduction in size.  Additionally, the integrated phase control will provide the unprecedented ability to rapidly change the number of simultaneous beams, beam profile, and power-per-beam, thus opening a whole new direction in operational capability.  Key technical challenges include the ability to achieve the needed facet density (facet pitch should be on the order of a wavelength or two), control the relative phase across all facets equivalent to 9-bits, and efficiently couple and distribute coherent light to facets from a master laser oscillator with an integrated waveguide structure.  Related projects and studies have pointed to the significant system-level pay-offs of the new proposed technology.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Self-HEALing mixed-signal Integrated Circuits (HEALICs) program is to develop technologies to autonomously maximize the number of fully operational mixed-signal systems-on-a-chip (SoC) per wafer that meet all performance goals in the presence of extreme process technology variations, environmental conditions, and aging.  Virtually all DoD systems employ mixed-signal circuits for functions such as communications, radar, navigation, sensing, high-speed image and video processing.  A self-healing integrated circuit is defined as a design that is able to sense undesired circuit/system behaviors and correct them automatically.  As semiconductor process technologies are being scaled to even smaller transistor dimensions, there is a dramatic increase in intra-wafer and inter-die process variations, which have a direct impact on realized circuit performance, as well as significantly increased sensitivity to temperature and ageing effects.

This applied research program aims to develop techniques to regain lost performance and stabilize operation of mixed-signal SoCs over system lifetimes.  Consequently, the long-term reliability of DoD electronic systems is expected to be significantly enhanced.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Efficient Linearized All-Silicon Transmitter ICs (ELASTx) program is the development of revolutionary high-power/high-efficiency/high-linearity single-chip millimeter (mm)-wave transmitter integrated circuits (ICs) in leading edge silicon technologies for future miniaturized communications and sensor systems on mobile platforms.  The high levels of integration possible in silicon technologies enable on-chip linearization, complex waveform synthesis, and digital calibration and correction.  Military applications include ultra-miniaturized transceivers for satellite communications-on-the-move, collision avoidance radars for micro-/nano-air vehicles, and ultra-miniature seekers for small munitions.  The technology developed under this program could also be leveraged to improve the performance of high-power amplifiers based-on other nonsilicon technologies through heterogeneous integration strategies.  Significant technical obstacles to be overcome include the development of highly efficient circuits for increasing achievable output power of silicon devices (e.g., device stacking, power combining) at mm-waves; scaling high-efficiency amplifier classes to the mm-wave regime; integrated linearization architectures for complex modulated waveforms; and robust RF/mixed-signal isolation strategies.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>There is a critical ongoing military need for flexible, affordable, hand-held cognitive military communications systems.  The Adaptive Radio Frequency Technology (ART) program will provide the warfighter with a new, fully adaptive radio platform capable of sensing the electromagnetic and waveform environment in which it operates, making decisions on how to best communicate in that environment, and rapidly adapting its hardware to meet ever-changing requirements, while simultaneously significantly reducing the size, weight and power (SWaP) of such radio nodes.  ART will also equip each warfighter, as well as small-scale unmanned platforms, with compact and efficient signal identification capabilities for next-generation cognitive communications, sensing and electronic warfare applications.  ART technology will also enable rapid radio platform deployment for new waveforms and changing operational requirements.  ART aggregates the Feedback Linearized Microwave Amplifiers program, the Analog Spectral Processing program, and Chip Scale Spectrum Analyzers (CSSA) program, and initiates new thrusts in Cognitive Low-energy Signal Analysis and Sensing Integrated Circuits (CLASIC), RF Field-Programmable Arrays (RF-FPGA), and Dynamic Live Active Nulling (DyLAN).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Analog-to-Information (A-to-I) Receiver Development

The Analog-to-Information (A-to-I) Look-Through program will fundamentally improve the operational bandwidth, linearity, and efficiency of electronic systems where the objective is to receive and transmit information using electromagnetic (radio) waves under extreme size/weight/power and environmental conditions required for DoD applications.  The A-to-I Look-Through program will develop ultra-wideband digital radio frequency (RF) receivers based on Analog-to-Information Converter (AIC) technology.  Compared to conventional RF receivers, AIC-based designs will increase receiver dynamic range and frequency band of regard while reducing data glut, power consumption and size.  Likewise, limitations of current art power amplifier technology in simultaneously achieving high operational bandwidth, linearity, efficiency and power has resulted in well documented instances of electronic fratricide.  This program will overcome these limitations by converting digital signals directly to high power RF analog signals, thus eliminating the traditional high power amplifiers that are limited by the above-mentioned tradeoffs.  Transition is anticipated into airborne SIGINT and electronic warfare systems, as well as ground-based special operations forces systems.</r2:Description>

The AWARE program aims to solve the technological barriers that will enable FOV, high resolution and multi-band camera architectures by focusing on four major tasks: high space-bandwidth product (SBP) camera architecture; small pitch pixel focal plane array architecture; broadband focal plane array architecture; and multi-band focal plane array architecture.

The AWARE program demonstrates technologies such as detectors, focal plane arrays, read-out integrated circuitry, and computational imaging that enable wide FOV and high space bandwidth, novel optical designs, high resolution and multiple wavelength band imagers.  These technologies will be integrated into subsystem demonstrations under the related MT-15 project in PE 0603739E.

The Diverse &amp; Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) effort will take this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (for example, Gallium Nitride, Indium Phosphide, Gallium Arsenide, Antimonide Based Compound Semiconductors), microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures.  This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true "systems on a chip" (SoCs) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions for a wide array of system applications.  FY 2011 and FY 2012 incorporates the COSMOS program into DAHI.

In the Applied Research part of this effort, high performance RF/optoelectronic/mixed-signal SoCs for specific DoD transition applications will be developed as a demonstration of the DAHI technology.  In addition, in order to provide maximum benefit to the DoD, as these processes are developed, they will be transferred to a manufacturing flow and made available (with appropriate computer aided design support) to a wide variety of DoD laboratory, FFRDC, academic and industrial designers.  Manufacturing yield and reliability of the DAHI technologies will be characterized and enhanced.  This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Leading Edge Access Program (LEAP) is to enable university, industry, and government lab access to on-shore state of the art Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology for performing advanced integrated circuit (IC) research of benefit to the DoD.  Specifically, LEAP offers foundry access at a substantially reduced cost for CMOS technology nodes of 45 nanometers (nm) and below.  Currently much of the IC design work performed using advanced technology nodes, including that done for the DoD, uses off-shore facilities in Asia and Europe.  This results in substantial intellectual property (IP) development outside the U.S. and creates a number of difficulties for technology transition of DoD-critical applications.  This program will stimulate U.S.-based advanced design research, providing top researchers early and partially subsidized access to validate and test innovative ideas and facilitate a more natural transition of these ideas.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro PN&amp;T)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro PN&amp;T) program is developing technology for self-contained chip-scale inertial navigation and precision guidance.  This technology promises to effectively mitigate dependence on Global Positioning System (GPS) or any other external signals, and enable uncompromised navigation and guidance capabilities.  The program will enable positioning, navigation and timing functions without the need for external information updates by employing on-chip calibration, thereby overcoming vulnerabilities which arise in environments where external updates are not available such as caves, tunnels, or dense urban locations.  The technologies developed will enable small, low-power, micro-gyroscopes capable of operating in both moderate and challenging dynamic environments; chip-scale primary atomic clock standards; and on-chip calibration systems for error correction.  Advanced micro-fabrication techniques allow a single package containing all the necessary devices (clocks, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and calibration mechanisms) to be incorporated into a volume the size of a sugar cube.  The small size, weight and power of these technologies and their integration into a single package responds to the needs of guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and individual soldiers.

The successful realization of a Micro PN&amp;T device is dependent on developing fundamentally new batch microfabrication processes, gaining an understanding of the sources and effects of error at the micro-scale, and exploring new combinatorial physics.  Innovative 3-D microfabrication techniques will allow co-fabrication of different materials and devices on a single chip.  Clocks, gyroscopes, accelerometers, calibration stages, and 3D structures could be integrated into a small, low power architecture.  This co-location of different inertial and timing devices opens the possibility for utilization of combinatorial physics in a single micro-system, enabling fast start-up time, increased bandwidth and long-term stability, thus effectively providing very accurate navigation devices.  Advanced research for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-12.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The objective of the Advanced X-Ray Integrated Sources (AXIS) program is to develop tunable mono-energetic X-ray sources that are spatially coherent with greatly reduced size, weight and power while dramatically increasing their electrical efficiency through application of micro-scale engineering technologies such as MEMS and NEMS.  Such X-ray sources will enable new versatile imaging modalities based on phase contrast which are 1000X more sensitive than the conventional absorption contrast imaging.  Such imaging modalities should enable reverse engineering of integrated circuits to validate trustworthiness as well as battlefield imaging of soft tissues and blood vessel injuries without the injection of a contrast enhancing agent in blunt trauma.  It will also reduce radiation dose required for imaging.

The Applied Research component of this effort will focus on applying basic research discoveries to the development of compact, pulsed X-ray source.  Such sources are a necessary component to enable future technologies with high-speed motion imaging capabilities and the reverse engineering of integrated circuits.

The MPD program will focus on development of fast, small, reliable, carrier dense, microplasma switches capable of operating in extreme conditions such as high-radiation and high-temperature environments.  Specific focus will be given to methods that produce efficient, high-pressure (up to or even beyond atmospheric pressure) generation of ions, radio frequency energy, and light sources.  Applications for such devices are far reaching, including the construction of complete high-frequency plasma-based logic circuits, and integrated circuits with superior resistance to radiation and extreme temperature environments.  It is envisaged that both two and multi-terminal devices consisting of various architectures will be developed and optimized under the scope of this program.  MPDs will be developed in various circuits and substrates to demonstrate the efficacy of different unique approaches.

The MPD applied research program is focused on transferring the fundamental scientific advances funded by PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 to produce complex circuit designs that may be integrated with commercial electronic devices.  It is expected that the MPD program will result in the design and modeling tools, as well as the fabrication capabilities necessary to commercially manufacture high-performance microscale plasma device based electronic systems for advanced DoD applications.</r2:Description>

Specific areas of focus in this program include overcoming limiting evaporative and diffusive thermal transport mechanisms at the micro/nano scale to provide an order-of-magnitude increase in on-chip heat flux and heat removal density, determining the feasibility of exploiting these mechanisms for intrachip thermal management, characterizing the performance limits and physics-of-failure of high heat density, intrachip cooling technologies, and integrating chip-level thermal management techniques into prototype high power electronics in the form factor of RF arrays and embedded computing systems.</r2:Description>

The nanoscale components to be developed will enable continuous in vivo monitoring of both small (e.g. glucose, lactate, and urea) and large molecules (e.g. biological threat agents).  A reprogrammable therapeutic platform will enable tailored therapeutic delivery to specific areas of the body (e.g. cells, tissue, compartments) in response to traditional, emergent, and engineered threats.  The key challenges to developing these systems include safety, toxicity, biocompatibility, sensitivity, response, and targeted delivery.  The IVN program will have diagnostic and therapeutic goals that enable a versatile, rapidly adaptable system to provide operational support to the warfighter in any location.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Pixel Network (PIXNET) for Dynamic Visualization program aims to develop infrared imaging components and the necessary application programming interface (API) system to provide real-time and dynamic tactical visualization of battlefield situation awareness and exploitation at individual level and at collective ensemble.  The goal is to enable one-to-many and many-to-one real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) data and metadata to maximize mission relevancy and minimize decision time during day/night operations.

The program will focus on significant reduction in cost, size, weight and power (SWaP) of infrared sensor components to enable portability and ability to deploy widely to all participants in the theatre.  Development of wafer scale IR sensor and coolers for low cost manufacturing will provide a price point that will allow them to be deployed to each warfighter.  The emphasis on a small form -factor (&lt;3.5 cm3) will naturally enable new opportunities such as surveillance with micro-UAVs, networked handheld devices with fused imaging capabilities to share tactical information at troop level, and intelligence for rapid decision/action.  The phenomenology of different infrared wavelengths will be exploited for targets of interest and only relevant data will be transmitted, thus reducing data burden over the network.  Having the capability of PIXNET at the soldier level will increase situational awareness and will enable more effective tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP).  PIXNET will take advantage of small computing platforms such as Android cell phones API to integrate and demonstrate digital image data distribution and signal processing via wireless connectivity.  The Program Executive Office, Space Sciences Laboratory, PM Optics USMC and industry will be the transition partners.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Microscale Power Conversion (MPC) program will address the fundamental limitations of power conversion by enabling a new technology and approach that exploits advances in basic power devices that can operate at very high frequencies with low losses.  A key benefit of these new devices is that they can be integrated into very compact circuits and assemblies that will provide dramatic advances to the power bus of a platform.  Specifically, this program will develop the technology to enable DC to DC power conversion for military applications at the scale of an integrated circuit so it can be embedded within the electronics subsystem and a new distributed power architecture can be realized.  The focus of this program is on attaining 100MHz internal operation frequencies of power circuits since the size of the passive elements (inductors and capacitors) in a power converter scales inversely as the fourth power of the internal operating frequency.  In FY 2012, MPC moves to PE 0602715E, Project MBT-03.</r2:Description>

The objective of the program was to enhance sensitivity, resolution, and effectiveness of electromagnetic sensors beyond what is classically possible.  In the initial effort, the types of sensors that propagate entangled light out to and back from a target were proven to be ineffective when realistic scattering and absorption occur between the source and the target.  Sensors that propagate classical light to the target but use non-classical effects only in the receiver were shown to provide qualitative advantages over their classical counterparts.  These include compensation for soft aperture losses using squeezed vacuum injection and compensation for detectors' quantum inefficiency using noiseless amplification.</r2:Description>

The radio frequency (RF) spectrum contains innumerable friendly and adversarial signals of interest including: voice and data communications, electronic signatures, and navigation information.  Conventional electronic systems are challenged in detecting weak signals in the presence of strong ones (low-linearity) across a broad range of frequencies (narrow-band).  The RPT program aimed to efficiently capture all RF signals of interest by developing broad-band (>10 gigahertz) high-linearity (>70 decibels dynamic-range) optical components and microsystems.  RPT enables linear broadband microsystems such as remote links, channelizers, and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).  The RPT program will reduce susceptibility to electronic attack, increase the probability-of-intercepting (POI) adversaries on their first-pulse transmission, and increase information awareness 1000-fold.</r2:Description>

The Near-Junction Thermal Transport (NJTT) program explored heat conduction and hot spot mitigation through the materials layers near a high-power device junction.  This program concentrated on development of specific materials and substrate bonding techniques, as well as microfluidic cooling, to enhance dissipated heat removal in the region of the active junctions of semiconductor chips.  Attention was also devoted to development and verification of metrology and quantitative models for heat generation and transport in and near device junctions.  Industry leaders with the expertise in developing high-power semiconductor devices are expected to demonstrate devices with significantly enhanced heat density and consequent enhancement in performance metrics.  This program was a companion program to the Thermal Management Technologies (TMT) program in PE 0603739E, Project MT-12.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The objective of the Vulture program is to develop and demonstrate the technology to enable an airborne payload to remain persistently on-station, uninterrupted and unreplenished, for over five years performing strategic and tactical communications, position/navigation/timing (PNT) and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions over an area of interest.  Vulture technology enables a re-taskable, persistent pseudo-satellite capability, in an aircraft package.  The technology combines the key benefits of an aircraft (flexibility &amp; responsiveness, sensor resolution, reduced transmit/receive power, affordability) with the benefits of space assets (on-station persistence, no logistics tail, energy independence, fleet size, absence of in-country footprint).  The system has potential in numerous roles: operation as a single platform, as a formation of multiple aircraft, or as a constellation providing infrastructure augmentation or recovery.  The technology challenges include structural integrity of very lightly-loaded airframe structure, efficient and reliable energy collection, storage/retrieval and management, and reliability technologies capable of allowing the aircraft to operate continuously for five years.  The Vulture program will conduct subscale and full-scale technology maturation and demonstration activities to prove out critical technologies.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Persistent Close Air Support (PCAS) program will significantly increase close air support (CAS) capabilities by developing a system to allow continuous CAS availability and lethality to the supported ground commander.  The enabling technologies are: manned/unmanned attack platforms, next generation graphical user interfaces (GUI), data links, digital guidance and control, and advanced munitions.  PCAS will demonstrate the ability to digitally task a CAS platform from the ground to attack multiple/simultaneous targets.  PCAS will allow the Joint Tactical Air Controller (JTAC) the ability to rapidly engage multiple moving targets simultaneously within the area of operation.  PCAS's ability to digitally task a CAS platform to attack multiple/simultaneous targets would improve U.S. ground forces operations and speed of attack.  The system will be designed to reduce collateral damage and potential fratricide to friendly forces.  The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The joint DARPA/Air Force Integrated Sensor is Structure (ISIS) program is developing a sensor of unprecedented proportions that is fully integrated into a stratospheric airship that will address the nation's need for persistent wide-area surveillance, tracking, and engagement for hundreds of time-critical air and ground targets in urban and rural environments.  ISIS is achieving radical sensor improvements by melding the next-generation technologies for enormous lightweight antenna apertures and high-energy density components into a highly integrated lightweight multi-purpose airship structure - completely erasing the distinction between payload and platform.  The ISIS concept includes ninety-nine percent on-station 24/7/365 availability for simultaneous Airborne Moving Target Indicator (AMTI) (600 kilometers) and Ground-Based Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) (300 kilometers) operation; ten years of autonomous, unmanned flight; hundreds of wideband in-theater concealed communications links; responsive reconstitution of capabilities lost by any failed space assets; plus CONUS-based sensor analysis and operation.  An MOA has been signed by DARPA and the Air Force to pursue the program objectives through to transition.  The ISIS technology demonstration system transitions to the Air Force in 2014.</r2:Description>

T3 would be carried internally on stealth aircraft or externally on fighters, bombers, and UAVs.  The enabling technologies are: propulsion, data links, and digital guidance and control.  T3 would allow any aircraft to rapidly switch between air-to-air and air-to-surface capabilities.  T3's speed, maneuverability, and network-centric capabilities would significantly improve U.S. aircraft survivability and increase the number and variety of targets that could be destroyed on each sortie.  The program is jointly funded with, and will transition to the Air Force.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>In response to emerging threats, DARPA is building on recent technology advances to develop and demonstrate standoff anti-ship strike technologies to reverse the significant and growing U.S. naval surface strike capability deficit.  The Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) program is investing in advanced component and integrated system technologies capable of providing a dramatic leap ahead in U.S. surface warfare capability focusing on organic wide area target discrimination in a network denied environment, innovative terminal survivability in the face of advanced defensive systems, and high assurance target lethality approaches.  Specific technology development areas will include: robust precision guidance, navigation and control with GPS denial, multi-modal sensors for high probability target identification in dense shipping environments, and precision aimpoint targeting for maximum lethality.  Component technologies are being developed, demonstrated, and integrated into a complete weapon system.  The program will result in a high fidelity demonstration to support military utility assessment.  LRASM is a joint DARPA/Navy effort.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) X-Plane program will demonstrate revolutionary VTOL systems development through a series of component and system ground and flight tests, at subscale and full scale, leading to full scale flight demonstration of key technologies.  Program goals include flight speeds of greater than 250 knots, enhanced high/hot hover performance, improved edgewise rotor cruise performance, prop-rotor cruise efficiencies approaching propellers, hover-power loading at a minimum of 11 pounds thrust per horsepower, and a 20% improvement in empty weight fraction.  Technologies will be pursued in four distinct research thrusts:  performance, safety and survivability, supportability and availability, and collaboration and autonomy.  The successful VTOL X-Plane would demonstrate the potential and mission utility of new technologies, and be a significant step toward closing current capability gaps in this class of air vehicles.  Transition partners will include the branches of DoD operating vertical flight systems, including the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Special Forces.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Vulcan program is to design, build, and ground test a pressure gain combustion (PGC) technology system that demonstrates a 20% reduction in specific fuel consumption for  power generation turbine engines.  PGC technology has been under development for more than a decade and considerable progress has been made in key enabling technology areas.  The technology is believed mature enough to permit a dramatic new system capability.  PGC, when combined with turbine engines, offers the ability to design a new class of hybrid turbine power generation engines and Mach 4+ air breathing propulsion systems.  The Vulcan system consists of a full scale PGC, a compressor, and a turbine, and would have direct application to ship power generation and propulsion turbine engines, aviation turbine engines, high-mach air breathing engines, as well as commercial turbine engines of the same variety.  This program is funded from PE 0602715E, Project MBT-03, Tactical and Strategic Energy Technology in FY 2012.  Anticipated Service users include the Air Force and Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the DiscRotor program was to design and demonstrate the enabling technologies required to develop a new type of compound helicopter capable of high-efficiency hover and high-efficiency, high-speed flight, with stable, continuous and reversible transition between these flight states.  The aircraft concept featured a mid-fuselage disc with extendable rotor blades, and an aft swept wing.  With the rotor blades extended and the disc rotating, the aircraft would operate like a helicopter with vertical take-off, efficient hover, controllable low speed flight and vertical landing.  With the blades retracted, the aircraft would be capable of efficient wing-borne cruise at speeds exceeding any existing rotorcraft, 2-3 times that of a conventional helicopter.  Specific objectives of the DiscRotor program included: demonstrating the feasibility of safely and repeatedly retracting/extending the blades into the disc in forward flight, characterizing the flowfield environment created by a disc-rotor, demonstrating disc-rotor enabling technologies, and correlating performance and loads and dynamics between high fidelity physics-based analytical predictions and wind tunnel testing  to confirm capability to adequately design advanced rotorcraft configurations.  Interested partners include the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, Coast Guard, and SOCOM.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Space Programs and Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced space systems and provides revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military missions.

A space force structure that is robust against attack represents a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space assets.  The keys to a secure space environment are situational awareness to detect and characterize potential attacks, a proliferation of assets to provide robustness against attack, ready access to space, the ability to neutralize man-made space environments, and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit assets.  Ready access to space allows the delivery of defensive systems and replenishment supplies to orbit.  An infrastructure to service the mission spacecraft allows defensive actions to be taken without limiting mission lifetime.  In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space.

Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terrestrial users.  Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness; enabling concepts include novel propulsion/propellants, unique manufacturing processes; precision control of multi-payload systems, and payload isolation and pointing systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>System F6</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The objective of the System F6 program is to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a satellite architecture wherein the functionality of a traditional "monolithic" spacecraft is replaced by a cluster of wirelessly-interconnected spacecraft modules.  Each such "fractionated" module would contribute a unique capability, for example, computation and data handling, communications relay, guidance and navigation, payload sensing, or it can replicate the capability of another module.  The fractionated modules would fly in a loose, proximate cluster orbit capable of semi-autonomous reconfiguration or a rapid defensive scatter/re-gather maneuver.  Critical to this architecture is a robust, system-level approach to ensuring security, integrity, and availability, while implementing authentication and non-repudiation.  While delivering a comparable mission capability to a monolithic spacecraft, System F6 significantly enhances architectural and programmatic adaptability and robustness-reducing risk through the mission life and spacecraft development cycle, enabling incremental deployment of the system, and enhancing survivability.  The System F6 architecture provides valuable options to decision makers throughout the life cycle development of future space systems that are absent in present-day monolithic architectures.

The System F6 program will culminate in an on-orbit demonstration of a multi-module space system incorporating the F6 Technology Package (F6TP) - a suite of technologies, components, and algorithms that enables semi-autonomous multi-body cluster flight and secure, distributed, real-time sharing of various spacecraft resources at the cluster level.  Multiple versions of the F6 Technology Package will be developed on the basis of open-source interface standards, software, and reference designs termed the F6 Developer's Kit.  The on-orbit demonstration will be capable of accommodating one or more spacecraft payload modules supplied by a third-party mission partner.  Residual capability to support future payloads with the existing on-orbit infrastructure will also remain following the demonstration, and the infrastructure can be upgraded for a perpetual on-orbit resource capability.  The utility of the F6 architecture in low earth orbit (LEO) is significantly enabled by persistent broadband connectivity to the ground which allows resource sharing between space-based modules and terrestrial network nodes.  A solution to enable high-availability, low-latency, persistent, high-bandwidth communications with LEO spacecraft will be developed in the course of the F6 program.  The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force, though the architecture will have the ability to simultaneously accommodate payloads from multiple other partners including the Army and Navy.  The resultant architecture is expected to significantly lower the barrier to entry and enhance competiveness of the national security space industrial base.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Horizontal Launch

The goal of the Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA) program is to mature and demonstrate technologies for cost effective, routine, reliable, horizontal access to low earth orbit (LEO).  ALASA seeks improvements in cost, responsiveness, flexibility, and resilience with a single approach.  ALASA will enable small satellites to be deployed to orbit from an airborne platform, allowing performance improvement, reducing range costs, and flying more frequently, which drives cost per pound down.  The ability to relocate and launch from virtually any major runway around the globe reduces the time needed to deploy a satellite system.  Launch point offset permits essentially any possible orbit direction to be achieved without concerns for launch direction imposed by geography.  Finally, launch point offset allows the entire operation to be moved should a particular fixed airfield become unavailable due to natural phenomena or other issues.  Challenges include, but are not limited to: in-air separation of aircraft and orbit-insertion launch stages, development of alternatives to current range processes, control of weight and margin under a hard gross weight limit, and achieving a cost of $1 million, including range support costs, to deploy satellites on the order of 100 lb.  The anticipated transition partner is the U.S. Air Force.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Space Domain Awareness (SDA)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Space Domain Awareness (SDA) program is to develop and demonstrate an operational framework and responsive defense application to enhance the availability of vulnerable space-based communications resources.  SDA will investigate revolutionary technologies in two areas: 1) advanced space surveillance sensors to better detect, track, and characterize space objects, with an emphasis on deep space objects, and 2) space surveillance data processing/data fusion to provide automated data synergy, to increase space domain awareness, overall space safety of flight, and ultimately to allow space operators to make informed, timely decisions.  Current space surveillance sensors cannot detect, track, or determine the future location and threat potential of small advanced technology spacecraft in deep space orbits, where a majority of DoD spacecraft are located.  Additionally, servicing missions to geosynchronous (GEO) orbits will require exquisite situational awareness, from ultra high-accuracy debris tracking for mission assurance at GEO orbits to high resolution imaging of GEO spacecraft for service mission planning.  The SDA program will leverage data fusion and advanced algorithms developed under the Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) program, as well as seek to exploit new ground-breaking technologies across the electromagnetic spectrum and utilize already existing sensor technology in non-traditional or exotic ways, to bring advanced capabilities to the space domain.  SDA will correlate a wide range of operational support and space system user data to rapidly identify threat activities, propose mitigating countermeasures, and verify the effectiveness of selected responses.  Critical technologies include accessing disparate sources of relevant data, model-based situational awareness, and candidate response generation and evaluation.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the ability to continuously adapt to changes in defended system components and usage patterns as well as validation of system integrity.  The potential transition customer is the Air Force.

Efficient collection of data for SDA is crucial to controlling costs.  SDA will demonstrate new approaches to collection of data utilizing a variety of collection modalities, ranging from fusion of observations from amateur astronomers, to evaluation of sparse aperture imaging techniques.  The first sparse aperture demonstration is Galileo.  This effort will develop technology to image a Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite from the ground.  Galileo will utilize fixed mobile telescopes, each with adaptive optics and a guide star, to create multiple baselines that can be used to reconstruct the image through an inverse Fourier transform.  The concept is similar to existing astronomic interferometers, except Galileo will extend the basic interferometric technology to utilize fiber optic transport of light between each telescope to match the optical path length instead of the traditional evacuated light tubes.  Technical challenges include: controlling thermal effects and disperation within the fiber to properly interfere the light from the two telescopes, and precisely measuring the distance between the fixed and mobile telescope systems.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) program will develop and demonstrate an advanced ground-based optical system to enable detection and tracking of faint objects in space, while providing rapid, wide-area search capability.  A major goal of the SST program is to develop the technology for large curved focal surface array sensors to enable an innovative telescope design combining high detection sensitivity, short focal length, wide field of view, and rapid step-and-settle to provide orders of magnitude improvements in space surveillance.  This capability will enable ground-based detection of un-cued objects in deep space for purposes such as asteroid detection and space defense missions.  The Air Force will participate in the DARPA funded developmental testing of SST and then take over operation of SST as a sensor in the Air Force Space Surveillance Network.  A  memorandum of agreement  has been established with Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) for transition.  The program is also investigating expanding the demonstration of the telescope to explore detection and tracking of broader classes of space objects under different orbital regimes, and the impact of observations from different environments. 

In addition, the program will investigate data fusion and advanced algorithms for correlation of unknown objects.  SST is expected to generate a large number of uncorrelated targets (UCTs), and new methods will need to be employed to rapidly characterize and attribute the new objects.  Furthermore, the program will investigate methods which combine observations from disparate sensors (such as optical and radar installations) to more rapidly, accurately, and completely provide knowledge about UCTs, as compared to the existing system where no data fusion is employed.  Where appropriate, SST will investigate new concepts which would provide complementary or further advances in ground-based deep space object detection and characterization.  This data fusion effort is called Ibex.</r2:Description>

To date, servicing operations have not been conducted on spacecraft beyond low earth orbit (LEO).  A large number of national security and commercial space systems operate at GEO altitudes, furthermore, many end-of-life or failed spacecraft drift without control through portions of the GEO belt, creating a growing hazard to operational spacecraft.  Technologies for servicing of spacecraft with the expectation such servicing would involve a mix of highly autonomous and remotely (i.e., ground-based) teleoperated robotic systems have been previously pursued.  The Phoenix servicing program will build upon these legacy technologies, tackling the more complex GEO environment.  The program seeks to repurpose high value long life components on existing satellites in GEO, in full collaboration and cooperation with existing satellite owners, utilizing commercial ridealong capability to send small packaged systems into GEO for use in upgrading, fixing, repairing, and enhancing  the repurposed components.  Key challenges include transportation and orbital maneuvering, robotic systems and integration, and extravehicular tool requirements.

The U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, intelligence community, and other potential users require affordable support to the tactical warfighter via space.  The goal of the "SeeMe" program is to demonstrate the ability to get near-real-time, i.e., no older than ~90 minutes, images directly to individual users' handheld devices from space.  This will be accomplished via a very low cost constellation of inexpensive, disposable small satellites routinely and inexpensively put in orbit through low cost horizontal (airborne) launches.  The current methodology for satisfying imagery needs from space is to build multipurpose systems with very high reliability and long life, at very high costs, and launch them on expensive vertical launch boosters. In most cases, commercial or military, the time to deliver an already built space Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) system suitable to meet tactically desired ground sample distance is on the order of 20+ months, and the data delivery mechanism is typically more than several days (and up to weeks) to the end user.  SeeMe intends to radically shorten the entire cycle: ground development time, launch cadence, and on-orbit request-to-image-delivery time.  The anticipated transition partner is the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Membrane Optic Imager Real-Time Exploitation (MOIRE) program enabled the technology for very large aperture optics for space platforms.  MOIRE's diffractive optics significantly reduced the optical tolerances required to create images, enabling very large optical elements to be created.  MOIRE demonstrated the manufacturability of large membranes, large structures to hold the optics tight and flat, and also demonstrate the secondary optical elements needed to turn a diffractive optic (such as fresnel zone plate) into a wide bandwidth imaging device.  MOIRE ended with a technology demonstration that significantly reduces the risk of using these types of optics for flight development.  The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force.</r2:Description>

The program studied using these sources to calculate position and absolute time, and then broadcasting this information to users either on the ground or in space as a method to enhance navigation solutions.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Advanced Electronics Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it seeks to design and demonstrate state-of-the-art manufacturing and processing technologies for the production of various electronics and microelectronic devices, sensor systems, actuators and gear drives that have military applications and potential commercial utility.  Introduction of advanced product design capability and flexible, scalable manufacturing techniques will enable the commercial sector to rapidly and cost-effectively satisfy military requirements.

The MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Integrated Microsystems Technology project is a broad, cross-disciplinary initiative to merge computation and power generation with sensing and actuation to realize a new technology for both perceiving and controlling weapons systems and battlefield environments.  MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems to address issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements.  The project will also address thermal management, navigation and positioning technology challenges.

The goal of the Mixed Technology Integration project is to leverage advanced microelectronics manufacturing infrastructure and DARPA component technologies developed in other projects to produce mixed-technology microsystems.  These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness and security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms.  The chip assembly and packaging processes currently in use produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system.  This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'.  The ability to integrate mixed technologies onto a single substrate will increase performance and reliability, while driving down size, weight, volume and cost.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These issues include microscale power and actuation systems as well as microscale components that survive harsh environments.  The microfluidic molecular systems effort will develop automated microsystems that integrate biochemical fluid handling capability along with electronics, optoelectronics and chip-based reaction and detection modules for tailored sequence analysis to monitor environmental conditions, health hazards and physiological states.  Thermal management technologies will develop heat resistant thermal layers to provide efficient operation for cooling electronic devices.  Another focus in micro technologies is to improve navigation, position and timing capabilities for uncompromised navigation and positioning in today's dynamic military field of operations.

The major technical focus areas of the MEMS and Integrated Microsystems programs contained in this project are: 1) inertial measurement; 2) fluid sensing and control; 3) electromagnetic and optical beam steering; 4) chemical reactions on chip; 5) electromechanical signal processing; 6) analytical instruments; 7) thermal management; and 8) navigation and positioning technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Thermal Management Technologies (TMT)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Thermal Management Technologies (TMT) program is to explore and optimize new nanostructured materials and other recent advances for use in thermal management systems.  The overall goal of the program is to insert breakthrough materials and structures at all layers of DoD systems, and enable higher power densities, increased performance, and improved efficiency.  Innovative research is underway to go beyond evolutionary thermal management systems.  Modern, high-performance heat spreaders, which use two-phase cooling, are being developed to replace the copper alloy spreaders in conventional systems.  Enhancing air-cooled exchangers by reducing the thermal resistance through the heat sink to the ambient, increasing convection through the system, improving heat sink fin thermal conductivity, optimizing and/or redesigning the complimentary heat sink blower, and increasing the overall system (heat sink and blower) coefficient of performance is another thrust of this program.  Another element of this effort is focused on novel materials and structures that can provide significant reductions in the thermal resistance of the thermal interface layer between the backside of an electronic device and the next layer of the package, which might be a spreader or a heat sink.  The TMT program is an aggregation of: Thermal Ground Plane (TGP), Microtechnologies for Air-Cooled Exchangers (MACE), Nano Thermal Interfaces (NTI) and Active Cooling Modules (ACM) technology research.  Technology will be inserted through DoD industrial firms into future DoD systems.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro PN&amp;T) program is developing technology for self-contained chip-scale inertial navigation and precision guidance.  This technology promises to effectively mitigate dependence on Global Positioning System (GPS) or any other external signals, and enable uncompromised navigation and guidance capabilities.  The program will enable positioning, navigation and timing functions without the need for external information updates by employing on-chip calibration, thereby overcoming vulnerabilities which arise in environments where external updates are not available such as caves, tunnels, or dense urban locations.  The technologies developed will enable small, low-power, micro-gyroscopes capable of operating in both moderate and challenging dynamic environments; chip-scale primary atomic clock standards; and on-chip calibration systems for error correction.  Advanced micro-fabrication techniques allow a single package containing all the necessary devices (clocks, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and calibration mechanisms) to be incorporated into a volume the size of a sugar cube.  The small size, weight and power (SWaP) of these technologies and their integration into a single package responds to the needs of guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and individual soldiers.  The Micro PN&amp;T program is an aggregation of Integrated Primary Atomic Clock, Navigate Grade Integrated Micromachined Gyroscopes, Micro Inertial Navigation Technology, Information Tethered Microscale Autonomous Rotary Stages, Micromachined Rate Integrating Gyroscopes, Single-Chip Timing and Inertial Measurement Unit, Primary and Secondary Calibration on Active Layer, and Chip-Scale Combinatorial Atomic Navigator.  The technology is expected to transition through industry and existing DoD transition partnerships with the Services.

To achieve the low SWaP necessary for guided munitions, UAVs, and personal navigation applications, the technologies in the MicroPN&amp;T program will have to push the limitations of integration and performance in current MicroElectroMechanical systems (MEMS) technologies.  Unprecedented levels of precision will be required to meet the stringent demands of the military environment.  New architectures for devices will be developed that will leverage advances in fabrication techniques in order to increase stability and performance of a MEMS structure.  Applied research for this program is funded within PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The goal of the Mixed Technology Integration project is to leverage advanced microelectronics manufacturing infrastructure and DARPA component technologies developed in other projects to produce mixed-technology microsystems.  These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness, security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms.  At the present time, systems are fabricated by assembling a number of mixed-technology components: microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microphotonics, microfluidics and millimeterwave/microwave.  Each technology usually requires a different level of integration, occupies a separate silicon chip and requires off-chip wiring, and requires fastening and packaging to form a module.  The chip assembly and packaging processes produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system.  This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'.

The field of microelectronics incorporates micrometer/nanometer scale integration and is the most highly integrated, low-cost and high-impact technology to date.  Microelectronics technology has produced the microcomputer-chip that enabled or supported the revolutions in computers, networking and communication.  This program extends the microelectronics paradigm to include the integration of heterogeneous or mixed technologies.  This new paradigm will create a new class of 'matchbook-size', highly integrated device and microsystem architectures.  Examples of component-microsystems include low-power, small-volume, lightweight, microsensors, microrobots and microcommunication systems that will improve and expand the performance of the warfighter, military platforms, munitions and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs).

The program includes the integration of mixed materials on generic substrates including glass, polymers and silicon.  The program is design and process intensive, using 'standard' processes and developing new semiconductor-like processes and technologies that support the integration of mixed-technologies at the micrometer/nanometer scale.  The program includes the development of micrometer/nanometer scale isolation, contacts, interconnects and 'multiple-chip-scale' packaging for electronic, mechanical, fluidic, photonic and rf/mmwave/microwave technologies.  For example, a mixed-technology microsystem using integrated microfluidics, MEMS, microphotonics, microelectronics and microwave components could provide a highly integrated, portable analytical instrument to monitor the battlefield environment, the physical condition of a warfighter, the identity of warfighters (friend or foe) or the combat readiness of equipment.  The ability to integrate mixed technologies onto a single substrate will drive down the size, weight, volume, and cost of weapon systems while increasing their performance and reliability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Gratings of Regular Arrays and Trim Exposures (GRATE)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Gratings of Regular Arrays and Trim Exposures (GRATE) program will develop revolutionary circuit design methodologies combined with hybrid lithography tools to enable cost-effective low volume nanofabrication for DoD applications.  Moore's law has driven the silicon industry for several decades with the minimum feature size on an integrated circuit (IC) reduced to 22 nm for today's commercial products.  Due to challenging patterning requirements and complex circuitry, the costs of circuit design and verification, lithography tools and masks, and testing costs have increased exponentially and are unaffordable for low-volume manufacture of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for military electronics.  Consequently, military electronics capabilities are currently limited by the high cost of nanofabrication.  To solve this important problem, DARPA has invested in a variety of maskless patterning technologies including parallel e-beam arrays, parallel scanning probe arrays, and an innovative e-beam lithography tool.  This program will develop revolutionary circuit design methodologies coupled with innovative fabrication techniques and hybrid maskless patterning tools to realize cost-effective nanofabrication for low-volume defense or commercial ASICs.  Such an approach can also address the nanofabrication requirements of other low-volume DoD technologies such as photonics and micro-electro-mechanical systems.  This program will transition via industry.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Advanced Wide FOV Architectures for Image Reconstruction &amp; Exploitation (AWARE) program primarily addresses the passive imaging needs for multi-band, wide field of view (FOV) and high-resolution imaging for ground and near ground platforms.  The AWARE program aims to solve the technological barriers that will enable wide FOV, high resolution and multi-band camera architectures by focusing on four major tasks: High space-bandwidth product (SBP) camera architecture; Small pitch pixel focal plane array architecture; Broadband focal plane array architecture; and Multi-band focal plane array architecture.

The AWARE program will advance integration of technologies that enable wide field of view and high resolution and multi-band cameras, including the technologies demonstrated in the related AWARE program in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.  AWARE aggregates the following programs: Lambda Scale (formerly NIRD), Broadband (formerly PT-SQUAD), Multi-Band (formerly DUDE), and Wide Field of View (formerly MOSAIC).  The integration of the technologies will demonstrate subsystems such as focal plane arrays (FPAs) and cameras.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Excalibur program will develop high-power electronically-steerable optical arrays, with each array element powered by a fiber laser amplifier.  These fiber-laser arrays will be sufficiently lightweight, compact, and electrically efficient to be fielded on a variety of platforms with minimal impact to the platform's original mission capabilities.  Each array element will possess an adaptive-optic capability to minimize beam divergence in the presence of atmospheric turbulence, together with wide-field-of-view beam steering for target tracking.  With each Excalibur array element powered by high power fiber laser amplifiers (at up to 3 kilowatts per amplifier), high power air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements will be enabled that were previously infeasible because of laser system size and weight.  In addition, this program will also develop kilowatt-class arrays of diode lasers which will provide an alternate route to efficiently reaching mission-relevant power levels, and they will test the ultimate scalability of the optical phased array architecture.  Excalibur arrays will be conformal to aircraft surfaces and scalable in size and power by adding elements to the array.  By defending airborne platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles against proliferated, deployed, and next-generation man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), Excalibur will enable these reconnaissance platforms to fly at lower altitude and obtain truly persistent, all-weather ground reconnaissance despite low-lying cloud cover.  Proliferated and emerging threats will be evaluated for the potential of developing a near-term capability utilizing a single high-power fiber laser amplifier.  Further capabilities include multichannel laser communications, target identification, tracking, designation, precision defeat with minimal collateral effects as well as other applications.

The Excalibur program will also develop efficient high-power laser amplifier arrays based on coherent or spectral beam-combining.  The potential of these arrays to scale to tactical power levels (100 kilowatt class) will be investigated.  These laser amplifier arrays will be designed to work in tandem with the core laser components developed under the Excalibur program in PE 0602702E, Project TT-06.  In addition prototype High Energy Laser Counter Measure (HELCM) systems will be developed to enable a near-term capability for low-altitude self-defense against MANPADS.  This technology will transition via industry.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Low Cost Thermal Imager - Manufacturing (LCTI-M) effort builds upon previous manufacturing and imaging work and will develop a pocket-sized, manufacturable, and practical thermal imager at a price point that allows them to be provided to large numbers of warfighters.  Availability of very low cost and small form-factor infrared (IR) cameras will facilitate new techniques and applications that could provide the decisive edge needed in modern battlefields.  These cameras will allow a soldier to have practical thermal imaging capability for locating warm objects (e.g., enemy combatants) in darkness.  The small size, weight and power (SWaP) thermal camera will be integrated with a handheld device such as a cell phone with network capability for tactical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.  In order to achieve this goal, breakthroughs will be required in low-cost thermal imagers manufactured using wafer scale integration, vacuum packaging, low cost optics and low-power signal processing.  By the end of the program, the imager chips will be fully integrated with a low-cost processor and optics.  The camera will have wireless connectivity to integrate video display with cell phones or PDAs.

                                    <r2:Description>The Hemispherical Array Detector for Imaging (HARDI) program exploited the benefits of a hemispherical imaging surface.  The key concept is that a detector array can be fabricated on a hemispherical substrate using materials such as organic/inorganic semiconductors and that this array can be combined with a single simple lens to produce a wide field of view, small form factor camera that operates over a wide spectral range (400 nm to 1900 nm).  Organic materials have been shown to have good electronic and optoelectronic properties including light emission and detection.  Furthermore, in-plane organic/inorganic transistors can be incorporated for pre-processing of images.  Patterning of these materials on the hemispherical surface has been demonstrated by utilizing maskless laser lithography.  This program will transition to DoD systems through a demonstration of an array prototype developed by industrial contractors.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Radio Frequency Photonics Technology (RPT) program developed components and microsystems to revolutionize deployed signal intelligence (SIGINT) gathering capabilities.  The radio frequency (RF) spectrum contains innumerable friendly and adversarial signals of interest including: voice and data communications, electronic signatures, and navigation information.  Conventional electronic systems are challenged in detecting weak signals in the presence of strong ones (low-linearity) across a broad range of frequencies (narrow-band).  The RPT program efficiently captured all RF signals of interest by developing broad-band (>10 gigahertz) high-linearity (>70 decibels dynamic-range) optical components and microsystems.  RPT enabled linear broadband microsystems such as remote links, channelizers, and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).  The RPT program reduced susceptibility to electronic attack, increased the probability-of-intercepting (POI) adversaries on their first-pulse transmission, and increased information awareness 1000-fold.  This technology will transition via industry.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Command, Control and Communications Systems program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because its purpose is to demonstrate and evaluate advanced information systems research and development concepts.

The goals of the Command and Control Information Systems project are to develop and test innovative, secure architectures and tools to enhance information processing, dissemination and presentation capabilities for the commander.  This will give the commander insight into the disposition of enemy and friendly forces, a joint situational awareness picture that will improve planning, decision-making and execution support capability and provide secure multimedia information interfaces and assured software to "on the move" users.  Integration of collection management, planning and battlefield awareness programs is an essential element for achieving battlefield dominance through assured information systems.

The goals of the Information Integration Systems project are to take diverse data inputs from a variety of sources, efficiently disseminate the information, and perform distributed and dynamic all-source correlation and fusion to produce an integrated, geo-spatially referenced, battlefield database and knowledge-base.  The principal element of this project is assured communications using standard and non-traditional means, on and off the battlefield.

The goals of the Secure Information and Network Systems project are to develop and test emerging computer, communications, and network systems where the impact of the systems and the vulnerabilities of the systems are not kinetically based.  Network Security technologies arising from other projects will be further identified, developed, integrated, and tested.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Resilient Command and Control (RC2) program is developing a general framework and set of critical mission assurance capabilities to enable Commanders and their staffs to manage the array of C2 systems and architectures (sensor, communications, and information processing) used to conduct operations.  These adaptive, resilient C2 resource planning and re-planning capabilities will ensure mission success in the face of C2 system outages.  Specific technologies being developed under RC2 include advanced analysis, visualization, and planning tools to provide Commanders and their staffs with a dashboard that enables the following capabilities: (1) attain and maintain situation awareness of the C2 architectures; (2) understand mission impact of outages; and (3) realign the C2 systems to ensure the Commander's intent.  The tools and technologies that result from RC2 will enable operators to detect anomalous behavior via intuitive information displays; assess business function impact, including second- and third-order effects; and re-plan how the system can be used to achieve organizational goals and priorities.  Transition is planned to U.S. Pacific Fleet (PACFLT).</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Urban Leader Tactical Response, Awareness and Visualization (ULTRA-Vis) program developed an integrated, soldier-worn situational awareness system that allows ground forces  to display iconic representations of blue force locations, tactically relevant targets, and coordinated actions and effects.  The icons are geo-registered on the battlefield and viewed from each warfighter's perspective using a see-through, head-mounted display.  The system enabled soldiers to conduct non-line-of-sight combat operations and maintain situational awareness while on the move.  Information management protocols support the dissemination of tactical information to enable a soldier to direct weapons platforms for real-time collaboration without overload.  ULTRA-Vis technologies allows soldiers to selectively receive and visualize critical combat information using existing, low-bandwidth soldier voice and data radios.  ULTRA-Vis has empowered ground forces with a clear tactical advantage through inter/intra-squad collaboration, heightened situational awareness and the ability to take decisive action while on-the-move.  The ULTRA-Vis prototype units are under evaluation by the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), the Army, and the Marines.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The success of military operations depends on timely, reliable, secure, and synchronized dissemination of command and control and relevant situational awareness information to every military echelon.  While wired communications and networks are fairly well developed, providing assured high-bandwidth mobile wireless capabilities that match or exceed commercial wired infrastructure is needed to meet the demands of military users.  The goal of the Information Integration Systems project is to develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide effective communications to U.S. forces.  Approaches to this goal include developing technologies that increase network capacity and scaling, enhance spectrum efficiency in congested spectrum, tolerate network degradation, provide man-made and natural electromagnetic interference mitigation, defeat network reconnaissance and surveillance, counter denial of service and other threats, and autonomously move relevant information from the cloud to the edge.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Wireless Network after Next (WNaN) and Advanced Wireless Networks for the Soldier (AWNS) program goals are to develop and demonstrate technologies and system concepts that will enable densely deployed radio networks to compensate for limitations of the physical layer of a low-cost wireless node.  WNaN/AWNS networks will manage node configurations and the topology of the network to reduce the demands on the physical and link layers of the network.  The technology created by the WNaN/AWNS effort will provide reliable and available battlefield communications at low system cost.  This program will also improve the hardware, firmware, and software to allow the integration of the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) for backward interoperability to legacy communication systems.  AWNS is also investigating the integration of Multi-User Detection (MUD) and Multiple-Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology into the WNaN radio platform to position these technologies for transition into the WNaN radio node.  In addition, this effort will investigate Wireless Distributive Computing (WDC), Content Based Access (CBA), and smart antenna technology to enhance the network and node ability to understand the operating environment, mission concept of operations, and node responsibilities to assist in data processing, information dissemination, and accomplishment of military mission objectives.

In addition, this program will develop a low-cost handheld/body wearable wireless node that can be used to form high-density adhoc networks and gateways to the Global Information Grid.  This program will also develop robust networking architecture(s) and network technologies/processes that will exploit high-density node configurations.  AWNS technology is planned for transition to the U.S. Army.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Communications Under Extreme RF Spectrum Conditions (CommEx)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Communications Under Extreme RF Spectrum Conditions (CommEx) program will develop signal detection and reasoning technology that will allow radios to recognize interference and jamming attacks and then adapt to maintain communications, even in the presence of cognitive jammer attacks and dynamic interference of multiple cognitive network interactions.  The program will develop models of adversary, commercial, and friendly cognitive radios and implement those models in a "reasoner" that assesses, in real time, the current and future dynamics of the communications network.  Core technologies for operation in highly dynamic and/or high jamming to signal environments will be developed to include: automated jamming waveform forensics; RF Environment assessment (time, space, frequency, polarization); technologies for addressing known attack strategies and interference properties; and antenna, RF, signal processing, modulation, and network optimization technology.  Based on predictions of the level of communication success compared to mission communication requirements, the "reasoner" within the cognitive radio will choose waveform selections/configurations that best achieve mission objectives.  The "reasoner" will include the capability to analyze and select optimum frequency, waveform, and network configurations during all aspects of a mission, to include initial alert, ingress, mission, and exfiltration.  The design effort will lead to new radio communication architectures, more robust radio communication networking, and better understanding of selection amongst interference avoidance and interference suppression strategies.

This program also seeks to enable communication between dispersed and distributed emitters and receivers to provide a multiplier in capacity for both locating emitters and assessing effectiveness of an electronic attack.  The CommEx technology is planned for transition to the U.S. Army, Air Force, and Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Previously part of the CommEx program.  

Commercial Test and Measurement equipment has advanced greatly with the emergence of sophisticated cellular and wireless local area network technology and can be used to intercept, analyze and exploit our military communications signals.  Building upon technologies investigated under the COMMEX Program, the Computational Leverage Against Surveillance Systems (CLASS) program seeks new ways to protect our signals from increasingly sophisticated adversaries and to do so in a way that can be maintained as technology advances.  Three different techniques are being developed: 1) Waveform Complexity uses advanced communications waveforms that are difficult to recover without knowledge and understanding of the signals itself; 2) Spatial Diversity uses distributed communications devices and the communication environment to disguise and dynamically vary the apparent location of the signal;  3) Interference Exploitation makes use of the clutter in the signal environment to make it difficult for an adversary to isolate a particular signal.  The objective of the program is to make modular communications technology that is inexpensive to incorporate in existing and emerging radio systems (&lt;$100 incremental cost) but pushes adversaries to need more than 1,000x our processing power - "supercomputer" level processing power.  Technologies from this program are planned to transfer to the U.S. Army's Communications - Electronics Command.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly known as Cloud to the Edge

The goal of this program is to provide tactical warfighters operating at the edge with interactive, on-demand access to relevant information and a greater ability for real-time sharing of new operational content.  This content can include images, video, maps, and databases.  Ubiquitous access to relevant situational awareness and command and control information throughout the battle space is a key objective.  Advances in key technologies are enabling high-capacity communications to the edge.  However, the current centralized or regional storage and dissemination of information presents security, reliability, and capacity challenges in identifying and distributing relevant information to users at the edge.  Commercial industry has developed approaches to the autonomous dissemination of high demand information by using distributed servers and advanced networking and information database technologies, combined with highly-reliable fixed networking infrastructure with embedded complex information exploitation tools.  This program will leverage commercial capabilities to develop and demonstrate the technologies and prototype systems in networking, servers, and information dissemination techniques to enable efficient, and robust content distribution using dynamic, mobile, ad hoc military networks.  Capabilities from this effort will transition to the DoD.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Communications requirements are growing exponentially due to the proliferation of high-data rate sensors (video), UAVs, and the emergence of the Soldier/Marine as both an operator and a sensor.  Available spectrum is static and this data growth has created a 100-1,000x mismatch of data needs and available network capacity.  Mobile Hot Spots will provide an analog to the commercial wired solution to exploding high bandwidth requirements that relies on a hierarchical approach using core networks, regional/neighborhood distribution networks, and distributed access points.  This program will develop the high data rate mobile communications technologies that are required to close the capacity gap and create spectrally efficient, and secure wireless technologies by exploiting advances in high-frequency millimeter wave and optical communications technologies.  This effort will leverage commercial off the shelf short range, high speed communications access portals and scalable high data rate networking technologies.  Trade-offs between scaling capacity, high data rate, communications overhead, system overhead (size, weight, and power), and mobility will be addressed.  The Mobile Hot Spots program is targeted to transition to the Army and Marine Corps Expeditionary Forces.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Unlike commercial wireless communications, the military cannot count on a set of secure, fixed cell towers to establish wireless networks capable of receiving and distributing large amounts of data from distributed sources.  Rather, such communication must rely on approaches such as balloons and temporary communication towers that have a high logistical burden and are extremely vulnerable.  Building upon technologies investigated under other programs in this project, the Fixed Wireless at a Distance program will overcome these limitations by developing a re-locatable, long-range (10-100s of km) communication infrastructure that provides high-capacity (10s of Mbps) data links from within a protected space.  The key innovation in this program is the use of a large number of rapidly deployable, distributed, ground-based antenna arrays that can form a coherent aperture for directional transmission and reception of information to/from tactical wireless networks.  Program challenges include the fundamental limits (power and extent) of transmitter gain as well as the rapid and practical deployment of the ground-based arrays.  When completed, the Fixed Wireless at a Distance program will extend the reach of tactical communication systems by 10X without the need for vulnerable and costly infrastructure.  This technology is planned to transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>One of the key advantages on the battlefield is the ability to actively sense and manipulate the RF environment, enabling secure communications as well as effectively mapping and manipulating the adversary's communications in ways that defy their awareness, understanding, or response.  Current approaches for dealing with RF are emitter-based, with the signal processing techniques focused on array and time based processing for each emitter.  As the RF environment becomes more complex and cluttered, the number of strategic assets and commensurate signal processing inhibits effectiveness and sustainability to sense and manipulate at the precision (time, frequency, and space) required for effective action.  To address these shortfalls, the Advanced RF Mapping program will develop and demonstrate new concepts for sensing the RF environment based on distributed rather than emitter-based collection.  These concepts take advantage of the proliferation of RF devices (radios, cell phones) on the battlefield.  To use these devices effectively, the program will develop new algorithms that can map the RF environment with minimal communication load between sensors.  It will also develop approaches for exploiting our precise knowledge of the RF environment and the distributed proximity of the RF devices to provide secure communications for our warfighter as well as to infiltrate or negate our adversaries' communications networks.  For example, if synchronizing distributed elements to &lt;10 picosecond is achievable, coherent RF power projection at UHF frequencies from distributed devices would be possible.  Building upon technologies investigated under other programs in this project, the Advanced RF Mapping program will enable both offensive and defensive operations in complex RF environments.  Advanced RF Mapping technology is planned to transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>A highly networked and enabled force increases efficiency, effectiveness, and safety while reducing cost by making the right information available at the right time to every person and system that needs it.  Accomplishing this depends on providing reliable wireless communications to all U.S. forces, platforms, and devices in all phases of conflict.  The Highly Networked Force program seeks to overcome key limitations of current technology to realize the fully network-enabled force by addressing issues such as: lack of coverage due to operation in challenged locations or loss of relays or links; lack of capacity due to inefficient allocation of scarce spectral resources; lack of connectivity due to networks that cannot keep up with the high rate of change; and lack of expected service due to uncoordinated management of sub-networks and gateways.  Technologies developed under this program will be transitioned to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Optical &amp; RF Combined Link Experiment (ORCLE) program seeks to develop combined radio frequency (RF) and free space optical (FSO) communications as well as networking technologies that exploit the benefits of complementary path diversity.  This effort encompasses the extension of research into the FSO/RF Internet Protocol-based Network system, called Optical RF Communications Adjunct (ORCA).  Using optical and RF communication techniques, ORCLE will demonstrate improved battlespace communications using a hybrid RF and FSO link in air-to-air-to-ground environments.  The central challenge is to enable optical communications bandwidth without giving up RF reliability, regardless of the weather.  ORCLE will develop RF and FSO propagation channel analysis, coding techniques, and modeling to include weather, atmospherics, and aero-optics to provide the joint force commander assured high-data rate communications.  The technical objective is to prototype and flight demonstrate hybrid FSO/RF air-to-air-to-ground links that combine the best attributes of both technologies and simulate hybrid network performance.  The ORCLE technology is planned for transition to the Air Force.</r2:Description>

This program applied the technologies to signal processing functions typically performed in digital form, which experience design complexity, high power consumption, thermal loads, limits to computational speeds, loss in dynamic range, and susceptibility to manufacturing variances.  The Analog Logic program built and demonstrated an analog-only signal processing capability with no local oscillator, down-conversion, or analog-to-digital conversion.  The goal was to achieve a 10 times reduction in gate count, a 1024 Point Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) with 8 bits equivalent dynamic range, and functional performance within 0.5dB of digital performance.  Further, the program investigated the system-level impact of Analog Logic on other embedded processing problems as well as the feasibility of creating programmable embedded processing solutions in this technology.

This effort demonstrated the MNM capability under dynamic urban Non-Line-of-Sight multipath channel conditions where conventional techniques are degraded.  This effort also advanced MIMO technology development and performed field demonstrations of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), culminating in the development of a wideband form-factor system for use in tactical edge devices, such as troops, vehicles, and robotics.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Computer, networking, and communication technologies have rapidly matured in the last decade and have had a profound effect on DoD weapons systems.  In many instances the combination of those technologies has become either the integral piece of many of the emerging traditional land, air, and sea based weapon platforms or have become a stand alone, non-platform based virtual weapon system.  In recognition of this fact, the Secure Information and Network Systems project will develop and test emerging computer, communications, and network systems where the impact of the systems and the vulnerabilities of the systems are not kinetically based.  The project will develop, integrate, and test prototypes of promising network security technologies generated in projects such as, but not limited to, those developed in DARPA's Information &amp; Communications Program Element (PE 0602303E) and Cognitive Computing Systems Program Element (PE 0602304E).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Cyber Insider Threat (CINDER) program will develop technologies for identifying advanced cyber threat missions that may be currently ongoing within DoD and government interest systems and networks.  The program focuses on identifying ongoing adversary missions rather than a person, program, or particular piece of malware.  Current cyber defenses are primarily based on network and host intrusion detection and look for break-ins and abnormal behavior without context.  The CINDER program will build tools and techniques that apply mission templates of advanced cyber espionage onto seemingly normal internal system and network activity.  Through this CINDER will uncover ongoing advanced persistent cyber threats and espionage within our cyber environments.  Capabilities from this program will transition to DoD and/or the defense industrial base.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Network-Centric Warfare Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts.  It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission.  The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system.

The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are:  (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  

The Maritime Systems project will identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Naval forces play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>This program builds upon the past achievements of the High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System (HELLADS) development program and the Aero-Adaptive Aero-Optic Beam Control (ABC) program, budgeted in DARPA PE 0602702E, Project TT-06.  The goal of the HELLADS program is to develop a high-energy laser weapon system that will provide an order of magnitude reduction in weight compared to existing laser systems.  HELLADS will enable high-energy lasers (HELs) to be integrated onto tactical aircraft and will significantly increase engagement ranges compared to ground-based systems, in addition to enabling high precision/low collateral damage and rapid engagement of fleeting targets for both offensive and defensive missions.  Advancements in beam control and other subsystems that are required for the practical integration of a laser weapon into existing tactical platforms will be explored.  With the assistance of the Services, the HELLADS program will pursue the necessary analysis, coordination, and design activity for a prototype laser weapon system incorporating the HELLADS laser system and the ABC turret into air, ground, or sea-based tactical vehicles.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Legged Squad Support System (LS3) program will explore the development of a mission-relevant quadruped platform scaled to unburden the infantry squad and hence unburden the soldier.  In current operations, soldiers carry upwards of 50lbs of equipment, in some cases over 100lbs, over long distances in terrain not always accessible by wheeled platforms that support infantry.  As a result, the soldier's combat effectiveness can be compromised.  The LS3 program will design and develop prototypes capable of carrying 400lbs of payload for 20 miles in 24 hours, negotiating terrain at endurance levels expected of typical squad maneuvers.  LS3 will leverage technical breakthroughs of prior biologically inspired legged platform development efforts.  It will develop system designs to the scale and performance adequate for infantry squad mission applications, focusing on platform, control, and human-machine interaction capabilities, as well as secondary design considerations, such as acoustic signature.  Anticipated service users include the Army, Marines, and Special Forces.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Robotics Olympics*</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Robotic Activators and Physical Performance Improvements in Dynamic Environments (RAPPIDE)

Advancements are being made in land-capable, high degree-of-freedom unmanned platforms to enable mobility over very complex terrain.  Many current prototypes are inspired by biological systems and while proof-of-principle systems have or are demonstrating unprecedented mobility, limitations have emerged.  Advanced capabilities in perception, control, and physical capability/coordination are needed to work autonomously in human environments.  These are critical enablers for performing mission-relevant tasks in austere and remote regions, partially-destroyed roads, high-threat anti-access/area denied environments, rubble-filled areas, and providing greater range/endurance for soldiers, platforms, and personnel.

The Robotics Olympics program will boost innovation in autonomous systems and expand platform utility through enhanced actuation, energy density, perception, locomotion, agile reconfiguration, and design efficiency.  Program thrusts are centered on a progressive regimen of physical problem solving, real-time team oriented tasks, and dynamic adaptation designed to build "machine trust", especially when integrated with humans in a variety of operational environments.  The Robotics Olympics program consists of a series of Olympic and military obstacle course style challenge events that will focus on technology solutions to demonstrate and test robot athleticism for human capabilities.  Robotics Olympics events will drive advances in power systems, agility and speed, precision in perception tied to platform coordination, dexterity, and impulsive power.  Program objectives focus on regenerative technologies to expand mobility and extend endurance of unmanned platforms, advanced tactile and manipulation capabilities, and tools for cost effective test, build, and validation of autonomous technology.  

The effort is also aimed at inspiring and promoting Science Technology and Mathematics (STEM) initiatives.  Anticipated Service users include the Army, Marines, and Special Forces.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Counter Laser Technologies program is to develop a suite of technologies to increase the survivability of United States weapons platforms when encountering a high energy laser attack.  Laser countermeasures include systems and materials for detection and warning, material treatments to harden vulnerable surfaces, computer models to plan mission engagements to favor U.S. system survivability when under high energy laser attack, and techniques to degrade or destroy the offending laser weapon.  The High Energy Laser (HEL) lethality of concern in this program is apart from on-going efforts within the Services for sensor or eye protection from laser illumination.  Counter Laser Technologies addresses the HEL's ability to deposit energy on the weapon or platform to melt through, fracture, or weaken the body, thereby disabling or destroying it.  This effort will initially focus on characterizing the vulnerability mechanisms of a candidate set of weapons and platforms, developing warning systems to rapidly determine the attributes of the inbound threat (vector of origin, wavelength, power, format), and developing material solutions (skin treatments, material hardening methods).  Additional effort will focus on ways to proactively degrade or destroy offending laser performance by altering the laser's internal optics or by modifying the laser's line of sight to the target.  Technologies from this program will transition to platform and weapon system developers in all Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>This program will develop methods and technologies to enable our forces to manage the adversary's sensory perception to confuse, delay, inhibit, or misdirect their actions in the highly dynamic, close-range, visual/acoustic-dominated environment.  The current operational art of human-sensory battlefield deception is largely an ad-hoc practice; advancements in the understanding of how humans use their brains to process sensory inputs will inform the development of techniques and systems in the auditory and visual regimes to provide tactical advantage for our forces, and provide technology tools for incorporation into the design of battlefield systems.  This interdisciplinary effort will develop methodologies based on human cognitive insights and investigations, and apply those methodologies to develop, integrate, demonstrate and assess the operational effectiveness of advanced human-deceptive technologies on military ground, sea, and airborne systems.  Technologies from this program are anticipated to transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

GEO algorithm architectures were explored to achieve scalability through spatial, temporal and ontological partitioning.  GEO technologies are planned for transition to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).  Activities funded within the GEO research space include:

The Urban Reasoning and Geospatial Exploitation Technology (URGENT) program developed a 3-D urban object recognition and exploitation system that enabled advanced mission planning and situation analysis capabilities for the warfighter operating in urban environments.  URGENT created techniques for the rapid exploitation of EO and LIDAR sensor data at the city scale to recognize urban objects down to the soldier scale.  

The Geospatial Representation Integrated Dataspace (GRID) program investigated an automated geospatial data fusion, modeling, and dissemination technology for the tactical warfighter.  Geospatial registration algorithms have demonstrated success in automatically fusing geospatial data from multiple Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sources (e.g., electro-optical, full motion video, hyperspectral, and LIDAR) and encoding the fused data as a temporally indexed volumetric model that can potentially reduce geospatial theater ISR sensor data storage requirements while enhancing image quality for exploitation.</r2:Description>

Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The diesel-electric submarine is an asymmetric threat in terms of its cost and consequential growth in numbers relative to our legacy maritime platforms.  In addition, these submarines have trended toward lower acoustic signature levels, and have grown in lethality.  The Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program intends to reverse the asymmetric advantage of this threat through the development of advanced standoff sensing from unmanned systems.  Deep ocean sonar nodes will operate at significant depths in open ocean areas to achieve large fields of view to detect submarines overhead.  Each deep node is the maritime equivalent of a satellite, and is referred to as a subullite.  The significant field of view, along with the advantage of low-noise phenomena at extreme depths will permit a scalable number of collaborative sensor platforms to detect and track submarines over large areas.  For the vast shallow continental shelf areas, the program similarly adopts distributed mobile sensors, but instead leverages insights in non-acoustic sensing from above.  The effort is highly focused on achieving new detection modalities with sufficient low power, weight, and size, to enable UAV implementations.  Initial efforts will focus on identifying the best detection methods leveraged from state-of-the-art sensors and new physical and operational insights.  From this work, prototype systems will evolve through at-sea testing and sensor integration.  The program will achieve breakthrough technology for long-range detection and classification, communications, energy management, sensor and platform integration, and robust semiautonomous processing and control for distributed sensing platforms.  This program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Increasing requirements for missions in shallow littoral waters have created a need for a survivable and cost-effective capability to perform intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, antisubmarine warfare, special operations forces, and other missions in the littorals.  Today we risk manned submarines in waters that are shallower than the length of our hulls and we pit these high value assets against diesel electric submarines that in some cases pose an overmatching threat against our systems in these shallow waters.  The Unmanned/Minimally-manned Underwater Vehicle (UMUV) program will develop a vehicle specifically designed to operate in the littoral battlespace with the capability of performing littoral missions that span a wide range of complexity and can be performed with a small manned crew or autonomously (i.e., unmanned) depending upon mission requirements.  The UMUV will have the autonomy, range and endurance to drive to the fight from a safe basing location, will be capable of carrying the full range of payloads that are needed to support operational needs in littoral waters, and will provide the capability to perform missions where risk to personnel limits our willingness to execute these missions.  The program will explore low-cost derivatives of commercial underwater vehicles, the integration of advanced communication and sensor technologies, and the teaming of the UMUV with manned systems.  The UMUV program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Structural Logic program is developing platform structures and frames that can adapt to varying loads and simultaneously exhibit both high stiffness and high damping.  This program will demonstrate the utility of negative stiffness structural elements developed under the Multifunctional Materials and Structures program, budgeted in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-01, in the ridged support frames of real world DoD platforms.  As the demands on military platforms increase, so does the need for structures to mitigate the shock and vibrations applied by dynamic environments.  Today's structures exhibit limited adaptability and typically achieve either extreme stiffness or damping.  In military platforms, extremely stiff structures provide high strength, but readily transfer loads to passengers often resulting in serious injury.  Conversely, existing damping structures can reduce the load transferred to passengers, but only at the expense of structural strength and integrity.  By demonstrating the ability to combine stiffness, damping, and dynamic range in a single structure, the Structural Logic program will enable the design of military platforms with the ability to continually adapt their properties to match the demands of a dynamic environment.  The program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Thermal Management System for Ship Decks (TMD)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>It is anticipated that the high engine exhaust temperatures from the next generation of Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft deployed on Navy ships will dramatically reduce the life of both the deck structure and the non-skid surfaces.  The Thermal Management System for Ship Decks (TMD) addressed this problem by demonstrating a heat distribution system with an integrated thermally-stable non-skid coating.  The TMD transitioned to the Navy for integration into amphibious assault ships.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Persistent Ocean Surveillance (POS) program combined geolocation techniques, such as global positioning systems, with station keeping and intra-sensor communication technologies to provide long-term ocean environment sensing buoys.  A range of technologies were considered, including those that rely on the local environment (i.e., wind, ocean waves, solar energy, temperature differentials) for their power; miniature geolocation technologies; and technologies for sensor data storage, transmission, and intra-field communications.  The Renewable At-Sea Power program focused on efficient energy capture from the environment in order to achieve capability for fully renewable power at sea.  Technology from this program has been made available for transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The River Eye effort provided a new capability to predict or assess, in real time, river and estuary conditions that enable special operations mission planning and execution.  New techniques were developed to indirectly determine current speed and direction by remotely sensing advection of scene features.  Estimated bathymetry data was obtained from this current data and advanced inverse-circulation modeling.  Forward circulation models used the bathymetry data to predict future currents and water heights in a mission planning decision support tool.  An initial set of algorithms and processes transitioned to the Navy and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in FY 2010; in FY 2011, the algorithms were extended to enable night-time capability, and water depth retrieval algorithms were investigated.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Sensors Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability and battle damage assessment.  

The Surveillance and Countermeasures Technology project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems.  Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with tactical information needed to succeed in future wars.  Additionally, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats.  

The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor processing technologies and systems necessary for the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) mission.  The project is primarily driven by four needs:  1) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; 2) countering camouflage, concealment and deception of mobile ground targets; 3) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near real-time; and 4) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control, tracking, timely engagement and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.

The Exploitation Systems project develops algorithms, software, and information processing systems to extract information from massive intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) datasets.  In particular, it develops new technologies for detection and discrimination of targets from clutter, classification and fingerprinting of high value targets, localization and tracking over wide areas, and threat network identification and analysis.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars.  This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner.  This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems.  In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Title>Adaptable Navigation Systems (ANS)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Adaptable Navigation Systems (ANS) program will provide the U.S. warfighter with the ability to navigate effectively in all environments, including when Global Positioning System (GPS) is unavailable due to hostile action (jamming) or blockage by structures and foliage.  The ANS approach relies on two major technology innovations.  The first is the use of Signals of Opportunity (SoOp) from a variety of ground, air, and space-based sources.  These will be received on the Services' forthcoming software-defined radios and use specially tailored algorithms to determine position.  The second technology innovation allows SoOp-based position information to be combined with inertial and other sensors to enable flexible navigation systems that can be reconfigured in the field to support any platform or environment.  While component technology for positioning, navigation, and timing is advancing rapidly (in the form of Micro Electro-Mechanical System devices, clocks, and new aiding sensors), real-time integration and reconfiguration of these components is not possible given today's navigation filters and centralized processing architectures, which are inherently fragile to change.  Recent advances in mathematics, data abstraction, and network architectures could enable "plug-and-play" integration of both existing and future navigation components to allow real-time integration and reconfiguration of navigation systems.  If successful, major improvements in navigation accuracy and system cost could also be realized.  Early transition partners would include all Services, with emphasis on platforms and users that must operate in multiple environments.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The objective of the Adaptable, Low Cost Sensor program is to leverage commercial technology and commercial manufacturing techniques to improve the development time and significantly reduce the cost of sensors and sensor systems.  Military sensors are currently developed as unique designs that fully integrate mission specific hardware required for sensing, with all of the other non-mission specific capabilities, including sensors (GPS), processing, memory storage and communications into a single device.  Not only does this approach significantly increase the cost of the device, it makes changing requirements and the upgrading of any specific component extremely difficult.  Nevertheless, significant advances have been made in the capabilities of commercial equipment for almost all of those capabilities, mostly driven by the smart phone industry.  This makes it possible to create a mission-independent, designed-to-cost "commercial smart core" that can be combined with an appliqué of mission-specific hardware to provide the overall sensing capability.  Because the core can be upgraded independently of any particular sensor, sensors can make use of the advances and decreasing cost that is inherent in commercial technology.  Because commercial technology can be used in the core, commercial development and manufacturing techniques can also be leveraged, further improving the cost and development time of sensor systems.  In addition, this program will enable effective distributed sensor systems that were previously infeasible due to high cost of individual sensors.  This program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

This program developed techniques to inject and recover probing radar waveforms and unravel the complicated multipath in the return signals to enable the mapping and characterization of building interiors.  Radar signals were used to image static structures directly.  Doppler processing of radar signals was also being exploited to find, identify, and perform feature-aided tracking of moving personnel within a building and allow mapping of building pathways and stairways by monitoring traffic through buildings.  Multipath and propagation effects were modeled and iteratively compared with hypotheses of building structures to provide 3-D building maps and large concentrations of metal materials like weapons.  Technologies developed under this program will be made available to the Army and U.S. SOCOM for transition.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The expanded use of passive electro-optic (EO) sensors for detection and tracking (Infrared Search &amp; Track Systems and Forward Looking Infrared Radar Systems) has increased the threat to our airborne systems.  These sensors negate the advantages of our radars and radio frequency (RF)-based countermeasures such as digital radio frequency memory (DRFM).  When used in the presence of DRFM and other RF countermeasures by our adversaries, EO sensors could provide overmatching defensive capabilities.  The Multi-Function Optical Sensing program will provide an alternative approach to detecting, tracking, and performing non-cooperative target identification, as well as providing fire control for fighter class and long-range strike aircraft.  This approach leverages emerging high-sensitivity focal plane array (FPA) and compact, multiband laser systems technology in the near/mid/long-wave infrared bands to develop a multi-function optical system.  Technical challenges include the demonstration of inexpensive, multiband, large-format, photon-counting, high-bandwidth receivers and their integration into a multi-optical sensor suite compatible with airborne assets.  The Multi-Function Optical Sensor program will result in an airborne system that can detect, geolocate, and identify targets at standoff ranges.  Technologies from this program will transition into the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The proliferation of optical communications and sensor systems has created a need for electronic warfare (EW) approaches that can be used in the electro-optical (EO) domain.  Unfortunately, while there is a sophisticated suite of counter RF approaches, there is no such capability against EO signals, which are hard to find; and when found, even harder to suppress.  The EO Warfare program will extend EW into the optical domain by developing the capacity to defeat EO systems including: laser communications systems, EO/IR sensors, and laser imagers and seekers.  This program will exploit the significant advances that have been made in compact lasers, laser spectrum agility, and microelectronics to develop optical EW systems including an optical digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) equivalent.  Key challenges include detection and processing of optical signals for sensors (photon gating, embedded signal processing) integrated with detector arrays, and adaptive and computational optics that can be applied to finding EO-based communications and active sensors.  The product of the EO Warfare program is to develop new techniques and systems that can defeat laser communications and active optical sensor systems at >50km range.  Improved understanding of countermeasures to active sensors will also improve the robustness of our own developmental and fielded Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and communications systems.  Technologies from this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Multi-Modal Tunnel Detection</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>In today's asymmetric warfare, adversaries' persistent and expanded use of underground tunnels for tactical advantage is largely unchallenged.  Underground and subterranean tunnels are being increasingly employed to hide a variety of tactical and strategic functions, including command and control, missile and artillery protection, lines of communication and staging area for military operations.  Today's tunnel detection systems are based on single mode commercial sensor technology (Ground Penetrating Radar, seismic, resistivity, gravity, cone penetrator, and electromagnetic gradiometer).  Despite significant technical efforts, these approaches still fail to identify tunnels in the presence of variable geology and urban complexity and clutter.  Moreover, there is currently no technical basis for combining these modes into a more powerful detection schema.  The Multi-Modal Tunnel Detection program will overcome these limitations by going back to basics to exploit the underlying physics of a tunnel's response to a variety of energy sources (acoustic, seismic, electromagnetic, chemical, resistivity, conductivity, lidar, multi/hyperspectral, and gravity/gravity gradient).  This multi-sensor approach will be used in conjunction with advanced mathematics, new algorithms and processing techniques to develop and demonstrate approaches that optimally combine sensor modalities to characterize tunnels and reject clutter.  Upon completion the Multi-Modal Tunnel Detection program will deny the use of underground facilities that currently thwart our existing ISR systems.  This capability is expected to transition to the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Special Operations Command upon completion of a system demonstration phase.</r2:Description>

This includes command and control, weapons storage, manufacture of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and tunnel networks that breach secure borders and perimeters.  By passively capturing emissions associated with underground facility presence and operations, and doing so using airborne sensors (acoustic, electromagnetic, gravity gradiometry), LAASS significantly increased our ability to seek out underground facilities and map out their vulnerabilities and backbone structure.  LAASS technologies have been made available to Northern Command, Southern Command, Strategic Command, and Defense Threat Reduction Agency for transition.</r2:Description>

The system used a wideband radio frequency signal with low power and extremely low duty cycle.  The program developed a small, rugged transponder that provides a call for help to friendly forces.  The RT system operates over ranges that enable rescue forces or surveillance systems to receive its signals.  It supports accurate localization by rescue forces, and permits transmission of identifying, authenticating, and status information.  The RT technology is transitioning to the Marine Corps.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Lightning Based (Sferic) Underground Geo-positioning (S-BUG) program addressed the challenges presented when navigating and tracking within underground structures, both manmade and natural, by exploiting the abundance and long propagation range of naturally occurring global lightning events.  As conceived, surface receivers at known locations will compare time difference of arrival of very low frequency (VLF) sferic events and employ super-resolution correlation techniques to accurately determine the VLF source locations.  Any subsurface receiver could also detect the sferics, and real time or post-mission correlation with the surface data will enable geo-location of the subsurface receiver.  Exploitation of naturally-occurring, nondeniable signals has the potential to significantly reduce logistical requirements and increase operational standoff by orders of magnitude (1000+ km).  Technologies have been made available to transition to the U.S. SOCOM and the Army.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.  Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery.  The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.  The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The Behavioral Learning for Adaptive Electronic Warfare (BLADE) program will develop the capability to jam adaptive and rapidly evolving radio frequency (RF) threats in tactical environments and at tactically-relevant timescales.  This will change the paradigm for responding to evolving threats from lab-based manual development to an adaptive in-the-field systems approach.  When an unknown or advanced RF threat appears, BLADE networked nodes will dynamically characterize the emitter, synthesize an effective countering technique, and evaluate jamming effectiveness by iteratively probing, learning, and adapting to the threat.  An optimization process will tailor near-real-time responses to specific threats, producing a countermeasure waveform that maximizes jam effectiveness while minimizing the required jamming resources.  Thus BLADE will enable the rapid defeat of new RF threats and provide the warfighter with real-time feedback on jam effectiveness.  The program is planned for transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Military Imaging and Surveillance Technology (MIST) program will develop a fundamentally new optical ISR capability that can provide high-resolution 3-D images to locate and identify a target at much longer ranges than is possible with existing optical systems.  Several prototype optical surveillance and observation systems will be developed that will: (1) demonstrate probabilities of recognition and identification at distances sufficient to allow stand-off engagement; (2) overcome atmospheric turbulence, which now limits the ability of high-resolution optics; and (3) increase target identification confidence to reduce fratricide and/or collateral damage.  The program will develop and integrate the necessary component technologies including high-energy pulsed lasers, receiver telescopes that have a field of view and depth of field that obviates the need for steering or focusing the optical system, computational imaging algorithms to improve system resolution, and data exploitation and analysis tools. 

Advances in laser systems, digital imagers, and novel image processing algorithms will be leveraged to reduce the overall size, weight and power of imaging systems to allow for soldier portable and UAV platform integration. 

MIST will also continue to integrate technologies developed under the Crosswind Sensor System for Snipers (C-WINS) and the Dynamic Image Gunsight Optics (DInGO) efforts.  MIST will develop an optical rifle scope that enables a soldier, with minimal training, to shoot a firearm with marksman accuracy at range while also enhancing the capability for close quarters combat.  The MIST program will transition the developed rifle-scope to the Army, Marines, and Special Operations Forces.  The optical ISR technology will transition to the Air Force and SOCOM.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Multifunction RF program initially developed a helicopter pilot performance enhancement system for landing in degraded visual environments (DVE) such as dust clouds.  Beyond landing aids in DVE, RF-based sensors can also be used for additional situational awareness, such as near ground obstacle avoidance, air-to-air collision avoidance, targeting/fire control, as well as many other combat support activities.  Building on advancements made with RF sensors under this program, the program will further seek to eliminate many redundant RF elements of current independently-developed systems for landing in DVEs, terrain avoidance, obstacle avoidance, and targeting/fire control.  This will reduce the overall weight, power usage, cost, and profusion of exterior antennas on military aircraft, thus enabling greater mission capability with reduced vehicle system integration burden.  Transition is planned to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Advanced Airborne Optical Sensing</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>The Advanced Airborne Optical Sensing program is developing electro-optical and infrared sensors and processing technologies for aerial platforms.  Significant challenges have arisen as the result of two warfighting trends.  First, the ever-changing mix of airborne platforms now includes a greater number of smaller UAVs.  Second, the target set is increasingly challenging and now includes vehicles and individual dismounts that operate under foliage and in urban canyons, using camouflage, obscurants, and other means of concealment.  In response to these challenges, the Advanced Airborne Optical Sensing program has developed enhanced optical, electro-optical, photonic and other technologies for airborne optical sensing systems.  Specific examples of these technologies include: embedded image processors tailored to real-time detection, identification, and tracking of military targets; advanced laser radar technologies; hyper-spectral sensing technologies; flash detection and underwater object detection; advanced digital signal processing to support onboard image reconstruction, atmospheric correction, and system calibration; and adaptive optics techniques, such as deformable mirrors and liquid crystal spatial light modulators.  The program has extended these technologies and is making them practical for airborne surveillance systems. Efforts in this program include:

- The Standoff Precision ID in 3-D (SPI 3-D) program developed an affordable sensor package capable of high-resolution 3-D imaging for confirmatory target ID at long ranges, as well as full field of view (FOV) ranging to support precise geolocation of targets.  The program included a series of ground-based and airborne demonstrations of SPI 3-D capabilities including: (1) high range resolution 3-D imaging; (2) full FOV range to pixel determination; (3) multiple frame-to-frame registration of imagery; and (4) GPS-based cueing from search systems.  The program will also produce high speed, ultra-sensitive photo detectors for systems requiring operation at very low photon counts.  This supports long-range sensors that can detect highly obscured targets under canopy/camouflage as well as very wide-area searches for submerged targets, including sea mines and semi-submerged mobile vessels.

- The HALOE (High Altitude Lidar Operations Experiment) program has demonstrated, in an operational environment, the full capability of a 3-D imaging system.  The HALOE system provides support for current and emerging warfighter needs by delivering high-resolution, wide-area 3-D lidar imagery data in the OCONUS environment.  This system provides the unprecedented capability to collect accurate, high resolution 3-D data over wide areas to support a wide range of high-value applications, including detailed mission planning, vertical obstruction detection, helicopter landing zone analysis, and imagery geolocation.  The pathway to accomplish this goal includes improving the robustness and reliability of the sensor, conducting demonstrations, and training with CONUS flight tests leading to OCONUS operational experimentation in partnership with the Army.

HALOE successfully completed the CONUS flight testing phase and was deployed OCONUS for further testing and system checkout to address current and emerging needs of U.S. forces under the direction of commanders in theater during 2011.  The completed HALOE system will transition to the U.S. Army. 

- The Tactical Aircraft to Increase Long Wave Infrared Nighttime Detection (TAILWIND) program developed a system for collecting and processing IR data operating as a framing sensor.  The system accepts long wave infrared and color camera images permitting day/night reconnaissance for real-time target detection and tracking.  The resulting sensor and processing system will decrease the time required to focus the sensor operator's attention on relevant targets.  The TAILWIND system is planned for transition to the U.S. Army.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Recent conflicts have demonstrated the need for close air support by precision attack platforms such as the AC-130J or the MH-60 class helicopters in support of ground forces.  Under clear conditions, targets are easily-identified and engaged quite effectively, but in degraded environments the atmosphere is not always clear, and inhibits traditional optical sensors.  The AC-130J must fly above cloud decks in order to avoid anti-aircraft fire, and this negates optical targeting sensors.  Similarly, rotary/wing blades in urban operations generate copious amounts of dust that block circling assets from supplying cover fire for ground forces.  The Video-rate Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) program will develop a real-time spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging sensor that will provide imagery of a region to allow high-resolution fire direction in conditions where optical sensors do not function.  Technology from this program is planned to transition to AFSOC.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>* Previously called Wide Area Video Surveillance

The Autonomous Real-time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance program is developing airborne sensor systems that provide a persistent, real-time, high-resolution, wide-area, day-night video surveillance capability.  The ARGUS Infrared System (ARGUS-IR) uses an advanced infrared (IR) composite focal plane array (CFPA) sensor.  The nighttime persistent capability provided by ARGUS-IR combined with the daytime capability provided by the ARGUS Imaging System (ARGUS-IS) enables 24-hour day/night surveillance.  ARGUS-IR's wide-area, high-update-rate, high-resolution imaging capability will enable detection and tracking of dismounts as well as vehicles.  ARGUS-IR will utilize the signal/image processor developed as part of ARGUS-IS, enabling ARGUS-IS and ARGUS-IR to be combined on a common platform.  ARGUS-IR must overcome a number of demanding technical challenges related to the IR Focal Plane Array and size, weight, and power constraints for the IR sensor.  A transition plan is being developed with the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army.</r2:Description>

The program used an array of nodes that have synchronized clocks to enable the signal from each node to be aligned so that the carrier and phase jamming are focused on the specific target area and do not affect the non-target area.  Each node contains localization, network, synchronization, and jamming processing and communication in a low-cost, easily deployable package.

                                    <r2:Description>The Large Area Coverage Search-while-Track and Engage (LACOSTE) program explored persistent, tactical-grade ground-moving target indicator (GMTI) capability in dense urban areas.  Wide-area continuous tracking of moving vehicles requires very small coverage gaps, small resolution cells, and target separation and identification features.  The ideal sensor has the area coverage rates of GMTI radar and the resolution/identification capabilities of an electro-optical infrared system.  The LACOSTE program provided wide area surveillance, simultaneous tracking, and target engagement with electro-optical and infrared sensors for tactical GMTI operations.  The program developed a  sensor with a very wide field of regard, and a wide instantaneous field of view (FOV) that is rapidly scanned in a search-while-track mode, tracking up to thousands of targets in an urban area.  Additionally, the LACOSTE sensor provides next-generation precision tracking to enable engagement on a large number of targets in dense urban areas within that same field of regard with minimal penalty on the search-mode area coverage rate.  The program also developed a rapid "zoom" capability for target identification that enables feature-aided tracking through dense target environments, plus sufficient target identification for separating like-targets when back-tracking a particular target via the historical track data.  The LACOSTE technology was transitioned to the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army at the conclusion of the program.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The NetTrack Program developed feature-aided tracking technologies to enable airborne surveillance radars to maintain track on moving high value targets (HVTs) in traffic and cluttered environments.  Ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radars provide excellent potential for tracking HVTs because they operate in all weather and at long ranges.  However, maintaining target tracks is very challenging because obscuration and close target spacing make it difficult to associate radar kinematic measurements over time.  To address this challenge, NetTrack developed feature aided tracking technology that automatically collects and exploits target high range resolution (HRR) radar measurements.  Specific NetTrack technologies include signal processing to generate HRR measurements from raw radar returns, feature extraction and matching to exploit HRR measurements, multiple hypothesis tracking to associate measurements to tracks and estimate target location and velocity, and sensor resource management to automatically select optimum radar mode parameters and timing sequences.  A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) has been established for transition of NetTrack to the Navy Advanced Airborne Sensor which is a follow-on to the Navy Littoral Surveillance Radar System.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Precision Inertial Navigation Systems High Dynamic Range Atom Sensors and Systems (PINS HiDRA) developed an integrated cold atom-based inertial measurement unit (IMU) suitable for use on a wide range of military platforms.  The program built on the work of the Precision Inertial Navigation Systems (PINS) program to dramatically increase the dynamic range of the sensors, thereby enabling operation on aircraft and missiles.  Extensive system integration and miniaturization reduced system size, weight, and power, while increasing navigation performance as measured against currently fielded aircraft inertial navigation systems.  Technologies from the PINS HiDRA program have transitioned to the Adaptable Navigation Systems program budgeted at PE 0603767E, SEN-01.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Exploitation Systems project develops algorithms, software, and information processing systems to extract information from massive intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) datasets.  In particular, it develops new technologies for detection and discrimination of targets from clutter, classification and fingerprinting of high value targets, localization and tracking over wide areas, and threat network identification and analysis.  Efforts will focus on difficult ISR environments, for example (a) urban environments with extensive building obscuration, large volumes of civilian traffic, and feature-rich terrain, (b) mountain environments with highly variable terrain elevation, complex local and regional threat networks, and predominantly dismounted adversaries, (c) jungle environments with targets under heavy canopy, animals, and other sources of clutter masking human activity, and (d) maritime and littoral environments where threats now include terrorists, pirates, smugglers, drug traffickers, and other non-traditional adversaries.  The resulting technology will enable operators to more effectively use ISR data in the execution of wide area search, border and road monitoring, high value target tracking, overwatch, and other missions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Insight is developing the next generation multi-intelligence (multi-INT) exploitation and resource management system.  Insight provides new exploitation capabilities through an integrated, standards-based system that is designed for mission flexibility and cross-theater applicability.  Insight will enable detection of threat networks and irregular warfare operations through combination and analysis of information from imaging and non-imaging sensors and other sources.  The technical approach emphasizes model-based correlation, adversary behavior modeling, threat network analysis tools, resource management tools, a unified data management and processing environment, novel exploitation algorithms and analysis methodologies, and tools to integrate human and machine processing, including visualization, hypothesis manipulation, on-line learning, and distributed social intelligence.  Insight development activities leverage both virtual and physical test bed environments.  The virtual test bed enables evaluation of alternative sensor mixes and algorithms under extended operating conditions.  The physical test bed enables live testing, under realistic operational conditions, using current and next generation sensing and processing systems.  Insight technology development is being coordinated with the following potential transition sponsors: Army Program Executive Office-Intelligence, Electronic Warfare &amp; Sensors, Distributed Common Ground System - Army, Army Intelligence and Security Command, Air Force - Distributed Common Ground Station, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.  Insight provides a unified architecture for plug-and-play ISR with extensibility to all Services and Unified Combatant Commands, initially USCENTCOM, USSOCOM, and USPACOM.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Worldwide Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (WISR) system will provide ISR capability in denied areas.  The U.S. military has limited capability or permission to obtain airborne ISR observations of many critical problem areas.  Overhead observations are limited by sensor resolution, collection timeline and platform geometry.  However, millions of people worldwide have been recording and posting videos of events and areas of interest for national security.  The number of videos available on public networks is rapidly increasing.  WISR will use the ground-level video and still images to reconstruct 3-D and 4-D timelines of events and will use these reconstructions to code descriptions of dynamic content, rather than focusing on the identification and movement of individual objects and humans in the scene.  WISR constructs will be suitable for describing and differentiating patterns-of-life to reflect local and societal changes.  The program will use this data in support of three missions: intelligence preparation for expeditionary forces entering a new area of operation, reconstruction of significant events worldwide, and battle damage assessment.  These techniques will transition to operational commands and the intelligence community.</r2:Description>

The program integrates novel cyber-human-physical sensing and man-machine processing to better take advantage of the strengths of each.  New processing techniques for hyperspectral imaging sensors will enable long duration tracking of vehicles and dismounts.  Scalable stochastic modeling and inference techniques will yield improved situation awareness and assessment for wide-area electro-optical/IR motion imaging, radar, and multi-sensor exploitation applications in settings where large numbers of interacting entities engaged in complex activities are observed over long periods of time.  Techniques intended for use in riverine and maritime environments, where extremist and criminal groups threaten political stability, trade routes, and free commerce, will map navigable tributary systems, detect and identify threats, and monitor their activity.

                                    <r2:Description>The Foliage Penetrating Radar Planning and Exploitation program will complete final FORESTER foliage penetrating radar demonstrations and provide further exploitation capabilities to find dismounted targets in densely forested terrain.  Current foliage penetrating radar systems provide an important capability for detecting dismount targets under foliage, but the systems also detect animals, moving water, blowing trees, and other scene clutter moving under or in the foliage that makes situation assessment, manpower and radar resource intensive.  Further, Doppler signature data that may enable improved automated discrimination of dismount targets from other detections is not currently exploited.  Finally, no planning tools are available for optimizing and dynamically replanning collection assets to improve imaging geometries and detectability.  This program will provide capabilities to address these issues by exploiting Doppler signature data, automating temporal processing approaches currently used, and automating terrain, weather, and on-line exploitation data to enable planning and dynamic replanning.  The result will be significantly improved capability for finding and localizing targets under foliage.  The program will transition to USSOUTHCOM and USSOCOM.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>The Persistent Operations Surface Surveillance and Engagement (POSSE) program developed the capability to integrate sensor input from multiple modalities to find indications of insurgent activities.  Combined with dynamically updated information from soldiers on the ground, POSSE has enabled near-real-time generation of the evidence necessary for further investigation or interdiction.  POSSE experiments were conducted at the National Training Center (NTC) with realistic role players emulating typical residential, commercial, and light industrial activity.  Within this environment, insurgent activity was simulated by qualified experts using the latest and most complete intelligence available.  Measurements included precision collections of insurgent activities, as well as the realistic surrounding background clutter of typical civilian activity.  Results informed future experiments, led to specifications for future sensor design, and provided insights into how to integrate other narrow and wide area sensors into an integrated approach to countering insurgencies.  Transition is in process with the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element is budgeted in the Management Support Budget Activity because it is funding the building relocation support cost requirements for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).  The move to a new facility is in response to the Department of Defense Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) and Anti-terrorism/Force Protection Requirements Regulation (UFC 4-010-01 dtd 8 Oct 2003, as amended 22 Jan 2007).  The regulation is mandatory for facilities leased for DoD use and applies to all new leases executed on or after 1 Oct 2005 and to renewal or extension of any existing lease on or after 1 Oct 2009.  DARPA's existing leased facility does not meet the UFC standards and the lease extends beyond October 2009.  This Program Element will fund all expenses associated with planning and movement of the Agency to its new location.  Initial costs will include design and trade studies, costs associated with implementing force protection standards, floor plan layout and planning activities leading up to the move.  Further, it will fund outfitting of the selected property with the force protection standards, infrastructure, equipment, and furniture required for the DARPA staff and completion of the move in 2012.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Cyber Security Initiative will foster a revolution in the Nation's ability to protect and defend its cyber operations.  DARPA's responsibility as part of the overall Cyber Security Initiative (CSI) is to create a cyber test range that will become a National resource for testing the resiliency of cyber programs in the face of hostile action.  The Cyber Range will be capable of supporting multiple, simultaneous, segmented tests in realistically configured or simulated testbed environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Cyber Security Initiative is to revolutionize the Nation's ability to conduct cyber operations by developing a persistent and cost-effective cyber testing environment.  The National Cyber Range (NCR) program will develop a network testbed that will allow for research experimentation on diverse hardware and software topologies to produce qualitative and quantitative assessments of cyber security research and development programs through a safe, instrumented experimentation environment.  The range will replicate complex, heterogeneous networks.  It will revolutionize cyber testing to enable efficient cyber experimentation and facilitate realistic testing of tools and techniques to enable high fidelity assessments of cyber tools and techniques and the rapid transition of research programs to operations.  This program will begin transition to the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and will be available for leverage or use by all Federal Government organizations.</r2:Description>
