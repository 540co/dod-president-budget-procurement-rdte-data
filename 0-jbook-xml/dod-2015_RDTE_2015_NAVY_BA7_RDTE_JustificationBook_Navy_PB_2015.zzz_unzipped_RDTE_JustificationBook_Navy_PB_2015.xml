                                            <r2:Text>The Air Harpoon shipping container is being redesigned because the current container, MK-607, has experienced numerous instances of moisture intrusion which has damaged missiles beyond economical repair.  FY14 funds are required to address cracking encountered during the original design testing. Funds are required to complete IM test of redesigned container, and post-test assessment of MIL-STD-901d Ship Shock compliance.  Recent conventional ordnance deficiency report provides increased emphasis on the need to complete.  The new design for the container will finish qualification testing in FY-14 at the field activities.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review published February 2006 and OSD Advanced Technology &amp; Logistics Executive Committee Memorandum of February 2006 supported direction to restructure the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (UCAS) program into a new Navy UCAS program.  The Navy UCAS program will develop an unmanned, longer-range, carrier-based aircraft capable of being air-refueled to provide greater standoff capability, to expand payload and launch options, and to increase naval reach and persistence.  The Navy was directed to demonstrate carrier operations, including Autonomous Aerial Refueling, of a Low Observable (LO) planform UCAS and to mature required technologies to a Technology Readiness Level-6; which, is required for a potential follow on acquisition program.

The Navy UCAS designed for autonomous launch and recovery as well as operations in the Carrier Control Area, is comprised of an Air Vehicle Segment, a Mission Control Segment (MCS) and a government led Aircraft Carrier Integration Segment.  The scope of the Navy UCAS effort includes design, development, integration, and validation of an unmanned, LO planform Air Vehicle Segment and MCS in the land-based and shipboard environments.  Evaluations will be conducted to investigate MCS interfaces with shipboard systems such as Primary Flight Control displays, Landing Safety Officer displays, and Carrier Air Traffic Control Center stations. 
 
The Navy UCAS program will be structured to match program resources to United States Navy objectives and constraints with the goals of identifying and maturing critical technologies and reducing the risk of carrier integration of a UCAS.  Candidate Technology Maturation efforts include transformational communications, advanced integrated propulsion, aircraft carrier suitable materials, LO sensors and apertures, sense and avoid functionality (in an LO environment), autonomous operations (software algorithms and interfaces), and computer resource data storage and access systems.   Modeling, simulation, analysis, industrial capability assessments, system/component development, and analysis of architectures and concept designs are being developed as a result of the demonstration.  Maturation of candidate technologies support the evaluation of alternatives needed for a future milestone decision.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In the 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review, the Navy was directed to restructure the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (UCAS) program and develop an unmanned, longer-range carrier-based aircraft capable of being air-refueled to provide greater aircraft carrier standoff capability, to expand payload and launch options, and to increase naval reach and persistence. The primary goal is risk reduction for carrier integration while developing the critical data necessary to support a potential follow on acquisition milestone decision.  The Navy UCAS effort will focus on designing, developing, and evaluating the core capabilities which safely demonstrate carrier interoperability.  Currently, primary hardware development for the Navy UCAS effort is being performed under a Federal Acquisition Regulation based, cost plus incentive fee-type contract competitively awarded to a single contractor.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Total Force Structure Management System (TFSMS) is an evolutionary acquisition (EA) program currently comprised of two blocks/increments. TFSMS is a web-based application built upon an Oracle/Cognos infrastructure and currently residing on the G-6 Data Center in Marine Corps Base, Quantico. TFSMS currently has over 14,000 users. Block 1 is defined by a Capabilities Production Document (CPD) that was approved by the Marine Corps Requirements Oversight Council (MROC) 9 Apr 2008. TFSMS Block 1 Full Operational Capability (FOC) was met by completing development, testing and fielding of a transactional user web-based training capability to replace the current interim Instructor-led training which consists of a two-day Equipment Class and a two-day Structure Class taught locally twice each month. Increment II CDD was approved by the MROC 20 Nov 2009 (DM 07-2010). CPD was approved by MROC 3 Jul 2012 (DM 51-2012). Increment II capabilities include civilian billets, improved AAO calculations, and fielding plan capability; providing the Marine Corps with the ability to have a consolidated force structure picture.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funding supports the risk reduction and programmatic activities to recapitalize the Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) capability. This medium-lift/long-range logistics aircraft will provide critical air connector capability for time-critical logistics within the Navy Seabasing logistics enabling concept in support of the Carrier Strike Groups. This capability is currently provided by the C-2A Greyhounds, which are projected to begin retiring in large numbers as they reach their fatigue service life limits and the force falls below primary aircraft allocation in 2028. 

This program is funded under OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports the risk reduction and programmatic activities to recapitalize the Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) capability. This medium-lift/long-range logistics aircraft will provide critical air connector capability for time-critical logistics within the Navy Seabasing logistics enabling concept in support of the Carrier Strike Groups. This capability is currently provided by the C-2A Greyhounds, which are projected to begin retiring in large numbers as they reach their fatigue service life limits and the force falls below primary aircraft allocation in 2028.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MEDUSA JCTD demonstrated the Low Cost Guided Imaging Rockets (LOGIR) technology developed at the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake on the MH-60S. LOGIR was to initially provide "fire and forget" capability to 2.75-inch rockets in support of Sea Shield Pillar. LOGIR provides increased platform lethality against Fast Attack Craft (FAC)/Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FIAC) threat, a low-cost imaging infraRed precision guidance section for the existing 2.75-inch unguided rockets and maximum precision kills per sortie with minimum collateral damage, increased efficiency and increased standoff distance. Initial program documentation (i.e. performance specifitations, Capabilities Development Document) was developed within the scope of the JCTD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air-to-ground Missile (AGM)-114R is an Engineering Change Proposal to the fielded AGM-114K, K2, K2A, P, P2, P2A and AGM-114M missiles.  It is intended to address safety, reliability and producibility issues while maintaining the current lethality of fielded versions of the Hellfire missile.   The Department of the Navy (DoN) has participated in the development of the AGM-114R, which provides full Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV), FW (Harvest Hawk) and Rotary Wing Capabilities. The AGM-114R also increases lethality (Trajectory Shaping), increases Engagement Envelope (360 deg) and roll-tip off safety issues. The AGM-114R will maximize the Warfighter's operational flexibility by allowing them to effectively engage a variety of stationary and mobile targets, including advanced armor, bunkers, buildings, command and control vehicles, transporter/erector launchers and patrol craft.   

Research, Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding will support aircraft airworthiness certification through a combination of missile software verifications, Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordinance (HERO) analysis and aircraft interface validations.  In addition, Development Test/Operational Test (DT/OT) flight tests using all-up rounds will be performed during backwards compatibility System Qualification Testing (SQT).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Warhead Fuze Sustainment Program (0951) is an effort to develop advanced components to improve the reliability, safety, and security of Arming, Fuzing and Firing (AF&amp;F) systems for nuclear reentry systems.  The current effort is focused on supporting the alteration of the AF&amp;F system for the MK5/W88 system which will be five years beyond its design life at the scheduled deployment of the AF&amp;F alteration.  This effort also supports future utilization of the developed components by the US Air Force and United Kingdom.

The Technology Applications Program (2228) supports the TRIDENT II (D5) Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM) that provides the U.S. a weapon system with greater accuracy and payload capability as compared to the TRIDENT I (C4) system.  TRIDENT II enhances U.S. strategic deterrence providing a survivable, sea-based system capable of engaging the full spectrum of potential targets with fewer submarines.  This Program Element supports investigations into new technologies which would help mitigate the program impact due to component obsolescence and a rapidly decreasing manufacturing support base.  These efforts include Reentry System Applications and Guidance System Applications which will terminate in 2014.  In FY16, Multi-Star Enhanced Prelaunch (MEP) will commence.  This will demonstrate the ability to use two stellar sightings to formulate the in-flight correction (rather than one) which may in the future provide relief to the strict tolerance requirements of the strategic navigator on the current OHIO class submarines and the OHIO Class Replacement program.
						
The W78/88-1 Life Extension Program (3097) is an effort to conduct the Navy portion of a Department of Defense/Department of Energy (DOD/DOE) Nuclear Weapons Council initiated Phase 6.2/6.2A investigation of design options and associated feasibility and cost study for a life extension of the Air Force W78 Reentry Vehicle and Navy W88 Reentry Body.  The study will evaluate options and select a preferred solution(s) for a common Nuclear Explosive Package (NEP), including improved safety capabilities, which could be integrated into both the W78 and W88 platforms.  In addition, the study will conduct a cost study for a refurbishment life extension of the current W88 design.

The Integrated Nuclear Weapons Security System (INWSS) (3158) efforts support the Nuclear Weapons Security program and SSBN Escort mission.  The policies and requirements regarding the safeguard of nuclear weapons within the Department of Defense is established by DoD S5210.41M.  Within the Department of the Navy, nuclear weapons are limited to TRIDENT Fleet Ballistic Missiles (FBM), either deployed aboard TRIDENT submarines or located landside at Naval Submarine Base, Kings Bay, or Naval Submarine Base, Bangor where missiles are first assembled as well as repaired.  The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) has assigned the Strategic Systems Programs (SSP), the FBM program manager, with mission responsibility for the safeguard of FBM nuclear technologies.  This budget supports efforts directed at improving the current technological baseline through a series of studies.  These efforts will improve countermeasure technologies to address detection, delay and denial.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports implementation of a coordinated Navy/Air Force Reentry System Applications Program (RSAP), and a coordinated Navy/Air Force Strategic Guidance Applications Program (GAP).  RSAP and GAP funding are critical to respond to future requirements.  The December 2001 DOD Nuclear Posture Review determined that infrastructure is a critical part of the new triad and these efforts form part of the infrastructure that supports the nuclear force structure.

The RSAP program, through sustainment of the reentry vehicle technology base, will maintain confidence in the dependability and reliability of strategic SLBM and ICBM weapon systems over the long term when no new systems will be in development.  Critical and unique attributes necessary for the design, development and in-service support of current and modernized SLBM reentry systems have been defined and will be maintained to ensure a functioning readiness application technical capability in reentry is preserved.  Working closely with the Air Force, Navy and Air Force requirements have been integrated into a comprehensive program.  The program maintains close coordination with the DOD Science and Technology (S&amp;T) community in order to: leverage S&amp;T programs, ensure system driven technology base requirements are considered in contract awards, eliminate duplication of effort and provide an opportunity to demonstrate appropriate emerging technologies through a reentry flight test evaluation process.

The GAP program provides a minimum strategic guidance core technology development capability consistent with the Strategic Advisory Group (SAG) recommendations to COMSTRATCOM.  The SAG recommended that SSP establish a program which preserves this critical design and development core.  It is a basic bridge program which develops critical guidance technology applicable to any of the existing Air Force/Navy strategic missiles.  The objective is to transition from current capability to a long term readiness status required to support deployed systems.  Efforts are focused on alternatives to technologies identified as system "weak links."  Currently, system accuracy and functionality depends upon key technologies which provide radiation hardened velocity, attitude and stellar sensing capabilities.  As the underlying technologies that currently provide these capabilities age and are no longer technically supportable, modern alternatives must be made available in order to allow for orderly replacement.  There is no commercial market for these technologies and their viability depends on the strategic community.

Both RSAP and GAP programs end by FY14.  In FY16, Multi-Star Enhanced Prelaunch (MEP) will commence.  This will demonstrate the ability to use two stellar sightings to formulate the in-flight correction (rather than one) which may in the future provide relief to the strict tolerance requirements of the strategic navigator on the current OHIO class submarines and the OHIO Class Replacement program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The W78/88-1 Life Extension Program (3097) is an effort to conduct the Navy portion of a DoD/DOE Nuclear Weapons Council initiated Phase 6.2/6.2A investigation of design options and associated feasibility and cost study for a life extension of the Air Force W78 Reentry Vehicle and Navy W88 Reentry Body.  The study will evaluate options and select a preferred solution(s) for a common NEP, including improved safety capabilities, which could be integrated into both the W78 and W88 platforms.  In addition the study will conduct a cost study for a refurbishment life extension of the current W88 design.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Enhanced Special Weapons effort supports the Nuclear Weapons Security program and SSBN Escort mission.  The policies and requirements regarding the safeguard of nuclear weapons within the Department of Defense is established by DoD S5210.41M.  Within the Department of the Navy, nuclear weapons are limited to TRIDENT Fleet Ballistic Missiles (FBM), either deployed aboard TRIDENT submarines or located landside at Naval Submarine Base, Kings Bay or Naval Submarine Base, Bangor where missiles are first assembled as well as repaired.  The CNO has assigned SSP, the FBM program manager, with mission responsibility for the safeguard of FBM nuclear assets.  More specifically, the mission includes landside and pier operations as well as transits to and from the dive point, each of which present challenges to personnel as well as existing technologies.  This budget supports efforts directed at improving the current technological baseline through a series of studies focusing on land and in transit requirements.  Collectively, these efforts will improve countermeasure technologies addressing detection, delay and denial.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This project supports the Submarine Acoustic Warfare System (SAWS) Program to maintain and improve the survivability of all U.S. Submarine classes.  This program funds:

1.  The Next Generation Countermeasure (NGCM), an ACAT III program, currently in Engineering and Manufacturing Development (E&amp;MD).  The key new capabilities for NGCM are adaptive countermeasure (ACM) technology with full duplex capability and mobility packaged in a three inch diameter body, bringing a superior capability to the fleet.

2.  The Torpedo Defense Working Group (TDWG).  A working group comprised of fleet, resource sponsor, and acquisition community representatives to assess countermeasure effectiveness against fleet threats, both known and projected, with  associated studies, models, and simulations.

3.  The Technical Direction Agent and In-Service Engineering Agent hardware and software development support for Acoustic Devices Countermeasure (ADC) (ADC MK 2, 3 &amp; 4, NAE Beacon) as well as Countermeasures Set, Acoustic (CSA) MK 2, MK 3, MK 4 systems and Acoustic Augmentation Support Systems (AASS) in the Acoustic Augmentation Support Program (AASP), including obsolete unit-level technical insertion.

4.  Research and development of new technologies and capabilities developed under the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC), Small Business and Innovative Research (SBIR), and other Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) initiatives.  New and emerging hardware and software are evaluated in representative acoustic environments, against projected threats through both digital and hardware-in-the-loop simulations, to determine their effectiveness and how that improves submarine survivability. The technology is then incorporated into the appropriate countermeasure.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Schedule: Not applicable.  
Financial: Sequestration reduced FY13 funding.  Reduced FY15 funding with the Department's 2012 decision to defer NGCM outside the (then) FYDP.  In PB15 the department increased funds to accommodate NGCM to support NGCM program stabilization, modifications to the CSA MK4, and miscellaneous rate adjustments. The TDWG and WAF efforts were also stabilized to ensure ongoing assessment efforts remained a part of the submarine survivability assessment.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the Submarine Acoustic Warfare System (SAWS) Program to maintain and improve the survivability of all U.S. Submarine classes.  This program funds:

1.  The Next Generation Countermeasure (NGCM).  An ACAT III program, currently in Engineering and Manufacturing Development (E&amp;MD).  The key new capabilities for NGCM are adaptive countermeasure (ACM) technology with full duplex capability and mobility packaged in a three inch diameter body, bringing a superior capability to the fleet.

2.  The Torpedo Defense Working Group (TDWG).  A working group comprised of fleet, Resource sponsor and Acquisition Community to assesse countermeasure effectiveness against fleet threats both known and projected, and associated studies and models to assess effectiveness.

3.  The Technical Direction Agent and In-Service Engineering Agent hardware and software development support for Acoustic Devices Countermeasure (ADC) (ADC MK 2, 3 &amp; 4, NAE Beacon) as well as Countermeasures Set, Acoustic (CSA) MK 2, MK 3, MK 4 systems and Acoustic Augmentation Support Systems (AASS) in the Acoustic Augmentation Support Program (AASP), including obsolete unit-level technical insertion.

4.  Research and development of new technologies and capabilities developed under the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC), Small Business and Innovative Research (SBIR), and other Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) initiatives.  New and emerging hardware and software are evaluated in representative acoustic environments, against projected threats through both digital and hardware-in-the-loop simulations, to determine their effectiveness and how that improves submarine survivability. The technology is then incorporated into the appropriate countermeasure.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Shore to Ship Communications System addresses joint system design issues for Emergency Action Message (EAM) distribution to all nuclear platforms and provides evaluation of joint interoperability of EAM delivery systems. Tools are developed to provide strategic command and control planning within the submarine shore infrastructure to support deployed ballistic missile submarines. 

The Navy Strategic Communications Project responds to emerging E-6B Command, Control and Communications capability requirements by performing technical evaluations, modeling and simulation, investigative ground and flight testing, enhanced software modifications and development of configuration modifications.  The E-6B is a manned airborne platform that provides survivable, endurable and reliable Command, Control and Communications capability in support of the President, Secretary of Defense and United States strategic and non-strategic forces.  These efforts support follow-on aircraft modification procurements necessary to ensure interoperability in information-assured network-centric strategic environments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Shore to Ship Communication System develops communication elements which provide Nuclear Command, Control and Communications (NC3) from originator to execution platforms.  This portfolio of programs provides design and developments for shore-to-ship transmit and receive communications systems.

The Low Band Universal Communications System (LBUCS) is a modernization program that will upgrade the transmit and receive subsystems of the Fixed Submarine Broadcast System (FSBS) which are approaching their operational end of life. LBUCS will ensure operational capability through the Very Low Frequency (VLF) architecture by providing system life extension and flexibility of submarine broadcast traffic to submarines operating in a stealth posture. The flexibility includes enhanced throughput and anti-jam capability, ensuring more operational products are delivered to a submarine without risking mast exposure. The flexibility further includes a simplified shore architecture to maintain capability while maximizing use of shore nodes (Broadcast Keying Sites). LBUCS also provides an upgrade to the VLF receive system, with all interoperable waveforms, to ensure continued compliance with Nuclear Command and Control System Technical Performance Criteria (NTPC). 

The Strategic Communications Assessment Program/Continued Evaluation Program provides constant assessment of the effectiveness of the end-to-end NC3 network and analysis of system performance in various mission locations.

Technologies to improve high voltage insulators, helix house bushings and antenna components used in the fixed VLF transmit systems are evaluated and tested through the High Voltage Improvement Program (HVIP). Development of information assurance solutions for the Broadcast Control Authority (BCA) and Submarine Operating Authority (SUBOPAUTH) Wide Area Network (SWAN) are part of this program to mitigate vulnerability concerns.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

MISSION: 
RTT programs transition technology from any source, including those not traditionally associated with defense technology. An effective and robust integration of commercial and military technologies can reduce costs and improve naval capabilities by keeping pace with the fast moving changes in technologies and operational needs. The RTT program is comprised of three elements: The Rapid Technology Transition (RTT) program, the Technology Insertion Program for Savings (TIPS), and the Rapid Development and Deployment (RDD) program. The RTT and TIPS programs are structured to bring transition deals to closure quickly, and to provide execution year funding for a rapid start, bridging the gap until the program of record can fund the completion of the technology insertion. The RDD program is structured to quickly develop a prototype solution that will be deployed in theater for Naval forces engaged in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).

The mission of the RTT program is to increase the rate that new, innovative, and potentially disruptive technologies are inserted into Department of Navy (DON) acquisition programs and the hands of the warfighter. 

The mission of the TIPS program is to increase the rate that new cutting edge technologies are inserted into DON acquisition programs in order to significantly reduce operations and maintenance support costs.

The RDD program provides for the rapid development and fielding of prototype solutions to meet urgent operational needs. The RDD process applies when existing DON processes cannot meet urgent operational needs. Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) have generated rapidly evolving military needs that require responsive materiel solutions. 

Rapid transition opportunities occur when a sufficiently mature technology is identified that can meet a particular need on a timetable which matches that of an acquisition program, and is supported by a business case which justifies the associated cost and schedule risk. The combination of circumstances which create such opportunities can appear, and disappear, well inside the Program Objectives Memorandum (POM) cycle. These programs are designed to be proactive in identifying opportunities and to work with resource sponsors, fleet and force users, and Program Managers (PMs) in constructing viable technology transition deals one at a time. 

To ensure the widest possible awareness of emergent commercial technology opportunities, these programs interact with the industry and coordinate closely with Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) to maintain awareness of insertion opportunities. Utilizing existing authorities, RTT applies execution year funds where necessary to "jump-start" transitions so they can be inserted and validated by Sea Trial experiments leading directly to deployment and/or demonstrations of high risk/high payoff technologies. This Program Element is the only Navy program that addresses current, urgent requirements that are required by the fleet within a 18-24 month period. As such, planning and execution are accomplished within the same fiscal year, which causes a non-traditional financial execution profile for the program. The program therefore does not meet traditional execution benchmarks.

Higher Navy priorities result in the termination of the RTT program in 2014.

Utilizing existing authorities, TIPS applies execution year funds where necessary to "jump-start" transitions so they can be inserted and validated leading directly to deployment and/or demonstrations of high risk/high payoff technologies. This Program Element is the only Navy program that addresses current opportunities to reduce operations and support (O&amp;S) cost drivers within a 18-24 month period. As such, planning and initiation are accomplished within the same fiscal year, which causes a non-traditional financial execution profile for the program. The program therefore does not meet traditional execution benchmarks. 

Funding increase to the TIPS reflects emphasis on increasing the number of projects that reduce operations and support costs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of the RTT project is to increase the rate that new, innovative, and potentially disruptive technologies are inserted into DON acquisition programs and the hands of the warfighter.  A key aspect of the RTT project is its charter to transition technology from any source, including those not traditionally associated with defense technology.  An effective and robust integration of commercial and military technologies can reduce costs and improve naval capabilities by keeping pace with the fast moving changes in technologies and operational needs.  The RTT project is structured to bring transition deals to closure quickly, and to provide execution year funding for a rapid start, bridging the gap until the program of record can fund the completion of the technology insertion.

The RTT program has been terminated at the end of FY 2013 and funding religned to higher naval priorities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of the Technology Insertion Program for Savings (TIPS) is to increase the rate that new cutting edge technologies are inserted into DON acquisition programs in order to significantly reduce operations and maintenance support costs.  The program is structured to quickly transition applicable commercial off-the-shelf solutions and late-stage development technologies from any source to meet an emerging opportunity.  TIPS provides execution year funding for a rapid start, bridging the gap until the program of record can fund the completion of the technology insertion.

Funding decrease from FY13 to FY14 resulting from CNO higher priority or requirements
Funding increase from FY14 through FY15 reflects emphasis on increasing the number of projects that reduce operations and support costs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Rapid Development and Deployment (RDD) provides an environment and process for rapid development and fielding of prototype solutions to meet urgent operational needs.  The RDD process applies when existing DON processes cannot meet urgent operational needs.  Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) have generated rapidly evolving military needs that require responsive materiel solutions.  RDD is a fast track process for application, by exception, to Navy and USMC capability needs and materiel solutions that meet the following criteria:  (1) Need identified during active or incipient combat or contingency operation, or (2) Need derived from combat survivability of the warfighter or impacts the success of the mission.  RDD initiates projects to deliver prototype solutions that are not readily available off-the-shelf and that can be developed, integrated with other components and systems (as necessary), tested, and fielded within 270 days of need approval.  RDD provides startup funds to initiate projects that meet the above criteria while other funding is made available within the year of execution. Rapid Development and Deployment (RDD) provides an environment and process for rapid development and fielding of prototype solutions to meet urgent operational needs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F/A-18 is required to perform multiple missions.  Capabilities of the F/A-18 weapon system and ancillary equipment can be upgraded to accommodate and incorporate new or enhanced weapons as well as advances in technology to respond effectively to emerging future threats.  Continued F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G "Flight Plan" spiral capability development is critical to the baseline of the Super Hornet next generation mission system capability and maintaining tactical relevance in support of Navy Aviation Plan 2030.  Development continues for a platform solution to threat Advanced Electronic Attack and Counter-Electronic Attack (CEA).  F/A-18 solutions to CEA include upgrades to existing sensors such as F/A-18 Radar Upgrade, Infrared Search and Track Block I, and development of a fused picture between these sensors, such as Multi-Sensor Integration Phase III (the phases of Multi-Sensor Integration are being rolled up under the title of Multi-System Integration in FY15, programmatic name change only).  Additionally, continued advanced development engineering for improvements in reliability and maintainability are required to ensure maximum benefit is achieved through reduced cost of ownership and to provide enhanced availability.  

JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Specific changes include earlier start for 29C development from 3Q15 to 2Q14; earlier start for 31C development from 3Q17 to 1Q16; 27C Integration Testing start earlier from 1Q15 to 2Q14; H14 Integration Testing ending 3Q18 vice 4Q17; H14 Operational Testing start delay from 1Q18 to 4Q18 ending 2Q19 vice 3Q18; H12 Fleet Release moves from 4Q16 to 4Q17. H14 Fleet Release from 4Q18 to 4Q19. H10+ specific to IRST for 3Q16 release.  Also includes a naming convention change in regards to SCS builds 27, 29 &amp; 31. Initially all "X" labeled builds to include Block I Super Hornets, now 27, 29, &amp; 31 will no longer include Super Hornets thus going back to a "C" SCS label designation to include only legacy A-D aircraft.

Delays in the schedule for IRST are due to technical challenges with the Fuel Tank which led to additional flight test requirements.

Multi-Sensor Integration Phase II and Phase III testing efforts have been truncated to end in 4Q14, efforts continue in 1Q15 under Multi-System Integration. 

Small Diameter Bomb Increment II / Joint Miniature Munitions Bomb Rack Unit software development refined to incorporate refined H12 schedules.  

2065: The System Configuration Set (SCS) schedule has had multiple changes due to issues discovered during developmental and operational test requiring additional development time.  Schedule changes affect the software efforts for RADAR.  Specific changes include H12 Fleet Release delay from 4Q16 to 4Q17.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>F/A-18 Improvement (1662):  The F/A-18 is a multi-mission strike fighter aircraft that is used in Air-to-Air, strike, surveillance, reconnaissance and tanking roles through selected use of external equipment (fuel tanks, tactical and reconnaissance pods, and various ordnance launching racks).  Additional capabilities are required for interoperability in a network-centric tactical environment. In order to respond effectively to emerging future threats, F/A-18 aircraft capabilities are being expanded and upgraded to incorporate new/enhanced weapons systems and avionics including Dual Mode Weapons, a Counter-Electronic Attack, Infra-red Search and Track integrated with the Active Electronically Scanned Array Radar to provide Narrow Band High Gain Electronic Attack, Distributed Targeting precision strike capability through a Distributed Targeting System, and Sensor Integration through Multi-Sensor Integration Phase I/II/III capability which is renamed beginning in FY15 as Multi-System Integration.  Continued advanced development engineering and analysis of hardware/software is required to successfully optimize fleet F/A-18 weapon systems for interoperability in a network centric tactical environment (such as Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air), to include: enhanced software capabilities, potential new hardware development, enhanced existing hardware, and enhanced network centric capabilities.   Additionally, continued effort is needed to perform technical evaluations, modeling and simulations, investigative flight testing, enhanced software modifications based on reported fleet deficiencies and beginning in FY14 the development and testing of design modifications to address obsolescence issues with the F/A-18 weapon system and ancillary equipment.  Funding has been added starting in FY 2012 for the Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System/Automated Terrain Avoidance and Warning System which will integrate currently implemented manual methodologies to provide not only aural and visual cues/advisories but also automatic initiation of aircraft recovery and subsequent return of control to the pilot following recovery.  This funding line continues F/A-18E/F "Flight Plan" spiral capability development, to include Multi-Sensor Integration Phase II and Phase III capability (programmatic name change beginning in FY15 to Multi-System Integration) and further Flight Plan Engineering and System Configuration Set development and integration.  This budget continues funding for F/A-18A-F Test Wing Maintenance support, funds development efforts needed for integration of air launched laser guided rockets on F/A-18 A+/C/D and beginning in FY14 the development and testing required for the integration of the Small Diameter Bomb II and Joint Miniature Munitions-Bomb Rack Unit on the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Multi-System Integration migrates from the previous Multi-Sensor Integration Phased approach and allows for insertion of new technologies and requirements to keep pace with rapidly evolving warfighter demands. Also, includes a naming convention change in regards to SCS builds 27, 29 &amp; 31. Initially all "X" labeled builds to include Block I Super Hornets, now 27, 29, &amp; 31 will no longer include Super Hornets thus going back to a "C" SCS label designation to include only legacy A-D aircraft.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System /Automated Terrain Avoidance and Warning System will preserve force structure by reducing attrition of pilots and aircraft that result from Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT).  CFIT occurs at greater rates on fighter attack aircraft and is a leading cause of loss of life and loss of combat capability within the DoD aviation community.  At full implementation, Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System /Automated Terrain Avoidance and Warning System will integrate currently implemented manual methodologies to provide not only aural and visual cues/advisories, but also automatic initiation of aircraft recovery and subsequent return of control to the pilot following recovery.  Funding supports Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System/Automated Terrain Avoidance and Warning System studies, analysis and functional requirements; communication, navigation and identification related development and integration efforts.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The F/A-18 Improvement program consists of extensive spiral development efforts mapped out in the capability-based approach F/A-18 E/F "Flight Plan."  These efforts are critical to the baseline of the Super Hornet next generation mission system capability and maintaining tactical relevance in support of Navy Aviation Plan 2030.  The major programs within the F/A-18 Improvement project are based on six Weapon System Capabilities:  Distributed Targeting Air to Ground and Maritime, Distributed Targeting Air to Air, Net Centric Operations/Battle Space Management, Sensor Integration, Air to Ground and Maritime Attack, and Air to Air Attack.  The major efforts included in this project are: Dual Mode Weapons integration; an Infra-Red Search and Track; Distributed Targeting capability through a Distributed Targeting System; Multi-Sensor Integration Phase I, Phase II and Phase III capability (programmatic name change to Multi-System Integration beginning in FY15); continued advanced development and F/A-18E/F Flight Plan engineering and analysis; continued enhanced software capabilities development; and engineering support to perform technical evaluations, modeling and simulations, and investigative flight testing.  
- Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST).  The IRST Block I program is a Navy program in the Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase.  A Block I system will be developed by the Navy that will meet requirements for a Counter-Electronic Attack capability.  This capability will reach Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY 2017.
- Distributed Targeting System (DTS).  DTS development is provided on a sole source cost plus incentive fee contract for EMD activities to Boeing.  The program was a new start ACAT III FY 2009 effort, with a post MS B entry and an IOC in FY 2013.  The program is leveraging previous Engineering Change Proposal efforts and is designated for Lot 26 and up domestic Super Hornets.  Updated acquisition plan is in accordance with Dr. Carter memorandum.  
- Sensor Integration.  Sensor Integration development is provided on a sole source cost plus fixed fee contract on a Research and Development Basic Ordering Agreement to Raytheon and Boeing.
- Integration of Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System/Automated Terrain Avoidance and Warning System is envisioned to only require changes to the software System Configuration Set.  Studies and analyses are needed to identify the appropriate implementation method.
- Integration of Small Diamter Bomb Increment II and the Joint Miniature Munitions Bomb Rack Unit is software driven with ground and flight test requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>F/A-18 Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR) Upgrade:  The F/A-18 RADAR Upgrade, Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) development program, which began in FY 1999, is the last of three pre-planned upgrades to the F/A-18 Type/Model/Series RADAR.  The AESA system corrects operational test deficiencies noted in the AN/APG-73.  It provides multi-target tracking, Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) imagery, SAR Target Location Error (TLE), and improved spotlight map resolution.  In addition, it provides greater lethality than previous F/A-18 RADARs by allowing full tactical support of existing and planned air-to-air (A/A) and air-to-ground (A/G) weapons and it significantly increases A/A and A/G detection and tracking ranges.  The AESA system provides greater survivability through self-protection and standoff jamming capabilities, while its greater range allows for reduced detection by enemy RADAR. This budget continues spiral capability development of AESA with increased efforts to address Phase II Operational Requirements Document requirements such as Counter-Electronic Attack 1 (CEA 1) against multiple Radio Frequency Emitters, AESA Multi-Jammer Electronic Protection (EP), Precision TLE Improvement, Monopulse and 5th/6th Channel development and Air Combat Maneuvering/Short Range Search and Track development and includes upgrades to RADAR Instrumentation, test and evaluation assets and threat assets, and upgraded modeling and simulation of both clean and Electronic Attack threat environments.  Budget also supports development and testing of design modifications to address obsolescence issues with APG-65, APG-73 and APG-79 RADAR systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>E-2 Improvements (0463) provides for incorporation of technologies for the evolution of E-2 Battle Management and Command and Control capabilities in support of naval warfare command and control requirements.  It funds digital IP radio efforts as a surrogate to the Joint Tactical Radio System, machine-to-machine digital data communications, Advanced Digital Networking System, cooperative and non-cooperative identification, and open architecture hardware and software computing environments.  These efforts have laid the foundation for growth to provide additional functional capabilities satisfying evolving operational requirements, e.g., Airborne Networking, Joint Sensor Netting and Track Management, Tactical Decision Aids, Advanced communications, and permits the evolutionary growth of a Combat Identification and Theater Air and Missile Defense Capability. 

Link-16/Cooperative Engagement Capability Interoperability Program funding is to address the most severe data link related interoperability issues.  This will significantly improve the quality of the tactical surveillance picture, reduce the possibility of leakers, mitigate Blue on Blue engagements, and mis-identification of tracks.  Provides stable sensor fusion foundation to support sensor/weapon coordination requirements.

This program is funded under OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>E-2 Improvements (0463) provides for incorporation of technologies for the evolution of E-2 Battle Management and Command and Control capabilities in support of naval warfare command and control requirements.  It funds digital IP radio efforts as a surrogate to the Joint Tactical Radio System, machine-to-machine digital data communications, Advanced Digital Networking System, cooperative and non-cooperative identification, and open architecture hardware and software computing environments.  These efforts have laid the foundation for growth to provide additional functional capabilities satisfying evolving operational requirements, e.g., Airborne Networking, Joint Sensor Netting and Track Management, Tactical Decision Aids, Advanced communications, and permits the evolutionary growth of a Combat Identification and Theater Air and Missile Defense Capability.

Link-16/Cooperative Engagement Capability Interoperability Program funding is to address the most severe data link related interoperability issues.  This will significantly improve the quality of the tactical surveillance picture, reduce the possibility of leakers, mitigate Blue on Blue engagements, and mid-identification of tracks.  Provides stable sensor fusion foundation to support sensor/weapon coordination requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Communications Automation Program - This project is a continuing program that provides for automation and communications upgrades for fleet tactical users.  It includes Battle Force Tactical Network (BFTN) and Joint Aerial Layer Network-Maritime (JALN-M). 

The Battle Force Tactical Network (BFTN) on each surface, subsurface, air, or fixed US Navy platform utilizes previously installed/existing Line of Sight (LOS)/Extended Line of Sight (ELOS) radios (a.k.a. Radio Frequency (RF)) to create a secure gateway that inter-connects all users into a common RF Tactical Network (a.k.a. wireless). This Network separately supports US-Only and Allied/Coalition users' tactical data information exchanges on each platform (node) between and/or across separately dispersed RF Networks even if Satellite Communications (SATCOM) channels to shore are lost during an Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) event.

Joint Aerial Layer Network-Maritime (JALN-M) is the Navy implementation of the JALN architecture which provides assured communications in any environment, especially A2AD.  With disruption or loss of Space tier communications, JALN-M establishes and/or restores connectivity within the High Capacity Backbone (HCB) tier, the Distribution Access Range Extension (DARE) tier, and the Transition tier in accordance with the JALN Initial Capabilities Document and the JALN Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Final Report.  JALN-M is a robust, assured communications capability providing joint connectivity via the HCB and Navy platform connectivity via a pseudo satellite DARE capability.  JALN-M will use the Extended Data Rate (XDR) waveform for intra-battle group DARE communications, a Common Data Link (CDL) waveform for the HCB cross-link capability, and will leverage enhanced Ultra High Frequency/High Frequency (UHF/HF) waveforms for coalition connectivity.     

FY15 BFTN efforts will support system demonstration, operational tests, (i.e., Technical Evaluation, Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E)), and design enhancements to the baseline system that includes higher data rates for increased network speeds to support expanded range of applications beyond email, chat correspondence and web access. The engineering change will also incorporate intelligent modems and controllers that will automatically manage flow of information, offset jamming and an increase in channel quantities that will quadruple the number of BFTN network paths; thereby, increasing speed and shore interoperation/reliability of service. This engineering change is also intended to address obsolescence and end of life impacts of rapidly advancing network technologies.

FY15 JALN-M efforts will continue to support the goal of developing six (6) JALN-M Prototype payloads through the leveraging of  the results of  both HCB and Airborne XDR flight demonstrations. Efforts will include development of capabilities to be interoperable with Automated Digital Network System (ADNS). ADNS provides routing, switching, baseband, configuration and monitoring capabilities. Funding will also facilitate the development of the design specification of JALN-M payload requirements for integration into an airborne prototype Pod.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Maritime Aerial Layer Network (MALN) is renamed Joint Aerial Layer Network-Maritime (JALN-M).</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Battle Force Tactical Network (BFTN) on each surface, subsurface, air, or fixed US Navy platform uses previously installed/existing Line of Sight (LOS)/Extended Line of Sight (ELOS) radios (a.k.a. Radio Frequency (RF)) to create a secure gateway that inter-connects all users into a common RF Tactical Network (a.k.a. wireless). BFTN enables war-fighters to digitally communicate NATO and US-Only information necessary to execute and plan in a real-time operational environment without relying on ashore application server interaction. This RF Network separately supports US-Only and Allied/Coalition users within each platform to distribute information even if Satellite Communications (SATCOM) channels to shore are lost. As a result, Carrier and Expeditionary Strike Group Commanders maintain the digital communication ability to execute and plan with other U.S. ships, submarines or aircraft, as well as with Allied/Coalition networks; even if SATCOM channels to shore are lost. 

In a satellite-denied event, adversaries covertly jam or disable communications necessary to Fleet protection and tactical operation. BFTN engineering changes will facilitate automation of communications relays and application of network aware link establishment (NA-ALE) across battle groups. The BFTN engineering change will also enable modification of the BFTN Fly Away Kit for use in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV); thereby extending BFTN Ultra High Frequency/High Frequency (UHF/HF) link ranges. As a result, BFTN service levels can be extended for theatre of operations sufficient to thwart contested SATCOM connectivity to shore servers. Engineering studies and related test activities will commence FY14 to support the ultimate goal of development and implementation of an engineering change for increased BFTN network data rates and link ranges (1.92Mbps - Ultra High Frequency (UHF) at 20nm and 128Kbps - High Frequency (HF) at 200nm), a quadrupling of system channel quantities for improved service, increased network performance and jam resistance in a satellite degraded/denied environment. Design enhancements will enable the BFTN network to self-assemble Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) delivery circuits, adapt to user proximity changes due to maneuvers or operational demands and self-heal those data delivery circuits, if they are degraded or forcefully taken from afloat forces. The engineering change will also mitigate obsolescence and end of life impacts associated with steady progression of network technology and architectures. 

FY15 BFTN engineering change and related test activities will continue toward the objective of increasing BFTN network data rates and link ranges (1.92Mbps - UHF at 20nm and 128Kbps - HF at 200nm), increasing channel quantities for improved service and improved network performance and jam resistance in a satellite degraded/denied environment. Engineering activities will include tests designed to assess performance of the engineering change with range extension via an in-flight aerial relay between a shore sites to surface platforms in FY16. Testing of legacy radio modifications for wideband and modems/controller modifications that increase data rates will authenticate expansion of RF Networking data rates/ranges within and across at-sea forces, as well as providing access to the Global Information Grid (GIG) via long haul links to Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) routers at fixed and mobile operation centers, including satellite denied and RF jamming situations. 

Joint Aerial Layer Network-Maritime (JALN-M) is the Navy implementation of the JALN architecture which provides assured communications in any environment, especially Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD). With disruption or loss of space tier communications, JALN-M establishes and/or restores connectivity within the High Capacity Backbone (HCB) tier, the Distribution Access Range Extension (DARE) tier, and the Transition tier in accordance with the JALN Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) dated 27 August 2009 and the JALN Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Final Report dated 31 October 2011. JALN-M is a robust, assured communications capability providing Joint connectivity via the HCB and Navy platform connectivity via a pseudo satellite DARE capability. JALN-M will use the Extended Data Rate (XDR) waveform for intra-battle group DARE communications, a Common Data Link (CDL) waveform for the HCB cross-link capability, and will leverage enhanced UHF/HF waveforms for coalition connectivity.

FY15 funding will continue to support the goal of developing six (6) JALN-M Prototype payloads through the leveraging of  the results of  both HCB and Airborne XDR flight demonstrations. Efforts will include development of capabilities to be interoperable with Automated Digital Network System (ADNS). ADNS provides routing, switching, baseband, configuration and monitoring capabilities. Funding will also facilitate the development of the design specification of JALN-M payload requirements for integration into an airborne prototype Pod.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Surface Support RDT&amp;E funding will be used for the research, design, development, integration testing, and documentation of a new Inertial Navigation System (INS) to support the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) mission.  The program will implement systems engineering processes to identify specific BMD performance requirements, investigate major navigation system error sources, define new functions, research new technologies, algorithms, and techniques to improve system performance, conduct analyses of alternatives, create preliminary and final design concepts, develop new hardware components and associated software, and conduct land based and shipboard testing.

The Navy's current INS is the AN/WSN-7(V) Ring Laser Gyro Navigator (RLGN), a legacy 1980's design that was first installed in 1998 and is now obsolete.  This is a proprietary design.  Estimates to redesign obsolete components for new production systems for SCN platforms exceed current budgets.  The RLGN is reaching its limit with respect to providing the high-accuracy navigation solution required to meet known and emerging mission requirements.  Navigator of the Navy's Vision 2025 identifies emergent requirements with respect to improved navigation in a GPS denied environment, littoral warfare, mine countermeasures, and manned and unmanned vehicle operations that cannot be met with existing systems.  The RLGN employs an Inertial Measuring Unit (IMU) with three single-axis ring laser gyros that allow the system to provide continuous and automatic data outputs of the ship's geographic position (latitude, longitude), horizontal and vertical linear velocity (Ve, Vn, Vv), attitude (heading, roll, and pitch) and attitude rates. The INS provides mission critical ship's position and attitude data to shipboard sensors (such as radars), combat systems, gun, and missile systems.  The INS uses data from the Global Positioning System (GPS) to periodically update (i.e., reset) its position and internal clock.  The INS is the ship's primary position source in absence of GPS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Surface Support RDT&amp;E funding will be used for the research, design, development, integration testing, and documentation of a new Inertial Navigation System (INS) to support the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) mission.  The program will implement systems engineering processes to identify specific BMD performance requirements, investigate major navigation system error sources, define new functions, research new technologies, algorithms, and techniques to improve system performance, conduct analyses of alternatives, create preliminary and final design concepts, develop new hardware components and associated software, and conduct land based and shipboard testing.

The Navy's current INS is the AN/WSN-7(V) Ring Laser Gyro Navigator (RLGN), a legacy 1980's design that was first installed in 1998 and is now obsolete.  This is a proprietary design.  Estimates to redesign obsolete components for new production systems for SCN platforms exceed current budgets.  The RLGN is reaching its limit with respect to providing the high-accuracy navigation solution required to meet known and emerging mission requirements.  Navigator of the Navy's Vision 2025 identifies emergent requirements with respect to improved navigation in a GPS denied environment, littoral warfare, mine countermeasures, and manned and unmanned vehicle operations that cannot be met with existing systems.  The RLGN employs an Inertial Measuring Unit (IMU) with three single-axis ring laser gyros that allow the system to provide continuous and automatic data outputs of the ship's geographic position (latitude, longitude), horizontal and vertical linear velocity (Ve, Vn, Vv), attitude (heading, roll, and pitch) and attitude rates. The INS provides mission critical ship's position and attitude data to shipboard sensors (such as radars), combat systems, gun, and missile systems.  The INS uses data from the Global Positioning System (GPS) to periodically update (i.e., reset) its position and internal clock.  The INS is the ship's primary position source in absence of GPS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funds support development of the Tomahawk Weapon System (TWS) encompassing Tomahawk Land-Attack Missile (TLAM) upgrades, Tactical Tomahawk Weapons Controls System (TTWCS), Tomahawk Command and Control System (TC2S) upgrades and other missile system improvements. The TWS provides a Tomahawk cruise missile attack capability against fixed and mobile targets. The TLAM can be fitted with either Conventional unitary warhead (TLAM/C) or submunition Dispenser (TLAM/D). Tomahawk is capable of being deployed from both submarines and surface ships. Launched from mobile, sea-based platforms, the land attack variant significantly increases the total capability of joint forces. This Program Element also includes funding for the NGLAW Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) and resultant follow-on development of a long range, survivable strike capability. 

This program is funded under Operational Systems Development because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for Full Rate Production (FRP) and anticipate funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>Technical:  FY15 increase in funding will be used to continue Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2AD) Navigation Improvements and initiate A2AD communications upgrades into Block IV weapons systems. A2AD communications Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review and Operational Test Readiness Review were added to the schedule as a result.

Funding was also added to Project Unit 3378, Next Generation Land Attack Weapon, for the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) and resultant follow-on development of a long range, survivable strike capability.

Schedule:  Changes to the R-4 schedule include updating all Image Navigation specific language and replacing it with Anti-Access/Area Denial(A2AD). The A2AD Preliminary Design Review and Critical Design Review dates have each slipped by 1 QTR as a result of restructuring program scope to existing Tomahawk segments to plan and execute GPS denied missions. As a result of changes to the program's Hardware Development acquisition strategy, Tactical Tomahawk Full Rate Production was removed. 

A2AD Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) and A2AD Navigation Fleet Release have slipped due to contractor performance on preceding Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts. The contractor was expected to be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6/7 by the end of delivery order 3 (Jun 2013), and have only achieved TRL 5/6.  Subsequently, an additional delivery order was added to that Basic Ordering Agreement which is no longer being pursued.

Changes within the R-4 schedule profile to the TTWCS schedule include the deletion of the v5.4.1 future operational capability milestone as v5.4.1 has been deferred and v5.4.0.2 has replaced it in 3rd quarter 2016 as the program of record, as approved by PEO (U&amp;W) on January 24, 2013. Per this decision, v5.4.0.2 milestones replace v5.4.1 milestones. This includes v5.4.0.2 Operational Test Readiness Review (OTRR) replacing v5.4.1 test readiness review in 4th quarter 2015, Fleet release will occur after v5.4.0.2 OTRR in 2nd quarter 2016.

Changes within the R-4 schedule profile to TC2S include changing TC2S 4.3 FOC from 3QFY12 to 4QFY15 as a result of changes in ship availabilities and budget reductions due to FY13 sequestration. The 5.0.1 FOC was delayed from 2QFY15 to 4QFY17 due to schedule delays with the fielding of TC2S 4.3.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tomahawk Weapon System (TWS) provides a Tomahawk cruise missile attack capability against fixed and mobile targets. This program ensures that the TWS exploits state-of-the-art technology to preserve the efficiency of this proven weapon system, and includes all missile development, mission planning system development, and submarine and surface ship weapons control system development.

The Tactical Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR) Block IV missile is a comprehensive spiral baseline upgrade to the TWS that provides the tactical commander a quick reaction response capability as well as improved flexibility, increased accuracy and higher lethality.  A five-year multi-year (FY04-FY08) production contract was awarded in August 2004 for the production of up to 2200 Block IV Tomahawk missiles.  The essential upgrades of the Block IV missile are: improved guidance, navigation, control and mission computer two-way Satellite Communications (SATCOM), and a lower production cost as compared to the Block III missile.  Block IV provides a Ultra High Frequency SATCOM data link to enable the missile to receive in-flight mission modification messages, to transfer health and status messages and to broadcast Battle Damage Indication messages.  Block IV also includes a high anti-jam Global Postitioning System (GPS) receiver, navigation improvements and associated antenna systems.  The Tomahawk program also includes developments to evolve the TWS to be able to plan and execute missions requiring navigation in an Anti-Access/Area Denied environment.
 
Under the umbrella of the Theater Mission Planning Center (TMPC), the TC2S is the mission planning segment of the TWS that provides systems for the precision targeting, route planning, mission distribution, and strike management of Tomahawk cruise missile missions from sites located ashore and afloat.  TMPC optimizes all aspects of the Tomahawk missile mission to successfully engage a target and has evolved into five scalable configurations at 179 sites: Cruise Missile Support Activities (CMSAs) (3), Tomahawk Strike Mission Planning Cells (TSMPCs) (3 - C5F, C6F, C7F), Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) (10 CVN's/5 CTF's), Firing Units (FRUs)(84 Surface/56 Submarines), Command &amp; Control Nodes (C2 Nodes)(6), labs (6), and training classrooms (6).  Systems fielded at the CMSAs and TSMPCs provide mission planning and employment support information for TLAM/C, including the distribution of mission data and command information essential to TLAM employment via the mission distribution system and associated communications infrastructure.  Development of Tactical Tomahawk capabilities in TMPC/TC2S includes software development, integration, test, and delivery, including support for training development, installation planning, and simulation/model development required by Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force.  This project also includes development related to national and tactical imagery architectures, as well as software development to decrease mission planning time and increase the quality and accuracy of each mission for Block III and IV TLAM.

The TTWCS provides launch capability for surface and submarine platforms.  Development of the TTWCS provides a common architecture to launch the TACTOM Block IV and all variants in inventory.  Development of upgrades to the TTWCS is required to meet the Department of Defense Information Technology Standards Registry, to meet FORCEnet compliance and be Internet Protocol Version 6 ready in order to remain interoperable within the Joint Service Architecture and to retain weapons system viability and usability for our Sailors.  These efforts provide battle-group tactical flexibility and responsiveness while maximizing TWS wartime capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Tactical Tomahawk (TACTOM) Weapon System achieved IOC in May 2004. The acquisition strategy involves maintaining production through FY14 and entrance into recertification starting in FY19. Recertification of TACTOM missiles starting in FY19 provides modernization opportunities to improve weapon system performance. TC2S and TTWCS are in sustainment requiring periodic hardware and software updates to maintain compliance with IA standards and maintain system relevance against emerging threats. Sustainment of TC2S and TTWCS segments will rely on a blend of industry and government expertise through the remaining life of the program.

Research &amp; Development technology demonstration capabilities (Multiple-Effects Warhead, Anti Surface Warfare) will be potentially introduced after successful qualification and testing.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The Navy seeks to improve the Tomahawk cruise missile attack capability against land targets through research and development done predominantly through defense contractors and government field activities.       

Examples in the area of the All-Up-Round include development of candidate warheads and sensors that will enhance weapon ability to cover all assigned target types, provide a quick reaction response capability for the weapon system, and improved guidance, navigation, control, mission computer two-way satellite communications, and a high anti-jam GPS receiver all in line with state of the art technology.  

In the area of the weapons control system, research and development is performed to ensure viability and usability of the system into the future, providing necessary upgrades to meet the Department of Defense Information Technology standards registry to comply with FORCEnet requirements and be Internet Protocol Version 6 ready to remain interoperable within Joint Service Architecture, in order to provide battle-group tactical flexibility and responsiveness needed to enable full wartime capability.  

In the area of the TC2S, continue research and development in order to provide scalable configurations to deploy where and as needed to provide necessary command and control, development necessary to function with national and tactical imagery architectures, decrease mission planning time, and increase the quality and accuracy of each mission for the TWS.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) comprises two projects - 0766 and 0344.  Project 0766 provides for Integrated Undersea Surveillance Systems (IUSS) Research and Development Projects under the Maritime Surveillance Systems (MSS) Program Office (PEO SUB PMS 485).  IUSS provides the Navy with its primary means of submarine detection both nuclear and diesel.  A portion of project 0766 (FSS) is classified, with details available at a higher classification level. Project 0344 funds the Shallow Water Surveillance System (SWSS) project to develop and demonstrate the technology to enable autonomous installation of a passive acoustic array with processing and communications gear. 

The IUSS Research and Development project (0766) funds SURTASS Passive and SURTASS Low Frequency Active (LFA) developments.  SURTASS provides the mobile, tactical arm of the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System, providing long range detection and cueing for tactical weapons platforms against both diesel and nuclear powered submarines.  SURTASS LFA provides an active adjunct capability for IUSS passive and tactical sensors to assist in countering the quieter diesel and nuclear threats of the 1990s and beyond.  The LFA tasks are directed at detection of slow quiet threats in harsh littoral waters.

In order to continue with reductions in life cycle costs and continue with system-wide consolidation, a short-term goal is to develop a common IUSS processor based on NAVSEA's Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (ARCI) program, with a cyclical tech refresh of hardware and software in conjunction with the submarine Advanced Processor Build (APB) process.  The IUSS Integrated Common Processor (ICP) has the capability to process and display data from all fixed and mobile underwater systems.  The IUSS ICP will be used for all new system installations and replace the legacy systems as they reach end of life and require upgrading.  Additionally, SURTASS has consolidated on the TB-29A Twin-line array, a variant of the Submarine TB-29A Long line array.  This reduced the number of array variants employed by SURTASS from 3 to 1, and enabled development and logistics cost savings by leveraging off the submarine TB-29A program.

The Shallow Water Surveillance System (SWSS) project (0344) funds the development and demonstration of the Increment 1B system with technology to enable autonomous classification and reporting of specific submarine targets of interest.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A. This project includes efforts for SURTASS.  The SURTASS project comprises the mobile, tactical arm of the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System, providing long range detection and cueing for tactical weapons platforms against both diesel and nuclear powered submarines.  SURTASS also provides the undersea surveillance necessary to support regional conflicts and sea-lane protection.  SURTASS has experienced recent passive and active success against diesel submarines operating in shallow water.  SURTASS is leveraging existing developments and reducing costs by using Non-Developmental Items and commercial hardware, supporting common Navy Undersea Warfare processing and towed array developments, and increasing operator efficiency through computer-aided detection and classification processing.  SURTASS development efforts include: LFA improvements, common IUSS processing, twin-line array development and processing, improved detection and classification/passive automation to counter quieter threats, additional signal processing, integrated active and passive operations, improved Battle Group support, and improved information processing. 

 LFA provides an active adjunct capability for IUSS passive and tactical sensors to counter the quieter diesel and nuclear threats of the 1990s and beyond.  The LFA tasks are directed at detection of slow, quiet threats in harsh littoral waters.  Improvements include TL-29A/LFA integration enhancements, advanced waveforms for littoral/shallow water operations including Doppler sensitive waveforms, and processing algorithms to reduce clutter and reverberation false alarms in shallow water.  The LFA task includes development and testing of a compact LFA transmit source array for SWATH-P ships, and upgrade of LFA processing capability in the IUSS Integrated Common Processing (ICP) architecture.  The ICP is a derivative of the NAVSEA Submarine Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (ARCI) program, and is being augmented for IUSS requirements.  Together, the LFA improvements, TL-29A, and the ICP support the SURTASS Active Improvement Program.

 Functional improvements are delivered to the Fleet in software "builds" while hardware improvements are delivered through the Tech Insertion (TI) process.  Software improvements delivered via the Advanced Surveillance Build (ASB) process are based on the Advanced Processor Build (APB) process begun by the NAVSEA Submarine USW program.  Each ASB will introduce new capabilities into SURTASS systems including improved automation, normalizer techniques, adaptive beam forming, and display enhancements.  SURTASS participates in the process by contributing algorithms for consideration, supplying peer group members for review of candidate algorithms, participating in test evolutions, and incorporating improved algorithms into operational systems.  The TI process, modeled after the NAVSEA Submarine USW hardware improvement program, delivers processing technology improvements to platforms on roughly a 4-year cycle.  Hardware upgrades for active and passive arrays and communications systems will also be provided during TI upgrades, but not on a regular planned development cycle as for the processing upgrades. 

B. PEO SUB is involved with the development and maintenance of various IUSS systems.  These systems include FDS, FDS-C, and SURTASS.  The near-term goal is development of ICP, which will result in a single IUSS processor baseline, with minor maintenance efforts continuing on fielded systems.  The existing system architecture, signal processing, contact management, and reporting requirements will be evaluated as well as the requirements for future systems.  The development of the ICP will take advantage of automation advancement, array technology improvements, along with IUSS, submarine, and surface USW system commonality.  Additionally, a long term goal is to activate all IUSS sensors as part of a coordinated Active Improvement Program.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR) (formerly known as the Multi-Role Radar System (MRRS)) is an expeditionary, 3-dimensional, high-mobility, multi-purpose wheeled vehicle, short/medium range multi-role radar designed to detect cruise missiles, air breathing targets, rockets, mortars, and artillery. MRRS and GWLR (Ground Weapons Locating Radar) merged into a single requirement/capability (G/ATOR) and will replace an aging fleet of single mission legacy radar systems. G/ATOR will support air defense, air surveillance, counter-battery/target acquisition, aviation radar tactical enhancements and the final evolution will also support the Air Traffic Control mission.  This project was funded under Program Element 0206313M Project C3099 prior to FY2010 and Program Element 0206313M Project 9C89 in FY2011-2012.  It was moved to Program Element 0204460M in FY2013.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR) is a multi-role, ground-based, expeditionary radar that replaces five legacy radar systems for the Marine Air Ground Task Force.  It satisfies the Marine Air Command and Control System (G/ATOR Block 1) and the Ground Counter Fire/Counter Battery (G/ATOR Block 2) capabilities.  The G/ATOR replaces the AN/TPS-63 and complements the AN/TPS-59 long range radar and will provide mobile, multi-functional, three-dimensional surveillance of air breathing targets, detection of cruise missiles and UAS, and the cueing of air defense weapons.  The G/ATOR contributes to the extension of Sea Shield/Sea Strike by surveillance and detection of enemy air threats not seen by Navy sensors in the littorals by participating in a cooperative engagement network of sensors and shooters.  G/ATOR enables Integrated Fire Control (IFC) and provides engage/fire on remote capability.  G/ATOR surveillance coverage with IFC will provide unprecedented reach, volume, and precision in the execution of Operational Maneuver From The Sea, allowing Naval forces to project and sustain power deep inland. The funding increase from FY14 to FY15 supports Gallium Nitride (GaN) Transition and G/ATOR Block 2 software development as part of a Common Hardware Material Solution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR) is a multi-role, ground-based, expeditionary radar that replaces five legacy radar systems and provides the USMC Air Defense and Air Surveillance (AD/AS)(G/ATOR Block 1), Counterfire/Targeting (G/ATOR Block 2), and Air Traffic Control (G/ATOR Block 4) capability.  The AD/AS (GB1) development effort was competitively awarded in 2007 and completed Milestone C in FY14.  Development of the Counterfire/Targeting (GB2) capability was initiated in FY10 with a RFI to industry, followed by a Business Case Analysis (BCA) to select the most cost effective procurement strategy.  The results of the BCA indicated that a sole source contract to NGSC was the most cost effective solution. Thus, development award is planned for the 3rd Qtr FY15. In FY13, a BCA was performed to determine the optimum strategy for development of the Air Traffic Control (GB4) mission with a potential development contract to be awarded in FY16.  Funding in FY14 and FY15 supports systems engineering activities prior to contract award, including integration studies with ATNAVICS, the Navy provided Air Traffic Control C2 systems.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>A. MISSION DESCRIPTION:
0604 - This project develops specialized instrumentations for fleet readiness training while minimizing life cycle costs.  Tasks include development of the following: Large Area Training Range (LATR) improvements and Tactical Training Range(TTR) infrastructure improvements to include:  the Joint Display Subsystem (JDS), Radar Acquistion Display Subsystem, Electronic Warfare (EW) server, Link 16 interface, TTR shipboard rotary platform technology improvements and the Radiant Mercury (RM) Cross Domain Solution (CDS).  

1427 - Surface Tactical Team Trainer (STTT) develops modifications during sustainment of Battle Force Tactical Training (BFTT) system.   This is required to maintain capabilities and interfaces to provide realistic combat system coordinated team, unit and Fleet Synthetic Training (FST) collective Group/Force level training events.   In addition, BFTT supports the embedded trainer "family of systems" approach for the development of a Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC).  Specific improvements include improved integration with the Navy Continuous Training Environment (NCTE) and development of a High Level Architecture (HLA) capable, integrated shipboard network to meet increasing Commander Naval Surface Forces (CNSF) and United States Fleet Forces Command (USFFC) FST requirements. The need for transforming training is documented within the DoD Training Transformation Plan, the Chief of Naval Operations Fleet Response Plan and Commander United States Fleet Forces Command Fleet Readiness Training Plan.  

2124 - The Air Warfare Training Development (AWTD) program provides transition of operational systems technologies and risk mitigation for aviation training systems, including mission preview/rehearsal simulation technologies, Live-Virtual Constructive (LVC) and the Aviation Training Technology Integration Facility (ATTIF).  The ATTIF provides for incremental development, prototype evaluation, technology readiness level assessment and final fleet Test and Evaluation prior to technology transition.  

3093 - The Tactical Combat Training System (TCTS) will provide the Navy a replacement for the Tactical Aircrew Combat Training System and LATR systems.  TCTS will also provide fleet deployable training for at-sea training and tactics development.  By providing a rangeless capability, the system will greatly increase the area where live instrumented training can be conducted.  Fielding of a pod system is complete at TACTS sites.  The program incorporates an evolutionary development (incremental) towards an encrypted system capable of supporting a broad spectrum of naval platforms through weapons simulations, participant sensor stimulation, open architecture and an encrypted/long range secure data link. 

3356- Funds FCA, high fidelity Aegis Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) individual and team trainers for all Advanced Capability Build (ACB) and below Aegis baselines. This line also provides funds for development of a CIWS 1B Baseline 2 Trainer upgrade.


JUSTIFICATON FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY:

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>BFTT Program provides realistic joint warfare training across the spectrum of armed conflict, realistic unit level team training in all warfare areas (e.g. NIFC-CA and BMD missions to support IAMD capabilities).  BFTT will link ships together via USFFC NCTE. BFTT is evolving to an open distributed architecture with maximum commonality across ship classes, integrating existing training systems and evolving to High Level Architecture (HLA) protocols.  BFTT provides ships' Commanding Officers and Battle Group/Battle Force Commanders with the ability to conduct coordinated realistic, high stress, combat system level team training as an integral part of the Afloat Training Organization, the Tactical Training Groups and C2F/C3F FSTs. BFTT provides a baseline capability/system that meets the Operational Requirements Document (ORD).  Without an operating BFTT system, the ship will be unable to complete system level testing impacting overall combat system operational testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project transitions new training system technologies for use in Naval Aviation training.  Products from this effort are directly tied to the Navy Aviation Simulation Master Plan (NASMP), NASMP technology upgrades, MH-60R/S master plan, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) master plan, UAS Common Control Station (CCS), Live Virtual Constructive (LVC), component technologies, F/A-18C-F Requirements Procurement Plan (RPP), open architecture implementation, multiple platform technology refresh efforts and the Multi-Mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA/P-8) programs.  These efforts will support the development and design of future naval aviation training/preview/mission rehearsal systems (fixed, deployed, and unmanned).  Tasks include:  Advanced training systems specification development to provide for common, modular, High Level Architecture (HLA) compliant, high fidelity Distributed Mission Training (DMT) and mission rehearsal capabilites ashore and afloat.  Technologies to be developed and integrated include:  intelligent semi-automated forces (SAF) technologies, automated performance measurement technology, advanced net-ready weapons simulation, Air to Air/Air to Ground (AA/AG), visual/sensor enhancement, sensor/weather server, common Mission Training Station (MTS) technologies, tablet mission preview technology, advanced visual-sensor technology, high resolution helmet mounted, and/or flat panel displays, 20-20 visual acuity image generation, NAVAIR Portable Source Initiative (NSPI) improvements, common correlated data set technologies, common link, common software/database reuse technologies, advanced environmental effects modeling, fused radar/infra-red/electro-optic and acoustic sensor simulations, aerodynamic modeling, physics-based infra-red simulations, comms degradation modeling and final T&amp;E within the Aviation Training Technology Integration Facility (ATTIF), NAWCAD, which is a man-in-the loop test bed for the integration of software, hardware and operational equipment.  This Manned-Flight Simulator (MFS) capability provides a window to fleet aviators for critical comment, evaluation and fine tuning of new, interoperable, and innovative technologies such as Training System Common Environment (TRACE) components, before final transition to the fleet.  MTS, debrief/After Action Review (AAR) and intelligent training tools for the virtual environment are focused on human performance enhancements for fleet readiness and distributed mission training at all levels.  
Metrics:  These technology transitions seek to lower Total Ownership Costs (TOC) of the training systems and life cycle costs, including: increasing software re-use, reduced instructor manning profiles, software-based fidelity enhancements and increased fleet readiness by enhancing overall system fidelity to the projected operating environments.  NASMP readiness improvements are conservatively forecasted at 12-35% Training and Readiness (T+R) improvement via synthetic environment upgrades and associated technology upgrades to stand-alone and networked simulators.  Individual technology transition investments have routinely exceeded 300+% financial Return On Investment (ROI).  Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), Training and Readiness, fleet readiness, and financial metrics are used.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

By providing a rangeless capability, the system will greatly increase the area where live instrumented training can be conducted.  Fielding of a pod system is complete at TACTS sites.  The program incorporates an evolutionary development (incremental) towards an encrypted system capable of supporting a broad spectrum of naval platforms through weapons simulations, participant sensor stimulation, open architecture and an encrypted/long range secure data link.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Cryptologic Systems Engineering - Cryptologic Carry On Program (CCOP) develops state-of-the-art signal acquisition software in response to Combatant Command requirements for a quick-reaction surface, subsurface and airborne cryptologic carry-on capability. There are approximately 115 cryptologic capable surface ships and shore sites in the current Navy inventory; each is a potential user of this carry-on equipment, depending on deployment schedules and the tempo of operations. In addition, there are numerous subsurface and air platforms that are also potential users. This funding line will provide the resources to enable rapid transition of available Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off -The-Shelf (GOTS) technologies that apply to Fleet requirements for carry-on system functionalities. These technologies typically require various levels of integration to leverage on-board systems that provide system and mission management, product reporting, and data analysis. COTS/GOTS system documentation and training materials usually require adaptation or modification to meet fleet operator requirements, or entirely new training materials may need to be developed. Before deployment for operational use, systems must be systematically tested to ensure suitable and reliable operation, tested for network vulnerabilities if connected to shipboard Local Area Networks, and tested relative to interoperability requirements. Certification testing is conducted to meet Office of Naval Intelligence security requirements and network testing is conducted in accordance with Information Technology (IT) requirements to allow connection to Navy networks. Funding will also provide resources to address rapid deployment of enhancements or improvements to the common hardware and/or software baseline of all other carry-on subsystems to meet emergent requirements.

FY15 funds will continue to integrate, test, and document identified COTS and GOTS technologies and subsystems that meet emergent and on-going Fleet requirements as specified in the Signals of Interest (SOI) and target threat list. Funds will continue to develop upgrades to existing systems and subsystems according to Fleet requirements. Additional funds will aid in the development of new SOI algorithms in support of cryptologic systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The goal of these investments is to provide to Commanders non-kinetic options to influence adversaries and prevent escalation of crises.  Due to the nature and classification of these efforts, qualitative measures are used. It is the intent through the development of modeling and simulation scenarios and capabilities to develop quantitative  metrics.  The success of this depends heavily on the insight obtained via various intelligence community efforts.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>A new Program Element (PE), 0605555N, has been established for the Direct and Time Sensitive Strike Program Office to support research, development, test and evaluation of Strike Weapons to be employed from a multitude of fixed and rotary wing aircraft in support of offensive and defensive land and sea based targets across multiple mission areas.  The following projects have been realigned/transferred to this new PE beginning in FY 2014: 3212 - MEDUSA Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) and 3412 - Hellfire-Romeo (Hellfire-R) Integration. The Cost to Complete on Exhibits R-2 and R-2a should be $7.615M.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Research, Development, Test and Evaluation funding for the Joint Service Anti-Radiation Missile (ARM) program, which will include near and far term performance improvements, cost reduction, and studies that establish future development requirements.  Specific initial efforts include lower cost seeker component development and seeker aided fuzing to enhance warhead performance in low angle impacts and against certain ship targets. 

These projects are funded under Operational Systems Development because they include development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) Improvement is a Navy led joint service program with the Air Force.  The program commenced production in FY 1983.  Program element 0205601N was used until FY 1990 to develop and test one hardware and two software upgrades to the HARM (air-to-ground (AGM)-88B, Block 3 &amp; AGM-88C, Block 4) as Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs).  Another ECP software program (Block 3A &amp; 5) was developed (FY 1996 through FY 1999) to modify HARM software in order to meet operational requirements.  HARM Block 3A/5 software was distributed to the Fleet in FY 2000.  The Block 5 tactical software upgrade gives HARM improved geographic specificity and improved capability against advanced waveforms.  HARM Block 5A is currently being deployed in the Fleet.

HARM Improvement includes efforts to conduct Foreign Military Assessment (FMA) analysis and engineering to exploit vulnerabilities of foreign weapon system threats.  HARM Improvement includes funding for threat assessment, operational updates and integration efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Expect continued testing on advanced Surface-to-Air weapons and related integrated air defense systems (IADS), jammers and ARM countermeasures, and non-traditional ARM targets. One specific area of attention will be expanding collection, analysis, and definition of radar parametric related to HARM 5A improvements, with feedback from full Fleet fielding in 2013.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM) transitioned a Phase III Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program to develop and demonstrate a multi-mode guidance section on a HARM airframe to System Development and Demonstration (SD&amp;D) in FY 2003. The AARGM SD&amp;D program was designed to integrate multi-mode guidance (passive Anti-Radiation Homing (ARH)/active Millimeter Wave (MMW) Radar/Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation System) on the HARM Air-to-Ground Missile (AGM)-88. AARGM weapon system capabilities include: active MMW terminal guidance, counter shutdown, expanded threat coverage, enhanced ARH, netted targeting real-time feed via Integrated Broadcast System (IBS) prior to missile launch, Weapon Impact Assessment (WIA) transmitted prior to detonation, GPS/point-to-point weapon navigation, and weapon employment with impact avoidance zone/missile impact zones.

In June 2003, a successful Milestone B transitioned AARGM to a SD&amp;D Acquisition Category 1C program. Alliant Techsystems (ATK) Missile Systems Company was awarded the AARGM SD&amp;D contract valued at $222.6M. In May 2004, the contract baseline was increased to $231.9M to accelerate incorporation of an embedded IBS-Receiver, enabling the warfighter to directly receive National intelligence data, increasing overall pilot situational awareness. Recent modifications have changed the current baseline to $232.3M. 

The AARGM program includes 40 SD&amp;D test articles with the follow on of 1,879 production modification kits. Milestone C was achieved 4Q FY 2008, followed by a combined FY 2008/FY 2009 Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract award in 1Q FY 2009. Developmental testing was completed in 2009. Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) was completed in 3Q FY 2012. LRIP III contract was awarded 1Q FY 2012, and deliveries have begun 1Q FY 2013. Full-Rate Production (FRP) decision was received 20 August 2012 with FRP contract award on 10 September 2012, and deliveries have begun in January 2014.

The AARGM Block 1 Upgrade program began in FY 2012 and consists of improvements and enhancements through software changes, which will enable the AGM-88E AUR, as well as the Common Munitions Built-in Test (BIT) Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE) box 4 and 5 to correct IOT&amp;E deficiencies and complete Capability Production Document requirements.  Block 1 will improve counter measure identification, and will complete development of Target of Opportunity, Millimeter Wave (MMW), IBS-R capabilities, Navigation, and Weapons Impact Assessment (WIA) messages.  In parallel with the Block 1 Upgrade, efforts to complete the development of Phase III equipment (Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS)-R/Embedded Network Tactical Receiver (ENTR) and IBS-R/ENTR antenna) are ongoing.  

Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation/Integrated Test/Operational Test - Development (FOT&amp;E/IT/OT-D) in conjunction with Block 1 Upgrade will complete tactics development and support promulgation of Operational Tactics Guide (OTG).  FOT&amp;E includes AGM-88E extension to objective aircraft.

In FY 2013-FY 2019, the AGM-88E AARGM program plans to develop and demonstrate the capability to engage and destroy non-traditional and Overseas Contingency Operations targets through the Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) missions. These developments continue Future Naval Capability Science and Technology investments by the Office of Naval Research initiated in FY 2006.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY 2014, a new Program Element (PE) was established (BA 7 - 0605555N) for the Direct and Time Sensitive Strike Program Office to support research, development, test and evaluation of Strike Weapons employed from a multitude of fixed and rotary wing aircraft in support of offensive and defensive land and sea based targets across multiple mission areas.   This project unit has been transferred to PE 0605555N.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Medusa Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) will demonstrate the Low Cost Guided Imaging Rockets (LOGIR) technology currently being developed at the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake on the MH-60S.  LOGIR provides "fire and forget" capability to 2.75-inch rockets in support of Sea Shield Pillar, increases platform lethality against Fast Attack Craft (FAC)/Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FIAC) threat, provides a low-cost Imaging InfraRed precision guidance section for the existing 2.75-inch unguided rockets and provides maximum precision kills per sortie, low cost, minimum collateral damage, increased efficiency, and increased standoff. Initial Program documentation (i.e. Performance Spec, Capabilities Development Document) will be developed within the scope of the JCTD.  

Digital Rocket Launcher (DRL) provides 2.75 inch-rocket capability on MH-60R/S in support of Sea Shield Pillar, increases lethality against FAC/FIAC threat. The addition of the Advanced Precision Kill Weapons System guidance section for the existing 2.75 inch unguided rockets provides maximum precision kills per sortie, minimum collateral damage, increased efficiency and increased standoff.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element develops and improves the Navy's Tactical Data Link (TDL) systems. It includes the Advanced Tactical Data Link Systems (ATDLS) Integration Programs, specifically Link 16 Network, Command and Control Processor (C2P) and Link Monitoring and Management Tool (LMMT); and Network Tactical Common Data Link (NTCDL) Program which provides the ability to transmit/receive real-time Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) data simultaneously from multiple sources (surface, air, sub-surface, man-portable), and exchange command and control information (voice, data, imagery, and Full Motion Video (FMV)) across dissimilar Joint, Service, Coalition, and civil networks. The Program Element also develops and tests tactical data link capability to distribute other data types to new and existing platforms.

JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under Operational Systems Development because it encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for upgrade of existing operational systems.

NTCDL provides warfighters with the capability to support multiple, simultaneous, networked operations with currently fielded CDL-equipped platforms (e.g. F/A-18, P-3, and MH-60R), in addition to next generation manned and unmanned platforms (e.g., P-8, Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS), Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike ( UCLASS), and Fire Scout). NTCDL is a tiered capability providing a modular, scalable, multiple-link networked communications. NTCDL benefits the fleet by providing horizon extension for line-of-sight sensor systems for use in time critical strike missions. NTCDL supports Anti-Access/Area of Denial (A2AD) through its relay capability, and supports Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation Dissemination (TCPED) through its ISR networking capability.  Additionally, NTCDL supports Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR) efforts through its ability to share ISR data across dissimilar Joint, Service, Coalition, and Civil organizations.

The Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) program consists of two products, MIDS Low Volume Terminal (LVT) and MIDS Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). MIDS-LVT provides Link 16 capability to platforms that were unable to employ Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) due to space and weight constraints. The MIDS-LVT effort is multinational (U.S., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) with joint Service participation (Navy, Army, and Air Force). The Department of Defense (DoD) established the program to design, develop, and deliver low volume, lightweight tactical information system terminals for U.S. and Allied fighter aircraft, bombers, helicopters, ships, and ground sites. MIDS-LVT provides interoperability with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) users, significantly increasing force effectiveness and minimizing hostile actions and friend-on-friend engagements. The terminal design is smaller, lighter, highly reliable, interoperable with JTIDS Class 2 terminal, compatible with all the participants' designated platforms, affordable, and re-configurable to individual user needs and budgets. 
MIDS JTRS, designed as a Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) and executed as an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to the production MIDS-LVT configuration, completed qualification in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. It facilitated the Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) JTRS incremental approach for fielding advanced JTRS transformational networking capability and transformed the MIDS-LVT into a 4-channel, Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant, Joint Tactical Radio. A form-fit-function replacement to MIDS-LVT, MIDS JTRS also adds three programmable 2 Megahertz (MHz) to 2 Gigahertz (GHz) channels capable of hosting the JTRS legacy and networking waveforms. In addition to the Link 16, Tactical Air Navigation, and voice functionality found in MIDS-LVT, MIDS JTRS has four channels and adds capabilities such as Link 16 Enhanced Throughput, four nets Concurrent Multi-Netting (CMN) with Concurrent Contention Receive (CCR) (CMN-4), Link 16 Frequency Re-mapping (FR), software programmability, and Cryptographic Modernization (CM). With CMN-4, MIDS JTRS also utilizes Tactical Targeting Network Technology for MIDS JTRS Naval Integrated Fire Control Counter Air and From the Air Advanced Tactical Data Links.  These capabilities provide Joint Airborne Network-Tactical Edge functionality to run advanced mission applications in a cross-platform/cross-domain tactical network enterprise and the ability to simultaneously participate in four Link 16 Nets.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and improves the Navy's Tactical Data Link (TDL) systems. It includes the Advanced Tactical Data Link Systems (ATDLS) Integration Programs, specifically Link 16 Network, Command and Control Processor (C2P) and Link Monitoring and Management Tool (LMMT).

ATDLS Integration Program develops new and improved capabilities for Navy TDL users. The Navy Link 16 Network Increment II consists of Dynamic Network Management (DNM), Cryptographic Modernization (CM) and Frequency Remapping (FR). C2P Technology Refresh (TR) and C2P Interoperability will modernize legacy C2P processing components to address C2P component obsolescence and fleet interoperability issues. C2P is a critical component in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) architecture. Modernization is a service life extension program required to sustain C2P support of Naval Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) and BMD capabilities. Link 22 development and integration into the C2P allows for standard data link communication with Coalition forces. LMMT will upgrade commercial off-the-shelf hardware and modernize software operating systems. LMMT will improve TDL performance monitoring and management in support of the Integrated Air &amp; Missile Defense (IAMD) and Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) missions.

Link 16 Network Increment II funds the following activities: (1) conduct DNM Developmental Test (DT)/Operational Test (OT) and correct DNM deficiencies (2) develop and implement CM and FR mandates as a product improvement into Link 16 terminals and integration into shore sites, ship (NGC2P), and current Navy Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) airborne platforms; (3) DT/OT of Navy platform CM/FR modifications; (4) provide product improvement for continued production capability MIDS-on-ship (MOS) Modernization (MOS Mod) and extensibility to new Tactical Data Link capabilities of shipboard Link 16 terminals.

FY 2015 Justification: Funding will provide for Link 16 DNM software modification to adress TSR issues and Developmental Test/ Follow on Test &amp; Evaluation (DT/FOT&amp;E) for MOS terminals. JTIDS CM/FR to completion of Test Readiness Review (TRR) and conduct of acceptance testing of five Engineering and Manufacturing Development units to be used for National Security Agency (NSA) Cryptographic Certification and acceptance testing.  Software modifications to the shipboard Command and Control Processor (C2P) will continue to support shipboard integration of the CM/FR capability. Similar software modifications to the E-2C host processing will be continued through the E-2C Program Office (PMA-231) for the CM/FR capability. Funding will also provide for MOS CM/FR  Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Critical Design Review (CDR).  JTIDS and MOS CM/FR efforts are in support of NSA (NSA Policy 3-9) and Joint Chiefs of Staff mandates (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction Notice 6510.02), for the modernization of the cryptographic algorithm used in Link 16 terminals and the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation Memorandum of Agreement (Regarding the 960-1215 MHz. Frequency Band, 31 December 2002) for the implementation of a capability to remap any 14 of the existing 51 frequencies in order to remain operable within the United States and its possessions. All Link 16 terminals are required to have this capability to support Link 16 Interoperability. To address continued production capability and extensibility to new Tactical Data Link capabilities, funding will provide for continued MOS Mod development leading to a Test Readiness Review (TRR).

Command and Control Processor (C2P) Technology Refresh (TR) funds a product improvement effort to the legacy C2P hardware components and allows C2P software to execute on modern processors, thereby extending its effective service life. Product improvement efforts will include C2P software development, hardware integration, update of the C2P development environment to promote sustainability and testing to include Developmental Test (DT)/Operational Test (OT) of the C2P TR baseline.

C2P, Phase 3, Increment 3 is planned to include Link 22, which is a modernized replacement for Link 11, providing Beyond Line of Sight (BloS) tactical data communication system utilizing fixed frequency or frequency hopping techniques in the High Frequency (HF) (3-30 Megahertz (MHz)) and/or the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) (225-400 MHz) bands.

FY 2015 Justification: Continue C2P Technology Refresh development and accomplish Inc 3 Link-22 Preliminary Design Review (PDR), Milestone B and Critical Design Review (CDR).

Link Monitoring and Management Tool (LMMT) is a near real-time tactical command and control system delivered on commercial off-the-shelf hardware providing for multiple Tactical Data Link (TDL) interfaces, routing and display of TDL data including Link 16 and Joint Range Extension. LMMT is also capable of performing TDL network planning, monitoring, management, data forwarding between the TDLs and providing tactical data to the Global Command and Control System for establishing the Common Operational Picture.  LMMT requirements will be incrementally developed and delivered in capability drops.

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In accordance with the Acquisition Decision Memorandum dated 11 July 2012, the Joint Tactical Radio Systems Programs of Record (JTRS PORs) transitioned to a Military Department-managed program.  MIDS transitioned to the Navy under PE 0205604N but was formerly in PE 0604280N. MDAP code 554.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) program consists of two products, MIDS Low Volume Terminal (LVT) and MIDS Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). MIDS-LVT provides Link 16 capability to platforms that were unable to employ Joint Tactical Information Distribution System due to space and weight constraints. The MIDS-LVT effort is multinational (U.S., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) with joint Service participation (Navy, Army, and Air Force). The Department of Defense (DoD) established the program to design, develop, and deliver low volume, lightweight tactical information system terminals for U.S. and Allied fighter aircraft, bombers, helicopters, ships, and ground sites. MIDS-LVT provides interoperability with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) users, significantly increasing force effectiveness and minimizing hostile actions and friend-on-friend engagements. The terminal design is smaller, lighter, highly reliable, interoperable with JTIDS Class 2 terminal, compatible with all the participants' designated platforms, affordable, and re-configurable to individual user needs and budgets. 
MIDS JTRS, designed as a Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) and executed as an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to the production MIDS-LVT configuration, completed qualification in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. It facilitated the Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) JTRS incremental approach for fielding advanced JTRS transformational networking capability and transformed the MIDS-LVT into a 4-channel, Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant, Joint Tactical Radio. A form-fit-function replacement to MIDS-LVT, MIDS JTRS also adds three programmable 2 Megahertz (MHz) to 2 Gigahertz (GHz) channels capable of hosting the JTRS legacy and networking waveforms. In addition to the Link 16, Tactical Air Navigation, and voice functionality found in MIDS-LVT, MIDS JTRS has four channels and adds capabilities such as Link 16 Enhanced Throughput, Four Net Concurrent Multi-Netting (CMN) with Concurrent Contention Receive (CCR) (CMN-4), Link 16 Frequency Re-mapping, software programmability, and Cryptographic Modernization. With CMN-4, MIDS JTRS also utilizes Tactical Targeting Network Technology for MIDS JTRS Naval Integrated Fire Control Counter Air and From the Air Advanced Tactical Data Links.  These capabilities provide Joint Airborne Network-Tactical Edge functionality to run advanced mission applications in a cross-platform/cross-domain tactical network enterprise and the ability to simultaneously participate in four Link 16 Nets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MIDS JTRS development was initiated as a major modification to the MIDS-LVT using an Engineering Change Proposal to the existing production contracts.  Development efforts included the Phase 2B Core terminal.  The U.S. prime contractors from the MIDS-LVT program, Data Link Solutions (DLS) and ViaSat Inc., cooperatively designed and developed the Core terminal.  Each prime contractor built and qualified Production Verification Terminals.  The U.S. implemented a continuous competition strategy between DLS and ViaSat that will be maintained throughout the MIDS JTRS production phase.  This strategy was successfully used on MIDS-LVT production.  The FY15 budget supports the development and implementation of Crypto Modernization, Frequency Remapping, and Enhanced Throughput capabilities for the MIDS-LVT terminal.  It also supports the development to incorporate Four Net Concurrent Multi-Netting (CMN) with Concurrent Contention Receive (CCR) (CMN-4), Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT) and the TTNT waveform into MIDS JTRS.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Network Tactical Common Data Link (NTCDL) provides the ability to transmit/receive real-time Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) data simultaneously from multiple sources (surface, air, sub-surface, portable), and exchange command and control information (voice, data, imagery, and Full Motion Video) across dissimilar Joint, Service, Coalition, and civil networks. NTCDL provides warfighters with the capability to support multiple, simultaneous, networked operations with currently fielded CDL-equipped platforms (e.g. F/A-18, P-3, and MH-60R), in addition to next generation manned and unmanned platforms (e.g., P-8, Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS), UCLASS, and Fire Scout). NTCDL is a tiered capability (surface, air, sub-surface, man-portable) providing a modular, scalable, multiple-link networked communications. NTCDL benefits the fleet by providing horizon extension for line-of-sight sensor systems for use in time critical strike missions. NTCDL supports Anti-Access/Area of Denial (A2AD) through its relay capability, and supports Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation Dissemination (TCPED) through its ISR networking capability.  Additionally, NTCDL supports Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR) efforts through its ability to share ISR data across dissimilar Joint, Service, Coalition, and Civil organizations.
 
FY15 will focus on pre-EMD and pre-MS B efforts leading to Contract Award, development of NTCDL system Engineering Development Models (EDMs), and support efforts for airborne terminal research and development activities of High Capacity Backbone (HCB) and air-to-air relay activities in an Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2AD) environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Navy's Strategy is to remain the preeminent maritime power, providing the U.S. a global expeditionary force committed to security and prosperity, while defending the Nation's interests.  Within this vision, Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) remains a Navy core competency in a dynamic and uncertain maritime environment.  U.S. adversaries continue to develop asymmetric capabilities and capacities to deter, disrupt, or delay the entry of U.S. and allied naval forces, and pose a constant challenge as we implement the Maritime Strategy.  Evolving submarine technologies offer enhanced stealth, speed, endurance, weapons, and operational proficiency, trends foretelling that the adversary submarine of the future will have a significantly larger sphere of influence, while presenting less vulnerability to ASW forces.  The effective offensive engagement range of the adversary submarine of the future will continue to match or outrange individual U.S. and multinational platform sensors and weapons in many tactical environments.  Submarines are an increasing threat to all Naval and Allied ships, particularly modern diesel subs and faster torpedoes.  Not only can the presence of potential hostile submarines delay naval combatant action until they are located and neutralized, submarines can also disrupt all seaborne logistics supply for any ground campaign as well as maritime commerce.  ASW forces must be effective in all operating environments, ranging from the deep open ocean to the littorals, and are key to countering adversarial anti-access and area denial strategies.

The objective of this Program Element (PE) is to significantly improve existing Surface Ship Undersea Warfare (USW) sonar system capabilities through quick and affordable development/integration of emergent, transformational technologies in support of Littoral ASW, Theater ASW, Mine Reconnaissance, and overall Sea Shield efforts required to pace the threat.  Detection and classification play uniquely vital roles in the success of any ASW campaign.  To be effective against increasingly stealthy threats in an often ambiguous undersea environment, future sensors must be environmentally adaptive, have very low false alarm rates, and exploit the full range of current and future submarine detection vulnerabilities.

Project 1916's primary mission is to improve AN/SQQ-89(V) Measures Of Performance (MOP) by enhancing detection, tracking, classification, passive, active, torpedo Detection, Classification, and Localization (DCL) and sonobuoy data processing and display capabilities, and increasing acoustic sensor frequency bandwidth (Operational Requirements Document #667-76-05 titled 'AN/SQQ-89 Improvement Program', Test and Evaluation Master Plan 802-2 (TEMP 802-2)). Improvements to system simulation, stimulation, Information Assurance (IA), software and network architectures, and safety are included.  This project takes advantage of the AN/SQQ-89(V) Open System Architecture (OSA) and Acoustic Rapid Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Insertion (ARCI) initiatives to integrate a torpedo DCL and ASW sonar combat system capability improvements.  This COTS-based Surface Ship ASW combat system, the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15, is currently planned as a backfit program for both CG47 (select CG59-73 Baseline 3 and 4 ships) and DDG51 (All DDG and follow FLT I/II/IIA) class ships.  The Open Architecture (OA) (level 3 compliant) of the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 system drives the Advanced Capability Build (ACB) spiral development process and provides budget flexibility to make COTS/OA technology solutions and ARCI-type initiatives affordable.  This will be accomplished via the incorporation of select Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and emergent, transformational ASW technologies delivered to the AN/SQQ-89(V) prime integrator every two years.  ASW technology implementation will take advantage of improvements developed under the submarine Advanced Processing Build (APB) program and will in turn share unique improvements developed under this program with the submarine and surveillance ASW communities.  This project will also contribute to the development of Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) ASW Mission Packages.

Project 1916 also includes funding for the Surface Ship Enhanced Measurement Program (SSEMP), which will measure the performance of existing and new Surface Ship ASW combat systems and enables data-based assessment of the capabilities and shortfalls in the performance of these systems in realistic scenarios.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Surface ASW Systems Improvements Project will support essential performance enhancements to AN/SQQ-89(V) and Surface Ship Sonar Systems.  This project will improve AN/SQQ-89(V) MOP by enhancing detection, tracking, classification, active, passive, torpedo DCL, and sonobuoy data processing and display capabilities, and increasing acoustic sensor frequency bandwidth (Operational Requirements Document #667-76-05 titled 'AN/SQQ-89 Improvement Program'), TEMP 802-2.

This project will take advantage of the AN/SQQ-89(V) OSA and ARCI initiatives to integrate a TDCL and ASW sonar and combat system capability improvements.  This COTS-based Surface Ship ASW combat system, the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15, is currently planned as a backfit program for both CG47 (select CG59-73 Baseline 3 and 4 ships) and DDG51 (All DDG51 and follow FLT I/II/IIA) class ships.  This project has delivered the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Pre-Production Prototype, performed installation on board CG73, and conducted subsequent Developmental Test &amp; Evaluation (DT&amp;E) and Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) where the system was found 'Operationally Effective' by Command Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR).

The OSA and high performance COTS processing hardware on ships fielded with the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 combat system provides an opportunity to integrate select P3I as well as emergent, transformational ASW technological improvements that were previously unachievable.  The Undersea Warfare (USW) suites on these ships will require periodic upgrades to remain effective well into the 21st century and to pace the threat.  Software upgrades target capability increases in high interest areas as prescribed by the Fleet and captured in campaign analysis.  To achieve this, this project will package and deliver incremental upgrades every two years to the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 production program via an ACB spiral development process (ACB-11, ACB-13, etc.) by inserting maturing USW technologies, such as enhancements to improve USW performance in the littoral, reduced manning on AN/SQQ-89(V) equipped ships, operator efficiency upgrades via the implementation of robust embedded data record and replay capability and active/passive sonar simulation/stimulation, DCL active/passive processing upgrades, passive sonar automated detection and classification processing bell-ringers from the ASW Community-of-Interest, detect and track through maneuvers, integration of MH-60R mission systems with the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 combat system, integration of Mid-Frequency active detection improvements, false-alarm rate reduction, clutter reduction, integration of ASW Community-of-Interest improved acoustic intercept and small-object avoidance, ASW Multi-Sensor integration (acoustic similar-source fusion and implementation of integrated shipboard system data, and ASW combat display architecture), distributed engagement management (Network Centric Enterprise Services implementation, new displays and decision aids, ASW Community-of-Interest model capabilities implementation), Multi-Frequency Acoustic Communications (MF ACOMMS) between Surface Combatants and Submarines, and upgraded technologies such as algorithm improvements, increased Passive Narrow Band (PNB) frequency, Continuous Active Sonar (CAS), and beamformer improvements. A rigorous testing program is also required to ensure that these performance enhancements are operationally effective and suitable.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These items will be integrated and delivered to the CG47 and DDG51 class AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 backfit production programs via ACB updates.  Import advanced development capabilities from the submarine Advanced Processing Build (APB) and Acoustic Rapid Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) Insertion (ARCI) projects.  Export advanced capabilities to submarine and surveillance combat system programs.

Resolve/troubleshoot issues/deficiencies that arise from the AN/SQQ-89(V) Surface Ship ASW Test &amp; Evaluation program. Rapidly address and correct problems/deficiencies in processing, capability or operations within the following areas within the AN/SQQ-89(V) USW combat system architecture; sensor processing, acoustics, fire control, contact management, performance prediction, operator productivity and on-board training, MFTA, Digital Fire Control Interface (DFCI), MFA processing, and adaptive beamforming.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>MK-48 ADCAP (Advanced Capability) Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program executes incremental development of weapon performance improvements in three development product areas: (1) Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System (CBASS), (2) Advanced Processor Builds (APBs), and (3) torpedo technology insertion. The budget enables Acquisition Category (ACAT) III development to address Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) defined capability-based requirements and mission needs. This program is tied to development programs that leverage a joint United States/Australia Armaments Cooperative Project (ACP) to develop MK-48 ADCAP CBASS; and Future Naval Capability (FNC) technologies developed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR).

Countermeasure (CM) sophistication and availability on the open market directly affects ADCAP kill proficiency and its ability to counter rapidly evolving threats. The focus of the MK-48 ADCAP torpedo program from FY 2001 and out shifted from being primarily concentrated on software block upgrade efforts towards coordinated hardware upgrades, rapid Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) insertion, and APBs to rapidly upgrade the ADCAP to counter evolving threats and maintain robust performance. The CBASS program developed and fielded a broadband sonar capable of identifying CMs and discriminating them from the target. CBASS Phase I achieved IOC in FY 2006 and Phase II was achieved in 2013.  The Commonwealth of Australia Royal Navy (RAN) is jointly participating to develop CBASS APB5 to improve shallow water performance and signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) extension November 2009.  The MOA extension expires Nov 2019.

The MK-48 ADCAP torpedo program focuses on two specific areas near term; torpedo APBs and hardware tech insertions. The CNO continues to stress shallow water (less than 600 feet) as a critical operating area to counter third world diesel electric submarines. Torpedo testing in shallow water has demonstrated that in-service ADCAP has less than full capability in this difficult environment. However, this testing, in conjunction with laboratory simulation efforts, has shown that significant performance improvements can be made by implementing changes to weapon tactics and software algorithms. Development, implementation, and testing of these changes is being accomplished under the torpedo APB program. The APB program also leverages the RAN joint torpedo program and FNC technologies developed by the ONR in the areas of torpedo broadband signal processing, tactics processing, and alertment. The torpedo tech insertion program will leverage the MK-54 Lightweight Torpedo (LWT) algorithms. Further hardware investment involves development of Guidance &amp; Control (G&amp;C) replacement required to support production and development of automated test equipment replacement to improve comprehensive system testing of full up CBASS torpedoes.

The torpedo technology insertion program will provide for evolutionary torpedo improvements and upgrades (including the transition and testing of advanced technologies from the research and development community).  This approach will incorporate developmental testing of the FNC transitioning technologies for ADCAP upgrades in the areas of torpedo sensors, weapon/platform connectivity, warhead lethality, speed and endurance. These efforts will continue torpedo development investment at a lower cost and shorter term than traditional torpedo programs.

APB5 software upgrades are currently in process for MK-48 ADCAP torpedoes.  

Both FNC technologies and MK-54 LWT developments will be transitioned into ADCAP through APBs and technology insertion packages. Priorities for APBs and technology insertion are: (1) improved torpedo effectiveness through advanced processing algorithms, (2) advanced counter-countermeasure capability, and (3) a new array to improve torpedo effectiveness.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

MK-48 ADCAP program executes incremental development of weapon performance improvements in two development product areas: (1) APBs, and (2) torpedo technology insertion. The budget enables ACAT III development to address CNO defined capability-based requirements and mission needs. This program is tied to development programs that leverage a joint United States/Australia ACP to develop MK-48 ADCAP; and FNC technologies being developed by the ONR.

APB software upgrades will improve torpedo performance in challenging water, countered environments through incorporation of new algorithms designed to address broadband, multiband, classifications and tactics processing changes. Hardware technology insertions will improve weapon availability through development of a G&amp;C replacement and an ATE replacement.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>Cost:

Project 2269:  Due to higher program and Navy priorities, Expeditionary Airfields (EAF) budget was reduced by $6.7M.  
in FY13.

Schedule:

Project 0601: Aircraft Spotting Dolly and Carrier/Amphibious Assault Ship Crash Crane schedule delayed as a result of the majority of FY13 funding being re-directed to a higher priority program within Project 0852.  Milestone C moved to 4Q FY16.   

Project 0852: eCASS Milestone C moved to 1Q FY14 due to the delayed completion of test analysis of DT-B1 results.  Milestone C delay has caused multiple schedule changes within the program, all of which have been approved by the Milestone Decision Authority.

Project 1355: Systems Engineering Propulsion &amp; Power Component Improvement and System Engineering to Correct Flight Safety Deficiencies added.
 
Project 2269:  Due to higher program and Navy priorities, EAF scheduled events and milestones were adjusted accordingly.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Common Ground Equipment is a Naval Aviation project to apply new technology to common support equipment necessary to support multiple systems/aircraft within the Navy.  The common support equipment items developed with this budget are briefed to the Air Force, Army and Coast Guard for possible use in joint procurement in the production phase.
  
New Programs are Aircraft Spotting Dolly (ASD) and Carrier/Amphibious Assault Ship Crash Crane (CV/AACC) in FY14.  ASD is an R&amp;D program to develop next generation ASD.  New ASD requires low profile and alternative power to allow safe spotting of all aircraft aboard carrier/amphibious class ships. CV/AACC is required to remove damaged aircraft from the flight line.  R&amp;D resources are needed to identify not only replacements, but new technologies, which can increase the reliability and maintainability of this flight ops critical piece of equipment.  

PEMA funding supports the evaluation, testing and integration to develop Portable Electronic Maintenance Aids (PEMA) Commercial Off the Shelf solution for portable device deployments across the Naval Aviation Enterprise. PEMA is a portable device utilized by maintainers with the implementation of digital maintenance capabilities (digital publications, Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals, Internet Protocol based data uploads, Binary digit data downloads, automated diagnostics, and planeside Naval Aviation Logistics Command/Management Information System. PEMAs are a mandatory display device supporting modern day Automated Maintenance Environment implemented for weapon systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>There are no commercially available towing vehicles that could even be modified to replace the capabilities of the present SD-2.  An R &amp; D effort will be required to design its replacement.  Advances in batteries and alternating current motor drive systems in the past decade have made it feasible to design an electrically powered vehicle for the CV, CVN, and L-Class hanger deck spotting missions.  Such a vehicle will be inherently more reliable, reduce maintenance, and eliminate the fumes and noise generated by a diesel engine.  An electrically driven vehicle will provide much greater motion control for slow speeds to aid in the engagement to the aircraft nose gear.  Proximity sensors will be incorporated to automatically stop the spotting dolly prior to accidental impact with the aircraft, other support equipment or bulkheads, increasing the safety of the spotting operations.  The legacy ASD is close to thirty years old and experiencing parts obsolescence issues and general efficiency degradation.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>CV/AACC are required to remove damaged aircraft from the flight line. In 2004, a solicitation for a commerical off the shelf replacement for the existing shipboard crash crane was issued. Two bids were received, and after a complete evaluation with many rounds of discussions with the companies bidding, both proposals were found to be technically inadequate and the procurement effort was discontinued. As a result, the crash cranes have continued operation unchanged. Designed in the late 1980's, major systems are beginning to experience the obsolescence of spare parts and are in need of updating. R&amp;D resources are needed to identify not only replacements, but new technologies, which can increase the reliability and maintainability of this flight ops critical piece of equipment. Systems updates would include the engine/generator and electrical updates to the motor drive/control system. An exploration of power sources other than diesel engines would be considered and a corrosion resistant boom.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The electronic Consolidated Automated Support System (eCASS) project is the system design and development of the latest generation of the US Navy's CASS family of automatic test systems.  The legacy CASS system was designed and developed in the 1980's and commenced fielding in 1992.  As such, it is reaching the end of its useful life due to obsolescence issues.  eCASS is the replacement system for legacy CASS systems, which provides Naval aircraft avionics component maintenance and repair support at Intermediate and Depot maintenance facilities both shore-based and afloat.  As a CASS replacement program, the eCASS program objectives remain the same as that of CASS.  Specifically:  (1) increase material readiness; (2) reduce life cycle costs; (3) improve tester sustainability at depot and intermediate maintenance levels; (4) reduce proliferation of unique test equipment, and (5) provide test capability for existing and emerging avionics/electronics aircraft weapon systems.

The Test Technology Development project involves analysis, application, maturation, integration and testing of emerging electronic, mechanical and optical test technologies for potential military utility in support of Naval avionics testing and repair.  Specific technologies being developed include synthetic instruments, new Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared electro-optics capabilities, multi-analog test capability to enable functional testing, and modernization elements for the CASS family of automatic test systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Aircraft Equipment Reliability/Maintainability Improvement Program (AERMIP) is the only Navy program which provides Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation engineering support specifically for in-service, out-of-production aircraft equipment. AERMIP increases readiness through reliability, maintainability, and safety improvements to existing systems and equipment installed in Naval aircraft. It also provides a transition vehicle to deploy Total Ownership Cost reduction initiatives through flight-test support and Fleet Test &amp; Evaluation. It meets affordable readiness objectives by providing a cost-effective solution to obsolescence problems encountered when service lives are extended. AERMIP promotes commonality and standardization across aircraft platform lines and among the services through extension of application and use of non-developmental items. AERMIP also decreases life cycle costs through reduced operational and support costs. AERMIP facilitates the Operational, Safety and Improvement Program by applying proven low-risk solutions to current fleet problems. AERMIP also funds high-priority flight testing which is not associated with any acquisition or development program under the Flight Test General task.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Propulsion and Power (P&amp;P) Component Improvement Program (CIP) provides the only source of critical design and development engineering support to resolve safety, reliability  and maintainability deficiencies of in-service Navy and Marine Corps aircraft propulsion systems. The highest priority issues P&amp;P CIP addresses concern safety-of-flight deficiencies, which account for approximately 80% of P&amp;P CIP efforts. The program also corrects service-revealed deficiencies, improves Operational Readiness and Reliability and Maintainability, and reduces platform Life Cycle Cost. Budgets are allocated across platform-specific teams and multi-platform product support teams based upon long term strategies to achieve  safety and affordable readiness goals; the R-3 exhibit details annual portions of those long-term strategies. P&amp;P CIP tasks have reduced the rate of in-flight aborts, safety incidents, non-mission capable rates, scheduled and unscheduled engine removals, maintenance work hours, and overall cost of ownership. This is accomplished through the maintenance and validation of specification performance, testing to qualify engineering changes, verifying life limits, and improving the inherent reliability of the propulsion and power systems as an integral part of Reliability Centered Maintenance initiatives. Historically, the missions, tactics, and environmental exposure of military aircraft systems change to meet new threats or operational demands, and often result in unforeseen problems, which if not corrected, can cause critical safety/readiness degradation, such as those experienced during OPERATIONS DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM, ENDURING FREEDOM, and IRAQI FREEDOM due to sand erosion. In addition, new problems arise through actual fleet deployment and usage of the aircraft. System development programs, while geared to resolve as many problems as possible before deployment, cannot duplicate actual operations or account for the vast array of environmental and usage variables, particularly when aircraft missions vary from those that the aircraft was designed to perform. Therefore, it has been found that P&amp;P CIP can provide an immediate engineering response to these flight-critical problems and accelerated engine testing can avoid potential problems. P&amp;P CIP starts after development and Navy acceptance of the first production article and addresses usage and life problems not covered by warranties. P&amp;P CIP addresses engines, transmissions, propellers, starters, auxiliary power units, electrical generating systems, aircraft wiring, and fuel and lubricant systems. These efforts continue over the system's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level sufficient to maintain the reliability, and decrease the operating costs, of older inventory. P&amp;P CIP is a highly leveraged and cooperative tri-service program with Foreign Military Sales participation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The Propulsion and Power Component (P&amp;P) Improvement Program (CIP) will support engineering design and development efforts for 100% of the safety of flight issues on in-service propulsion and power systems covered under the program. Over the past two years, this equated to more than 275 individual Engineering Project Descriptions (EPDs). P&amp;P CIP will also address reliability and maintainability deficiencies equating to at least another 100 individual EPDs. Similar projects have increased the aggregate engine reliability across the USN/USMC fleet, as measured by the mean flight hours between engine removals, by 40% over the past eight years.   

Program execution will be actively managed on 100% of the projects via contractor earned value data and overall obligation and expenditure rates as reflected in Navy ERP. Data will be analyzed and measured against OSD/FMB benchmarks on a monthly basis.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Naval Science Advisor Program ensures the Fleet/Force (F/F) helps shape the Department of the Navy (DoN) investment in Science and Technology (S&amp;T), develops teaming relationships to rapidly demonstrate and transition technology, supports development of technology-based capability options for naval forces, and enables warfighting innovations based on technical and conceptual possibilities.  This is accomplished through proactive connectivity and collaboration between DoN S&amp;T and Joint, Navy, and Marine Corps commands worldwide.  The program accomplishes this through several methods. It provides Science Advisors to Joint, Navy, and Marine Corps operational and strategic planning commands. Science Advisors facilitate and disseminate Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) requirements provided by the F/F Commanders to the Director of Navy Test and Evaluation and Technology Requirements (OPNAV N091). Science Advisors collaborate with the F/F to identify specific solutions to known operational capability needs and provide the means to develop and demonstrate prototype systems.  As a result, Science Advisors provide insight into issues associated with Naval Warfighting Capabilities that influence S&amp;T program decision making.  The program develops leaders among civilian scientists and engineers in the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE).  Upon completion of their tours, Science Advisors return to the NRE with first hand knowledge of the F/F, warfighting issues, and strategic decision making.  The Office of Naval Research (ONR) Science Advisor program enables continuous communication and collaboration between the warfighters, the technical community, and strategic development commands.

Effective FY14, funding for the Naval Science Advisor Program moved to PE 0602236N</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Commander US Naval Forces Central Command (C5F) SA provided leadership and guidance towards identification and response of C5F warfighting capability gaps based on threats having a critical impact on major campaign operations and combat readiness in the CENTCOM Area of Responsibility (AOR).

Commander US Fleet Forces Command (USFFC) SA facilitated integration and articulation of Fleet warfighter and readiness requirements influencing DOD RDT&amp;E resourcing by leading a team from the Fleet, force providers and Naval Component Commands articulating the requirements to the S&amp;T community. 

Commander Submarine Forces (CSF) SA established a team based structure to advance Undersea Enterprise (USE) S&amp;T needs to achieve warfighting capabilities through the USE Chief Technology Officer (CTO), OPNAV N87, and the NRE.  Evaluated, refined, and supported FY-13 FNC proposals and four Enabling Capabilities (EC) were approved for new start; Towed Array Reliability Improvement, ASW Fusion for Remote sensors, Alternate Anti-Surface Warfare Torpedo Homing and Target Discrimination, and Simulation Toolset for Analysis of Mission, Personnel, and Systems.

Commander Naval Surface Forces (SURFOR) SA provided continuous engagement with ONR, and Fleet and Systems Command senior leaders in the creation, modification, and promulgation of Total Ownership Cost, Anti-Surface Warfare (ASW) and Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) gaps used as the basis for the development of FNC EC products. 

Commander Third Fleet (C3F) SA led the demonstration planning efforts for an IO Technology Demonstration that was tasked by the CNO.  Completed a survey of game changing or disruptive S&amp;T efforts throughout the NRE, and as result of the survey, developed a Future Capabilities Needs List, detailing areas of future S&amp;T investment. This IO demonstration will continue to build on gained knowledge to implement new technologies and tactics.

US Naval Forces Europe/Africa, C6F SA managed the deployment of the Computer Aided Maritime Threat Evaluation System, a rules based information technology to aid C6F in assessing the risk of commercial shipping within the AOR.  Codified an enduring technical exchange with the NATO Undersea Research Center (NURC) under a memorandum of agreement to facilitate greater interoperability and the transition of NURC technologies into Naval Forces Europe/Africa, C6F exercises and operations.

Commanding General 1st Marine Expeditionary Force and Marine Forces Central Command (CG I MEF/MARCENT) SA supported deployed force requirements definition and innovation insertion into Iraq and Afghanistan.

Commander, US Marine Corps Forces Command (MARFORCOM) SA continued a cohesive and close teaming relationship with ONR Global SA at I MEF, II MEF, III MEF, and MARFORPAC that coordinated United States Marine Corps operating force's voice on S&amp;T matters.

Commander, Naval Air Forces (NAVAIRFOR) SA continued the development and installation efforts of weapons systems EO/IR upgrade on 2 aircraft carriers and one amphibious assault ship for detection and identification of small boat threats to aircraft carrier strike groups.

III Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF) SA worked with other USMC SAs to establish a new Operational Advisory Group (OAG) for the Marine Corps in Operational Science Technology and Experimentation (OSTE).  Designed and proposed a new Science and Technology Review Committee (STC) at III MEF that will be used to inform the new OSTE OAG of MEF requirements and provide oversight, guidance and ownership of S&amp;T work at III MEF in Okinawa, Japan.

Commanding General II Marine Expeditionary Force (II MEF) SA provided support to the standup and deployment of II MEF FWD, briefing the Operations Officers and S&amp;T Officers on emerging technology/ capabilities to be encountered in Afghanistan during II MEF FWD rotation.

Commander, USMC, Pacific (MARFORPAC) SA focused on addressing operational and strategic needs with technology by engaging with the joint S&amp;T community both within the Pacific and across DOD. Proposed, secured funding, and started installation of Micro Auto Gasification System (MAGS), a small scale in-situ waste management system for tactical and garrison environments.

Commander Pacific Fleet (PACFLT) SA improved capabilities across the Pacific AOR through rapid technology pull in various mission areas including Maritime Security Operations, ASW and Counter-Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance.  Engaged S&amp;T, acquisition, industry, university, other government agencies, and coalition partners to identify warfighting gaps and possible long-term solutions and collaborative efforts.

US Pacific Command (USPACOM) SA developed a command-wide S&amp;T strategy to address operational shortfalls and synchronize S&amp;T engagement with the USPACOM Theater Campaign Plan.  Established and executed multi-phase action plan to inform service RDT&amp;E enterprise of command warfighting shortfalls and identify candidate mitigation capabilities via USPACOM S&amp;T Integrated Priority List.

Commander Submarine Forces Pacific Fleet (SUBPAC) SA continued to expand the capabilities of the Unmanned Aerial System (UAS, aka SOTHOC, Submarine Over-The-Horizon Organic Capability).  Two successful tactical development exercises with the UAS have occurred to evaluate counter detection.  These exercises used UAS for over-the-horizon targeting of high-valued units in a multi-ship formation.

SA, Commander, Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC), updated the NECC S&amp;T Strategy Plan as the warfighters demand signal to the Navy Expeditionary Combat Enterprise (NECE).  Conducted technical demonstrations and the operational demonstration of the Riverine and Intercoastal Operations (RIO) JCTD unattended sensor system.

SA, Commander, C10F, served as the senior representative/liaison in all interactions with S&amp;T oriented government, military, academia, and industry organizations.  Functioned as the FORCEnet Operational Agent S&amp;T representative, Naval Space Operations S&amp;T.

SA, Commander Second Fleet (C2F), led the planning efforts for two Sea Trial sponsored events.  Coordinated the MK 38 Laser Weapons System initiative which demonstrates the capabilities of a ship based directed energy weapon system for self-defense against small watercraft, UAS and other threats. 

Commander Fourth Fleet (C4F) SA was responsible for concepts of operation, science and technology, experimentation, exercises and programs of record relating to all aspects of Joint, Naval and Coalition warfare in support of the Maritime Strategy, U.S. SOUTHERN COMMANDs Campaign Plan with a focus on Countering Transnational Organized Crime (CTOC) and Theater Security Cooperation Plan, and Maritime Operations Center (MOC) capabilities.  For successful implementation, the C4F SA was required to engage with personnel from USNAVSOs COCOM, U.S. SOUTHERN COMMAND, Navy Warfare Development Command, the other Navy Operational Agents (THIRD Fleet, NNWC), the platform agents (Submarine Forces, Naval Air Forces, Surface Forces, Navy Expeditionary Combat Command), US Fleet Forces Command and others as necessary.  The C4F SA worked closely with SOUTHCOMS experimentation cell to integrate new technology for CTOC missions.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides funding to develop the command and control (C2) support and information infrastructures for the Fleet Marine Force and supporting establishment. Doctrinally, the C2 support system and the information infrastructure form two parts of a triad of capabilities which permits command and control systems to be transformed into a complete operating system. The third element of the triad is command and control organization and is not covered in this program element. USMC command and control is divided into seven functional areas and one supporting functional area as follows: intelligence C2, fire support C2, air operations C2, radio systems C2, combat service support C2, warfare C2, radar systems C2, and C2 support (information processing and communications).

Within this program element, subprojects have been grouped by C2 functional area for more efficient planning. Air defense weapons systems have been added to facilitate planning and a separate project is used for systems assigned to the supporting establishment. Subprojects which support the commander's decision processes have been collected into the Command Post Systems project since these systems must work in close cooperation to ensure effective C2 of Marine Air Ground Task Forces.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Command and Control (C2) Systems Applications (SA) - MAGTF C2 SA merges the development, integration and testing of 45 existing C2 systems and applications into one common enterprise capability.  They reside in all Combat Operations Centers (COCs) and related USMC C2 platforms.  This effort provides greater economies of scale/affordability with system developers, technical design agents, integration agents and individual program offices.  MAGTF C2 SA efforts are in alignment with the combat developers requirements for:  Net-Centric systems, Development of reusable Open Architecture components, Data exposure, Enhancing the warfighter's Situational Awareness and Increasing/Maximizing the Commander's decision space.

Joint Battle Command - Platform (JBC-P) Family of Systems (FoS) - JBC-P FoS is a joint Army led ACAT II program. It is a product line comprised of systems and products formerly associated with the Blue Force Tracker (BFT) FoS and JBC-P. It comprises L-Band SATCOM and terrestrial Command and Control (C2) and Situational Awareness (SA) systems that use graphic displays to identify friendly units by providing Position Location Information (PLI) while facilitating tactical level C2.

Blue Force Situational Awareness (BFSA) - The Marine Corps' Situational Awareness Blue Force Tracker family of systems is comprised of the Mounted and Dismounted variants of a terrestrial Enhanced Position Location Reporting System/Single Channel Ground Airborne Radio System (EPLRS/SINCGARS) and the mounted celestial (SATCOM) system. In FY14, the BFSA and JBPC funding lines are merged into the JBCP FoS line.

Tactical Command Operations System (TCO) - TCO is the principle tool within the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) for situational awareness through distribution of the Common Tactical Picture (CTP).  It supports tactical operations providing information via high speed computer systems in a timely manner and includes the Intel Operations Workstations/Servers.  R&amp;D funds provide science and technology advanced concepts to be applied to the system for an increase in functional capabilities to the warfighter, to include Joint Command and Control (JC2) development efforts within Tactical Service Oriented Architecture (TSOA).

Identity Dominance System-MC (IDS-MC) - IDS-MC is a multi-modal (fingerprint, iris and face) biometric collection system that provides the USMC a reliable and effective capability to collect, share, match, access, verify and store identity information. IDS-MC will enable the Marine to collect appropriate biometric, biographical and reference information on an individual and match this locally developed information with pre-existing information available to the expeditionary force. The system will display match results with linkage to the respective individual's biographical and reference information as well as help analyze the response, update records as appropriate, create reports and disseminate updated information in accordance with current MAGTF policy. The primary mission of IDS-MC is to provide the MAGTF with the means to identify persons encountered in the battle space. While IDS-MC is not an intelligence analysis system, it does provide identification information in support of military intelligence and law enforcement operations by providing positive identification of persons of interest. IDS-MC is an enabler in the areas of detainee management and questioning, base access, counterintelligence screening, border control, law enforcement, displaced persons' management and aiding in humanitarian assistance missions. IDS-MC supports the tactical application of identity dominance and fully supports a forward presence, crisis response and contingency response capability.  IDS-MC will incrementally phase out the Biometric Automated Toolset (BAT).

Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data Family of Systems (AFATDS FoS) - AFATDS FoS consists of three programs, AFATDS, Back Up Computer System (BUCS) and Mobile Tactical Shelter (MTS).  The AFATDS automates the fire planning, tactical fire direction, and fire support coordination required to support maneuver from the sea and subsequent operations ashore.  AFATDS integrates all supporting arms assets within the MAGTF such as mortars, cannon artillery, rockets and missiles, close air support, and naval surface fire support systems. BUCS is a hand-held computer system designed to provide a backup to the AFATDS in computing ballistic firing solutions, as well as provide survey and Meteorological functions in support of artillery.  Additionally BUCS is the primary ballistic firing solution system during Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) and for the Expeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS).  The MTS is a Lightweight Multi-purpose Shelter (LMS) mounted on a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) which protects both the AFATDS and operators from the environment.  MTS enables rapid emplacement and displacement of fire support elements and provides networked communications on the move. Target Hand-Off System (THS) - Previously identified as the entire Target Location Designation and Hand-Off System. The THS is the portion of TLDHS that provides Fire Support Observer/Controllers with the ability to view video, manipulate, and digitally transmit (hand-off) target data to Fire Support platforms and agencies. 

Handheld Command and Control (H2C2) - H2C2 project vision outlines a collective and efficient mobile computing Acquisition Strategy in order to ensure economies of scale and scope.  The H2C2 portfolio consists of two specific capabilities - secure wireless access to multiple networks and handheld communication platforms.  The handheld capability provides low cost (commercially available) platforms (smartphones and tablets) for use on every network regardless of the operational environment.  The emerging technologies will enable access to both classified and unclassified systems on a single device.  The secure wireless capability enables Marines burdened by wired implementations an option to leverage wireless mediums.  This capability provides wireless communication between a variety of devices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Currently the initial focus is developing the Tactical Service Oriented Architecture (TSOA) software, which provides a common software infrastructure through which services and applications from other programs of record can begin the process of interfacing with in order to maximize software commonality across echelons and missions.  The long term goal is a software capability that will enable data discovery and data sharing across mission areas, a common standards-based viewer, core services and applications, and access to the GIG and other Joint networks, data and services.
													
JBC-P: JBC-P is leveraging the Army's (PM Joint Battle Command-Platform (PM JBC-P)) development of the JBC-P software and the Marine Corps' program is contingent upon the Army's development and acquisition strategy. PM JBC-P will fund research and development for JBC-P unless there are Service unique requirements, which the Marine Corps program office will fund. The Marine Corps' program office will participate in all design and readiness reviews and joint operational testing events.

BFSA: BFT FoS is leveraging an Army (PM Joint Battle Command-Platform (PM JBC-P)) ACAT II program to deliver a critical battlefield command and control system to the operating forces. These systems operate on both a terrestrial and celestial network and enable tactical units to move more effectively by providing friendly unit identification and location, as well as friendly intent and status.  The current focus is on testing and evaluating improved software which will make possible type-1 encryption and a greater bandwidth network.  The long term goal is a secured reduced latency system that will greatly improve the battlefield commander's situational awareness and reduce the potential of fratricide.

TCO: Contracting is performed with various vendors for software test and integration, COTS evaluation and documentation to develop advanced concepts and additional functional capabilities.  The PMO conducts quarterly performance reviews.  Specific hardware is also procured for test purposes which include environmental, shock, compatibility, and interoperability testing.

Identity Dominance System (IDS): Currently, the IDS-MC Program Office acquisition strategy is to leverage the Navy's IDS Program and provide funding to meet Marine Corps requirements.  The Marine Corps' program office will participate in all design and readiness reviews as well as the DOT&amp;E activities.  The long-term goal is to equip the Marine with a user-friendly biometric authentication technology that will be employed throughout DoD to deny the enemy freedom of movement within the populace and positively identify known insurgents within an Area of Responsibility (AOR).  In FY13 the program provided funding to PMS408 to enhance the Navy IDS software to meet the IDS MC unique requirements.

AFATDS:  AFATDS is a Cost Plus Award Fee contract through Army CECOM, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. R&amp;D efforts will be a combined effort between the software developer (Raytheon), the Army PM and the USMC of software enhancements for the next planned versions of AFATDS.

THS:  The acquisition of components (software/hardware) for the THS initiative will maximize the use of existing COTS, GOTS, NDI, and GFE.  Software development is conducted utilizing a sole source small-business contract.  Software must maintain compatibility with five Programs of Record (POR) and seven Operational Flight Programs (OFP).

H2C2: H2C2 will use an evolutionary approach for technology insertion.  The approach will leverage and mature Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and Non-development Item (NDI) technologies to rapidly transition a handheld data capability to other acquisition programs.  H2C2 inserts mature technology into existing programs in order to fill capability gaps and requirement shortfalls.  These technologies will be inserted at different times along gaining program acquisition cycles.  This strategy will apply to available technology at different proposed technology insertion points for each gaining program.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Funding for the Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S) program has moved to PE 0206335 Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S), Project 3373 for FY15 and beyond. Funding prior to FY15 is located in PE 0206313M Marine Corps Comms Systems, Project 2273 Air Ops Cmd &amp; Control (C2) Sys.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S) - A coordinated modernization effort to replace the existing aviation command and control equipment of the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS) and to provide the Aviation Combat Element (ACE) with the necessary hardware, software, equipment, and facilities to effectively command, control, and coordinate aviation operations. The CAC2S system will accomplish the MACCS missions with a suite of operationally scalable modules to support the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF), Joint, and Coalition Forces. The CAC2S integrates the functions of aviation command and control into an interoperable system that will support the core competencies of all Marine Corps warfighting concepts. The CAC2S, in conjunction with MACCS organic sensors and weapons systems, supports the tenets of Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and fosters joint interoperability. CAC2S Increment I will replace legacy aviation command and control systems in the following Marine aviation agencies: Direct Air Support Center (DASC), Tactical Air Command Center (TACC), and Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC). Prior year to FY14 funding for this program is located in this project (2273).  Funding for FY15 through the FYDP is contained in PE 0206335M and Project 3373.

Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS) - Joint mandated Air War planning tool for the generation, dissemination and execution of the Air Tasking Order (ATO).  TBMCS is an Air Force led program, which provides the automated tools necessary to manage tactical air operations, execute area air defense and airspace management in the tactical area of operation, and coordinate operations with components of other military services.  TBMCS is located at the Tactical Air Command Center (TACC), with remotes located throughout the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  It is scalable, allowing for joint, coalition and service specific operations.  It is an evolutionary acquisition program.  

Composite Tracking Network (CTN) -  Provides the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Commander a ground based sensor netting solution that significantly improves situational awareness by correlating sensor measurement data (target position, speed, heading, Identification Friend and Foe (IFF), etc.) from local and remote radars in the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) network, which is then provided to the warfighter in the form of composite, real-time, air surveillance tracks. AN/MSQ-143A (V)I - funding will allow CTN to execute transportability testing and conduct a Field User Evaluation (FUE) of this system configuration. These events will wrap up the testing for this configuration and allow the CTN Program Office to go to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for a fielding decision for this system configuration.          
												
The Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS) Sustainment - Consists of various command and control agencies designed to provide the Aviation Combat Element (ACE) commander with the ability to monitor, supervise and influence the application of Marine aviation assets in support of Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) operations.  The MACCS Sustainment provides funding to keep these fielded systems ready, relevant and capable until their functions are replaced by the Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S).

Joint Cooperative Target ID Ground (JCTI-G) - The program was refocused late in FY11 to reflect the results of a JFCOM led AoA that determined the best path to follow for continued reduction of fratricide incidents.  Funding to support Fielded and Planned Capability Improvements (FPCI) which will contribute to Combat Identifications (CID) and fratricide mitigation.  An Army and Marine Corps agreement supports closure of the Fires-On-Dismount fratricide mitigation gap and to refocus on FPCI requirements.

Combat Operations Center (COC) - AN/TSQ-239 (V)1/2/3/4 are a deployable, self-contained, modular, centralized and scalable facility ((V)1 MEF-size, (V)2 MSC/Div-size, (V)3 Regiment-size, (V)4 Ballatlion-size) which provides digital, shared Command and Control/Situational Awareness functionalities to enhance the Common Operational Picture (COP) for the Command Element, Ground Command Element, Air Combat Element, and Logistics Combat Element.  It is a commercial-off-the-shelf integrated hardware solution using unit provided radios, re-hosted tactical data systems, and available Marine Corps prime movers to transport the system.  Funds support testing and Information Assurance (IA) certification activities, integration of emerging technology, and On The Move (OTM) capabilities. 
 
Remote Video Viewing Terminal (RVVT) - Provides the warfighter with video connectivity to multiple types of aerial platforms that transmit in C, L, S, or Ku frequency Bands (such as but not limited to Raven B, Puma, Micro-UAS, Shadow, Predator, Fire Scout, and Litening Pod on P-3, AV8-B, and F/A-18).  Data is displayed to Regimental Combat Teams (RCT), Forward Observers (FO) and Forward Air Controller (FAC) operators who coordinate with higher headquarters for fires.  

Joint Interface Control Office (JICO) Support System (JSS) - Will provide net-centric services through a transformational management system to enable internet protocol-based networks of the future to operate efficiently with current tactical networks.  It will manage complex tactical networks through an automated toolset and information repository that enables planning, management and analysis of tactical data link communications before, during and after operations.

The funding decrease from FY 14 to FY15 is due to CAC2S moving to PE 0206335M in FY 15, the CTN Antenna Trailer development no longer being developed in FY15, and the completion of the development of MACCS ECPs in FY14.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CAC2S will employ an evolutionary acquisition strategy utilizing an incremental and phased approach for development and fielding of the CAC2S.  The Capability Production Document (CPD) identifies two increments to achieve the full requirements of CAC2S.  The current acquisition strategy addresses Increment I of the CAC2S development process and focuses on the requirements that will modernize the assault and air support, air defense and control, and Aviation Combat Element (ACE) battle management capabilities of the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS). Increment I of the CAC2S will be accomplished through a two phased approach.  Phase 1 will address the requirements to establish the baseline CAC2S capabilities for the MACCS and improve Air Command and Control (AC2) performance and effectiveness.  Phase 2 will address the requirements for remaining ACE Battle Management Command &amp; Control (BMC2) requirements.

TBMCS is an ACAT III, USAF Program with joint interest/oversight.  It was mandated by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff in July 93 for Air Tasking Order (ATO) Interoperability among all services.  The USMC will not be letting any competitive contracts for TBMCS, but following the USAF lead, utilizing USAF TBMCS contracts and fielding only the joint modules of TBMCS.  As USMC unique requirements are identified and funded, they will be provided to the USAF (to include funding) for inclusion within TBMCS utilizing the USAF delivery order (fixed price) contract.  Over the course of the FYDP, the USMC will leverage USAF software support activities vice funding strictly USMC software support.

MACCS SUSTAINMENT - The acquisition strategy implemented by the MACCS Sustainment Program Office is to maintain the readiness, relevance, and capabilities of the portfolio of post-Milestone C systems through Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS) activities, active refresh of obsolete hardware items, and the implementation of system improvements/modifications in accordance with approved systems engineering processes.  Engineering changes to the systems make maximum use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS), and Non-Developmental Items (NDI) in order to decrease risk, leverage developed capabilities and support apparatus, and minimize investment expenditures.  These activities are performed by Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) commercial entities under contract to Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) or by Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane as the MACCS Sustainment Program In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA).  The next major milestone for the MACCS Sustainment Programs is Phase-out or Disposal as the replacement Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S) reaches full operational capability.
								
CTN -  The USMC's CTN acquisition strategy is to participate in the USN's Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) program procurement and testing, making necessary modifications to support the Marine Corps' requirement.

RVVT - In the near term, will utilize an existing SPAWAR IDIQ contract to procure Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) capability with limited development required to test interoperability with Manned and Unmanned Air Platforms. To conduct an Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) beginning FY15 for a competitive solution for the next generation RVVT.
 												
COC - The Combat Operations Center (COC) AN/TSQ-239 (V)2/3/4 is the foundation of USMC C2, meeting near term communications and network requirements in OEF.  There is a continuing developmental effort to evolve the COC into a fully integrated MAGTF C2 capability.  FY13 and FY15 supports continual tech refresh, technology insertion, modernization and software upgrade releases.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>COUNTER RADIO-CONTROLLED IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE (RCIED) ELECTRONIC WARFARE (USMC CREW) SYSTEMS are vehicle mounted and dismounted modular programmable multi-band radiofrequency jammers designed to deny enemy use of selected portions of the radio frequency spectrum in the vicinity of the jammer to counter the RCIED threat. The mounted and dismounted systems provide Marines in vehicle convoys and on foot with the necessary protection from the continued and evolving threat of deadly RCIEDs.  Legacy CREW systems are currently deployed to meet threats in the current theater of operation and fielded to selected MEU(SOC)s in support of worldwide deployment. To continue to support OEF and other worldwide missions, each CREW unit receives customized programing (load-sets) to counter the area's RCIED threats. The testing, programming development, and product improvement research our funded with the CREW's RDT&amp;E funding and prioritized to meet the demand of all deployed CREW assets.

GROUND-BASED OPERATIONAL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (GBOSS) is an incremental development program currently providing persistent, multispectral surveillance sensor packages in Afghanistan. Three variants of G-BOSS exist; 80' tower mounted system (heavy), 20' trailer mounted system (medium/GBL), and man-portable, tripod mounted system (lite/CBL).   Each tower employs multiple, self-contained detection and assessment technologies on a single trailer-mounted elevation platform with a multi-spectral sensor suite consisting of: daylight color &amp; infrared imagery (StarSafire III and T-3000), Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS), Manportable Surveillance and Target Acquisition Radar (MSTAR), communication suite for wireless point to point link, and unmanned aerial vehicle interface (VideoScout). The medium and lite systems provide a subset of the G-BOSS heavy capabilities.  G-BOSS is a material solution in response to an Urgent Universal Needs Statement (UUNS) in support of OIF and OEF.  There is no funding for GBOSS Research and Development after FY13 following the suspension of the G-BOSS(E) program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Developed corresponding waveform expansions required for the Universal Test Sets (UTS) for all theaters of operations. Continued support mounted CREW integrations for MEU/MEF mission profiles by analyzing vehicle profile issues and implement installation kits for the CVRJ(V)2 upgrade. Designed, tested, and contracted load carrier upgrades for the Thor III dismounted system that allowed a Marine to reduce fatigue caused by the carrying of the CREW systems.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>COUNTER RADIO-CONTROLLED IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE (RCIED) ELECTRONIC WARFARE (USMC CREW): CREW mounted and dismounted systems provide Marines in vehicle convoys and on foot with the necessary protection from the continued and evolving threat of deadly RCIEDs in all current and future operations.  The program will continue to develop new techniques, improve capabilities, enhance software and develop upgrades to counter evolving threats and prevent technology obsolescence.  Activities include waveform development, non-recurring engineering for system enhancements, capability upgrades, and installation kits, integration of the enhancements/Vehicle Installation Kits (VIKs) and the tests/government studies required to support these changes.  3100 CVRJ(V1) mounted systems were upgraded to a Band C (V2) capability beginning in FY12 and are being fielded to selected MEU(SOC) units starting in FY13. The Thor III are dismounted systems fielded to OEF in FY12 and are also being fielded to selected MEU(SOC) units starting in FY13.  The Modi is a dismounted system which commences initial replacement of the Thor III and transition to the MEU(SOC) program.  40 Modi were procured in FY13 with expected delivery in FY14.  The CREW MEU(SOC) program consists of 150 mounted 360 dismounted systems and was initiated as an ongoing effort to develop new techniques, improve capabilities, enhance software and develop waveform load sets to counter evolving threats and prevent technology obsolescence for both mounted and dismounted systems.  

GBOSS.  The acquisition approach has been to use existing government contracts (US Navy, US Army, US Air Force) for Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Government-Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) material and services that meet the basic requirements of the UUNS and give priority to materials and services already integrated into an existing or similar architecture.  In FY13, the acquisition approach will be to maintain NSWC Crane as the system integrator to leverage their engineering and contracting vehicles for product development and test and evaluation. This approach is the most expeditious to deliver equipment and services to the forces in theater.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) Tactical Communications Modernization (TCM):  TCM was established to procure interim radio systems to bridge the gap between legacy systems and forecasted deliveries from the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) program.  The program schedule and budget profile for TCM procures leading edge radio systems to support the primary operational voice and data communications requirements for mounted and dismounted forces.  TCM procurements enable an initial joint networking capability and support National Security Agency (NSA) Communications Security (COMSEC) Modernization requirements.  Funding provides engineering and test support for both the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) requirement, AN/MRC-145B service life extension program.  
 
(U) Networking on the Move (NOTM):  NOTM provides a robust command and control (C2) capability by integrating tactical data systems with on the move satellite communications (SATCOM) for beyond line-of-sight ability that allows battlefield commanders to have uninterrupted two-way access to digital data, anywhere on the battlefield.  NOTM provides MAGTF commanders and staffs with full Common Operational Picture (COP) access, virtually unlimited situational awareness and a powerful ability to issue digital orders (fires, maneuver, planning) to GCE, ACE and LCE units at all echelons while on-the-move or at-the-halt.  NOTM also provides Marine units the capability to link with and extend Defense Information System Network (DISN) services; SIPRNet, NIPRNet, and Defense Switched Networks (DSN).  Integrated full motion video (receipt and retransmission), tactical voice communications plus three options for secure wireless local area network (LAN) connectivity between staff members makes this amphibious capability a crucial asset to all elements of the MAGTF.  NOTM achieved initial operational capability at I MEF in March 2013 and will continue fielding a total of 56 systems at I MEF, II MEF, III MEF and the support establishment through August 2014.  

(U) Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT):  Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) is an integrated Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) satellite communications terminal with a modular architecture that supports drop and insert architecture through scalable and flexible applications.  VSAT uses commercial Ku and military Ka frequency bands to provide beyond line-of-sight (BLOS) connectivity to support intra-MAGTF communications (NIPRNET, SIPRNET, and telephony) down to the battalion/squadron level.  The primary variant of VSAT is the Support Wide Area Network Terminal Version D (SWAN-D), which itself comes in three modular variants, dependent on MAGTF-size and mission.  

(U) Lightweight Multiband Satellite Terminal (LMST)/PHOENIX are quad-band Super High Frequency (SHF) satellite terminals mounted in transit cases and High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) and can be used as either the hub or spoke terminal in a SATCOM network.  LMST/PHOENIX provide SHF SATCOM transmissions to any size MAGTF and can be deployed as a "first in" communications source across the entire spectrum of conflict via various deployment  configurations.  With the signing of the SATCOM Collapse (20 May 2011), the Marine Corps will consolidate three programs: Lightweight Multiband Satellite Terminal (LMST), Phoenix Tactical SHF Satellite Terminal (TSST), and the Very Small Aperture Terminal Large (VSAT-L) into one requirement defined as the Universal Satellite Access Tactical Terminal (USATT).  RDT&amp;E funding will be utilized to research/integrate VSAT X-Band development during the SATCOM Collapse transition process. 	

(U) Secure Mobile Anti-Jam Reliable Tactical-Terminal (SMART-T): SMART-T provides tactical users with protected data and voice via Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite communications. The SMART-T system is transported on High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs), providing MAGTF Commanders a secure, survivable, long-haul, low/medium data rate communications link not subject to terrain masking and horizon limitations. The SMART-T is also capable of operation when removed from the HMMWV. SMART-T is currently undergoing an upgrade to be interoperable with the new Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) constellation and will require certification testing and a Multi-service Operational Test and Evaluation (MOT&amp;E).

(U) Terrestrial Wideband Transmission Systems (TWTS) is a capabilities portfolio of terrestrial based wideband transmission systems (formerly known as an TRC-170).  Portfolio includes Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) system (AN/TRC-170) and Line Of Sight (LOS) systems (AN/MRC-142 (FOS), Troposcatter Support Radio (TSSR), and Wireless Point-to-Point-Link version D (WPPL-D)).  The AN/TRC-170 is a transportable BLOS, terrestrial, self-enclosed troposcatter terminal (multichannel) capable of transmitting and receiving digital data over varying distances up to 100 miles.  AN/MRC-142 FoS consists of the AN/MRC-142B (ship to shore) and C variants to provide LOS, two-way, secure voice and data communications up to 35 miles.  TSSR is a multi-channel LOS wireless cable replacement communication system.  The TSSR is commonly used in place of fiber optic or coaxial cable at expeditionary airfields.  WPPL-D is an integrated communications system consisting of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) radios, antennas, and IP networking equipment that provides NIPR/SIPRNet data connectivity, voice and video services.  TEAMS is a 34-meter telescopic mast system, extending support to various organic LOS systems (AN/MRC-142 and TSSR) by increasing operational reach by overcoming obstacles to communications.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>(U) Tactical Communications Modernization (TCM):  Provides for the testing and evaluation of the next generation tactical radio systems supporting:  AN/MRC-145 service life extension program (AN/MRC-145B) and the MUOS terminals.

(U) Networking on the Move (NOTM):  NOTM will use an evolutionary acquisition strategy and pursue a competitive contract that leverages Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) technology to procure, sustain and meet emerging requirements. The design of the system provides for internal growth capability through an open system architecture enabling technology refresh to extend the system's life, maintain interoperability, Information Assurance (IA) compliance, and reduce costs due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS).  It is envisioned that technology refresh will occur on the NOTM hardware and software periodically due to component obsolescence, user-driven requests for improvements, IA compliance, and mission-related requirements.  Refresh will include investments to incorporate evolving capability to ensure compatibility with other systems, create lighter more efficient equipment, and keep pace with evolving software requirements.  End-of-life equipment refresh is expected throughout the program's life cycle and may be managed through kit purchases, replacement through Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs), or as replacement parts as equipment is repaired.

(U) Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT):  VSAT systems are currently in fielding and sustainment phases. VSAT systems primarily support operations on costly commercial SATCOM bandwidth. Some additional military SATCOM frequencies (Ka-band) have already been incorporated into the large, trailer mounted VSAT systems to alleviate reliance on commercial SATCOM bandwidth procurements. Additional military Ka-band upgrades to smaller variants of VSAT systems are pending. Additionally, VSAT systems have been recently identified as the platform required to support operations on military X-band SATCOM frequencies as other X-band capable systems reach obsolescence. In order to subsume the capabilities lost in the phase out of the obsolete systems, VSAT systems require ECPs to incorporate X-band capability in addition to upgrading ancillary subsystems. ECPs will involve procurement of COTS upgrade kits that are designed and integrated in accordance with government owned drawings and specifications. Contract delivery orders will be awarded to competent bidders on US Army PM Warfighter Information Network-Tactical multi-award IDIQ contracts on a FFP basis. The majority of candidate upgrade kits and components exist as previously awarded CLINs on current contracts. Upon determination of final configuration of upgraded SATCOM terminal, program office will use the same U.S. Army contracting vehicles to procure the approved quantity of new terminals to replace the obsolete terminals being phased out.

(U) LIGHTWEIGHT MULTIBAND SATELLITE TERMINAL (LMST)/PHOENIX:  With the signing of the SATCOM Collapse (20 May 2011), the Marine Corps will consolidate three programs: Lightweight Multiband Satellite Terminal (LMST), Phoenix Tactical SHF Satellite Terminal (TSST), and the Very Small Aperture Terminal Large (VSAT-L) into one requirement defined as the Universal Satellite Access Tactical Terminal (USATT).  The acquisition strategy for the Lightweight Multi-band Satellite Terminal (LMST) and Phoenix program is to sustain terminals to maintain joint interoperability through FY17.
   												 	
(U) Secure Mobile Anti-Jam Reliable Tactical-Terminal (SMART-T): SMART-T is an Army led, ACAT II program.  The Marine Corps SMART-T has fielded the full Authorized Acquisition Objective (AAO) of 42 terminals and 32 AN/PSQ-17 Network Planning tools. SMART-T will be upgraded for compatibility with Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) waveforms and data rates.  The AEHF capable SMART-T and planning tools will replace the legacy SMART-T. Terminal out of warranty repair for legacy components will be executed, when necessary, using the Army National Maintenance Contract.

(U) Tactical Wideband Communication Systems (TWTS): Requires R&amp;D to proceed with design of obsolescence mitigation of TRC-170, MRC-142. These funds are identified to cover system developmental activities along with different test activities to include durability (life), interoperability, performance and operational activities; test activities to support operation system upgrade for WPPL-D &amp; removal of networking capabilities in support of Warfighter Networking Services concept.  Reduction of funding in the amount of $3.551M from FY14 to FY15 reflects 95% completion of TRC-170 ECP refinement and an 80% completion of MRC-142 testing.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) Network Planning &amp; Management (NPM), formerly Joint Network Management System (JNMS), is a portfolio of communications planning and Network Management applications for use throughout the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  NPM includes the Systems Planning Engineering and Evaluation Device (SPEED).  NPM provides the MARFOR (Marine Forces) component planners with the ability to conduct high-level planning; detailed planning and engineering; monitoring; control and reconfiguration; and spectrum planning and management in support of Combatant Commander (COCOM) and Commander, Joint Task Force (CJTF) operations.   SPEED provides High Frequency (HF) predictions, Line of Site (LOS) propagation, Radio Coverage Analysis (RCA), Satellite planning, Command and Control Personal Computer (C2PC) track interface, interference and de-confliction analysis, spectrum management, Radio Guard Charts, Comm-On-The-Move (COTM), and T/E (training &amp; education) and force structure management.  The funding decrease from FY14 to FY15 is due to completion of added capabilities and functional improvements. Funds will support task book place for SPAWARLANT to continue development of SPEED software.
									
(U) Transition Switch Module (TSM): consists of three systems that provide a flexible Unit Level Switch that replaces legacy Tri-Tac switches with current commercial technology, providing maneuver elements with improved voice/data switching, data transport and bandwidth management capabilities.  This program maintains USMC joint interoperability as all Services transition to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) switching technologies.		
	
(U) Expeditionary Command and Control Suite (ECCS): Will provide reach back capability to the Global Information Grid (GIG) to access the Defense Switch Network (DSN), Defense Information System Network (DISN) Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET), and DISN Video Services (DVS), enabling a small advance force/liaison team to communicate with a Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF), Joint Task Force (JTF) or other Joint Force Commander, and to maintain situational awareness.
  				
(U) Tactical Data Network (TDN) Data Distribution System - Modular (DDS-M):  The DDS-M provides the commander a modular, integrated, and interoperable Internet Protocol (IP)- based LAN and WAN data networking capability that forms the data communications backbone and data communications support to organizations within a MAGTF.  The DDS-M provides extension of the Defense Information System Network (DISN), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), and Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) as well as a Coalition networking capability and access to strategic, supporting establishments, joint and other service component tactical data networks for Marine Corps Tactical Data Systems (TDSs) and other DDS-Ms.  The DDS-M provides Marine Corps maneuver elements with a modular and scalable IP data transport capability that will replace, supplement and be used with existing legacy data systems through the integration of computers, routers, data switches and cabling, Enhanced Position Location and Reporting System (EPLRS) radio net interface units, MODEMS, link encryption devices, and patch panels.  Uninterrupted Power Supplies (UPS) provide for emergency power and continuity of operations.  The DDS-M can operate from the SBU up to the TOP SECRET (TS)/SENSITIVE COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION (SCI) level and contains integral In-line Network Encryption (INE) device supporting IP Security (IPSec) and Virtual Private Networking (VPN).  The funding decrease from FY14 to FY15 is due to the completion of research and development for the Session Boundary Controller (SBC) in FY14.

(U) Joint Enhanced Core Communications System (JECCS):  Formerly known as First In Command and Control System (FICCS).  JECCS is the Joint Task Force (JTF) enabler ''first in'' integrated, processor-controlled communications and management system that provides C2 capabilities supporting a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) deployment ashore of the early phases of a deployment by a larger command element such as a Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) or JTF Commander's mission into an Area of Operation.  The JECCS is easily scalable and capable of "fly-away" deployment.  It is a system of systems composed of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) equipment.  It provides the primary interface between subscriber equipment/systems and the long-haul multi-channel transmission systems.  The JECCS facilitates secure and non-secure voice and data communications, switching functions, network routing, and management functions.  The JECCS augments the current and planned communications architectures and provides technical control and network management services for the broad range of switching and radio connectivity requirements. 

(U) Digital Technical Control (DTC):  DTC and other communications are a switch network infrastructure which provides voice, SIPR, NIPR, coalition, data, and video services.  DTC provides the deployed warfighter with a standard data and voice architecture that is interoperable with joint and other services' communications systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides funds for engineering, test, and evaluation activity, which ensures that the systems being developed within the Program Element (PE) employ consistent standards for interoperability and to the maximum extent feasible use of hardware and software which is uniform and standard across programs.  

Expeditionary Energy Office (E2O):  Energy is a top priority for the USMC and one of the six pillars of Modernization for the Corps identified by the Commandant. In 2009 the Commandant established the USMC Expeditionary Energy Office (E2O), with the mission to analyze, develop, and direct the Marine Corps' energy strategy in order to optimize expeditionary capabilities across all warfighting functions.  E2O's role is to advise the Marine Requirements Oversight Council (MROC) on all energy and resource related requirements, acquisitions, and programmatic decisions. This office and funding directly support execution of the USMC Expeditionary Energy Strategy and Implementation Plan (Mar 2011), and priorities identified in the USMC Expeditionary Energy Water and Waste Initial Capabilities Document/Capabilities Based Assessment (Sept 2011), as well as Science and Technology Objectives identified in the 2012 USMC S&amp;T Strategic Plan. The Marine Corps program aligns with Commandant's Planning Guidance 2010, the National Defense Authorization Act 2009, DoD directives and SECNAV goals. This funding will support the achievement of the Strategy, and the activities of the USMC Experimental Forward Operating Base process, managed by the E2O. 

Joint Interoperability of Tactical Command and Control Systems (JINTACCS) is a Joint Chiefs-of-Staff (JCS)/DoD-mandated program for joint development, implementation, and testing of tactical data links and US Message Text Format (MTF) under the direction of the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and Office of the Secretary of Defense/Networks and Information Integration (OASD/NII) per the Commander Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCSI) 6610.01C and CJCS16241.04 for US Military Tactical Forces (USMTF). This effort also covers interoperability and testing of tactical message standards such as MILSTD 6017 Variable Message Format used between the US Army and USMC; and Coalition message formats the Joint Command, Control, Consultation Information Exchange Data Model (JC3IEDM). 

Marine Air-Ground Task Force Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence Systems Engineering and Integration, and Coordination (MAGTF C4I SEI&amp;C) provides for the centralized planning and execution of Marine Corps Enterprise Information Technology and National Security Systems. It develops, certifies, and manages the configurations of the Marine Corps Enterprise Systems and Technical Architecture products and uses these to support enterprise-level systems engineering. It supports unified technical representation to joint and coalition communities for Marine Corps Systems and provides top-tier system engineering support to address system of systems technical issues. It is used to conduct direct Marine Expeditionary Unit/Marine Expeditionary Force (MEU/MEF) support in system integration testing with USN. This is part of Deploying Group Systems Integration Testing (DGSIT) and workups supporting Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) deployments. It is also used to support Marine Corps systems coordination and involvement in DoD initiatives to include ForceNet, Global Information Grid Enterprise Services (GIGES), and other Deployable Information Systems Architecture DISA/NETWARCOM efforts.

Marine Civil Information Management (MARCIM) is a system of systems comprised of people, process and technology that operates in the full Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) environment. It is a force multiplier for the commander that allows him to leverage the process of Planning, Collection, Consolidation, Analysis, Production, and sharing of civil information in order to support the visualization and understanding of the civil environment to the military commander's decision making process.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

DC SIAT led the Army - Marine Corps C2 interoperability Systems Engineering IPT to align the use of tactical messaging standards creating interoperability between the DoD ground force systems FBCB2/JTCW (VMF), GCCS (OTH Gold), TBMCS/AFATDS (USMTF), and aviation tactical data links (Link 16/22). This effort provided the guidance and direction for development of strategies to allow the Marine Corps to meet its Service level requirements mandated by the DoD Net Centric Data Strategy and participate in the Joint development of XML data standards to enable tactical data exchanges in C2 systems. DC SIAT led the development of data model converter applications to create Standardization Agreement 4677 on interoperability between the NATO JC3IEDM data model to the JTCW (VMF) system allowing coalition interoperability at the dismounted level.</r2:Text>

The Letter of Clarification (LOC) identifies two baselines to fullfill all Threshold requirements. The current acquisition strategy addresses both baseline builds to include the software development, training, fielding and sustainment of these builds. Build 1 will support an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) and Build 2 will support a Full Operational Capability (FOC).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Ground Based Air Defense Transformation (GBAD-T) - Based upon the deployment of the Low Altitude Air Defense (LAAD) Battalions and their employment of the Stinger Missile, GBAD-T transforms Air Defense equipment through technology insertion and equipment repackaging to address capability gaps as the result of equipment obsolescence and the emergent and evolving threats to the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  

GBAD-T consists of three efforts: 1) systems engineering support of currently fielded LAAD equipment/assets to include the Stinger Mounted Optic and Mode 5/S IFF Directed UNS; 2) redesign and integration of the Advanced Man-Portable Air Defense System (A-MANPADS) Increment 1 Fire Unit Vehicle (FUV) into an operationally capable vehicle configuration; 3) design, test, and integrate new system for the Fire Unit Vehicle (FUV) to replace aging and failing technology. The replacement technology is required to retain interfaces with and be capable of receiving a Common Aviation Command and Control Systems (CAC2S) broadcasted link. It will also be capable of interfacing with legacy Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS) equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) The Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Combat Service Support Element &amp; Supporting Establishment (CSSE &amp; SE) consists of mutually supporting Logistics Information Technology (IT) programs that support force deployment, planning, and execution; sustainment and distribution; and contributes to the Combatant Commander's Common Operating Picture to support rapid accurate decision making.  
	
GLOBAL COMBAT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MARINE CORPS (GCSS-MC) is the physical implementation of the enterprise Information Technology (IT) architecture designed to support both improved and enhanced Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Combat Support Services (CSS) functions and MAGTF Commander and Combatant Commanders/Joint Task Force (CC/JTF) combat support information requirements.  The initial program includes all transactional CSS systems related to Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) functionality enabled with Service Management functions.  When combined, these capabilities are referred to as Logistics Chain Management (LCM) or GCSS-MC/LCM.  The primary goal of GCSS-MC/LCM is to provide the capabilities specified in the Logistics Operational Architecture (Log OA).  The result of enabling the Log OA is the retirement of legacy applications.  The GCSS-MC/LCM exposes timely mission information to Marine Corps operational and CSS commanders, CC/JTF commanders and their staffs and other authorized users.  It exposes information interoperability and common logistics information applications and services across functional areas.  GCSS-MC/LCM allows operating forces commanders to base decisions on complete logistics information and make decisions in concert with specific operational tasks.  

The GCSS-MC/LCM program will upgrade from the current Oracle EBS 11.5.10 application and all customizations to Oracle Enterprise Business Suite (EBS) Release 12.   The (EBS) Release 12 critical refresh and technical insertion will provide a secure sustainable system with increased operational efficiency.
																				
JOINT FORCE REQUIREMENTS GENERATOR II (JFRG II) is a Global Command and Control System (GCCS) software application designed to provide DOD with a Joint Services, state-of-the-art, integrated, and deployable Automated Information System (AIS) that supports strategic force movements.  JFRG II provides rapid development of force data to satisfy operational planning and execution requirements.  It serves as the essential link between service force requirements and validated/sourced unit data.  JFRG II permits multi-level planning with entry of equipment and personnel data, transportation/movement data, and the phasing of the total force throughout the entire movement timeline.  JFRG II contains an exhaustive joint data library and interfaces directly with the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES).  JFRG II can generate standard, executive, and ad hoc reports, perform database queries, and export or import data from Transportation Coordinators' Automated Information for Movement System (TC-AIMS) II, MAGTF Deployment Support System (MDSS) II, War Reserve System (WRS) and JOPES.  JFRG II operates and functions in a classified environment.

ELECTRONIC MAINTENANCE SUPPORT SYSTEM (EMSS) is composed of several main components including Electronic Maintenance Devices (EMD), regional servers, deployment servers, charger racks, and ruggedized deployment cases. EMSS is a rugged organizational-level (O-level), light-weight, one-man portable maintenance device capable of supporting multiple platforms and systems across maintenance communities.  EMSS provides a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware device equipped with network interfaces, Built-In-Test/Built-In-Test Equipment (BIT/BITE) interfaces, and Software Defined Test Instrument (SDTI) General Purpose Electronic Test Equipment (GPETE) capabilities. These hardware capabilities will enable commercial or custom DoD and USMC software capabilities including Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs), Computer Based Training (CBT), access to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) over USMC networks, and other maintenance applications to be hosted on EMSS.  With these capabilities, maintainers will make more informed decisions, thereby sustaining force readiness over time.

TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS PORTFOLIO (TSP): provides funding that supports the USMC Deployment and Execution Support Systems and the Distribution Management Support Systems.  These systems and applications support the planning, deployment, distribution, sustainment and redeployment of supplies, equipment and personnel.  The TSP portfolio applications utilize AIT read/write devices, active and passive radio frequency identification (aRFID/pRFID) tags and satellite tracking systems. TSP applications support In-Transit Visibility (ITV) and Total Asset Visibility (TAV) initiatives to provide commanders with timely and accurate near real-time data on the location and movement of personnel, equipment and supplies that are in-process, in-transit and in-theater.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>GLOBAL COMBAT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MARINE CORPS (GCSS-MC) is pursuing an Evolutionary Acquisition (EA) strategy in order to field operationally suitable and supportable capabilities in the shortest time possible that meets the Logistics Advocate goals.  EA offers the fastest method to field this highest of advocate priorities and allows for requirements to be time-phased as the users become more familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the fielded system.  In addition to quicker fielding, an EA approach is particularly well suitable for software intensive programs and offers these benefits: rapid delivery of an initial capability with the explicit intent of delivering continuously improving capabilities in the future and a reduction in the "cycle time" from identification of emergent user requirements, priorities and fielding. The GCSS-MC acquisition strategy will deliver capabilities in increments.  Each increment capability will follow a complete acquisition process in accordance with the DOD 5000 publications and OSD's Enterprise Integration roadmap.  Increments will include emergent user priorities, advanced technology improvements and expanded functionality.  Each increment will repeat the complete acquisition program cycle going through a milestone (MS) C Full Rate Production Decision Review.  Increment 1 is divided into two major independent releases:  Enterprise Release 1.1 and Deployed Access Release 1.2.  This approach differs from the original plan of delivering one release due to the technical complexities related to the overall scope of the solution. More substantial software improvement/system upgrades will be fielded with each Increment as required and prioritized by the user community.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Long Range Radar (AN/TPS-59) - The AN/TPS-59 is a three dimensional ground-based sensor that can detect and track long range Air Breathing Targets (ABT) at ranges of 300 nautical miles and Tactical Ballistic Missiles (TBM) at ranges of 400 nautical miles.  The system is experiencing increasing obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues. The program will use a Post Production Support (PPS) contract and Other Government Activities (OGAs) to develop engineering changes to resolve DMSMS and incorporate Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) per DOD mandate.

Family of Target Acquisition Systems (FTAS) - The FTAS provides the MAGTF the capability to locate, identify, and attack enemy indirect fire weapons systems and observe and direct friendly artillery fire. The FTAS consists of the AN/TPQ-46 Firefinder Radar, the AN/TPQ-49 Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar, and the AN/TSQ-267 Target Processing Set.  The FTAS is critical in the execution of counterfire and the integration of target acquisition information enabling attack by MAGTF assets.  The FTAS also provides artillery firing units the ability to conduct artillery registration and other friendly fire missions.  The FTAS encompasses the equipment required to support target acquisition within the target acquisition platoon and is resident in the headquarters battery of each artillery regiment.  The program will continue to address engineering issues that arise due to DMSMS items within the FTAS.

Short/Medium Range Air Defense Radar (SHORAD or AN/TPS-63) - The AN/TPS-63 is a two-dimensional, medium-range, medium altitude, transportable radar system, which is doctrinally employed as a tactical gap-filler or as an early warning system for early deployment into the operational area.  It has a 360-degree air surveillance capability at a range of 160 miles and complements the co-employed AN/TPS-59 three-dimensional, long-range, air surveillance radar system.  The program will use OGAs to develop engineering change proposals related to improved system reliability with the specific purpose of meeting increased fleet operational requirements.  

Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3DELRR) - The Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) is a USAF program established to develop a lightweight, expeditionary, transportable, long-range surveillance radar system capable of detecting Airborne Ballistic Targets (ABTs) and Theatre Ballistic Missiles (TBMs).  Marine Corps personnel are providing technical, engineering, and programmatic support, as well as, source selection support to the U.S. Air Force 3DELRR program. The program support consists of program management, engineering, logistics, test, and requirements activities. Commencing in FY14, the Marine Corps will no longer provide funding to support the Air Force to support the 3DELRR program. 

Virtual Warfare Center (VWC) Support - The project team conducts fully interactive simulated war games at the Virtual Warfare Center (VWC) in St. Louis, MO, in order to quantify family of systems performance and how it impacts effectiveness in the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) mission area. The VWC provides a venue for the exploration of advanced engagement concepts focused on persistent forward naval engagements in support of the MAGTF and the development of associated Joint and Service specific tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).  VWC support encompasses a set of integrated fire control (IFC) activities that also includes concept/CONOPS development, family of systems architecture development, and systems engineering/integration efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Long Range Radar (AN/TPS-59) - The AN/TPS-59 is a three dimensional ground-based sensor that can detect and track long range Air Breathing Targets (ABT) at ranges of 300 nautical miles and Tactical Ballistic Missiles (TBM) at ranges of 400 nautical miles.  The system is experiencing increasing obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues. The program will use a Post Production Support (PPS) contract as well as Other Government Agencies (OGAs) to develop engineering changes to resolve DMSMS and incorporate Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) per DOD mandate.

Virtual Warfare Center (VWC) Support - The project team conducts fully interactive simulated war games at the Virtual Warfare Center (VWC) in St. Louis, MO, in order to quantify family of systems performance and how it impacts effectiveness in the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) mission area. VWC support encompasses a set of integrated fire control (IFC) activities that also includes concept/CONOPS development, family of systems architecture development, and systems engineering/integration efforts.  These efforts are led by ONR.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CAC2S will employ an evolutionary acquisition strategy utilizing an incremental and phased approach for development and fielding of the CAC2S.  The Capability Production Document (CPD) identifies two increments to achieve the full requirements of CAC2S.  The current acquisition strategy addresses Increment I of the CAC2S development process and focuses on the requirements that will modernize the assault and air support, air defense and control, and Aviation Combat Element (ACE) battle management capabilities of the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS). Increment I of the CAC2S will be accomplished through a two phased approach.  Phase 1 will address the requirements to establish the baseline CAC2S capabilities for the MACCS and improve AC2 performance and effectiveness.  Phase 2 will address the requirements for remaining ACE Battle Management Command &amp; Control (BMC2) requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV) program provides life-cycle support to ensure cost-effective combat readiness for the AAV Family of Vehicles (FOV).  This is accomplished through engineering changes resulting from continuous review of sub-systems to maintain system supportability, safety, reduce total ownership costs, improve fleet readiness, address obsolescence issues, and improve vehicle survivability and performance.  The AAV program also includes a survivability upgrade which will increase AAVP7A1 survivability and force protection while maintaining the required land and water mobility performance.  This upgrade is derived from the need for an operationally effective amphibious armored personnel carrier capability bridge until the future amphibious portfolio of vehicles reaches full operational capability.

The increase from FY14 to FY15 represents the AAV Survivability Upgrade prototype build contract option award, and design engineering for AAV turret, power train, and suspension improvements; as well as nonrecurring engineering and design for AAV electrical characterization, automatic fire supression system, C2 system enhancements, and AAV obsolescence and safety modifications.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The USMC intends to competitively award a contract to upgrade 392 Assault Amphibious Vehicles.  The program's main focus is on improving Marine force protection capabilities.  To support the required capabilities, the Survivability Upgrade program will seek to incorporate Non-Developmental Item (NDI) and/or Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) solutions into the existing AAVP7A1 Reliability, Availability, Maintainability/Rebuild to Standard (RAM/RS).  The acquisition strategy seeks to minimize cost, schedule, and maximize value, technology readiness, and commonality, while ensuring the selected manufacturer meets the capability attributes established for the AAVP7A1 RAM/RS.  R&amp;D will fund competitive designs with MS B in FY14 followed by EMD and production. IOC is scheduled for FY19.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Light Armored Vehicle Family of Vehicles (LAV FOV) consists of six fielded LAV configurations, and one communications/intelligence-configured asset on a LAV chassis. The LAV FOV provides a logistically self-contained, highly mobile, and lethal combined arms combat system to the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF). The LAV Product Improvement Program funds modification and sustainment activities and the development and testing of modifications of three programs; the LAV Modification Program, the LAV Anti-Tank Modernization (ATM) Program, and the LAV Survivability Upgrades Program. These programs will ensure that the LAV FOV will be capable of conducting its assigned missions by enhancing lethality and survivability; reliability, availability, maintainability and durability; as well as reducing operations and support costs.  

The funding decrease from FY14 to FY15 reflects adjustments to the LAV Acquisition Program Changes and resulting realignment of funds.  The Mobility and Obsolescence Program moved from the LAV Survivability Program to the LAV Modification Program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The LAV Modification program funds numerous low-dollar, yet extremely important minor modifications, support equipment and tools and other projects that increase LAV reliability and readiness while simultaneously reducing operations and support costs.  The Marine Corps PM-LAV Modification Team uses multi-disciplined integrated project teams consisting of engineering, logistical, contracting and financial personnel to manage Modification projects.  The majority of contracts issued under the Modification line are subject to the competitive acquisition process. Currently the LAV Modification and Sustainment program will capture the Mobility and Obsolescence kits consisting of Power Pack, Driveline, Steering, Electrical System, Suspension, Hull Modifications and Ballistic Protection Upgrade Package (BPUP) Kits.  The Mobility and Obsolescence program will address the Family of Light Armored Vehicles (FOLAV) automotive system obsolescence and reduced performance due to increased Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW).  This will be achieved through acquisition and the integration of replacement Powerpack, Driveline, Steering, Electrical System, Suspension, Hull Modifications and Ballistic Protection Upgrade Package (BPUP) Kits.  This effort will require deliverable kits during the Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, to include Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) and Modification Instructions (MI) for each of the 7 LAV variants and all Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) products (training, technical publications, tools, test equipment, provisioning, etc.) to support Developmental Testing, Operational Assessment, Independent Operational Test and Evaluation and fielding.  

The LAV Anti-Tank Modernization (ATM) program will focus on integrating a new turret into the LAV-AT variant with options for production.  The LAV-ATM is a replacement for the obsolete M901A1 turret to correct operational and readiness deficiencies.  It will be capable of firing the current family of Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided (TOW) missiles and be forward compatible with the next generation of heavy anti-armor missiles.  The program was approved in December of 2009 as part of the Material Development Decision to enter at Milestone B (MS B) based on the technical maturity of the capabilities required, schedule, and budget.  Milestone B approval was achieved in Mar 2011 and the EMD contract was awarded in Apr 2012. Once the EMD phase is complete, a combined MS C and Full Rate Production Review (FRPR) are planned to be followed by a Production and Deployment Phase and Operations and Support Phase.

The Survivability Upgrades program will only include replacing and relocating the legacy LAV-25 fuel cells (currently located under the scout seats in the LAV-25) with self sealing fuel cells and adding blast attenuating seats for all 7 LAV variants.  These projects are being executed as ECPs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Marine Expeditionary Rifle Squad (MERS) mission is to manage the infantry squad  "squad as a system" by conducting integration, systems engineering, human factors, and modernization efforts across all the products that are worn, carried, and consumed by the rifle squad. Physical integration, capability analysis, modeling and simulation, ergonomics, and configuration management are facilitated by this program in working with the various program managers and project officers in the development of their unique items that contribute to the squads overall capabilities. Weight and volume management are fundamental considerations in the insertion or modernization of any squad equipment. MERS works with Joint and NATO soldier modernization programs to harvest new technologies to increase the capability of the rifle squad. The program also ensures the integration of the rifle squad into the various mobility platforms currently in service and being developed to ensure a Marine and his equipment can operate effectively. This program is essential to ensure the combined synergistic equipment effects enhance the war-fighting functions of the Marine rifle squad towards the strategic Marine Corps war-fighting vision for the future.

Marine Enhancement Program (MEP) provides Research, Development, Test and Evaluation funding for low visibility, low cost items. It focuses on items of equipment which will benefit the individual Marine by reducing the load, increasing survivability, enhancing safety, and improving combat effectiveness. The emphasis of the program is on non-developmental item/commercial off the shelf (NDI/COTS) available items which can be quickly evaluated and fielded. This program is coordinated with the Army's Soldier Enhancement Program (SEP).

Ammunition Life Cycle Management Program responsibility for Total Life Cycle Management for ground conventional munitions.  Accordingly, PM Ammo is a member of the joint services Ammunition Logistics Research and Development IPT (ALR&amp;D IPT). Each year the IPT solicits R&amp;D projects from all of the services.  The IPT looks for innovative ideas to enhance logistical support for munitions.  Approximately 20 Ammo Logistics R&amp;D projects are voted on each year by the IPT.  They are prioritized by voting actions of the Senior Review Board and funding sources are identified. Since the funding for ammunition will likely decrease as the Marine Corps draws down and we end our participation in OEF, ammunition logistics R&amp;D projects designed to extend the shelf life of our current inventory, provide enhanced packaging to protect our munitions, and other such projects will go a long way to ensure the Marine Corps can maintain a reliable conventional ammunition inventory into the future.  New Start in FY15.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155), also known as the M777A2, provides direct, reinforcing, and general support fires to maneuver forces. It replaces all howitzers in all missions in the USMC and replaces the M198 howitzer as the general support artillery for light forces in the Army. The LW155 fires unassisted projectiles to a range of 15 miles and assisted projectiles to 19 miles. The addition of the digital fire control system enables the weapon to program and fire the improved Excalibur precision-guided munition to ranges in excess of 25 miles with better than 10-meter Circular Error Probable (CEP) accuracy. The LW155 is the first ground combat system whose major structures are made of high strength titanium alloy and the system makes extensive use of hydraulics to operate the breech, load tray, recoil and wheel arms. The combination of titanium structures and the use of hydraulic systems resulted in a significant weight savings over the M198 system (7000 lbs.). Compared to the M198, the LW155 emplaces three-times faster and displaces four-times faster. It traverses 32 percent more terrain worldwide and is 70 percent more survivable than the M198. The LW155 was first introduced into the Marine Corps in April 2005 and since then 10th, 11th, 12th and 14th Marines and the schoolhouses have been fielded. The Army has been fielding the system to its Stryker Brigades and Fires Brigades. The LW155 is currently in OEF with both Services.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>DVTE is a laptop Personal Computer (PC) based simulation system capable of emulating organic and supporting Infantry Battalion weapons systems and training scenarios to facilitate training and readiness based training. Its portable configuration allows Marines to train in areas where there are few options for training garrison, aboard ship, at remote reserve locations, and deployed. DVTE training includes language and culture training, platoon and squad level tactics, employment of supporting arms, and various Recognition of Combatants (ROC) packages. DVTE is part of a Commander's "training toolkit" contributing to the building block approach to standards based training focusing on achieving an improved level of combat readiness.

Due to DVTE being non-MAGTF Integration Plan compliant, there is minimal risk of losing the expanded training capability.  As a result, funds were reduced throughout the FYDP.  DVTE will utilize operations and maintenance funding for future software updates.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>MTWS is the only Marine Corps aggregate-level constructive simulation system designed to support the training of Senior Commanders and their staffs in command and control processes and procedures.  The system provides interactive, multi-sided, force-on-force, real-time modeling and simulation with stand-alone tactical combat scenarios for air ground, surface, and amphibious operations that interfaces to fielded Marine Corps Command, Control, Communications Computers and Intelligence (C4I) systems such as Command and Control Personal Computer (C2PC) and Intelligence Operations Server (IOS).  MTWS provides the battle staff the ability to seamlessly train with and use other C4I systems during the execution on an MTWS supported training event.  Through the implementation of a High Level Architecture (HLA) interface between MTWS and the entity-level Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation (JCATS) system, high resolution tactical objectives can be simulated in JCATS and reflected within the context of a larger operation scenario conducted in MTWS.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Range Modernization/Transformation (RM/T)</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>RM/T developments are associated with modernizing live training ranges at major USMC bases and stations.  This development effort enhances After Action Review (AAR) with ground truth feedback, realistic representation of Opposing Forces (OPFOR), and will upgrade the range and exercise control capabilities.  RM/T integrates Live, Virtual, and Constructive training technologies, thereby, enhancing fielded live-fire, force-on-target, and force-on-force training capabilities.

Reduction of funding is a result of funding cuts and Training and Education Command (TECOM) decision to realign RDTE funding to OMMC to sufficiently sustain, operate, and allow for safety and environmental controls on fielded assets.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Family of Combat Equipment Support and Services provides research, development, test and evaluation on low cost items with emphasis on non-developmental/commercially available items. Much of the RDT&amp;E is conducted in coordination/concert with other services and joint organizations, and in consideration of RDT&amp;E efforts being pursued by the other Services. Items approved for procurement will transition into Procurement Marine Corps and the Operation and Maintenance Marine Corps lines for Individual Combat Equipment, Medical Equipment and Shelters. The focus is to provide state of the art combat equipment (e.g. lightweight helmet, sleeping bags, load bearing systems, etc.), medical equipment (e.g. Authorized Medical Allowance (AMAL)/Authorized Dental Allowance (ADAL), Enroute Care, Mobile Medical Monitors, etc.), and Family of Shelters (soft wall, different frames and fabrics, etc.). The benefits will be reduced logistics, less weight, improved combat effectiveness, better echelon I and II care for Marines, improved individual and unit protection, tactical mobility, etc. The employment of state-of-the-art equipment will ensure Marines are equipped with the best items that technology can offer.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Body Armor Development (BAD) provides the most technologically advanced ballistics protection at the lightest weight in the world today. With current combat operations, these items have generated considerable Congressional and public interest because the items are considered life-saving equipment. When evaluated in total, BAD programs provide the critical systems that save lives, reduce the severity of combat injuries, and increase combat effectiveness by keeping more Marines in the fight. A key component of all of the BAD programs is that as new threats emerge on the battlefield, BAD equipment must constantly adapt to meet these new threats. BAD programs are truly a force multiplier on the battlefield of today and tomorrow. It includes Modular Scalable Vest (MSV), Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts (ESAPI), Helmet, and Eye Protection.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) is a C-130 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile system capable of firing all rockets and missiles in the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM). The system includes one launcher, two Re-Supply Systems, and the MFOM. HIMARS will provide the Fleet Marine Force with 24 hour ground-based, responsive General Support/General Support Reinforcing (GS/GSR) indirect fires which accurately engage targets at long range (60+km), with high volumes of lethal fire under all weather conditions throughout all phases of combat operations ashore, to include irregular warfare and distributed operations. HIMARS is a significant improvement over previously fielded ground fire support systems. During a 24 hour period, the system is expected to conduct multiple moves and multiple fire missions. Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) is the primary munition for units fielded with the HIMARS and MLRS rocket and missile platforms. GMLRS provides close, medium, and long range precision and area fires to destroy, suppress, and shape threat forces and protect friendly forces against cannon, mortar, rocket and missile artillery, light material and armor, personnel, command and control, and air defense surface targets. GMLRS integrates guided and control packages and an improved rocket motor achieving greater range and precision accuracy, requiring fewer rockets to defeat targets, thereby reducing the logistics burden.

The two fielded variants are GMLRS with Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM/Increment 1) and GMLRS Unitary (U/Increment 2), a 200 pound class high explosive warhead. The GMLRS U is the only variant currently in production, integrating a multi-mode fuse and high explosive warhead making it an all weather, low collateral damage, precision strike rocket. GMLRS U expands the MLRS target set into urban and complex environments by adding point, proximity, and delay fusing modes. GMLRS U are being fired in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), and has demonstrated high effectiveness and low collateral damage while supporting Marines in combat. A third variant of GMLRS, the alternative warhead (AW/Increment 3) is being developed to replace DPICM and meet the requirements outlined in a 25 June 2008 cluster munitions policy, which requires all cluster munitions by 2019 to produce less than 1% Unexploded Ordinance (UXO) on the battlefield. HIMARS satisfies the Marine Corps requirement for an indirect fire system that is responsive, maneuverable, and is capable of engaging targets at long range. The Reduced Range Practice Rocket (RRPR) includes training devices for tactical training, classroom training and handling exercises.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>USMC HIMARS is procuring the Army rocket launcher, the current/future Multiple Launch Rocket System Family of Munitions (MFOM) and a Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) based Resupply System (truck(s) with associated trailer(s)). The Marine Corps launcher and ammo requirements closely match U.S. Army requirements. The U.S. Army HIMARS program received increased funding and is now an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC level program. Marine Corps Resupply System requirements are unique. Accordingly, the Marine Corps is an integrator and must ensure the required warfighting capability is fielded to the Marine Corps operating forces. The USMC has aligned funds to reflect an emphasis on not only hardware development, but also the integration of these principle end items while providing associated evaluation and oversight, and the development of associated rocket munitions in conjunction with the Army. Additionally, the Marine Corps program is establishing the training and support methodologies that will result in associated skill sets required within the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps strategy is incorporating acquisition and capability upgrades to both the systems and rocket munitions. These improvements parallel the U.S. Army's acquisition strategy.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops Joint and Marine Corps unique improvements to artillery fire support technology that supports the artillery triad of fires and fire support equipment. These initiatives include but are not limited to the following: the Expeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS), munitions development &amp; testing (to include rocket munitions), as well as testing and development of the Family of Artillery Munitions (FAM), Common Laser Ranger Finder (CLRF) integrated capability, and the Modeled Meteorological Information Manager (MMIM).  

EFSS is an all-weather, ground based indirect fire system designed to support the vertical assault element of the Ship-To-Objective Maneuver (STOM) force.  The EFSS is defined as a Launcher, Mobility Platform (prime mover), Ammunition, Ammunition Supply Vehicle, and Technical Fire Direction and Control equipment necessary for orienting weapons to an azimuth of fire.  EFSS supports irregular warfare and distributed operations.  

FAM is used to develop and mature artillery munitions for the Marine Corps triad of fire.  

The CLRF is a lightweight, eye-safe target laser rangefinder capable of being carried and employed by a single Marine.  CLRF Integrated Capability (CLRF IC) is a replacement to the existing CLRF Suite of Equipment.  CLRF IC provides the observer the ability to perform target detection, recognition, identification, and location determination in a suite of systems.  

The Modeled Meteorological Information Manager (MMIM) will be the primary artillery meteorological capability at the artillery battalion and regiment providing the ability to create, receive, manage, and transmit near real time gridded meteorological information supporting artillery and target acquisition systems significantly enhancing the accuracy of meteorological information.  

The Fire Support Mod Line is a set of Marine Corps efforts to address critical operational and logistics deficiencies in existing, fielded fire support/weapons systems and equipment.  The line provides technical refresh, development of target acquisition, and artillery survey and meteorological systems.  Funding is used to ensure Clinger Cohen Act (CCA) and Information Assurance (IA) requirements are met, execution of product improvements/modifications, and upgrades to system hardware and software for the Ground Counter Fire Sensor (GCFS), Marine Artillery Survey Set (MASS), Meteorological Station Group (MSG), Global Positioning System Survey (GPS-S) and the Improved Position Azimuth Determining System (IPADS), Lightweight Target Designator (LTD) and the CLRF as well as for upgrades, engineering change proposals, and modifications for guided munitions and fire control systems.  Funding is also used for upgrades, engineering change proposals (ECPs) and modifications for guided munitions and fire control systems which falls within Fire Support Systems for the Marine Corps. 

The Internally Transportable Vehicle (ITV) is a program in this project that is a lightweight, highly mobile vehicle that provides a deployed Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) with a ground vehicle internally transportable in the MV-22 and CV-22 tilt-rotor aircraft as well as the CH53-E and MH-47 aircraft. The ITV has two configurations: The Light Strike Vehicle (ITV-LSV) and EFSS Prime Mover (ITV-PM).

Insensitive Munitions Program's purpose is to field munitions that are insensitive munitions (IM) compliant.

Conventional Ground Ammunition project identifies and develops Insensitive Munitions (IM) Technologies to address IM shortfalls in new Marine Corps development or improvements to legacy Conventional Ground Ammunition to meet OSD mandated IM compliance requirements.  These IM Technology investments directly support the development of the bi-annual Marine Corps Insensitive Munitions Strategic Plan (IMSP) to address the identified IM technology needs of the Marine Corps.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>All DoD services are required to field munitions that are insensitive munitions (IM) compliant.  IM compliancy is measured by the performance of munitions to six tests; Fast Cook-Off, Slow Cook-Off, Bullet Impact, Fragment Impact, Sympathetic Detonation, and Shape Charge Jet.  Services are required to submit IM Strategic Plans annually delineating how they intend on executing their Service IM effort to maximize IM improvements to both new development and legacy munitions.  These IM Strategic Plans, Supporting Plan of Actions, and Milestones, with funding trial, are submitted to the JROC, demonstrating each Service's commitment to the continuing effort to improve IM, for approval.  In order to achieve the system's IM performance, a weapon system's developer must have new technology to apply to its poorly performing IM system. Under this program, the USMC invests in IM technology which will improve its existing munitions IM reactions and complies with the OSD mandate for maximum feasible IM compliance.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Description>All DoD services are required to field munitions that are insensitive munitions (IM) compliant. IM
compliancy is measured by the performance of munitions to six tests; Fast Cook-Off, Slow Cook-Off, Bullet Impact,
Fragment Impact, Sympathetic Detonation, and Shape Charge Jet. Services are required to submit IM Strategic Plans annually delineating how they intend on executing their Service IM effort to maximize IM improvements to both new development and legacy conventional ground ammunition. These IM Strategic Plans, Supporting Plan of Actions, and Milestones, with funding trial, are submitted to the JROC, demonstrating each Service's commitment to the continuing effort to improve IM characteristics of Conventional Ground Ammunition, for approval. In order to achieve the system's IM performance, the Conventional Ground Ammunition developer/owner must have new technology identified and available to address IM shortfalls at the onset of the ammunition development or available for insertion during improvement opportunities for legacy ammunition. Under this program, the USMC invests in IM technology which will improve its existing munitions IM reactions or ability to reliably initiate IM technologies and complies with the OSD mandate for maximum feasible IM compliance.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>These programs range from off-the-shelf modifications to developmental items.  Development will typically be conducted at government labs.  

Efforts that fall under the Expeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS) funding line include; The EFSS system; the High Explosive Rocket Assisted Projectile (HE-RAP); and the Precision Extended Range Munition (PERM).  The strategy for HE-RAP consists of procuring 350 HE-RAP test articles that can be utilized to conduct some minor characterization testing and data gathering for future Marine Corps operations.  The acquisition approach for PERM is being conducted in two phases; In Step 1, two CPFF contracts were awarded to two vendors for the development and delivery of production representative rounds.  Step 1 allows the development of existing technology, the management of technology risks, and demonstration of PERM designs prior to Milestone C (MS C). In Step 2 one FFP contract will be awarded for the production and delivery of the Total Munitions Requirement (TMR) and a priced option for the procurement of the vendor's Technical Data Package (TDP) for the approved material solution.  PERM will supplement the capability of EFSS by increasing the effective range from 8km to up to 20 km.  

Currently the Family of Artillery Munitions (FAM) Program includes four (4) artillery munitions which are being developed by the Army. The Army is in possession of these programs but continues to interact with the FAM IPT to ensure USMC requirements and capability needs are met. This allows the USMC to become users of the munition and certify the round for naval transportation. The munitions include but are not limited to; XM1156 Precision Guidance Kit (PGK), Excalibur, Joint Extended Range Illumination Projectile (JERIP), and XM1128 155mm RAP Round. Each munitions status is tracked to ensure Marine Corps requirements are satisfied throughout the systems lifecycle.  The Marine Corps guides WESRB certification to bring ordnance from the Army into the Marine Corps inventory. Fire power enhancement used selected upgrades from Army developmental programs to create a system that more readily meets Marine Corps requirements.  

CLRF-IC will be procured using competitive contract strategy upon completion of the Engineering Manufacturing Development phase.  

MMIM was procured and is managed by the US Army.  The Marine Corps is an active participant in the Army program.

Fire Support Mods:  A Sole Source contract was awarded to upgrade the GCFS command post computer and procure an Interface Control Document that will allow the program office to complete the digital communications requirement using competitive contracting.  Limited research and analysis will be done as necessary to support ECPs for the MASS, IPADS and miscellaneous targeting devices.

The ITV Program will identify existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), government off-the-shelf (GOTS), and military off-the-shelf (MOTS) components to improve ITV reliability and safety by utilizing the Nevada Automotive Test Center (NATC).

The Insensitive Munitions Program is intended to invest in technologies that will improve the IM responses of currently fielded USMC priority munitions items in accordance with the USMC IM Strategic Plan and the OSD mandate to field IM compliant munitions to the maximum extent practicable.

The Conventional Ground Ammunition strategy is to invest in Insensitive Munitions (IM) technologies to address IM shortfalls of priority programs identified in the bi-annual Marine Corps Insensitive Munitions Strategic Plan (IMSP).  Once the IM technologies have been successfully demonstrated and matured, the intent is to insert the new technologies into new conventional ground ammunition development as well as provide opportunities to improve legacy munitions IM characteristics.  The IM R&amp;D effort directly addresses the mandated OSD requirement to obtain incremental IM improvement in pursuit of becoming fully IM compliant to the maximum extent practicable.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) satisfies the medium lift capability of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV)/Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV)/MPC triad. The MPC supports expeditionary maneuver warfare of the Ground Combat Element (GCE) and enhances Marine Operating Forces tactical and operational mobility on a platform that is highly mobile on land while maneuvering with all USMC wheeled and tracked combat, and tactical vehicles. MPC provides armored protection and lethality to protect the vehicle and support dismounted infantry in the attack, while providing payload to carry the infantry's combat loads, mission-essential equipment, and up to two days of supplies.

This program's requirement was deferred and does not have funding beyond FY2013.  ACV Increment 1.1 (PE 0603611M, Project 0025) leverages and continues the work that was previously accomplished under the MPC program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

It will enhance combat breaching capabilities of the ground combat elements, logistics, maintenance and transportation. The PE also provides improvements in all areas of Combat Service Support Equipment Vehicles by determining the replacement for the heavy, medium and light fleet vehicles. This includes projects such as: Alternative Power Sources for Communications Equipment (APSCE) which is a suite of devices that provide the commander with the capability to use existing power to operate his communication equipment, computers and peripheral equipment instead of using batteries or fossil fuel generators; the Marine Corps Family of Automatic Test Systems (ATS), formerly TETS, which provides automatic testing capability for use by technicians both in garrison and forward edge of the battlefield; improvements in all areas of the M1A1 main battle tank; the High Performance Capabilities for Military Vehicles Project which is dedicated to applying the best practices of the motor sports industry to military vehicles including engineering expertise, equipment and technology.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Logistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) program is the replacement for the Logistics Vehicle System (LVS) fleet. The LVSR Modification line funds numerous modifications and initiatives that are required to address operational priorities, engineering change proposals, safety concerns, support equipment inefficiencies, tool malfunctions, product quality deficiencies, and other issues that effect vehicle reliability, availability, maintainability and readiness. A proactive and focused approach ensures proper vehicle sustainment and life cycle management and it allows the flexibility to develop and implement improvements as needed to respond to the evolving needs of the Marine Corps. Reduction of funding from FY14 to FY15 is due to the decreased number of ECPs and safety mods required.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The M1A1 Mod Kit effort includes improvements in all areas of the M1A1 main battle tank and the Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB).  The M1A1 tank provides armor protected firepower to the USMC ground combat element.  Efforts under the mod line pertaining to the M1A1 include improvements in lethality systems to increase armament accuracy, increase the crew's situational awareness through sensor enhancements and intra-vehicular data sharing, providing for off-board targeting improvement, and environmental testing of components.  The AVLB provides the Marine Corps only armor-protected assault gap crossing capability.  Continued funding is required to address obsolescence, address operational deficiencies to adapt the tank and AVLB to a changing operational environment and support user-defined product improvements. These improvements directly address Marine Corps Lessons Learned, after action reports, and will ensure maximum survivability, sustainability, and readiness.

Route Reconnaissance and Clearance (R2C) is an incremental development project to enhance the capabilities of the R2C systems, a family of systems fielded in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) via the Urgent Needs Statement (UNS) process.  This research and development effort will integrate future vehicles, robots, and associated equipment to provide standoff detection, marking, and neutralization of Explosive Hazards such as mines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).  Enhancements for R2C will provide capabilities not found in the current inventory to defeat explosive hazards and will protect Marines and equipment while conducting route and area clearance operations.  The integration of the next generation of armored security and support vehicles, Vehicle Mounted Mine Detectors (VMMDs), specialized robots, and a new suite of detection, marking, and neutralization systems will enable maneuver commanders to make timely and informed decisions in avoiding or neutralizing explosive hazards that impede their missions.  Multiple detection and marking capabilities will detect a broader spectrum of explosive hazards and achieve higher overall effectiveness rates, while standoff and remote-controlled detection, marking, and neutralization capabilities will enhance force protection and system survivability. Operational speeds and rates will increase, which will better support the maneuver force operational tempo.  This program does not have funding beyond FY2014.

The Engineer Mods and Tool Kits line funds modifications and initiatives which are required to address operational priorities, engineering change proposals, safety concerns, support equipment inefficiencies, product quality deficiencies and other issues that affect vehicle reliability, availability and readiness.  This proactive and focused approach ensures proper vehicle sustainment and life cycle management in response to evolving needs of the Marine Corps fleet.  Operational needs to provide personnel survivability on engineer equipment is essential to current and future operations.  Research and development funding develops and integrates new lighter, compact armor technology and supports ballistic testing for applications to existing and future acquisitions.    

Corrosion Prevention and Control (CPAC): The useful life of Marine Corps assets will be extended through a comprehensive CPAC RDT&amp;E program aimed at identifying and certifying new corrosion control products, materials, processes and procedures for legacy and new acquisition.

The Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Family of Vehicles (FoV) provides tactical mobility for Warfighters with multi-mission vehicles designed to support urgent operational needs and protect personnel from the effects of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), underbody mines, and small arms fire threats.  Five vehicle categories (CATs) have been tested, procured, fielded and sustained: Category I - Urban combat operations, ambulance.  Category II - Multi-mission ops-convoy lead, troop transport, ambulance, utility vehicle.  Category III - Mine/IED clearance ops, explosive ordnance disposal.  MRAP All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) - Combat operations (ops) in rural, mountainous, urban terrain.  Other Protected Vehicles- Specialty mission or unique configuration. Provides the same threshold ballistic, mine and IED protection as other MRAP vehicles.  Includes the MRAP Recovery Vehicle (MRV) variant.

The Low Metallic Signature Mine Detector (LMS MD) will provide a light-weight, man portable, handheld detection capability that is capable of detecting traditional, low metallic, non-metallic mines, and explosive devices.  The LMS MD capability enables mobility of dismounted forces by significantly increasing their ability to locate, mark, avoid, and/or reduce mine and IED threats.  It will enable better categorization and identification of explosive hazards as it will be capable of detecting and discriminating between symmetric mines and asymmetric explosive devices, to include metallic, low metallic and zero metallic mines, IEDs, and Unexploded Ordinance (UXO) throughout a MAGTF Area of Operations (AO).  The replacement detection capability to the interim VMR2 Minehound and AN/PSS-14 Mine Detector Program of Record, the LMS MD will be fielded throughout the Combat Engineer and EOD communities to provide dismounted maneuver and mobility support to a MAGTF in an expeditionary environment.  This program does not have funding beyond FY2014.

Engineer Squad Robot (ESR) provides the Ground Combat Element with a lightweight back packable robot to support the maneuver commander with organic route and obstacle reconnaissance, urban scouting and breaching capabilities, explosive detection, interrogation and reduction in support of dismounted tactical maneuver across the spectrum of conflict. The Robot will be part of the T/E of Combat Engineer Squads in both active and reserve Combat Engineer Battalions (CEB), Marine Wing support Squadrons (MWSS) and additional systems are allocated for supporting establishments.  This program does not have funding beyond FY2014.

The FY14 to FY15 decrease reflects the adjustment of Marine Corps fiscal priorities which includes the termination of funding for the Route Reconnaissance and Clearance (R2C), Low Metallic Signature Mine Detector (LMSMD), and Engineer Squad Robot programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Corrosion Prevention and Control (CPAC): The useful life of Marine Corps assets will be extended through a comprehensive CPAC RDT&amp;E program aimed at identifying and certifying new corrosion control products, materials, processes and procedures for legacy and new acquisition.  The CPAC RDT&amp;E Program works to standardize and substantially improve strategies, objectives and processes to prevent, detect, and treat corrosion and its effects on Marine Corps ground vehicles and weapons systems.  This mission responds to the Congressional directives and DoD and SECNAV instruction to reduce the negative operational effects and associated total ownership cost of Marine Corps ground vehicles and weapons systems</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:Text>The CPAC program continued to provide support to all major PEO / PMs concerning corrosion control.  Key efforts include review and modification of program CPAC Planning documents, support of Design Review meetings, and evaluation of corrosion testing on prototype assets. Additionally the USMC CPAC program has completed significant engineering efforts including revision to the USMC painting technical manual TM 4750-OD/1: Painting, Coating, Underbody, and Registration Marking for Marine Corps Combat and Tactical Equipment that included specified surface preparation methods based on substrate type and thickness, modified Chemical Agent Resistant Coating (CARC) specifications, coating quality assurance requirements, undercoating specifications, and the addition of a procedure for bedliner applications. Throughout this document, technical modifications were made on the basis of USMC and OSD-funded corrosion control engineering projects which yielded positive changes in corrosion control processes.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>(U) The M1A1 modification kits program will leverage Army initiatives to the maximum extent and incorporate modifications to adapt Army solutions to the USMC environment. The USMC will research, develop, and evaluate programs to improve the survivability and lethality of the USMC tank.  These efforts include the Abrams integrated Display and Targeting System, threat detection and warning, situational awareness, survivability, and ownership cost reduction work. M1A1 Mods will exercise options on existing contracts of varying types to conduct research and analysis associated with the development of modifications and corrosion prevention to the M1A1 Tank and supporting platforms.  	
(U) Route Reconnaissance and Clearance (R2C):  Starting in FY10, the Marine Corps began to procure a fleet of standardized Route Reconnaissance and Clearance systems based upon the successful route clearance teams operating in Iraq using Capabilities Production Documents for current systems and leveraging contracts already in place.  Concurrently, supports a research and development effort to integrate future vehicles with enhanced mobility and survivability, a suite of improved detection and marking capabilities, and robots with greater detection, marking, and neutralization capabilities. As a result of adjustments to Marine Corps fiscal priorities the R2C program has been terminated. This program does not have funding beyond FY14. 

(U) Engineer Mods and Tool Kits:  This is a roll-up line of various engineering efforts, modifications and other related items less than $5 Million each.  This program provides for significant improvements to a various pieces of engineering equipment by enhancing their capabilities and improving readiness.  

(U) Corrosion Prevention and Control (CPAC) Program: The Program will execute the RDT&amp;E Program through direct allocation of funding to the Naval Surface Warfare Center - Carderock Division Corrosion Research and Engineering Branch for comprehensive program aimed at identifying and certifying new corrosion control products, materials, processes and procedures for legacy and new acquisition.

(U) Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP):  The Program will execute RDT&amp;E funds in support of Cougar Egress and Seat Survivability testing.  Funds will also support research and development efforts associated with Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) for survivability and mobility upgrades. 

(U) The Low Metallic Signature Mine Detector will develop, integrate, test, evaluate and procure a new hand-held mine detector system to replace the current AN/PSS-14 Mine Detector Program of Record. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) technology has improved significantly since the development of the AN/PSS-14, allowing greater efficiency, target discrimination, miniaturization, longer operating time and command &amp; control. The Low Metallic Signature Mine Detector will be effective against low and non metallic devices, capable of identifying man-made objects, weigh less than 7 lbs, capable of start-up and calibration in less than 60 seconds, and be integrated with existing C2 systems. As a result of adjustments to Marine Corps fiscal priorities the LMS-MD program has been terminated for FY15 thru FYDP.

(U) The Engineer Squad Robot(ESR)/CRS-I provides Marines and Soldiers a dismounted standoff capability for scouting and explosive hazard detection.  USMC ESR will formally merge with the Joint USMC/Army Common Robotic System (Individual) (CRS-I) starting in FY16.  By combining efforts, there will be an improvement in meeting "Better Buying" initiatives as the Approved  Acquisition Objective (AAO) will increase from a USMC AAO of 274 to a Joint AAO of 3,734.  Prior to FY16, the ESR will conduct a Joint AoA for the multi-mission Unmanned Ground System (UGS) and a WSTA to assist in determining the best alternative for the ESR/CRS-I program.  After completion of the WSTA and AoA, the acquisition approach for the Joint ESR/CRS-I will be determined.  AoA approval is scheduled for 4th Qtr FY14. As a result of adjustments to Marine Corps fiscal priorities the ESR program has been terminated for FY15 thru FYDP.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Marine Corps Tactical Motor Transport Modification project manages procurement and life cycle sustainment for more than 40,000 principle end items divided among four fleets:  Light Fleet, Medium Fleet, Heavy Fleet, and Special Fleet.  A sustained effort is maintained in the Marine Corps for development and testing in support of fleet Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) initiatives, vehicle quality deficiency resolutions, safety initiatives, environmental/state transportation mandated vehicle changes, and system component refresh modifications efforts.  Since transportation asset operational availability declines at a steady rate over time, SLEP, fleet overhauls, and enhanced depot level modifications are essential in maintaining a viable transportation capability in the Marine Corps Operating Forces. 	

The Improved Recovery Vehicle (IRV) project includes improvements in all areas of the M88A2 Improved Recovery Vehicle. Continued funding is required to address obsolescence and support pre-planned product improvements.  In addition, will implement lessons learned and develop safety related Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to correct hazards noted during the standard day to day operation of the M88A2 Improved Recovery Vehicle.

The HMMWV Sustainment Modification Initiative (SMI) program will restore selected variants of the remaining armored HMMWV fleet to 2004 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) performance parameters.  This will be accomplished via a modification through kitting approach.  The improvements will focus on restoring the vehicles to safe operating parameters over the expeditionary mission profile, restoring reliability, payload, and mobility to ORD thresholds.  The FY15 funding increase reflects the commencement of vendor drive-off testing operational assessment.  
	 
The Material Handling Equipment (MHE) line is a roll-up line that provides for the replacement and Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) of Marine Corps MHE including forklifts, cranes, and container handlers.  Funds will be used to explore techniques and technology to help survivability of the various platforms while also working to help sustain reliability and performance of the equipment.

The Family of Construction Equipment (FCE) line is a roll-up line that provides for the replacement and Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) of Marine Corps construction equipment.  Funds will be used for Ballistic and Add on Armor (AoA) application tests and integration into the Engineer Family of Systems construction equipment.    
											
P-19 Replacement (P-19R) will replace the aging A/S32P-19A Crash Fire Rescue fleet in support of expeditionary airfield operations and the supporting establishment.  The vehicle will be outfitted with advanced fire suppression equipment and provide rescue and aircraft fire fighting capabilities to permanent and expeditionary airfields throughout the Marine Corps.  The P-19 Replacement may also be employed to fight structure fires in support of base camps and as firefighting support to other elements of the MAGTF, such as ammunition supply points, Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricant (POL) distribution points, or hazardous material storage facilities. The increase in funding from FY14 to FY15 is due to an additional testing requirement to support Full Rate Production (FRP) of the P-19R.

MTVR Trailer and Family of Tactical Trailers programs will explore options for "lightening the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF)" weight and cube attributes of our light and medium trailer fleet.  Seeking technologies and other current and emerging options that can be employed to achieve optimum lift capability while constrained to the desired weight and cube.  Transportation and expeditionary goals will be considered in the research and development phase for the trailer fleet. The MTVR Trailer program is a USMC initiative to replace the current M105/MK149/M353 Trailers with a trailer capable of augmenting the MTVR's increased mobility without degrading its operational capabilities. This program will develop and field a trailer which will have greater mobility characteristics while increasing the payload up to 12,000 lbs. The FY14 to FY15 decrease is due to completion of developmental testing and movement of program to Full Rate Production (FRP).    

Family of Material Handling Equipment will explore ways to armor or design survivability for various pieces of equipment in the Material Handling Family.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Improved Recovery Vehicle (IRV) program leverages Army developmental projects to create a system that more readily meets Marine Corps Heavy Recovery Vehicle requirements.  Improvements include Engineering Change Proposals addressing safety, reliability, and technology upgrades.

The HMMWV Sustainment Modification Initiative (SMI) program will take a five-phased approach. The first phase will include trade studies and preliminary design; the second phase will focus on final design and the building of component upgrade kits; the third phase will include performance and RAM testing of production representative kitted vehicles against the requirements in the 2004 HMMWV ORD; the fourth phase will complete development of the technical specification; and the fifth phase will award the production contract.  The vehicle improvements will be accomplished by enhancing the HMMWVs at industry facilities, government depots, or a partnering combination of the two, via a modification through kitting approach.  Open competition for providing the kits and installing/integrating them into existing platforms is a key goal. 

The P-19 Replacement will leverage COTS and/or NDI components in an effort to minimize costs, test requirements, and reduce development time. P-19R will supplant the aging A/S32P-19A fleet in support of expeditionary airfield operations and the supporting establishment. The vehicle will be outfitted with advanced fire suppression equipment and provide rescue and aircraft fire fighting capabilities to permanent and expeditionary airfields throughout the Marine Corps. The P-19 Replacement may also be employed to fight structure fires in support of base camps and as firefighting support to other elements of the MAGTF, such as ammunition supply points, Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL) distribution points, or hazardous material storage facilities.

Motor Transport Modification funding will focus on streamlined acquisitions of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf/Non-Developmental Items (COTS/NDI) that can be identified, integrated, and tested in a short amount of time.  Successful modifications and tests are intended for follow-on procurement and incorporation into existing system component upgrades, SLEPs, or rapid COTS/NDI fielding for the Fleet Marine Forces (FMF).

The Family of Material Handling Equipment acquisition strategy will use RDT&amp;E funding to explore current and new armor options that can be used to achieve optimum crew survivability performance. 

The Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) Trailer program's original acquisition strategy consisted of procuring three variants of trailers that would have greater mobility characteristics, while maximizing the commonality of parts, across the three trailer platform.  FY05 RDTE funds were used to procure six prototypes trailers (two of each variants) developed by Choctaw Manufacturing Developing Contractors (CMDC). Prior to a fielding decision, the original MTVR Trailer program was halted due to concerns the trailers did not meet the CMC goal to lighten the MAGTF.  As a result, the MTVR Trailer program was restructured for re-design of the cargo trailer and to delay procurement of the Water and General Purpose trailers.  On 29 November 2012, a CD&amp;I letter directed that the trailer requirement would now be constructed as a modular trailer capable of hauling the water SIXCON and all expeditionary power units, to include the 100Kw generator.  The new modular design would replace the MK149, M353, and M105 trailer and would be designated as the MTVR Modular Trailer, MK593.

The Family of Construction Equipment acquisition strategy will use RDT&amp;E funding to explore current and new armor options that can be used to achieve optimum crew survivability performance.  

The Family of Tactical Trailer (FTT) acquisition strategy will use RDT&amp;E funding to explore current and new technological options that can be used to achieve optimum lift within the desired weight and cube constraints in support of the "Lightening the MAGTF" initiative. Transportation and expeditionary goals will be considered in the research and development phase for the light and medium/heavy trailer fleet.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Environmental Control Equipment :
The Enhanced Environmental Control Unit (E2CU) program is the second generation of a family of environmental control units from 9000 BTU to 60,000 BTU/Hr cooling output.  The E2CU program will provide tactical Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and superior reliability for all MAGTF units in all operational concepts.  E2CU will replace all legacy ECUs starting in 2015 in the following sizes: 9000 BTU/Hr; 18,000 BTU/Hr; 36,000 BTU/Hr; and 60,000 BTU/Hr.  These higher reliability and higher efficiency sets will use EPA-approved refrigerants, will be more energy efficient, be more mobile, easier to repair, and quieter than their predecessors.  A significant average fuel efficiency improvement over the current ECU family has been demonstrated.  With environmental control systems consuming 50-70% of tactical electric power in theater, this savings will be a significant contribution to reducing the USMC fuel demand, and lightening the MAGTF.  The Warfighter benefit includes a decreased logistics footprint, less reliance on petroleum-derived fuels, increased local energy security, and reduced tanker losses (fewer on the road).  The operational imperative to reduce fuel usage will consequently reduce refueling operations and exposing Marines to hazardous fuel convoy operations.  The funding decrease from FY14 and FY15 reflects the requirements and resource realignment of all commodity areas and budget adjustments made by the Marine Corps Combat Development Command.

Mobile Power Equipment:
The Family of Mobile Electric Power Equipment consists of skid and trailer mounted tactical generators ranging from 1 to 200 kilowatts, Mobile Electric Power Distribution Systems, Load Banks, and Electrician's Tool Kits.  This equipment is procured and fielded to provide electricity on the battlefield. Combat, combat support, and combat service support units all require tactical power to operate weapons systems, Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) systems, medical and messing facilities, environmental control equipment, and water purification systems.  With over 10,000 generators and using diesel engines in the Operating Forces, improving their fuel efficiency and reliability will be a significant contribution to reducing the USMC fuel demand, and lightening the MAGTF.  The Warfighter benefit includes a decreased logistics footprint, less reliance on petroleum-derived fuels, increased local energy security, and reduced tanker losses (fewer on the road).  The operational imperative to reduce fuel usage will consequently reduce refueling operations and exposing Marines to hazardous fuel convoy operations. 

Four discrete efforts will be pursued as follows:   
(1) Hybrid Generator: Funding to integrate new AMMPS 10kW Generator and energy storage devices onto a Light Tactical Trailer.  Will provide capability to deliver 10kW steady state, supply up to 13kW peak demand for several hours using stored energy, provide 3kW silent operations for several hours (battery only).  Will transition into production of a unit that can be integrated with the AMMPS generator.   
(2) Next Generation Power Distribution:  Intelligent power management devices that can integrate with existing MEPDIS-R Power Distribution Boxes and AMMPS generators.  Provides capability for safe, efficient centralized power distribution from a single source to multiple loads, Automatic phase balancing of loads, power monitoring and data collection/dissemination for remote system monitoring.  
(3) Next-Generation Floodlight System (FLS): Funding to integrate new 10kW AMMPS Generator and a new light tower (floodlight system) onto a Light Tactical Trailer.  Provides tactical lighting and exportable 3-phase electrical power.  Will transition into production of a unit that can be integrated with the AMMPS generator.  
(4)  1kW Diesel Generator:  Integration and product qualification testing of new 1kW diesel generator for USMC-unique applications.  Generator procurement will be by customers on a DoD contract.  
The increase in funding from FY14 and FY15 reflects the requirements and resource realignment of all commodity areas and budget adjustments made by the Marine Corps Combat Development Command.  In addition, funding supports the current program strategy for Mobile Hybrid Electric Power System (MEHPS)developmental efforts in concert with SECDEF/CMC energy initiatives.

Advanced Power Sources
These R&amp;D efforts will focus on achieving the Marine Corps goal of lightening the MAGTF and the individual Marine combat load though reduced battery weight and logistical fuel resupply needs. The Mobile Electric Hybrid Power System - Lightweight (MEHPS-L) and Medium Hybrid Expeditionary Energy Systems (MHEES) will focus on hybrid power systems capable of improved fuel efficiency and silent operations in the 0.5-5kW power range. These systems will be smaller, lighter and more efficient systems. The conformal/CFX battery effort will focus on testing and integrating next generation batteries. The Shipboard Battery Management System will focus on developing, testing, and integrating a shipboard battery maintenance structure which will allow the Marine Corps to transport and maintain lithium batteries throughout the fleet in a safe and expeditionary manner. The Squad Electric Power Program will focus on further weight reduction of the Squad Electric Power System and increasing survivability and durability of the system. The On Board Vehicle Power (OBVP) will focus on flexibility and efficiency of research and development to save fuel at idle conditions and improve vehicle energy efficiency on MTVR platforms.  The Advanced Battery Charger will allow complete charging of different types of military and commercial batteries used for communications, electronics, and weapon systems.  The funding decrease from FY14 and FY15 reflects the requirements and resource realignment of all commodity areas and budget adjustments made by the Marine Corps Combat Development Command.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Full and open competition.  Three contractors to develop and deliver prototypes in two size models.  Government testing to validate performance.  Single contractor to produce both models using multi-year ID/IQ production contract.  Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), followed by LRIP testing, then Full Rate Production (FRP) to procure using PMC funds on annual Delivery Orders.  ECUs are organically supported by Marines.

Initial focus on development of Hybrid Generator Systems using AMMPS generators beginning in FY13, and Power Distribution, followed by New Floodlight Set development in FY14.  For each effort, strategies are very similar: Full and open competition.  Three contractors to develop and deliver prototypes in two size models.  Government testing to validate performance.  Single contractor to produce both models using multi-year ID/IQ production contract.  LRIP, followed by LRIP testing, then Full Rate Production to procure using PMC funds on annual Delivery Orders .  All equipment is organically supported by Marines.  The 1kW Generator effort will be to integrate and test these generators in USMC unique applications.  Generators will be procured by others on a DoD contract.

The acquisition strategy for the Renewable Energy Program is to focus on improvements for the next generation Solar Portable Alternative Communications Energy System (SPACES), Ground Renewable Expeditionary Energy System (GREENS)/Medium Hybrid Expeditionary Energy Systems (MHEES), and Mobile Electric Hybrid Power System Lightweight (MEHPS- L).  These R&amp;D efforts will focus on achieving the Marine Corps goal of lighting the MAGTF and the individual Marine combat load through reduced battery weight and logistical fuel resupply needs.  In particular the development will focus on making these systems smaller, lighter and more efficient.  In addition this development effort will also focus on development needed to transition the Office of Naval Research (ONR), Reliable S (SAP - Service Accessible Point) Update Protocol (RSUP), Future Naval Capability (FNC) effort.

The acquisition strategy for the Battery Management and Sustainment System (BMASS) is to focus on the development of the next generation portable Marine Corps charger and a Portable Lithium Battery Maintainer.  These R&amp;D efforts will focus on developing a capability which allow the Marine Corps the ability to support battery needs in all locations and environments of operation (land, sea and air).  In particular the development will focus on making the next generation of the Suitcase Portable Charger (called the Advanced Battery Charger) smaller, lighter, more efficient and high power.  It will also focus on development of a capability which allows the Marine Corps to transport and maintain lithium batteries throughout the fleet in a safe and expeditionary manor.

The acquisition strategy for the Squad Electric Power Program is to focus on the transition of the ONR Squad Electric Power FNC effort.  This R&amp;D effort will focus on achieving the Marine Corps goal of lighting the individual Marines combat load though reduced battery weight and increase interoperability of Marine Corps gear.  In particular the effort will focus on further weight reduction of the Squad Electric Power System and increasing survivability and durability of the system.

The acquisition strategy for the On Board Vehicle Power Program is to focus on the continued adaptation and development of technologies transitioned from the Office of Naval Research Future Naval Capability.  Primary focus will be on adaptation for different vehicle platform models (M1151, M1165) as well as updates to system configuration due to Armor requirement changes.  Further, changes in deployment methodology with command guidance to focus on flexibility and efficiency will drive research and development to save fuel at idle conditions and improve energy export efficiency.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Marine Corps Automatic Test Equipment Systems (MCATES) program provides development of sustainment technology for automatic test equipment used in organizational/intermediate maintenance facilities.

The Marine Corps Family of Automatic Test Systems (ATS), formerly called Third Echelon Test Sets (TETS), provides automatic test program capability for use by technicians both in garrison and the forward edge of the battlefield; specifically in the areas of interactive electronic technical manuals, condition/predictive based maintenance, and embedded sensors and prognostics.  

Automatic Identification Technology (AIT) devices encompass a variety of read and write data storage technologies that are used to improve accuracy, timeliness, and handling.  These technologies provide near-real time Total Asset Visibility data used to influence critical decisions by Operational Commanders. AIT enhances our force in readiness by coordinating, synchronizing and automatically transferring data by means of barcodes, magnetic stripes, integrated circuit cards, optical memory cards, active Radio Frequency Identification (aRFID), and passive RFID (pRFID) tags, as well as the software required to create and manage the devices, read the information stored on them, and integrate that information with other logistics data.  The information on each device can range from a single part number to a self-contained database. These devices can be interrogated using a variety of means, including fixed infrastructures and portable systems.  The information obtained from those interrogations is provided electronically to various Automated Information Systems (AIS).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Funding supports research, development and testing of incremental product improvements, product interoperability and accreditation for Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) connectivity.
										 		
Technical Control Analysis Center (TCAC), consisting of the AN/UYQ-83 TCAC Remote Analysis Workstation (RAWS), AN/MYQ-9 TCAC Transportable Workstation, Multi-Level Security (MLS) and the One Roof system, is the focal point of Radio Battalions (RADBN), Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARFORSOC), and Fixed Wing Marine Electronic Attack Squadron (VMAQ) Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) operations.  TCAC automatically collects, stores, retrieves and plays back digital voice signals; fuses and analyzes SIGINT data from tactical, theater and national collectors and databases for dissemination to tactical commanders.  TCAC provides SIGINT analysis applications to deployable Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) units capable of directing and managing the technical and operational functions of other RADBN SIGINT/Electronic Warfare (EW) assets. TCAC provides termination of national, theater and tactical data networks for data exchange with the tactical SIGINT/EW assets, the Intelligence Analysis System (IAS), national databases, and provides USMC tactical SIGINT collection and analytical data into the Real-Time Regional Gateway (RTRG) and Distributed Common Ground System - Marine Corps (DCGS-MC).  

Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar (JSTARS) receives near-real-time Moving Target Indicator and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from the JSTARS E-8C aircraft.  JSTARS Common Ground Stations (CGS) and Joint Service Workstations (JSWS) process, display, exploit and support evaluation of information received.  In FY15 JSTARS will be subsumed into DCGS-MC (PE 0305208M). 

Tactical Remote Sensor Systems (TRSS) provides all weather direction, location determination, targeting, and tactical indications and warning of enemy activity in the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Commander's Area of Interest.  TRSS is an equipment suite consisting of three primary sub-systems:  Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS); Relay Systems; and monitoring systems.  The sensor systems include seismic/acoustic sensors, electro-magnetic sensors, and infrared (passive) sensors.  The relay systems include SATCOM retransmission systems.  The monitoring system includes the Sensor Monitoring imaging sensors group and Hand-Held Monitors (HHM).  The composition of the three sub-systems are comprised of several individual components.  Upgrading of individual components will occur on an as needed basis. TRSS 6.0 development improves the TRSS sensor management software in order to integrate TRSS sensor systems with theater-provided-equipment sensor systems in OEF and improve system interoperability.

Team Portable Collection System (TPCS) - is a semi-automated, man/team portable system providing intercept, collection, Direction-Finding (DF), reporting and collection management to MAGTF Commander. It provides special signals intercept, and DF capability and is modular, lightweight and team transportable. It provides the MAGTF Commander with a modular and scalable carry on/carry off suite of equipment which allows the system to exploit information from more technically advanced target sets.  TPCS is required to incorporate advanced SIGINT technology in order to allow the MAGTF Commander to maintain technological parity with the adversary.  TPCS is subsumed by the Tactical Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Collection System in FY14. 		
											
Wide Field of View Persistent Surveillance (WFVPS) is a Marine Corps UUNS (10-335UA) in response to a CENTCOM JUONS (CC-0424) call for a Wide Area Staring Sensor on-board an organic USMC small UAV supporting operations in Afghanistan. There is no additional funding for the WFVPS program beyond FY14.
	
MAGTF Secondary Imagery Dissemination System (MSIDS) Family of Systems (FoS) provides organic tactical digital imagery collection, transmission and receiving capability to the MAGTF Commander.  MSIDS is comprised of components necessary to enable Marines to capture, manipulate, annotate, transmit and receive images in Near Real Time (NRT), internally with subordinate commands that are widely separated throughout the areas of operation and externally with higher and adjacent commands.  MSIDS capability resides with the MAGTF G/S-2 sections and Ground Reconnaissance Battalions, Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalions, Infantry Battalion Scout Sniper Platoons and Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command. The MSIDS FoS extends the digital imaging capability to all echelons within the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), down to and including battalions and squadrons.  Captured images are capable of being forwarded throughout the MAGTF through the use of Base Station Workstation/Communication Interface (BW/CI), Out Station Workstation/Communication Interface (OW/CI) or existing C4ISR architecture.  Images can also be transmitted to the Tactical Exploitation Group (TEG) for more detailed processing and analysis.  The Video Exploitation Workstation (VEW) is used to import, manipulate, annotate still and video imager, create intelligence products, lift still frames from video, view multi-format TV signals and provide a field briefing capability. 

Intelligence Equipment Readiness (IER) supports rapid prototyping and integration of emerging technologies involving national systems data.  IER provides a responsive capability to alleviate Marine Corps intelligence systems shortfalls created by rapidly evolving technology, missions and threats.  The program provides for rapid technology insertion, training and logistics, and the time sensitive intelligence infrastructure requirements of Marine Corps Operating Forces and the theater and service intelligence organizations supporting those forces.  IER addresses requirements that span the entire Marine Corps Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Enterprise (MCISR-E).
					
Intelligence Analysis System, Family of Systems (IAS FoS) provides timely planning and all source fusion, analysis, and dissemination of intelligence across the Intelligence Community of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF). IAS FoS is a scalable system that supports all missions, and provides a tactical intelligence capability tailored to meet specific mission requirements. Advanced analytics provides improved linking of structured and unstructured data sources, data and information discovery, and improved interoperability of data and exchange amongst the existing toolset applications. Funding allows the IAS FoS to stay up-to-date with current technology (COTS/GOTS) that allows an increase in response time of intelligence analysis process, better quality intelligence products, and timely dissemination for units in all deployed environments.  The FY14 funding increase supports development of initial advanced analytics capability.  The FY15 funding decrease is due to completion of initial advanced analytics development.  

Radio Reconnaissance Equipment Program (RREP) provides the Radio Battalions (RADBNS), Radio Reconnaissance Platoons (RRP), and the Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARFORSOC) Direct Support Teams (DSTs) with mission unique Signals Intelligence/Ground Electronic Warfare (SIGINT/EW) Equipment suites. The SIGINT Suite 3 (SS-3) is comprised of technology and equipment necessary to prosecute advanced signals. RREP will insert a new Electronic Attack (EA) system into the RREP Family of Systems (FoS). The RRP and DST Marines are trained and equipped to support the full spectrum of Marine Expeditionary Unit Special Operations Capable (MEU SOC) mission profiles as well as provide real time, imbedded support to any special operations scenario. This provides the supported Commander greater flexibility in employing his SIGINT assets when the use of conventional RADBN assets are not feasible. RREP is upgrading the SS-3 using an evolutionary development approach that inserts the latest technology into the suite as it becomes mature. This enables the SS-3 to remain a current platform against emerging threats. RREP is subsumed by the Tactical Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Collection System (TSCS) in FY14. 

Counterintelligence (CI) and Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Equipment Program (CIHEP) provides the MAGTF with integrated, standardized, and interoperable information (automated data processing), communication, and specialized equipment to conduct the full spectrum of tactical CI/Force Protection to include Irregular Warfare, HUMINT, and technical collection operations.  CIHEP provides each CI/HUMINT Company (CIHCo) with a suite of equipment comprised of commercial-off-the-shelf, government-off-the-shelf, and non-developmental items (COTS/GOTS/NDI).  It integrates audio, video, imagery, communications, technical surveillance and computer equipment into lightweight, modular, scalable, deployable packages.  CIHEP enhances the capability to collect, receive, process, and disseminate CI/HUMINT information from overt, sensitive, technical, tactical, and Force Protection, in the service, joint, and combined forces area of operations.			
	
Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR) family conforms to the DoD Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) objectives of interoperability and commonality across the Services to receive and process near real-time intelligence data.  The Universal Serial Bus (USB) Embedded National Tactical Receiver (ENTR) system, the newest component of the IBR family, is an integral portion of 7 Programs of Record, providing a significant reduction in size and weight.  The USB ENTR provides access to IBS data via Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) broadcast channels delivering near real-time intelligence information within Combatant Commanders theater of operation allowing intelligence analysis to respond to accelerated operations cycles.  	

Communication Emitter Sensing and Attacking System (CESAS) has the mission to disrupt, degrade or deny detected adversarial communication emitters. CESAS covers the High Frequency (HF), Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) frequency ranges against enemy emitters using modern modulation schemes. CESAS allows flexible employment to conduct Electronic Attack (EA) while on the move or in a stationary position, thus optimizing the Commanders' ability to employ this asset for the greatest success of the mission. Decrease of $5.923M from FY14 to FY15 due to completion of most Engineering and Manufacturing Development activities associated with the CESAS II development.
	
Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) exploits current national reconnaissance systems and programs by examining both technical and operational capabilities, implementing training, and sponsoring concept demonstrations to directly support Marine Corps operating forces.  The goal is to pursue technologies which exploit data from national systems to enhance intelligence support to the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) and/or the supported Joint Task Force commander.

Tactical Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Collection System (TSCS):  TSCS incorporates Team Portable Collection System (TPCS) and Radio Reconnaissance Equipment Program (RREP) into a single effort beginning in FY14.  It provides modular, lightweight and team/man transportable/portable systems and components which provide signal intercept, collection, Direction-Finding (DF), reporting and collection management capability to MAGTF Commander. It provides the MAGTF Commander with a modular and scalable carry on/carry off suite of equipment which exploits information from more technically advanced target sets.  TSCS uses rapid technology insertion processes and procedures to incorporate advanced SIGINT technology to allow the MAGTF Commander to maintain technological superiority.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The AIM-9X (Sidewinder) short-range air-to-air missile is a long term evolution of the AIM-9 series of fielded missiles.  The AIM-9X missile program provides a launch and leave, air combat munition that uses passive infrared (IR) energy for acquisition and tracking of enemy aircraft and complements the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM).  Air superiority in the short-range air-to-air missile arena is essential and includes first shot, first kill opportunity against an enemy employing IR countermeasures.  The AIM-9X employs several components common with the AIM-9M (fuze, rocket motor and warhead).  Anti-Tamper features have been incorporated to protect improvements inherent in this design.  AIM-9X is a Post Milestone III, Acquisition Category IC joint service program with Navy lead.

The Block II program has entered into Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and the LRIP-3 contract was awarded in August 2013.  This budget line continues the development, test and integration of software updates to the missile and aircraft platform integration to ensure these capabilities perform in accordance with established requirements as documented in the Capabilities Production Document (CPD). 

The AIM-9X Block III builds upon the incremental acquisition strategy used to develop AIM-9X Block I and Block II to provide increased kinematics, lethality, enhanced IR Counter-Measure performance against emerging advanced threats, and improved Insensitive Munitions (IM) performance and will employ several components common with the AIM-9X Block II (advanced seeker, Advanced Optical Target Detector / datalink).

This program is funded under OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AIM-9X Block III builds upon the incremental acquisition strategy used to develop AIM-9X Block I and Block II to provide increased kinematic performance against emerging advanced threats, and improved Insensitive Munition (IM) performance. Block III includes design improvements to enhance performance capabilities of the missile and will employ several components common with the AIM-9X Block II (e.g. advanced seeker, Advanced Optical Target Detector / datalink).   This budget line item will fund the technology risk reduction, software development, hardware development, insensitive munitions improvements, test, and aircraft platform integration of AIM-9X Block III to ensure these capabilities perform in accordance with established requirements.  Risk reduction and Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) programs also comply with and address the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum Insensitive Munitions direction (11 February 2009) for AIM-9X IM technology insertion.  Applicable anti-tamper features already incorporated in the existing AIM-9X Block II to protect improvements inherent in design will be brought forward for AIM-9X Block III.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>Technical: FY15 funding increase supports Electronic Protection Improvement Program (EPIP) efforts.

Schedule:  The F/A-18E/F Operational Test (OT) schedule growth was driven by software fixes, which paused testing until May 2013.  Further testing delays were the result of sequestration, furlough, target aircraft grounding and the government shutdown.  Forecast Initial Operational Capability (IOC) dates were shifted consistent with the delay in the completion of OT.  Advanced EPIP AIM-120C7 is being divided into two software releases to permit fielding of incremental improvements against advanced electronic attack threats as soon as possible. Updated to reflect estimate of contract restructure dates pending receipt of proposal in mid February 2014.  Schedule growth for Basic and Advanced EPIP for AIM-120D due to additional scope to address Operational Test issues.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Future joint forces will be responsive, deployable, agile, versatile, lethal, survivable and sustainable.  The nation will need lift assets that can provide for assured access, decrease predictability and dwell time, and have the capacity to quickly deliver troops and equipment together in a manner that provides for unit integrity.  Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV) will provide Combatant Commanders high-speed, intra-theater sealift mobility with inherent cargo handling capability and the agility to achieve positional advantage over operational distances.  Not limited to major ports, the JHSV will be able to operate in austere port environments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The nation will need lift assets that can provide for assured access, decrease predictability and dwell time, and have the capacity to quickly deliver troops and equipment together in a manner that provides for unit integrity.   Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV) will provide combatant commanders high-speed intra-theater sealift mobility with inherent cargo handling capability and the agility to achieve positional advantage over operational distances.  Not limited to major ports, the JHSV will be able to operate in austere port environments.   The Joint High Speed Vessel is one of three programs in the Department's "Capital Account Pilot Program."

The primary objective of the T&amp;E program is to ensure the JHSV is effective and suitable for its intended mission.  The focus will be on reducing test time and cost through an appropriate combination of DT and OT events in order to achieve compatible objectives.  

DT&amp;E efforts include modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), design analysis, inspection, component testing, system level testing, demonstration, ship trials, and PDT&amp;T events.  The JHSV T&amp;E Program will coordinate DT&amp;E and OT&amp;E to bring the lead ship to Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in the most efficient and timely manner possible.

Operational testing will include an Operational Assessment (OA), Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E).  JHSV OT&amp;E will be conducted as Multi-service OT&amp;E events. 

The objective of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E) is to provide a timely and reasonable assessment of the survivability of the system as it progresses through its development and prior to full-rate production.  The program will utilize existing commercial and military technologies to modify commercial high-speed ferry designs for military use. LFT&amp;E is included in OT&amp;E.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Navy Multiband Terminal (NMT) Program is the required Navy component to the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) program for enhancing protected and survivable satellite communications to Naval forces.  The NMT system provides an increase in single service capability from 1.5 Megabits per second (Mbps) to 8 Mbps, increases the number of coverage areas and retains Anti-Jam/Low Probability of Intercept (AJ/LPI) protection characteristics.  It is compatible with today's Navy Low Data Rate/Medium Data Rate (LDR/MDR) terminals and will sustain the Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) architecture by providing connectivity across the spectrum of mission areas, to include land, air and naval warfare, special operations, strategic nuclear operations, strategic defense, theater missile defense, and space operations and intelligence.  The NMT system will replenish and improve on Navy terminal capabilities of the Military Strategic, Tactical &amp; Relay System (MILSTAR), Defense Satellite Communications System  (DSCS), Wideband Global Satellite (WGS) and Global Broadcast System (GBS).  The new system will equip the warfighters with the assured, jam resistant, secure communications as described in the joint AEHF satellite communications system and WGS Operational Requirements Documents (ORD).  The NMT will provide multiband Satellite Communications (SATCOM) capability for ship, submarine, and shore platforms.

The Joint Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) Network Integrated Control System (JMINI CS) is a legacy system that commenced in 1998. JMINI CS is a Navy-led, Joint-interest program providing integrated, dynamic, and centralized control of non-processed UHF MILSATCOM 5/25 kHz Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) and Demand Assigned Single Access (DASA) channels to maximize existing highly sought after SATCOM resources.  The system also provides decentralized web-based management of those resources for use as a situational awareness tool for Combatant Commanders, Global SATCOM Support Centers, and Regional SATCOM Support Centers.  The system is expected to operate well beyond the original 2015 End of Life (EoL) date to 2033.  The JMINI CS Program will perform concept development and exploration  to identify  cost-effective solutions to address multiple life cycle support issues, in order to minimize loss of service to the fleet.  The effort will involve evaluation, development, laboratory and integration testing of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) hardware and software to replace obsolete components or subsystems while maintaining interoperability with existing systems. 

Maritime Integrated Broadcast Service (MIBS)  (formerly Tactical Data Information Exchange Subsystem Broadcast (TADIXS-B)) Program Charter is to deliver Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) data to operational and tactical decision makers aboard United States Navy ships, shore headquarters, and other joint platforms.  It will provide means to disseminate organically derived data from Navy platforms to other  tactical, operational, and strategic users in theatre. MIBS provides the Navy a capability to deliver near real time data, enhancing the Common Operational Picture (COP), to support operations in all warfare areas, including: Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), Anti-Air Warfare (AAW), Anti-Surface Warfare (ASW), Undersea Warfare (USW), Electronic Warfare (EW). The program encompasses Navy IBS systems (Joint Tactical Terminal - Maritime (JTT-M)).  These systems will provide the Navy and other joint platforms with a coherent approach to fielding maritime IBS systems that takes advantage of all available pathways and services. 

The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) program provides for the development of the next generation Department of Defense (DoD) advanced narrowband communications satellite constellation. The current Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) Follow-On (UFO) constellation is projected to degrade below acceptable availability parameters in 2014. This MUOS Research Development Test &amp; Evaluation, Navy (RDT&amp;E,N) effort supports Full Operational Capability (FOC) in FY 2017.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Navy Multiband Terminal (NMT) Program is the required Navy component to the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Program for enhancing protected and survivable satellite communications to Naval forces.  The NMT system provides an increase in single service capability from 1.5 Megabits per second (Mbps) to 8 Mbps, increases the number of coverage areas, and retains Anti-Jam/Low Probability of Intercept (AJ/LPI) protection characteristics.  It is compatible with today's Navy Low Data Rate/Medium Data Rate (LDR/MDR) terminals and will sustain the Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) architecture by providing connectivity across the spectrum of mission areas, to include land, air and naval warfare, special operations, strategic nuclear operations, strategic defense, theater missile defense, and space operations and intelligence.  The NMT system will replenish and improve on Navy terminal capabilities of the Military Strategic, Tactical &amp; Relay System (MILSTAR), Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS), Wideband Global Satellite (WGS), and Global Broadcast System (GBS).  The new system will equip the warfighters with assured, jam resistant, secure communications as described in both the joint AEHF Satellite Communications System and the WGS Operational Requirement Documents (ORD).  Mission requirements specific to Navy operations, including threat levels and scenarios, are contained in the ORD.  The NMT will provide multiband Satellite Communications (SATCOM) capability for ship, submarine, and shore platforms.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) Network Integrated Control System (JMINI CS) is a legacy system that commenced in 1998. JMINI CS is a Navy-led, Joint interest program providing integrated, dynamic, and centralized control of non-processed UHF MILSATCOM 5/25 kHz Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) and Demand Assigned Single Access (DASA) channels to maximize existing highly sought after SATCOM resources used to support operational missions as well as joint training and tactical exercises. The system provides decentralized web-based management of those resources for use as a situational awareness tool for Combatant Commanders and SATCOM Support Centers. The JMINI CS is required to operate beyond the original End of Life (EoL) of 2015 in order to continue to support mission critical operations through at least 2033. The JMINI CS Program of Record (POR) will perform concept development and exploration to identify cost-effective solutions to address multiple life cycle support issues in order to address the increasing risk of an unrecoverable hardware or software failure, which would result in a loss of service for the fleet. The effort will involve evaluation, prototype development, laboratory and integration testing of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) hardware and software to replace obsolete components or subsystems while maintaining interoperability with existing systems.

(U)  Maritime Integrated Broadcast Service (MIBS)  (formerly Tactical Data Information Exchange Subsystem Broadcast (TADIXS-B)) program charter is to deliver Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) data to operational and tactical decision makers aboard United States Navy ships, shore headquarters, and other joint platforms.  It will provide means to disseminate organically derived data from Navy platforms to other  tactical, operational, and strategic users in theater. MIBS provides the Navy a capability to deliver near real time data, enhancing the Common Operational Picture (COP), to support operations in all warfare areas, including: Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), Anti-Air Warfare (AAW), Anti-Surface Warfare (ASW), Undersea Warfare (USW), Electronic Warfare (EW). The program encompasses Navy IBS systems (Joint Tactical Terminal - Maritime (JTT-M)).  These systems will provide the Navy and other joint platforms with a coherent approach to fielding maritime IBS systems that takes advantage of all available pathways and services.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

As a legacy system that commenced in 1998, JMINI CS is expected to operate well beyond the original 2015 End of Life (EoL) date to 2033.  The JMINI CS Program of Record (POR) will evaluate the most cost-effective solutions to address multiple life cycle support issues, in order to minimize loss of service to the fleet. The effort will involve evaluating Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) hardware and software, and conducting laboratory/integration testing to ensure proper functionality and interoperability.

MIBS: The Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT)  AN/USC-62 (JTT) will be upgraded, enhancing existing terminal capability to support the Common Integrated Broadcast (CIB), Common Message Format (CMF), and the National Security Agency (NSA) mandated Crypto Modernization Initiative (CMI). The upgrade requires integration testing to be completed by Space and Naval Warfare (SPAWAR) System Center Pacific personnel.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Consolidated Afloat Networks &amp; Enterprise Services (CANES) is the Navy's only Program of Record (POR) to replace existing afloat networks and provide the necessary infrastructure for applications, systems, and services required for the Navy to dominate the Cyber Warfare domain. CANES is the technical and infrastructure consolidation of existing, separately managed afloat networks including Integrated Shipboard Network Systems (ISNS), Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System - Maritime (CENTRIXS-M), Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Networks, and Submarine Local Area Network (SubLAN). These legacy afloat network designs are currently End of Life and CANES will replace these unaffordable and obsolete networks.

The fundamental goal of CANES is to bring Infrastructure and Platform as a Service, within which current and future iterations of Navy Tactical Network computing and storage capabilities will reside. CANES will provide complete infrastructure, inclusive of hardware, software, processing, storage, and end user devices for Unclassified, Coalition, Secret and SCI for all basic network services to a wide variety of Navy surface combatants, submarines, Maritime Operations Centers, and aircraft. In addition, hosted applications and systems inclusive of Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Information Operations, Logistics and Business domains require the CANES infrastructure to operate in the tactical environment. Integrating these applications and systems is accomplished through Application Integration (AI), the engineering process used to evaluate and validate compatibility between CANES and the Navy-validated applications, systems and services that will utilize the CANES infrastructure and services. Specific programs, such as Distributed Common Ground System - Navy (DCGS-N), Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M), Naval Tactical Command Support System (NTCSS), and Undersea Warfare Decision Support System (USW-DSS), are dependent on the CANES Common Computing Environment (CCE) to field, host, and sustain their capability because they no longer provide their own hardware. CANES requires that Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) field prior to or concurrently with CANES due to the architectural reliance between the two programs.  

CANES will develop updates on a rolling four year hardware baseline and a two year software baseline. CANES is based on the overarching concept of reducing the number of afloat network baselines and providing enhanced efficiency through a single engineering focus on integrated technical solutions. This will allow for streamlined acquisition, contracting test events, and significant lifecycle efficiencies through consolidation of multiple current configuration management baselines, logistics, and training efforts into a unified support structure. Platform Sets 1, 2, 3, and 4 define phases of CANES system development efforts.  Each platform set consists of different ship class design baselines.

In FY 2015, CANES RDT&amp;E investment will support the developmental efforts for Technical Insertion (TI) software baseline.  Perform systems engineering efforts to complete functional baselines and updates to technical data packages.  Continue testing events at Enterprise Engineering and Certification (E2C) laboratory for TI software baseline.  Perform Developmental Testing (DT) and Follow-On Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E) for force level platforms. Achieve Full Deployment Decision (FDD).  

The Communications Automation Program - This project is a continuing program that provides for automation and communications upgrades for Fleet tactical users. It includes Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) and High Frequency Internet Protocol/Sub Network Relay.

ADNS is the method by which tactical Navy units transfer Internet Protocol (IP) data to Navy and Department of Defense communities on the Global Information Grid (GIG). ADNS serves as a gateway to enable joint and coalition interoperability for these tactical assets and ensures GIG connectivity. ADNS allows unclassified, secret, top secret traffic, and various joint, allied, and coalition services to reconnect to the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) ashore via radio paths and pier connectivity.  

In FY 2015, ADNS RDT&amp;E investment will support continued interface design development and integration with network applications, development of Line-of-sight (LOS) Link, DISN integration, development of Cipher-Text (CT) piers. Also in FY2015, study efforts will begin with the intention of integrating ADNS into the Joint Aerial Layer Network - Maritime (JALN-M) system.  JALN-M is the Navy implementation that provides network connectivity in areas that have limited or denied Satellite Communications (SATCOM).  ADNS study efforts will include addressing network management, intra and inter domain routing, Quality of Service (QoS), and Concept of Operations discussions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Impacts resulting from operational ship availability timelines for the CANES Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) and Follow-On Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E) test platforms caused the Unit Level DT1, Unit Level DT2, IOT&amp;E and Force Level DT and Force Level FOT&amp;E test events to be re-phased.  The delays to the ship availability timeline also caused IOC to be re-phased based on IOC definition in the program's Capability Development Document (CDD) for IOC to be declared once first installation is completed.  CANES development of Platform Sets 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4 has been re-phased to include development in FY 2014 to align with ship installation schedules of platforms added to the CANES Target Inventory Objective.  CANES Limited Deployment re-phased to reflect Limited Deployment authorization provided at Milestone C.

The ADNS INC III Submarine Verification of the Correction of Deficiencies (VCD) Report has been added in 4QFY13 to finalize the Operational Test report required by COMOPTEVFOR (COTF).

The ADNS program will continue system development efforts for interface design development and integration with network applications and Defense Information Systems Network (DISN), future SATCOM, JALN-M and Radio Frequency (RF) paths.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project unit is a continuing program that provides for automation and communications upgrades for Fleet tactical users.

Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) provides routing, switching, baseband, configuration and monitoring capabilities for interconnecting naval, coalition and joint enclaves worldwide. ADNS utilizes off the shelf equipment and network protocols as specified by the Joint Technical Architecture. ADNS Increment (INC) II provides capabilities of load balancing, radio frequency restoral, initial quality of service to include application prioritization, initial traffic management, and enhancements designed to maximize use of available bandwidth for surface, shore, and airborne platforms. ADNS INC III converges all Navy tactical voice, video, and data requirements into a converged IP data stream. ADNS INC III interoperates with higher bandwidth satellites, supporting up to 25 mega bytes per second (Mbps) of throughput on unit level ships and up to 50 Mbps on force level ships. INC III architecture also incorporates an IPv4/IPv6 dual stack and a Cipher Text security architecture to align to joint and coalition networks, in addition to greater security utilizing the High Assurance Internet Protocol (IP) Encryptor (HAIPE) devices. ADNS INC III serves as the Navy tactical interface for IP Networking with Joint Tactical Radio System, and Advanced Extremely High Frequency to include Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES). Starting in FY2015, ADNS will serve as the Navy tactical interface for IP Networking for the JALN-M system.  ADNS will investigate emerging technologies to integrate with additional Department of Defense C4I Programs to improve interstrike group networking and extend the network to the tactical edge.

FY15 funds will be used for continued interface design development and integration with network application, development of Line-of-sight (LOS) Link, Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) integration, and development of Cipher-Text (CT) Piers. Also in FY2015, study efforts will begin with the intention of integrating ADNS into the JALN-M system.  JALN-M is the Navy implementation that provides network connectivity in areas that have limited or denied Satellite Communications (SATCOM).  ADNS study efforts will include addressing network management, intra and inter domain routing, Quality of Service (QoS), and Concept of Operations discussions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

INC I , II , and III will use competitively awarded contracts to implement changes consistent with acquisition initiatives. ADNS leverages Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) products while capitalizing on acquisition reform initiatives to achieve material savings in the logistics, installation, integration and training areas. Where feasible, differing types of advantageous contract vehicles will be used to provide flexibility, decrease contract administrative costs, and encourage acquisition streamlining through the use of COTS/GOTS products.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>ADNS - Included in the ADNS program goals are the improvements to bandwidth throughput, connectivity to multiple Radio Frequency (RF) paths, greater security, and system capability delivered within a smaller form factor. The ADNS program will, at a minimum, provide bandwidth throughput enhancements resulting in an increase from 2 megabytes per
second (Mbps) to 25 Mbps. ADNS will also provide the ability to transport data across multiple paths simultaneously vice the current limitations of single or secondary paths.  ADNS will provide greater security posture by encrypting each enclave, and securing the core via Cipher Text.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Consolidated Afloat Networks &amp; Enterprise Services (CANES) is the Navy's only Program of Record (POR) to replace existing afloat networks and provide the necessary infrastructure for applications, systems, and services required for the Navy to dominate the Cyber Warfare domain. CANES is the technical and infrastructure consolidation of existing, separately managed afloat networks including Integrated Shipboard Network Systems (ISNS), Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System - Maritime (CENTRIXS-M), Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Networks, and Submarine Local Area Network (SubLAN). These legacy afloat network designs are currently End of Life and CANES will replace these unaffordable and obsolete networks.

The fundamental goal of CANES is to bring Infrastructure and Platform as a Service, within which current and future iterations of Navy Tactical Network computing and storage capabilities will reside. CANES will provide complete infrastructure, inclusive of hardware, software, processing, storage, and end user devices for Unclassified, Coalition, Secret and SCI for all basic network services to a wide variety of Navy surface combatants, submarines, Maritime Operations Centers, and aircraft. In addition, hosted applications and systems inclusive of Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Information Operations, Logistics and Business domains require the CANES infrastructure to operate in the tactical environment. Integrating these applications and systems is accomplished through Application Integration (AI), the engineering process used to evaluate and validate compatibility between CANES and the Navy-validated applications, systems and services that will utilize the CANES infrastructure and services. Specific programs, such as Distributed Common Ground System - Navy (DCGS-N), Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M), Naval Tactical Command Support System (NTCSS), and Undersea Warfare Decision Support System (USW-DSS), are dependent on the CANES Common Computing Environment (CCE) to field, host, and sustain their capability because they no longer provide their own hardware. CANES requires that Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) field prior to or concurrently with CANES due to the architectural reliance between the two programs.  

CANES will develop updates on a rolling four year hardware baseline and a two year software baseline. CANES is based on the overarching concept of reducing the number of afloat network baselines and providing enhanced efficiency through a single engineering focus on integrated technical solutions. This will allow for streamlined acquisition, contracting test events, and significant lifecycle efficiencies through consolidation of multiple current configuration management baselines, logistics, and training efforts into a unified support structure. Platform Sets 1, 2, 3, and 4 define phases of CANES system development efforts.  Each platform set consists of different ship class design baselines.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CANES is an ACAT IAM MAIS program. The program office is employing a multiple-phase, multiple-award down-select contract strategy to reduce program risks and maintain competition in both design development and production during contract performance. Two competitive contracts were awarded to design, develop, and deliver all hardware and the associated operating system, virtualization and other commercial software needed to deliver a functional network. The Limited Deployment (LD) contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman (NG) on 2QFY12. Milestone C achieved in 1QFY13. In 3QFY14, a separate full and open indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract (MAC) production contract will be awarded to support future production.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Early RDT&amp;E investment and sustainment of dual design contractors through the development phase reduced Total Ownership Cost (TOC) from Milestone B to Milestone C.  Cost avoidance throughout the life of the program is based on 1) reducing the number of networks through the use of mature, certified, cross domain technologies; 2) reducing the infrastructure footprint and associated costs for hardware afloat; and 3) providing increased capability to meet current and projected war fighter requirements.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) ensures the protection of Navy and joint cyberspace systems from exploitation and attack. Cyberspace systems include wired and wireless telecommunications systems, Information Technology (IT) systems, and the content processed, stored, or transmitted therein. ISSP includes the protection of the Navy's National Security Systems and Information (NSSI). ISSP must be rapid, predictive, adaptive, and tightly coupled to cyberspace technology. Through modeling and simulation of Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial cyberspace systems evolution, ISSP provides architectures, products, and services based on mission impacts, information criticality, threats, vulnerabilities, and required defensive countermeasure capabilities.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) Research Development Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts provide Information Assurance (IA) and Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) solutions to protect the forward deployed, bandwidth-limited, highly mobile Naval information subscriber and the associated command, control, and communications required to achieve the integrated military advantage from Net-Centric operations.  ISSP addresses engineering design, development, modeling, simulation, test, and evaluation for the unique IA challenges associated with dispersed, bandwidth limited, and forward-tactical connected US Navy communications systems.
 
This project includes a rapidly evolving design and application engineering effort to modernize cryptographic equipment and ancillaries with state-of-the-art replacements to counter evolving and increasingly sophisticated threats, in accordance with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6510 requirements. Communication Security (COMSEC) and Transmission Security (TRANSEC) evolution are from stand-alone dedicated devices to embedded modules incorporating National Security Agency (NSA) approved cryptographic engines, loaded with the certified algorithms and key, and interconnected via industry-defined interfaces. This includes the Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) capability requirements document for the development of Content Based Encryption (CBE) and in the implementation of the Committee for National Security Systems (CNSS) Policy 15 on the "Use of Public Standards for the Sharing of Information among National Security Systems."
 
In addition to protecting national security information, ISSP RDT&amp;E efforts provide enterprise-wide assurance for statutorily protected information, such as the 107 protected data types described in the federal task force on Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and in DoD Manual 5200.01 Volume 4. ISSP RDT&amp;E efforts must also provide solutions to the most advanced state-sponsored and criminal-intent Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), including those to Platform Information Technology (PIT), weapons systems, Industrial Control Systems (ICS), and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA).

ISSP RDT&amp;E efforts provide dynamic risk-managed IA solutions to the Navy information infrastructure, not just security devices placed within a network. Extensive effort will be placed on rapidly providing solutions required for the new DoD Instruction (DoDI) 8500.01, (CNSS) Instruction No. 1253, and National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53 IA control set, focused primarily on espionage and sabotage capable, state-sponsored APTs.  Additional efforts include the implementation of data object security labeling and provenance metadata, also required by DoDI 8500.01, which is a major enabler for cross-domain data sharing. Few technology areas change as fast as telecommunications and computers; resulting in the need for continuous evaluation, development, and testing of IA products and cyber defense strategies. ISSP efforts in support of this environment include developing or applying: (1) new secure voice and secure data prototypes and protocols; (2) technology for a new Suite B capable programmable COMSEC and TRANSEC devices and software; (3) security appliances and software for switched and routed networks; (4) technology to interconnect networks of dissimilar classification and need-to-know, known respectively as Cross Domain Solutions (CDS) and virtually secure environments (VSE); (5) techniques for assuring code and data residing in and transiting the Navy's computing base and information store;  (6) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and associated access control technologies such as smartcards and similar security tokens; (7) Key Management (KM) devices such as Simple Key Loaders (SKL), COMSEC Material Work Stations (CMWS), and Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) equipment (Client Management (MGC)/Advanced Key Processor (AKP) MGC/AKPs, High Assurance Protocol Equipment, Delivery Only Client (DOC) and Next Generation devices; (8) technologies that provide assured and persistent Identity and Access Management (IdAM) for persons, virtual instances, and connected devices; (9) technologies for assuring cloud and mobile operating environments and devices; (10) defensive cyber security technologies required to support strategic and tactical cyber operations in an Anti-Access, Area-Denial (A2AD) hostile environment; and (11) Cyber Remediation capabilities that will accelerate the Navy's ability to prevent, constrain and mitigate cyber-attacks and critical vulnerabilities as well as provide greater resiliency, awareness, data analytics, redundancy and diversity into the Navy's Defense-in-Depth (DiD) strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The goal of the Information Assurance (IA) program is to ensure the continued protection of Navy and joint information and information systems from hostile exploitation and attack. ISSP activities address the triad of Defense Information Operations: protection, detection, and reaction. Evolving attack sensing (detection), warning, and response (reaction) responsibilities extend far beyond the traditional ISSP role in protection or Information Systems Security (INFOSEC). Focused on the highly mobile forward deployed subscriber, the Navy's adoption of Network-Centric Warfare (NCW) places demands upon the ISSP, as the number of users expands significantly and the criticality of their use escalates. Today, the ISSP protects an expanding core of services critical to the effective performance of the Navy's mission.

The rapid rate of change in the underlying commercial and government information infrastructures makes the provision of security an increasingly complex and dynamic problem.  IA technology mix and deployment strategies must evolve quickly to meet rapidly evolving threats and vulnerabilities. No longer can information security be divorced from the information infrastructure. The ISSP enables the Navy's war fighter to trust in the availability, integrity, authentication, privacy, and non-repudiation of information.

This project includes funds for advanced technology development, test and evaluation of naval information systems security based on leading edge technologies that will improve information assurance (e.g., situational awareness and information infrastructure protection) across all command echelons to tactical units afloat and war fighters ashore.  This effort will provide the research to develop a secure seamless interoperable, common operational environment of networked information systems in the battle space and for monitoring and protecting the information infrastructure from malicious activities. This effort will provide naval forces a secure capability and basis in its achievement of protection from unauthorized access and misuse, and optimized IA resource allocations in the information battle space. This program will also develop core technology to: (1) improve network infrastructure resistance and resiliency to attacks; (2) enable the rapid development and certification of security-aware applications and information technologies in accordance with the Common Criteria for IA and IA-enabled information technology products by the National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Instructions; and (3) measure the effectiveness and efficiency of IA defensive capabilities under naval environments.

The program will develop common architectural frameworks that facilitate integration of network security capabilities, enable effective seamless interoperation, and contribute to a common consistent picture of the networked environment with respect to information assurance and security. This effort will address the need for a common operational picture for IA, as well as assessment of security technology critical to the success of the mission. This effort will also initiate requirements definition for situational awareness capabilities to support computer network defense in a highly-distributed, homogeneous, and heterogeneous networks including mobile and embedded networked devices. This effort also includes the architectural definition of situational awareness and visualization capabilities to support active computer network defense and support underlying data mining and correlation tools.  This includes addressing the capability to remotely manage and securely control the configurations of network security components to implement changes in real time or near real time. Program will also initiate requirements definition for secure coalition data exchange and interoperation among security levels and classifications, and ensure approaches address various security level technologies as well as emerging architectural methods of providing interoperability across different security levels. Examine multi-level aware applications and technologies including databases, web browsers, routers/switches, etc. Efforts will also initiate infrastructure protection efforts as the Navy develops network centric architectures and warfare concepts, ensuring an evolutionary development of security architectures and products for IA that addresses Navy infrastructure requirements. IA will ensure the architectures  evolve to provide proper protection as technology, DoD missions, and threats continuously evolve. IA includes defensive protections as well as intrusion monitoring (sensors), warning mechanisms, and response capabilities in the architecture. Ensure the unique security and performance requirements of tactical systems, including those operating various security levels are addressed. Also, the program will initiate the efforts to conceptualize new network centric warfare technology to protect our assets, such as secure network gateways, routers, components and tools that improve the survivability of Navy networks. Last, IA will provide systems security engineering, certification and accreditation support for high-confidence naval information systems and ensure certification and accreditation approaches are consistent with Navy and DoD requirements.

FY15 : Continue development of new network security demands addressing nation-state level sponsored activity. Incorporate security services to thwart Denial of Network Service (DNS) attacks, distributed denial of service, botnet and other sophisticated attacks.

Increase in funding supports the Weaselboard Program which is addressing an urgent Speed to Fleet initiative to assess the health and protection of shipboard systems and identify anomalous activity with Shipboard Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program funds the development of a single ship-based radar suite for ballistic missile treaty verification. Cobra Judy provides monitoring and verification of specific aspects of United States treaties with other countries. It is necessary to replace the current Cobra Judy to prevent any potential gap in coverage. Prior studies have indicated that a ship-based radar replacement is the most timely and cost effective solution. This program is joint-funded.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element supports the Navy's requirements in meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) space-based remote sensors.  These requirements include commitments to satellite, sensor, and operational demonstration/development activities as well as the transition to fleet applications associated with three satellite programs: 1) the joint Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), 2) the jointly funded Coriolis satellite which includes Navy Satellite Based Wind Speed (WindSat) and Air Force Solar Mass Ejection Imager instruments, 3) the Geodetic/geophysical Satellite (GEOSAT) Follow-On 2 (GFO-2) altimetry satellite funded entirely by Navy.
  
The Navy METOC Space-Based Sensing Capabilities project provides for Navy participation in Navy/Air Force cooperative efforts leading to DMSP sensor development, and specifically participation in the calibration and validation of instruments and delivery of satellite products to the fleet.  The passive microwave instruments carried on the DMSP satellites provide global and atmospheric data of direct operational relevance, including sea surface wind, sea ice, and precipitation.  WindSat is a partnered program that meets multiple naval remote sensing requirements and provides a significant risk reduction for the Joint Polar Orbiting Satellite System (JPSS) satellites' Microwave Imaging Sensor instrument.
  
The GEOSAT Follow-On project, and GFO-2 program, will provide a polar-orbiting satellite that measures sea surface topography using a precise altimeter.
Both the GEOSAT Follow-On and Navy METOC Support (Space) projects fulfill Navy's obligation to develop naval service-unique, mission critical space-based METOC technology. 

Starting in FY12 the Navy has delayed all GFO-2 altimetry satellite development efforts until FY 2017.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Meteorology and Oceanography (METOC) Space-Based Sensing Capabilities project provides for the naval service's unique sensor development efforts Navy Satellite Based Wind Speed (WindSat) and Navy participation in the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Special Sensor Microwave/Imager and Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder calibration/validation efforts in support of the fleet operational requirements.  WindSat, an initiative begun in 1997, is a partnered program that meets multiple naval remote sensing requirements and provides a significant risk reduction for the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) satellites' Conical Microwave Imaging Sensor instrument. The passive microwave instruments carried on DMSP and future JPSS satellites provide global oceanic and atmospheric data of direct operational relevance, including sea surface wind speed, sea ice, and precipitation.
 
The METOC Space-Based Sensing Capabilities project ensures the naval service's operational requirements are satisfied primarily through demonstration of technologies for inclusion on operational constellations such as DMSP,  the JPSS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES).  These efforts fulfill naval service unique requirements that are not funded within the DMSP, JPSS or GOES programs, and are in accordance with current inter-agency agreements.

The primary focus of the FY 2015 request is to continue assessment of other national, commercial, and foreign earth observing satellite system's sensor data for use in Navy Atmospheric and Oceanographic Prediction Models.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Naval service unique, space based Meteorology and Oceanography (METOC) requirements. Particular sensors or data sources with unique naval service mission needs are targeted to accelerate acquisition or ensure threshold accomplishment of Joint or converged national program plans. Navy Satellite Based Wind Speed provides risk reduction data and developmental technology that the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) program will use in the development of the Conical Microwave Imager Sounder (CMIS). CMIS will collect global microwave radiometry and sounding data to produce microwave imagery and other meteorological and oceanographic data. CMIS can be viewed as the follow-on instrument to the Special Sensor Microwave (SSM) instruments Navy developed for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. These CMIS sensors will be acquired as part of the JPSS architecture which supports these Navy requirements in the future. Maintenance of rigorous sensor calibration and data validation for operational SSM instruments continues along with algorithm development in support of fleet applications. The Advanced Altimeter technologies will improve radar altimeter resolution and aerial coverage to support Navy requirements for sea surface topography measurement in the littorals.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Goal:  Provide precise and near real-time METOC forecasting to the warfighter using existing and future space-based satellite derived data, including ocean surface wind speed, rain rate, ice concentration, and soil moisture measurements.
Metric:  Provide precise ocean surface wind speed within plus or minus 2.0 meters per second, the rain over land and ocean rate within plus or minus 5.0 millimeters per hour, soil moisture measurements within plus or minus 10%; and sea ice concentrations within plus or minus 10%.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides a Polar-orbiting satellite (the Geodetic/geophysical Satellite (GEOSAT) Follow-On 2 (GFO-2)) that measures sea surface topography using a precise altimeter.  Mission data will be collected by the Spacecraft Operations Center and passed to the Payload Operations Center, and Altimetry Data Fusion Center, which are co-located at the Naval Oceanographic Office, Stennis Space Center, MS.  Mission data is used in global and regional scale ocean forecast models.  GFO-2 will provide a capability for precise mesoscale (e.g., fronts and eddies) and basin-scale oceanography.  This capability will support tactical anti-submarine warfare, mine warfare, naval special warfare mission planning, tactical decision aids, and sensor/weapon performance prediction.  GFO-2 will also provide an undersea warfare battlespace characterization capability that supports submarine detectability, weapon settings, sound velocity profiles, tropical cyclone intensity, and track forecasts.
 
GFO-2 data will be made freely available to other agencies, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, who value its input to studies involving global warming and climate change, including El Nino Southern Oscillation effects.  
Ocean topography data was previously provided by GEOSAT from 1985 until the satellite failed in January 1990.  The Geodetic/geophysical Satellite Follow-On satellite was launched in February 1998 and deorbited in November 2008.  The GEOSAT GFO-2 will provide for the continuation of this capability. 

The Navy has delayed all Geodetic/geophysical Satellite (GEOSAT) Follow-On 2 (GFO-2) altimetry satellite development efforts until FY 2017.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Goal:  Provide Meteorology and Oceanography (METOC) GEOSAT derived mission data to improve the accuracy of global and regional scale oceanographic forecast models.
Metric:  Anti-Submarine Warfare capability is highly dependent on the operational environment.  GEOSAT Follow-On 1 demonstrated that a space based altimeter provided the equivalent of approximately a 500-fold increase in available subsurface observations and a 10-fold increase in available surface observations, critical to characterization of the ocean environment and oceanographic modeling.  War-gaming models show that this increased knowledge of the subsurface acoustic propagation resulting from one altimeter reduced the probability of losing a ship to subsurface attack from 80% to 20% for various scenarios.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports the Tactical Control System (TCS), a standards-based system, that provides interoperability and commonality for Command and Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance interfaces of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). TCS software, operating on Ground Control Station hardware, utilizes North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreements (STANAG)-4586 architecture communicating across a Tactical Common Data Link.  

TCS provides a full range of scalable UAS capabilities from passive receipt of air vehicle and payload data to full air vehicle and payload command and control. TCS offers the war fighter a common core operating environment to simultaneously receive, process, and disseminate data from different UAS types for intelligence, reconnaissance, surveillance, and combat assessment.

This program supports enhancements and updates to TCS in order to continue to meet supported air vehicle enhancements, incorporation of new technologies that will be used to enhance overall system performance, incorporate new payloads and payload capabilities (such as advanced sensors and weapons), incorporate multi-vehicle control, incorporate NATO  STANAG-4586 and Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence enhancements, and alignment with OSD direction for UAS control segments.

TCS software is incorporated into the MQ-8 Fire Scout system and fields in conjunction with MQ-8. TCS software addresses MQ-8 requirements validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in the VTUAV Capability Production Document (May 2007) and multiple Joint Emergent Operational Need/Urgent Operational Needs statements.  TCS supported by a Operational Requirements Document (Feb 2000).  

TCS maximizes the use of contractor and government off-the-shelf hardware and software whenever possible and incorporates software/hardware enhancements where appropriate to maintain growth potential and minimize hardware and operating system dependence.  TCS software is interoperable and is compliant with the OSD Command and Control, Communications, Intelligence Joint Technical Architecture, Distributed Common Ground System standards, Global Command and Control System (GCCS), and NATO standards.  TCS hardware and software upgrades will support the Navy's Common Control System migration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Effective FY 2014 the Increment II Advanced Analytics/All Source capability was realigned to Intelligence Analysis System (PE 0206625M). Effective FY 2015 the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) capability (PE 0206625M) is subsumed by DCGS-MC.  Topographic Production Capability (TPC) and Tactical Exploitation Group (TEG) have merged into DCGS-MC. Funding for these efforts under PE 0206625M has been realigned to DCGS-MC PE 0305208M effective FY 2011.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>DCGS-MC, in compliance with the Department of Defense DCGS Family of Systems (FOS) concept, is a service-level effort to migrate select USMC Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) processing and exploitation capabilities into a single, integrated, net-centric baseline that will be interoperable with other services and agencies.
Multiple functional capability sets will be configured to support Marine intelligence analysts across the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  The goal of DCGS-MC is to make external and internal ISR data more visible, accessible, and understandable.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Distributed Common Ground System-Marine Corps DCGS-MC, in compliance with the Department of Defense DCGS Family of Systems concept, is a Service-level effort to migrate select USMC Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) processing and exploitation capabilities into a single, integrated, net-centric baseline that will be interoperable with other Services and Agencies.

Multiple functional capability sets will be configured to support Marine intelligence analysts across the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF). The goal of DCGS-MC is to make external and internal ISR data more visible, accessible, and understandable. The funding decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is attributed to the achievement of Milestone C in 2QFY14 and reduced Engineering and Manufacturing Development efforts for Increment 1 (Geospatial Intelligence) in FY 2014.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Distributed Common Ground System - Navy (DCGS-N) is the Navy's portion of the Under Secretary of Defense, Intelligence (USD (I)) DCGS-N Family of Systems (FoS). The Department of Defense (DoD) has defined a DCGS architecture that will be compatible and interoperable across all of the Services' Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems and operations. DCGS accesses and ingests data from space borne, airborne, subsurface, and surface ISR collection assets, intelligence databases and intelligence producers. This collected data is shared across a Joint enterprise using the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) and in time, the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) to enhance access and sharing of ISR information across Joint forces through the use of common enterprise standards and services. DCGS FoS supports Joint Task Force (JTF)-level and below combat operations with critical intelligence for battle management and information dominance across the full spectrum of operations, including peace, conflict, war, and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). DCGS is a cooperative effort between the services, agencies, and DoD to provide systems capable of receiving, processing, exploiting, and disseminating data from airborne and national reconnaissance platforms. DCGS-N core components include the Analyst Work Station from the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) - Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (I3), Generic Area Limitation Environment (GALE) Signal Intelligence (SIGINT), Common Geo-positioning Services (CGS), Image Product Library (IPL), Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB), Joint Concentrator Architecture (JCA) and Track Management Services. 

The DCGS-N system represents the integration of 1) The processing and exploitation of tactical and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) and Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); 2) Precision target geopositioning, mensuration, and imagery dissemination capabilities; 3) Selected national IMINT requirements and processing capabilities from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA); and 4) Sharing of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Targeting and Command and Control information via DIB, DI2E, and Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) standards with a wide range of customers (e.g., Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M)), Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS), and many others. 

The DCGS-N Enterprise Node (DEN), which incorporates current DIB standards and DI2E policy, facilitating interoperability and data sharing among the DCGS FoS. DCGS-N ensures compliance with the DoD DCGS network architecture.  

The Navy is focusing on establishing an ISR Enterprise way ahead that will emphasize a reach back strategy to provide intelligence products to support deployed ship and shore operations. The Navy will also migrate to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that requires the development, integration, and testing of a Maritime ISR Enterprise capability, development and migration of ISR SOA applications, and development and integration to leverage a Common Computing Environment (CCE). Additionally, DCGS-N will become the focal point for migration of Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) fusion and analysis (MFAS) tool applications for the Navy. 

DCGS-N Increment 2 addresses a critical shortfall in Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TCPED) capability and capacity to support operational, tactical planning, and execution across the full range of joint military operations. Existing TCPED shortfalls will be exacerbated by planned Navy, Joint, and Allied fielding of new Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms. Currently fielded systems provide localized processing capabilities that will be overwhelmed in future years without a significant change in the way the Navy processes, exploits and disseminates intelligence data. DCGS-N Increment 2 will deliver all source fusion and analytical capabilities; provide Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) capabilities and integrate Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TCPED) capabilities to improve the use and analysis of sensor and platform data. Distributed Common Ground System- Navy (DCGS-N) Increment 2 will be based on an enterprise solution to share this information across commands, services, and agencies to promote shared situational awareness. DCGS-N Increment 2 consists of multiple releases. The first release provides an enhanced Navy Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) enterprise that converges and builds on the DCGS-N Increment 1 and Maritime Domain Awareness Enterprise Nodes; leverages the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E); is compliant with the Common Computing Environment (CCE); federates ISR and TCPED workflow and production improving throughput through automation; exploits new and evolving unmanned systems sensor data; provides Multi-Intelligence (Multi-INT) cross-queuing and modular tools. The second release enhances afloat ISR capabilities by providing a set of software centric tools providing Multi-INT fusion and analysis, behavior prediction and intelligent knowledge management designed to operate in disconnected or denied communications environment. Follow-on releases will be developed based on Fleet requirements.

Intelligence Carry-On Program (ICOP) is a suite of multi-source intelligence and analytical capabilities which includes an integrated Three-Dimensional (3-D) operational picture displaying intelligence and other data sources to provide a richer and more complete picture of the battle space on Unit Level platforms. The system supports a full motion video capability that receives, processes, exploits, and disseminates organic and non-organic data as well as the ability to process and correlate Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) and external Communications Intelligence (COMINT Externals). It integrates mature Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) applications with shared storage and communication paths to reach back to the DCGS-N Enterprise Node (DEN), and to provide data sharing to the Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) and national ISR systems, making tactical users a part of the larger ISR enterprise.  

In FY15, DCGS-N Increment 1 will verify and correct discrepancies discovered during the Block 2 Follow-On Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E).   

In FY15, DCGS-N Increment 2 will contribute to the development of the Program Executive Officer, Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (PEO C4I) prototype system. Increment 2 will conduct engineering reviews in accordance with agile development methodologies. 
 
In FY15, ICOP will complete all acquisition and engineering of development integration activities pertaining to formal testing efforts in preparation for fielding of Program of Record (PoR) systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Cost-To-Complete reflects DCGS-N Increment 2 only. DCGS-N Increment 1 funding is complete in FY15. DCGS-N Increment 2 is continuing as it currently is in pre-acquisition activities and a Life Cycle Cost Estimate (LCCE) is scheduled to complete in FY16 as part of Milestone B.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Distributed Common Ground System - Navy (DCGS-N) is the Navy's portion of the Under Secretary of Defense, Intelligence (USD (I)) DCGS-N Family of Systems (FoS). The Department of Defense (DoD) has defined a DCGS architecture that will be compatible and interoperable across all of the Services' Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems and operations. DCGS accesses and ingests data from space borne, airborne, subsurface, and surface ISR collection assets, intelligence databases and intelligence producers. This collected data is shared across a Joint enterprise using the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) and in time, the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) to enhance access and sharing of ISR information across Joint forces through the use of common enterprise standards and services. DCGS FoS supports Joint Task Force (JTF)-level and below combat operations with critical intelligence for battle management and information dominance across the full spectrum of operations, including peace, conflict, war, and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). DCGS is a cooperative effort between the services, agencies, and DoD to provide systems capable of receiving, processing, exploiting, and disseminating data from airborne and national reconnaissance platforms. DCGS-N core components include the Analyst Work Station from the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) - Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (I3), Generic Area Limitation Environment (GALE) Signal Intelligence (SIGINT), Common Geo-positioning Services (CGS), Image Product Library (IPL), Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB), Joint Concentrator Architecture (JCA) and Track Management Services. 

The DCGS-N system represents the integration of 1) The processing and exploitation of tactical and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) and Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); 2) Precision target geopositioning, mensuration, and imagery dissemination capabilities; 3) Selected national IMINT requirements and processing capabilities from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA); and 4) Sharing of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Targeting and Command and Control information via DIB, DI2E, and Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) standards with a wide range of customers (e.g., Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M)), Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS), and many others. 

The DCGS-N Enterprise Node (DEN), which incorporates current DIB standards and DI2E policy, facilitating interoperability and data sharing among the DCGS FoS. DCGS-N ensures compliance with the DoD DCGS network architecture.  

The Navy is focusing on establishing an ISR Enterprise way ahead that will emphasize a reach back strategy to provide intelligence products to support deployed ship and shore operations. The Navy will also migrate to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that requires the development, integration, and testing of a Maritime ISR Enterprise capability, development and migration of ISR SOA applications, and development and integration to leverage a Common Computing Environment (CCE). Additionally, DCGS-N will become the focal point for migration of Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) fusion and analysis (MFAS) tool applications for the Navy. 

DCGS-N Increment 2 addresses a critical shortfall in Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TCPED) capability and capacity to support operational, tactical planning, and execution across the full range of joint military operations. Existing TCPED shortfalls will be exacerbated by planned Navy, Joint, and Allied fielding of new Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms. Currently fielded systems provide localized processing capabilities that will be overwhelmed in future years without a significant change in the way the Navy processes, exploits and disseminates intelligence data. DCGS-N Increment 2 will deliver all source fusion and analytical capabilities; provide Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) capabilities and integrate Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TCPED) capabilities to improve the use and analysis of sensor and platform data. Distributed Common Ground System- Navy (DCGS-N) Increment 2 will be based on an enterprise solution to share this information across commands, services, and agencies to promote shared situational awareness. DCGS-N Increment 2 consists of multiple releases. The first release provides an enhanced Navy Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) enterprise that converges and builds on the DCGS-N Increment 1 and Maritime Domain Awareness Enterprise Nodes; leverages the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E); is compliant with the Common Computing Environment (CCE); federates ISR and TCPED workflow and production improving throughput through automation; exploits new and evolving unmanned systems sensor data; provides Multi-Intelligence (Multi-INT) cross-queuing and modular tools. The second release enhances afloat ISR capabilities by providing a set of software centric tools providing Multi-INT fusion and analysis, behavior prediction and intelligent knowledge management designed to operate in disconnected or denied communications environment. Follow-on releases will be developed based on Fleet requirements.

Intelligence Carry-On Program (ICOP) is a suite of multi-source intelligence and analytical capabilities which includes an integrated Three-Dimensional (3-D) operational picture displaying intelligence and other data sources to provide a richer and more complete picture of the battle space on Unit Level platforms. The system supports a full motion video capability that receives, processes, exploits, and disseminates organic and non-organic data as well as the ability to process and correlate Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) and external Communications Intelligence (COMINT Externals). It integrates mature Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) applications with shared storage and communication paths to reach back to the DCGS-N Enterprise Node (DEN), and to provide data sharing to the Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) and national ISR systems, making tactical users a part of the larger ISR enterprise.  

In FY15, DCGS-N Increment 1 will verify and correct discrepancies discovered during the Block 2 Follow-On Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E).   

In FY15, DCGS-N Increment 2 will contribute to the development of the Program Executive Officer, Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (PEO C4I) prototype system. Increment 2 will conduct engineering reviews in accordance with agile development methodologies. 
 
In FY15, ICOP will complete all acquisition and engineering of development integration activities pertaining to formal testing efforts in preparation for fielding of Program of Record (PoR) systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Distributed Common Ground System - Navy (DCGS-N) program utilizes mature Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) and Governmental Off The Shelf (GOTS) capabilities. The Navy adapts and integrates these capabilities and ensures interoperability with the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) standards and Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) policies. Integration of DCGS-N Increment 1 components has transitioned from Government-led to Industry-led based on the award of DCGS-N's Prime Mission Product (PMP) contract. The DCGS-N Increment 2 streamlined Information Technology (IT) acquisition strategy is based on an accelerated acquisition model as defined in the Interim Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI 5000.02).  DCGS-N Increment 2 capabilities will be developed through an evolutionary process that calls for multiple releases. Intelligence Carry-On Program (ICOP) will focus on multi-source intelligence and analytical capabilities and unit-level Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) processing, exploitation and dissemination for Surface operations, facilitating receipt, editing and sharing of imagery and video from aerial assets and shipboard cameras. ICOP will build on the Unit Level Rapid Technology Transition (RTT) prototypes and transition into a Program of Record (PoR) beginning in FY14.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>DCGS-N Increment 1 Goal: Provide Fleet with additional capabilities and migration to the Navy's Common Computing Environment (CCE) / Afloat Core Services (ACS). 
DCGS-N Increment 1 Metric: Correct any deficiencies found during Follow On Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E).

DCGS-N Increment 2 Goal: Support afloat forces through a robust enterprise ISR capability, satisfying maritime needs for processing, exploitation, and dissemination.  
DCGS-N Increment 2 Metric: Successful completion of Development Release for Proposal (RFP) review. 

ICOP Goal: Support unit-level ISR processing, exploitation and dissemination for Surface operations. 
ICOP Metric: Complete statutory/regulatory acquisition and training documentation, accomplish a successful Development Test/Operational Test (DT/OT), and complete correction of deficiencies from operational/environmental testing efforts in support of fielding Program of Record (PoR) systems.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>MQ-4C Triton Unmanned Air System (UAS).  The popular name Triton was approved for the MQ-4C UAS in June 2012, designating the RQ-4 Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) as the MQ-4C Triton.
 
The MQ-4C Triton is a high altitude-long endurance UAS designed to provide Fleet and combatant commanders with persistent maritime Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) of nearly all the world's high-density sea-lanes, littorals, and areas of national interest. Envisioned as an unmanned adjunct to the P-8A Multi-Mission Maritime Aircraft and crucial to the recapitalization of Navy's airborne maritime ISR capability, the system will seek to leverage Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force manpower, training and maintenance efficiencies.

The MQ-4C air vehicle is based on Northrop Grumman's Block 20 Global Hawk and features sensors designed to provide near worldwide coverage through a network of five orbits inside and outside continental United States, with sufficient air vehicles to remain airborne for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, out to ranges of 2000 nautical miles. Onboard sensors will provide detection, classification, tracking and identification of maritime targets and include maritime radar, electro-optical/infra-red and Electronic Support Measures systems. Additionally, the MQ-4C will have a communications relay capability designed to link dispersed forces in the theater of operations and serve as a node in the Navy's FORCEnet strategy. Tactical-level data analysis will occur in real-time at shore-based mission control sites connected to the air vehicle via satellite communications. Further intelligence exploitation can be conducted at Fleet shore-based sites or aboard aircraft carriers and other ships.

The MQ-4C Triton UAS will implement phased modifications within the acquisition program to pace capability with rapidly evolving technologies and threats to ensure the Navy maintains persistent ISR dominance through the system's lifecycle, and to support the OPNAV N2/N6 Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Targeting (ISR&amp;T) transition plan.  Modifications are intended to update Triton's Multi-Intelligence capabilities, provide Counter Electronic Attack (CEA) upgrades, a more robust electronic support capability and to continue improvements to baseline mission system payloads.  

MQ-4C will play a significant role in the Sea Shield and FORCEnet pillars of Sea Power 21. In its Sea Shield role, the system will rely on its key attribute of persistence to provide the supported combatant command or fleet commander with unparalleled situational awareness of the maritime battle space as it develops and sustains the common operational tactical picture. The system will also serve as a Fleet response plan enabler, while acting as a trip wire for intelligence preparation of the environment. Additionally, Triton UAS will be a FORCEnet enabler and relay platform, directly connected to both the Global Information Grid and the Distributed Common Ground System-Navy information backbone.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MQ-4C Triton Unmanned Air System (UAS).  The popular name Triton was approved for the MQ-4C UAS in June 2012, designating the RQ-4 Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) as the MQ-4C Triton.
 
The MQ-4C Triton is a high altitude-long endurance UAS designed to provide Fleet and combatant commanders with persistent maritime Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) of nearly all the world's high-density sea-lanes, littorals, and areas of national interest. Envisioned as an unmanned adjunct to the P-8A Multi-Mission Maritime Aircraft and crucial to the recapitalization of Navy's airborne maritime ISR capability, the system will seek to leverage Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force manpower, training and maintenance efficiencies.

The MQ-4C air vehicle is based on Northrop Grumman's Block 20 Global Hawk and features sensors designed to provide near worldwide coverage through a network of five orbits inside and outside continental United States, with sufficient air vehicles to remain airborne for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, out to ranges of 2000 nautical miles. Onboard sensors will provide detection, classification, tracking and identification of maritime targets and include maritime radar, electro-optical/infra-red and electronic support measures systems. Additionally, the MQ-4C will have a communications relay capability designed to link dispersed forces in the theater of operations and serve as a node in the Navy's FORCEnet strategy. Tactical-level data analysis will occur in real-time at shore-based mission control sites connected to the air vehicle via satellite communications. Further intelligence exploitation can be conducted at Fleet shore-based sites or aboard aircraft carriers and other ships.

The MQ-4C Triton UAS will implement phased modifications within the acquisition program to pace capability with rapidly evolving technologies and threats to ensure the Navy maintains persistent ISR dominance through the system's lifecycle, and to support the OPNAV N2/N6 Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Targeting (ISR&amp;T) transition plan.  Modifications are intended to update Triton's Multi-Intelligence capabilities, provide Counter Electronic Attack (CEA) upgrades, a more robust electronic support capability and to continue improvements to baseline mission system payloads.   

MQ-4C will play a significant role in the Sea Shield and FORCEnet pillars of Sea Power 21. In its Sea Shield role, the system will rely on its key attribute of persistence to provide the supported combatant command or fleet commander with unparalleled situational awareness of the maritime battle space as it develops and sustains the common operational tactical picture. The system will also serve as a Fleet response plan enabler, while acting as a trip wire for intelligence preparation of the environment. Additionally, Triton UAS will be a FORCEnet enabler and relay platform, directly connected to both the Global Information Grid and the Distributed Common Ground System-Navy information backbone.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MQ-4C Triton acquisition approach encompasses delivery of detection, tracking, imaging and data dissemination capabilities at Initial Operational Capability (IOC) with activities to enhance sensor and system performance via phased system modifications for post IOC delivery as part of the Triton acquisition program.  This approach of phased modifications within the acquisition program enables MQ-4C to pace capability with rapidly evolving technologies and threats to ensure the Navy maintains persistent Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance dominance through the system's lifecycle. 

The MQ-4C Triton program office is pursuing joint efficiency with the Air Force on the Global Hawk Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS).  However, the integration of the Triton UAS into the Maritime Patrol Reconnaissance Force and the unique maritime sensors employed dictate a Navy-led acquisition program focused on joint efficiencies, where possible.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>MQ-8 Unmanned Air System Joint Military Intelligence Program.

The MQ-8 (popular name "Fire Scout") Vertical Take-off Unmanned Aerial Vehicle provides real-time and non-real-time Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) data to tactical users without the use of manned aircraft or reliance on limited joint theater or national assets.  The baseline MQ-8 can accomplish missions including over-the-horizon tactical reconnaissance, classification, targeting, laser designation and communications relay.  The MQ-8 launches and recovers vertically and can operate from air capable ships, as well as confined area land bases.  Other characteristics include autonomous air vehicle launch and recovery, autonomous waypoint navigation with command override capability, dual aircraft operations, the incorporation of weapons, the incorporation of an electro-optical/infra-red/laser designator-laser range finder modular mission payload, radar, automatic identification system, and other specialty payloads.  Interoperability is achieved through the use of the Tactical Control System software in the ground control station, and through the use of the Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL). Data from the MQ-8 will be provided through standard Department of Defense Command, Control, Communications, Computers and ISR.

A Fire Scout system is comprised of air vehicles, payloads (electro-optical/infra-red/laser designator-range finder), Ground Control Station (with TCS and TCDL integrated for interoperability), UAV Common Automatic Recovery System (UCARS) for automatic take-off and landings, and associated spares and support equipment.  A total of 56 systems are planned to support training, maintenance, test and Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) requirements.  A limited number of land-based ground control stations supplement the system to support shore based operations, such as pre-deployment or acceptance functional check flights. These land based ground control stations will also support depot level maintenance/post-maintenance activities.

The MQ-8 system is post Milestone C (MS C), which was approved in May 2007.  MS C authorized entry into Low Rate Initial Production. The system is currently deployed on Navy Guided Missile Frigates (FFGs).   The Navy has truncated MQ-8B procurement with the last LRIP buy in FY11.  21 of the 23 LRIP aircraft (90%) have been delivered. Once delivery is complete, the 23 aircraft will support 8 Fire Scout systems.  MQ-8B airframes will continue to support maritime based ISR from FFGs, support LCS DT/OT events and LCS deployments. MQ-8B airframes will sunset through attrition. 

The MQ-8C Endurance Upgrade Rapid Deployment Capability (RDC) provides additional mission endurance, payload-weight-power, increased reliability, and improved maintenance to the Fire Scout System.  The Navy plans to transition the MQ-8C capability into the Program of Record.  The MQ-8C is a more cost efficient and capable system that meets both the Joint Emergent Operational Need Statement (JEONS) and the Fire Scout Capability Production Document (CPD).  The Navy plans to procure 48 MQ-8C based systems to support Littoral Combat Ship. This budget transitions the MQ-8C Endurance Upgrade, Radar, and Weapons capabilities into the Program of Record to meet both the JEONS and CPD requirements with a single system.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GROUP 1 (Family of Systems) - The program office is pursuing a rapid acquisition approach to quickly field new technology and capabilities to the warfighter. The strategy is to use evolutionary acquisition with two incremental developments to meet the final desired Small Unit Remote Scouting System (SURSS) requirements (Joint USMC/USA/SOCOM capabilities). The SURSS Block 0, Dragon Eye, was the first increment and was fielded to deployed units. Dragon Eyes are being removed and replaced with the Raven B. For the Block 1 increment, the USMC adopted the US SOCOM Rucksack Portable UAV (RPUAV) ORD, which meets the USMC's requirement and began migrating to the joint materiel solution, the Raven B. Raven B's are transitioning from an 8 Channel to a Digital Data Link (DDL) version while pursuing Tactical Sensor Network Suite (TSN2) technology which provides enhanced opportunities to detect irregular and asymmetric threats in a variety of domains, including urban, providing the warfighter with enhanced situational awareness and understanding. In concert with TSN2 technology development, continue research/testing technologies that improve UAV range and endurance as well as reliability and maintainability improvements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Marine Corps Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (MCTUAS) project supports the fielded RQ-7B Shadow Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system by conducting research, development, test and evaluation for improvement of the RQ-7 UAV capabilities in Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition, Intelligence, Battle Damage Assessment, Laser Designation and Force Protection.  The RQ-7B Shadow UAV system provides critical battlefield intelligence and targeting information in the rapid cycle time required for success at the tactical level. 
 
RQ-7B Shadow UAV systems are acquired through the United States Army (US Army) Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Program Office to fulfill United States Marine Corps (USMC) UAS requirements.  In order to optimize interoperability, maintainability, and capability with minimal cost, the USMC and US Army plan to develop additional capabilities for the common RQ-7 system to include the fuselage, flight and mission electrical and electronic systems, propulsion system, communications system, and capability payloads. These funds represent the USMC share of the combined joint development cost through Program Management Office UAS and the RQ-7 USMC specific development efforts of the NAVAIR 5.1 UAV Test Directorate.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (STUAS) is a combined United States Navy (USN) and United States Marine Corps (USMC) program that provides persistent maritime and land-based tactical Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance/Target Acquisition (RSTA) support for tactical level maneuver decisions and unit level force defense/force protection for Naval amphibious assault ships (multi-ship classes) and Navy and Marine land forces. This system will support Naval Missions such as building the Recognized Maritime Picture, Maritime Security Operations, Maritime Interdiction Operations, and provide support for Naval Units operating from sea/shore in Overseas Contingency Operations.  This submission is the USNs portion of the program and has been coordinated with the USMC budget submission PE 0305239M (RQ-21A).

A STUAS system (Land-based or Ship-based) consists of five (5) air vehicles, two (2) Ground Control Stations, multi-mission (plug and play) payloads, one (1) launcher, one (1) recovery system and associated support equipment.

The STUAS system will continue to evolve and upgrade capabilities to satisfy capabilities shortfalls, new requirements, and reliability, maintainability and safety issues.  Upgraded capabilities may include Navy Command and Control integration, Signals Intelligence and Synthetic Aperture Radar payloads, weapons integration, Heavy Fuel Engine, Laser Designator and Digital Common Data Link. RQ-21A will also continue to expand its shipboard capability across new ship classes.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element addresses projects under the Navy Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) Office.  It supports technical 
and management initiatives directed by Congress, Department of Defense (DOD), Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV), and 
Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) with the aim of bringing organization, focus, and efficiency to the development and 
use of M&amp;S throughout the Navy and DoD.  It provides a central agency for the formulation and implementation of policy and guidance in M&amp;S, and represents Navy interests in Joint and other agency initiatives.  It funds efforts to define and coordinate the corporate Navy M&amp;S policy and guidance to evolve an interoperable and reusable core M&amp;S capability consistent with the M&amp;S technical framework prescribed by DOD.  Efforts are organized around three product areas: 
(1) Core Services: This activity provides essential planning and coordination of M&amp;S efforts with other Services, the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Joint Staff, and other agencies to develop policies and procedures necessary for M&amp;S standards, visibility, and potential reuse across DoD.  (2) Community Services:  This activity provides M&amp;S subject matter expert support embedded in the DON M&amp;S Communities to recommend implementations for M&amp;S policies, standards, VV&amp;A, and reuse within their Community and to ensure that the wider DON and DoD are aware (visibility) 
of the M&amp;S products and services, initiatives, processes, and standards.  (3) Community Experiments and Prototypes:  This activity conducts experiments and prototypes aimed at determining the feasibility and applicability of proposed standards or technical approaches to Navy M&amp;S and investigates Service-unique requirements for standards or guidance to achieve M&amp;S efficiencies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>3030: A significant portion of the F/A-18 airframe is believed to have additional inherent capability and a life extension may be possible for many portions of the airframe.  The F/A-18 Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) is assessing the structural and subsystem conditions of the F/A-18 fleet in order to determine what modifications are necessary to extend the aircraft designed life limits to allow it to achieve Chief of Naval Operations inventory requirements.  Without SLAP and follow on Service Life Extension Program aircraft are retired from the USN inventory when a design service life metric is reached.   

3182: The T-45 Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) is assessing the subsystem condition of the T-45 fleet in order to determine what modifications are necessary to extend the aircraft subsystem design life limits to allow it to meet Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) Pilot and Naval Flight Officer (NFO) training requirements through 2035.  

JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F/A-18 Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) is assessing the structural and subsystem conditions of the F/A-18 fleet in order to determine what modifications are necessary to extend the aircraft designed life limits to allow it to achieve Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) inventory requirements. The goal of the F/A-18 SLAP program is to identify critical structures and components that can achieve the extended service life limit goals.  SLAP consists of structural analyses of the main landing gear, arresting hook and catapult back-up structures, vertical tails, wings and fuselage. A second effort is to assess the subsystem components (hydraulics, wiring, actuators, etc) to identify over and above inspections, overhaul intervals or replacement schedules to fly past design of 6,000 hours.  The current life limits for the F/A-18 E/F are 6,000 Flight Hours (FH), 2,250 catapults/arrestments (Cat/Traps) and 15,750 total landings. The F/A-18 SLAP program of record states the SLAP goals as 12,000 FH, 3,500 Cat/Traps and 22,500 total landings. The primary objective of F/A-18 SLAP is to determine if the stated SLAP goals are feasible.   An increase in total landings and flight hours would allow the F/A-18 to meet CNO inventory requirements, to include planning for the announced one year Joint Strike Fighter slide. This effort is required to be conducted for these airframes and subsystems to ascertain what actions and modifications must be taken to safely operate each system beyond its designed life until the targeted end of service life.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) program employs sole source contracts with Boeing, the aircraft prime manufacturer.  SLAP further decomposes program of record goals into smaller discrete steps, analyzing requirements to extend FH from 6,000 to 9,000 first.  These analyses will provide the raw engineering data to develop aircraft modifications to extend total aircraft landings, Cat/Traps, and FH.  The F/A-18 SLAP Program consists of two major engineering efforts: the aircraft structural assessment and the aircraft subsystems assessment.  Both efforts are broken into multiple phases which develop tools and models, assess current aircraft usage, and develop concepts to extend aircraft life to meet CNO objectives.  The program will combine exploitation of complete structural fatigue testing and actual fleet usage with the expectation of extending the service life of the F/A-18 aircraft.  Conducting F/A-18 SLAP to study the aircraft lifetime will provide a better estimate of aircraft service life and a follow on Service Life Extension Program (SLEP).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The F/A-18 SLAP provides an assessment of aircraft structure fatigue life as affected by flight maneuver, Cat/Traps and landings, based on actual usage and identifies the efforts required to extend the aircraft life to SLAP goals.  During SLAP Structures Phase A (FY08-FY13) tools and modeling necessary to assess usage and fatigue life are developed.  During SLAP Structures Phase B (FY11-FY19) specific structural locations which do not meet SLAP goals are identified and analyzed.  Subsystem SLAP is also initiated concurrently with Structures Phase (B).  A Flight Control Surface SLAP, SLEP retrofit concepts and repairs for deficient locations are developed during SLAP Structures and Sub-Systems Phase C (FY14-FY19).  SLAP is followed by the SLEP during which the actual retrofit and repairs are performed under OSIP 020-14 established in FY14.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>3182: The T-45 aircraft structure is currently fatigue limited to 14,400 flight hours based on initial full-scale fatigue tests conducted from 1992-1996. This service life limit prevents the T-45 fleet from meeting Integrated Production Plan (IPP), previously Pilot Training Requirements, past 2025. Recent studies have determined that the fleet squadrons have not been flying the T-45 aircraft as aggressively as the initial fatigue studies predicted. These studies demonstrate that the 14,400 flight hour service life can likely be extended, with a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), to 21,600 flight hours, which will support meeting IPP until 2035. A T-45 Structural Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) was completed in February 2012.   The results are being used to provide guidance on what structural areas to SLEP. In order for the T-45 to meet IPP until 2035, it is also necessary to assess the sub-systems of the T-45 in their ability to remain viable.  Beginning in FY13, the T-45 sub-systems SLAP effort will assess the sub-system condition of the T-45 fleet in order to determine sub-system modifications and/or redesign necessary to extend the aircraft designed service life to support IPP and Naval Flight Officer Training Requirements (NTR) until 2035. This sub-system assessment will be based on the updated fleet aircraft usage spectrum and future predicted training missions of the T-45 aircraft. The assessment will address all critical sub-systems required and their ability to maintain IPP/NTR until 2035, analysis and studies will be conducted to outline improvements, assess manufacturing capabilities, prototype redesign and test of sub-systems for trainer aircraft. The original funding within the T-45 SLAP budget programmed for T-45 tail hook has been absorbed into the overarching SLAP effort due to the success of T-45 additional tail hook life extension efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) program is intended to improve the productivity and responsiveness of the U.S. defense industrial base by funding the development and transition of leading edge manufacturing technologies.  The ManTech program is executed through a Center of Excellence (COE) strategy.  A majority of the COEs are consortium based with only a small group of technical and management personnel at the center.  ManTech projects are primarily performed by industry participants that bill the COE which, in turn, bills the Navy which causes a non-traditional financial execution profile for the program.  The program therefore does not meet traditional execution benchmarks.  The ManTech program, by providing seed funding for the development of moderate to high risk process and equipment technology, permits contractors to upgrade their manufacturing capabilities.  Ultimately, the program aims to produce high-quality weapon systems with shorter lead times and reduced acquisition costs.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The ManTech Program is intended to improve the productivity and responsiveness of the U.S. defense industrial base by funding the development of manufacturing technologies.  Major areas of endeavor both underway and planned include:  advanced manufacturing technology for metalworking, joining, electronics and electro-optics, composites, shipbuilding, and above-the-factory-floor business operations technology.  The ManTech Program is aimed at assisting acquisition programs in meeting performance and affordability goals by inserting manufacturing process solutions early into the design phase.

The budget levels for FY13, FY14 and particularly FY15 are lower than they have traditionally been due to DON decisions to re-baseline programs. For FY16 and beyond the budget returns to the prior profile.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The objective of the Metals Processing and Fabrication activity is to develop affordable, robust manufacturing processes and capabilities for metals and special materials critical to defense weapon system applications. Major areas that support this objective include: processing methods, special materials, joining, and inspection and compliance. These efforts directly impact the cost and performance of future aircraft, rotorcraft, land combat vehicles, surface and subsurface naval platforms, space systems, artillery and ammunition, and defense industry manufacturing equipment. Emphasis is on affordability for the following shipbuilding platforms: DDG-51, CVN-78 Class Carrier, VIRGINIA Class Submarine (VCS) / OHIO Replacement Program (ORP), and Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), with some funding geared toward metals processing and fabrication improvements for high priority air platforms such as the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). 

Funding decrease from FY13 to FY14 reflects ramp up of the  JSF project portfolio with less emphasis on metals processing technology.

Reductions from FY 14 to FY 15 reflect DON decisions to re-baseline programs.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>NSRP ASE is a collaboration of U.S. shipyards working with the Navy customer to reduce the cost of building and repairing naval ships and improving shipbuilding industry productivity through advanced technology and processes. NSRP ASE is an innovative and proven approach to public/private cooperation to manage cost-shared R&amp;D based on a national consensus Strategic Investment Plan. The Plan targets potential industry-wide technology and process solutions which are vetted by industry experts and builds upon the progress made over the previous years. The collaboration's organizational structure promotes teaming of industry, government and academia to achieve the continuous product and process improvements necessary for improved Navy ship affordability.  Solutions include both leverage of best commercial practices and creation of industry-wide initiatives with aggressive technology transfer to, and buy-in by, multiple U.S. shipyards. Navy PEOs (Ships, Subs and Carriers) and NAVSEA are directly involved in NSRP.  The Plan calls for matching government and industry investments over several years.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
