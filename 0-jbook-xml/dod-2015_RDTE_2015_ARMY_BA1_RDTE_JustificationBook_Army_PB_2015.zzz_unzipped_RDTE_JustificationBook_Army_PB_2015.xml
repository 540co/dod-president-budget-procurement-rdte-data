                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) supports basic research at the Army laboratories through the In-House Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program.  Basic research lays the foundation for future developmental efforts by identifying fundamental principles governing various phenomena and appropriate pathways to exploit this knowledge.  The ILIR program serves as a catalyst for major technology breakthroughs by providing laboratory directors flexibility in implementing novel research ideas, by nurturing promising young scientists and engineers, and is used to attract and retain top doctoral degreed scientists and engineers.  The ILIR program also provides a source of competitive funds for peer reviewed efforts at Army laboratories to stimulate high quality, innovative research with significant opportunity for payoff to Army warfighting capability.  

This PE supports ILIR at the Army Materiel Command's (AMC) six Research, Development, and Engineering Centers (Project 91A); at the six U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Command Laboratories (Project 91C); the seven laboratories within the Corps Of Engineers' US Army Engineer Research and Development Centers (Project 91D); and at the Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) Technical Center (Project F16).

Work in the PE provides a foundation for applied research initiatives at the Army laboratories and research, development and engineering centers.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this PE is performed by the AMC, Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD,and the SMDC, Huntsville, AL.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) builds fundamental scientific knowledge contributing to the sustainment of US Army scientific and technological superiority in land warfighting capability and to solving military problems related to long-term national security needs, investigates new concepts and technologies for the Army's future force, and provides the means to exploit scientific breakthroughs and avoid technological surprises.  This PE fosters innovation in Army niche areas (such as lightweight armor, energetic materials, night vision capability) and areas where there is no commercial investment due to limited markets (e.g., vaccines for tropical diseases).  It also focuses university single investigator research on areas of high interest to the Army (e.g., high-density compact power and novel sensor phenomenologies). The in-house portion of the program capitalizes on the Army's scientific talent and specialized facilities to transition knowledge and technology into appropriate developmental activities.  The extramural program leverages the research efforts of other government agencies, academia, and industry.   

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project fosters research for automatic target recognition (ATR) concepts to enhance the effectiveness of Army systems while simultaneously reducing the workload on the Soldier.  This project focuses on the fundamental underpinnings of aided and unaided target detection and identification techniques for land warfare scenarios including tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) of non-traditional targets.  This research enables Army systems that can act independently of the human operator to detect and track targets including clandestine tracking of non-cooperative targets.  Such capabilities are needed for smart munitions, unattended ground sensors, and as replacements for existing systems.  Critical technology issues include low depression angle, relatively short range, and highly competing background clutter.  The resulting research will provide a fundamental capability to predict, explain, and characterize target and background signature content, and reduce the workload on the analyst.  This research is aimed at determining the complexity and variability of target and clutter signatures and ultimately utilizing that knowledge to conceptualize and design advanced ATR paradigms to enhance robustness and effectiveness of land warfare systems.  ATR research strategies include emerging sensor modalities such as spectral and multi-sensor imaging.  Research in this project builds knowledge for several technology efforts including multi-domain smart sensors, third generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), and advanced multi-function laser radar (LADAR). 

Work in this project complements and is fully coordinated with the U.S. Army Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC); the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC); and the U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC).

Work is this project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to several Program Elements (PEs) to include PE 0606270A (Electronic Warfare Technology)/Project 906 (Tactical Electronic Warfare Applied Research).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Army research in materials and devices for active and passive infrared (IR) imaging systems; radio frequency (RF) photonics for radar, communications, and electronic warfare applications; and laser technology for missile threat countermeasure protection.  This research aims to generate new technologies for unprecedented battlefield situational awareness and to continue the dominance of Army units during night operations.  To achieve these objectives, IR focal plane arrays (FPAs) and lasers with significantly improved performance, lower cost, and increased operating temperatures are required.  This research has direct application to Army ground vehicles, aviation platforms, weapon systems, and the individual Soldier.  Research is focused on material growth, detector and laser design, and processing for large area multicolor IR FPAs and midwavelength IR lasers.  The principal efforts are directed towards novel materials for detectors and lasers, and investigating energy band-gap structures in semiconductor materials to enhance the performance of lasers and IR FPAs.  In the area of RF Photonics, near-IR modeling and nanofabrication techniques are applied to the design and fabrication of IR photonic-crystal waveguide structures having customized IR properties.  This research also is intended to lay the foundation for the development of integrated optoelectronic circuits using active and passive devices and components such as lasers, waveguides, and detectors in conjunction with fiber optic interconnects for the generation, distribution, processing, and control of microwaves and study the fundamental physics of signal processing and noise generation as well as the conversion between the time and frequency domains and the optical and electrical domains in these opto-electronic (OE) circuits/systems.  The technical goals are to manage and control defects in the raw, unprocessed materials, maintaining quality control in the fabrication of the devices and arrays, limiting introduction of impurities in the material, surface passivation of the devices so that they are resistant to degradation over time and thermal management, particularly as it applies to interband cascade lasers. This work is coordinated with the U.S. Army Communications Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC). 
 
Work in this project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinning to several Program Elements (PEs)to include PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology)/Project H95 (Night Vision and Electro-Optic Technology).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project increases knowledge of terrain with a focus on improving the generation, management, analysis/reasoning, and modeling of geospatial data, and the exploitation of multi-sensor data. This fundamental knowledge forms the scientific "springboard" for the future development of applications, techniques, and tools to improve the tactical commander's knowledge of the battlefield. Results of this research are used to extract and characterize natural and man-made features from reconnaissance imagery in near-real time; to exploit terrain analysis and reasoning techniques; and to explore the potential of space technology and tactical geospatial sensor technology to provide real-time terrain intelligence, command and control, and targeting support.  This research uses terrain and environmental data to improve situational awareness and enhance information dominance, leading to increased survivability, lethality, and mobility.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project focuses on research to seek an in-depth understanding of the complex atmospheric boundary layer associated with high-resolution meteorology; the transport, dispersion, optical properties and characterization of chemical and biological aerosols; and the propagation of full-spectrum electro-magnetic and acoustic energy.  The future Army will operate in very complex environments (e.g., urban, mountainous, forested and jungle terrain) requiring new approaches to understand, characterize, and depict environmental phenomena and their effects on military systems, personnel and operations.  The lack of a complete understanding of the meteorological aspects of the complex microscale boundary layer in which the Army operates continues to impact our ability to provide predictable, actionable, accurate and timely tactical environmental intelligence to battlefield commanders and small Soldier units.  This project focuses on producing the foundational environmental science research to characterize the atmospheric boundary layer and deliver novel capabilities and techniques including urban turbulence characterization for its effects on micro platforms and sensor payloads, high resolution urban wind flow modeling for more efficient and accurate prediction of the transport and dispersion of obscurants and chemicals, battlefield aerosol characterization and the interaction between aerosols and meteorological processes for Soldier health initiatives, characterization and detection of bio-warfare agent aerosols, environmental effects on acoustic and electromagnetic signal propagation in urban and other complex domains for improved target location and imaging, exploration of previously unexploited regions of the acoustic and electro-magnetic spectrum, and formulation of objective analysis tools that can assimilate on-scene all-source weather observations, atmospheric composition, and fuse this information with forecasts to provide immediate Nowcast products and actionable information.  These capabilities will have a direct impact on ensuring Soldier survivability, weapon system lethality, effective surveillance and reconnaissance, and the mobility required for future warfighter mission planning and execution operations.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project focuses on research that improves Soldier-system performance in future force environments by looking at  key phenomena underlying Soldier performance such as auditory spatial orientation (perception of azimuth, elevation and distance of sounds) within uncertain, degraded acoustic conditions; extending and protecting auditory and cognitive performance; human performance in automated, mixed-initiative (human control-machine control) environments; communications in hearing-degraded conditions; visual scanning and target detection; Soldier emotion and fatigue states; integration across multiple sensory modalities; perceptual-motor behavior; collaborative (team) and independent multi-task, multi-modal, multi-echelon Soldier-system performance - all cast against the influx of emerging transformation-driven technological solutions and opportunities.  Technical barriers include lack of methods for describing, measuring, and managing the interplay of these relatively novel phenomena due to situational complexity and ambiguity that characterize operations in the future force.  Technical solutions are being pursued in the areas of data generation and algorithm development in these emerging environments in order to update and improve our understanding of performance boundaries and requirements and enable neuroengineering.  These solutions include multi-disciplinary partnerships, metrics, simulation capabilities, and modeling tools for characterizing Soldier-system performance, and provide a shared conceptual and operational framework for militarily relevant research on cognitive and perceptual processes.  In the area of translational neuroscience, which is the transition of basic neuroscience research to relevant applications, research is carried out to examine leading edge methodologies and technologies to improve the measurement and classification of neural states and behavior in operationally-relevant environments, to examine the potential application of neuroscience theories to autonomous systems to improve Soldier-system interactions, to model the relationship between brain structure and cognitive performance for understanding  individual differences and injury, and to assess how neural pathways implicated in functional processing can be enhanced through dynamic system interface technologies for improving in-theatre performance and training. 

Work in this project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to several PEs to include PEs 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers)/Project H09 (Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance) and  0602716A (Human Factors Engineering Technology)/H70 (Human Factors Engineering System Development).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element provides the funding to develop innovative theories, models, and methods to improve personnel assessment, training, and leader development, as well as provide a better understanding of individual, unit, and organizational behavior and performance within the context of complex organizational and operational environments. The research within these domains will enable advances in psychometrics to support the development of the next generation of psychological assessments for selection, classification, and assignment. The research also will target how to improve the assessment of difficult-to-measure skills and enable theoretical advances to inform and support the accelerated development of complex cognitive and social skills. This research lays the foundation for future applications that address the behavioral and organizational dynamics that impact Army flexibility, effectiveness, and resilience.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project fosters research to increase the performance of small air-breathing engines and power-trains to support improved system mobility, reliability, and survivability for air and/or ground vehicles; and ultimately serve to reduce the logistics cost burden for the future force.  Problems addressed include the need for greater fuel efficiency and reduced weight in these propulsion systems.  Technical barriers to advanced propulsion systems are the inadequacy of today's materials to safely withstand higher temperature demands, the lack of capability to accurately simulate the flow physics and the mechanical behavior of these systems, including the engine and drive train.  The Army is the lead Service in these technology areas and performs basic research in propulsion, as applicable to rotorcraft as well as tracked and wheeled vehicles.  Technical solutions are being pursued through analysis, code generation, and evaluations to improve engine and drive train components and investigate advanced materials.  Component level investigations include compressors, combustors, turbines, energy sources and conversion, injectors, pistons, cylinder liners, piston rings, gears, seals, bearings, shafts, and controls.

Work in this project provides the technical underpinnings for Program Element (PE) 0602211A (Aviation Technology).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts basic research in materials science, which includes research into key phenomena enabling the creation and production of revolutionary materials that will provide higher performance, lighter weight, lower cost, improved reliability, and environmental compatibility for Army unique applications.  The current methodology of using materials to gain added functionality for Army systems is to use a layered approach, whereby each layer provides added capability (e.g., ballistic, chemical/biological, signature, etc.), but ultimately makes the system too heavy and too expensive.  Technical solutions are being pursued through understanding the fundamental aspects of chemistry and microstructure that influence the performance and failure mechanisms of ceramics, advanced polymer composites, and advanced metals, with the goal of creating hierarchically organized materials systems that possess multifunctional attributes at greatly reduced weight and cost.  These advanced materials will enable revolutionary lethality and survivability technologies for the future. 

Work in this project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings for several Program Elements (PE) to include PE 0602105A (Materials Technology)/ Project H84 (Materials) and PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology)/H98 (Clothing &amp; Equipment Technology). 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project seeks to improve the understanding of the chemistry and physics controlling the propulsion, launch, and flight of gun-launched projectiles and missiles, and to understand the interaction of these weapons with armored targets.  This research results in basic new knowledge, which allows the formulation of more energetic propellants, more accurate and non-lethal (NL)/lethal projectiles and missiles, and advanced armors for increased survivability of Army combat systems.  This effort supports the Office of the Secretary of Defense Advanced Energetics Initiative to mature the fundamental technologies required to transition the next generation of energetic materials into field use.  

Work in this project supports key Army needs and provides the theoretical unerpinnings to several Program Elements (PEs) to include PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology)/Project H80 (Survivability and Lethality Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.
 
Work in this project is performed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Adelphi, MD, and Research Triangle Park, NC.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports basic research to produce future generations of sensors with capabilities beyond those currently being employed.  Technical barriers include the fundamental speed and bandwidth limitations of current materials and devices, the efficiency of current algorithms, current computing architectures, organic material lifetimes, the understanding of the fundamental concepts of quantum cryptography, and spatial resolution of current radio frequency (RF) sensors.  The technical approach is to exploit large scale electromagnetic (EM) models to predict and explain target and clutter scattering behavior, digital and image processing modules and algorithms, beam propagation and material modeling of nonlinear optical effects, hazardous material detection, remote sensing and intelligent system distributive interactive simulations, unique sensor development, sensor data feature and information fusion in the concept of Data-to-Decisions (D2D), and battlefield acoustic signal processing algorithms.  Research performed under this project also supports survivable sensor systems, organic thin film transistor technology and organic light emitting diode technology for affordable rugged flexible displays.  This project also funds research in the development of biologically inspired materials for use as sensors as well as for power generation and storage; and physics-based multi-scale models for electronic, optical, mechanical, and chemical materials.  Payoffs include high-data-rate military communications, low cost compact flexible displays for the Soldier and for the Army, improved radar signal processing techniques that will allow existing systems to improve spatial resolution, improved ultra wideband radar technology for detection of explosives including mine detection, through the wall sensing and robotics perception, improved sensor approaches and signal processing techniques for enhanced acoustic/seismic sensing systems in noisy environments, distributed sensor data fusion in ad hoc networks, improved cryptography techniques, improved understanding of the physics and atomic properties of materials, and capabilities in hazardous material and event sensing.  

Work in this project supports key Army needs and provides the theoretical underpinnings to several Program Elements (PEs) to include PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology)/Project H98 (Clothing &amp; Equipment Technology).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports basic research to enable intelligent and survivable command and control, communication, computing, and intelligence (C4I) systems for the future force.  As the combat force structure decreases and operates in more dispersed formations, information systems must be more robust, intelligent, interoperable, and survivable if the Army is to retain both information and maneuver dominance.  This research supports the Army's Network Science initiative and addresses the areas of information assurance, signal processing for wireless battlefield communications, document and speech machine translation, and intelligent systems for C4I.  Major barriers to achieving the goals are the inherent vulnerabilities associated with using standardized protocols and commercial technologies while addressing survivability in a unique hostile military environment that includes highly mobile nodes and infrastructure, bandwidth-constrained communications at lower echelons, resource-constrained sensor networks, diverse networks with dynamic topologies, high-level multi-path interference and fading, jamming and multi-access interference, levels of noise in speech signals and document images, new low-density languages, and information warfare threats.  These C4I technologies must accommodate heterogeneous security infrastructures and information exchange/security mechanisms between multiple levels of security.  The intelligent systems for C4I research focuses on providing the agent technology capabilities that will produce highly relevant tactical events for mounted or dismounted commanders, leaders and Soldiers; improve the timeliness, quality and effectiveness of actions; and speed the decision-making process of small teams operating in complex natural or urban terrain.

Work in this project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to several Program Elements (PEs) to include PE 0602783A(Computer and Software Technology)/Project Y10(Computer/Information Science Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project fosters extramural basic research to create and exploit new scientific discoveries and technology breakthroughs, primarily from universities, that will improve the Army's transformational capabilities. Current technologies are unable to meet the operational requirements of the future force.  The Army Research Office of the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) maintains a strong peer-reviewed scientific research program through which leap-ahead technological solutions may be discovered, matured, and transitioned to overcome the technological barriers associated with next generation capabilities.  Included are research efforts for increasing knowledge and understanding in fields related to long-term future force needs in the physical sciences (physics, chemistry and life sciences), the engineering sciences (mechanical sciences, electronics, materials science and environmental science (atmospheric and terrestrial sciences)), and information sciences (mathematical sciences, computing sciences, and network sciences).  Targeted research programs in nanotechnology, training and simulation, smart structures, multifunctional and micro-miniature sensors, intelligent systems, countermine, compact power, and other mission-driven areas will lead to a future force that is more strategically deployable, more agile, more lethal, and more survivable.  The breadth of this basic research program covers approximately 900 active, ongoing research grants and contracts with leading academic researchers and approximately 1,600 graduate students yearly, supporting research at nearly 250 institutions in 50 states.  

Work is this project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to several Program Elements (PEs) to include PE 62618A (Ballistics Technology)/Project H80 (Survivablity and Lethality Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds basic research for improved tools and methods to enable the structural health monitoring capabilities and condition-based maintenance for rotorcraft and ground vehicles.  This research also enables the design and use of composite structures that can better address the cost, weight, performance, and dynamic interaction requirements of future platforms identified by the Army Modernization Strategy.  Ultimately, these technologies result in safer, more affordable vehicles with a greatly reduced logistics footprint.  This project is a joint Army/NASA effort that includes structures technology research into: structural integrity analyses; failure criteria; inspection methods which address fundamental technology deficiencies in both metallic and composite Army rotorcraft structures; use of composite materials in the design and control of structures through structural tailoring techniques; rotorcraft aeroelastic modeling and simulation; helicopter vibration (rotating and fixed systems); and the design and analyses of composite structures with crashworthiness as a goal.  The problems in structural modeling are inaccurate structural analysis and validation methods to predict durability and damage tolerance of composite and metallic rotorcraft structures and inadequate structural dynamics modeling methods for both the rotating and fixed system components to address reliability issues for future aircraft.  The technical barriers include a lack of understanding of failure mechanisms, damage progression, residual strength, high-cycle fatigue, the transfer of aerodynamic loads on the rotor to the fixed system, and impact of these unknown loads on aircraft components.  Technical solutions are focused on: advanced fatigue methodologies for metallic structures, improved composites technology throughout the vehicle, long-term investigation of integrated stress-strength-inspection, advanced methods for rotor system vehicle vibratory loads prediction, improved methods to predict vehicle stability, and improved analyses to address Army Aviation requirements.  These advancements will extend service life, reduce maintenance costs, enhance durability, and reduce the logistics footprint of existing and future Army vehicles.  This is the only basic research project supporting investigations for rotorcraft and ground vehicle structures within the Department of Defense.

Work in this project supports key Army needs and provides the technical underpinnings to Program Element (PE) 0602211A (Aviation Technology). 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project focuses basic research on innovative technologies for industrial pollution prevention (P2) that directly supports the Army production base and weapon systems and addresses non-stockpile chemical warfare (CW) site remediation.  Work in pollution prevention invests in next generation manufacturing, maintenance, and disposal methods that will result in significantly reducing the usage of hazardous and toxic substances and their associated costs.  The goal is to decrease the overall life-cycle costs of Army systems by 15-30% through the application of advanced pollution prevention technologies.  The CW remediation efforts concentrate on the application of biotechnology in the characterization and physical clean up of agent contaminated soils and groundwater and reduced corrosive and more environmentally benign decontamination of biological warfare (BW) agents on field equipment and weapon systems, with the goal of reducing the cost of remediating a site by at least 50% versus the use of conventional methods.  CW thrusts include establishing the ecotoxicity of CW compounds, environmental fate and effect of CW compounds in soils and biodegradation of CW compounds.  Pollution prevention thrusts include: environmentally acceptable, advanced, non-toxic processes to manufacture lightweight alternative structural materials to enhance weapon system survivability; clean synthesis of more powerful and improved energetic compounds to eliminate the use of hazardous materials and minimize the generation of wastes; and surface protection alternatives to hazardous paints, cadmium, chromium, and chromate conversion metal and composite surfaces.  

Work in this project complements and is fully coordinated with the Army Environmental Requirements Technology Assessment (AERTA) requirements. The program element contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments.  

The cited work provides the technical underpinnings for PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project fosters basic research leading to medical countermeasures for naturally occurring diseases impacting military operations. Basic research for this project provides an understanding of the mechanisms that make organisms infectious and mechanisms that render the human body response effective to prevent diseases caused by infectious agents. Understanding the biological characteristics of infectious organisms also enables the development of point-of-care and laboratory-based diagnostic tools (use for the identification of the nature and cause of a particular disease). Understanding of disease transmission by insects and other organisms helps in developing new interventions to prevent transmission of such diseases. Infectious disease threats from malaria, diarrhea, and dengue (a severe debilitating disease transmitted by mosquitoes), which are common in Africa, Central, European, Southern, and/or Pacific Commands, are the highest priorities for basic research. 

Research conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas: 

(1) Prevention/Treatment of Parasitic (organism living in or on another organism) Diseases
(2) Vaccines for the Prevention of Malaria
(3) Bacterial Disease Threats
(4) Viral Disease Threats
(5) Diagnostics and Disease Transmission Control

Work is managed by USAMRMC in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC).  The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.   

Work in this project complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602787A (Medical Technology). 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports basic research to understand the fundamental mechanisms of severe trauma to advance treatment and surgical procedures to save lives and improve medical outcomes for the Soldier. Experimental models are developed to support in-depth trauma research studies. This project includes studies of predictive indicators and decision aids for life-support systems, studies to heal and repair burned or traumatically injured tissue, traumatic brain injury (TBI), sight and face trauma, and transplant technology. Such efforts will minimize lost duty time from and provide military medical capabilities for far-forward medical/surgical care of injuries, as well as post-evacuation restorative and rehabilitative care.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project fosters basic research on physiological and psychological factors limiting Soldier effectiveness and on the characterization of health hazards generated by military systems and resulting as a consequence of military operations. This project includes research on the neurobehavioral aspects of post-traumatic stress and suicide and develops concepts for medical countermeasures to prevent or mitigate the effects of muscle and bone injury as well as to reduce the effects of sleep loss and other stressors on Warfighter performance. The hazards of exposure to directed energy, repetitive use, fatigue, heat, cold, and altitude are also investigated under this project.  

Research conducted in this project focuses on the following four areas:

(1) Injury Prevention and Reduction
(2) Physiological Health
(3) Environmental Health and Protection
(4) Psychological Health and Resilience
 
Work in this project complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602787A (Medical Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology, priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports basic research to increase knowledge in the areas of terrain state and signature physics.  It investigates the knowledge base for understanding and assessing environmental impacts critical to battlespace awareness. Projects include fundamental material characterization, investigation of physical and chemical processes, and examination of energy/mass transfer applicable to predicting state of the terrain, which control the effects of the environment on targets and target background signatures and mobility in support of the materiel development community.  The terrain state area of terrestrial sciences investigates weather-driven terrain material changes and sensing/inferring subsurface properties.  The signature physics area of terrestrial sciences focuses on understanding the dynamic changes to electromagnetic, acoustic and seismic signatures, and energy propagation in response to changing terrain state and near surface atmosphere.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports basic research to investigate fundamental scientific principles and phenomena necessary to ensure efficient development of the technologies needed to address Army sustainment issues in the restoration, compliance, conservation, and non-industrial pollution prevention areas.  These efforts include: investigating and monitoring contaminated sites, including chemical contamination and unexploded ordnance (UXO) detection/discrimination; better characterization of contaminants through improved risk-based assessment; destruction, containment, or neutralization of organics in water, soil, and sediments resulting from military activities; adhering to applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations; monitoring and controlling noise generation and transport; protecting and enhancing natural and cultural resources; reducing pollution associated with military activities; and the study of ecosystem genomics and proteomics in support of the Army's new Network Science initiative.  

Work in this project provides a fundamental basis for applied research in PE 0602720A (Environmental Quality Technology), Project 048 (Industrial Operations Pollution Control Technology), Project 835 (Military Medical Environmental Criteria) and Project 896 (Base Facilities Environmental Quality).  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports basic research in areas that expands the autonomous capabilities, utility, and portability of small robotic systems for military applications, with a focus on enhanced intelligence, biomimetic functionality, and robust mobility, to permit these systems to serve as productive tools for dismounted Soldiers.  It enables future systems to support and unburden Soldiers by integrating technologies with an understanding of cognitive and physical needs, and the missions of the humans and (non-human) agents operating on the battlefield.  The ability of the Warfighter to command a suite of small unmanned systems (e.g., air, ground, and hybrid vehicles) reduces exposure of the Soldier to harm and improves the efficiency by which a dismounted unit achieves tactical objectives such as securing a targeted zone.  Example missions requiring enhanced autonomy, manipulation, and man-portability include rapid room clearing and interior structure mapping; detection of human presence, chemical/biological/nuclear/radiological/explosive (CBNRE), and booby-traps; surveillance; and subterranean passage detection and exploration.  Because of their relatively small size, light weight, and service in dismounted environments, small unmanned systems have unique challenges in perception, autonomous processing, mobility mechanics, propulsive power, and multi-functional packaging that transcend similar challenges associated with large unmanned systems.  The U.S. Army Research Lab conducts research in related disciplines, including machine perception, intelligent control, biomimetic robotics, manipulator mechanics, and propulsive power and drives to foster the development of technologies for lightweight, small-volume, environmentally-harsh robotics applications.  Machine perception research includes the exploration of lightweight ultra-compact sensor phenomenology and the maturation of basic machine vision algorithms that enable small unmanned systems to more fully understand their local environment.  Intelligent control research includes the maturation of autonomous processing capabilities and the advancement of artificial intelligence techniques that lead to reliable autonomous behavior in a large-displacement, highly-dynamic environment and permit unmonitored task performance.  Research in biomimetic robotics and manipulator mechanics includes the advancement of mechatronic and biomimetic appendages to enable agile high-speed locomotion, dexterous task-performance, and environmental-manipulation; and the maturing of nonlinear control algorithms to support robust, stable mobility. Propulsion power and drives research includes investigations of engine cycles and alternative hybrid energy conversion techniques to provide compact, lightweight, quiet, low-emission, high-density power sources that support highly-portable unmanned systems capable of performing long-endurance missions.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project fosters research investigations through a modernized systematic approach that uses iterative computer simulation with mathematical modeling and biological information to analyze and refine biological studies. The information gained from these studies have potential to provide a better understanding of the overall biological system and its molecular network of interactions, which leads to improved early strategic decision-making in the development of preventive and treatment solutions to diseases. This approach establishes a model for application of computational biology processes and knowledge of biological networks to discover medical products that prevent and/or treat diseases or medical conditions.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) supports Army basic research efforts in the Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) program, the Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP) and the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) program by funding basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines pertinent to maintaining the U.S. land combat technology superiority.  Army MURI program efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high-priority, transformational topics that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline (e.g., Intelligent Luminescence for Communication, Display, and Identification).  For many complex problems, this multidisciplinary approach serves to accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results to application.  The DURIP provides funds to acquire major research equipment to augment current, or devise new, research capabilities in support of Army transformational research. The PECASE program funds single-investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their independent research careers.
Project V72 supports Minerva Research Initiative (MRI), a university based social science research project initiated by the Secretary of Defense in FY09.

Work in the PE provides a foundation for applied research initiatives at the Army laboratories and research, development and engineering centers. 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work on this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Research Triangle Park, NC.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the Minerva Research Initiative (MRI), a university-based social science research program initiated by the Secretary of Defense in FY09.  It focuses on areas in the social sciences that are of strategic importance to U.S. national security policy which have not been substantially pursued in the past.  The Minerva research effort will be performed to understand the internal military-political dynamics of repressive regimes, the vulnerabilities of regimes and institutions to various kinds of disruption and instability, the nature of crowd dynamics, group violence, community belief structures, the potential to influence public opinion and attitudes in diverse cultures, cultural effects on network security and military operations, the influence of technology on military capabilities of potential adversaries and allies, and other intersections of social-cultural issues with military activities and national security.  Predictive models and other analysis tools will be developed.  Leveraging the expertise in the social sciences within the academic community is needed to provide understanding of the roots of terrorist organizations and the challenges and opportunities for military operations in a culturally diverse environment.  Better understanding at a fundamental level and new computational tools will provide a beneficial impact on war fighting capabilities at the national policy, military strategy, operational, and tactical levels, and will enhance the capabilities of intelligence activities at all levels.  All research results are open source.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) fosters university and industry based research to provide a scientific foundation for enabling technologies for future force capabilities.  Broadly, the work in this project falls into three categories: Collaborative Technology Alliances / Collaborative Research Alliances (CTAs/CRAs), University Centers of Excellence (COE), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs).  The Army formed CTAs to leverage large investments by the commercial sector in basic research areas that are of great interest to the Army.  CTAs are industry-led partnerships between industry, academia, and the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) to incorporate the practicality of industry, the expansion of the boundaries of knowledge from universities, and Army scientists to shape, mature, and transition technology relevant to the Army mission.  CTAs have been competitively established in the areas of Micro Autonomous Systems Technology (MAST), Network Sciences, Robotics, Cognition and Neuroergonomics, and Multi-Scale Materials Modeling.  COEs focus on expanding the frontiers of knowledge in research areas where the Army has enduring needs, and couples state-of-the-art research programs at academic institutions with broad-based graduate education programs to increase the supply of scientists and engineers in automotive and rotary wing technology.  Also included are Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP) and activities to stimulate interest in science, math, and technology among middle and high school students.  This PE includes support for basic research at three Army UARCs, which have been created to exploit opportunities to advance new capabilities through a sustained long-term multidisciplinary effort.  The Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies focuses on Soldier protection by emphasizing revolutionary materials research for advanced Soldier protection and survivability.  The Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies focuses on enabling network centric-technologies, and broadening the Army's use of biotechnology for the development of bio-inspired materials, sensors, and information processing.  The Institute for Creative Technologies is a partnership with academia and the entertainment and gaming industries to leverage innovative research and concepts for training and simulation.  Examples of specific research of mutual interest to the entertainment industry and the Army are technologies for realistic immersion in synthetic environments, networked simulation, standards for interoperability, and tools for creating simulated environments.  This PE also includes the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institution (HBCU/MI) Centers of Excellence that address critical research areas for Army Transformation. 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  
 
Work in this PE is performed by the U. S. Army Research Lab (ARL) in Adelphi, MD; the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC) in Warren, MI; U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), in Huntsville, AL, and U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), in Aberdeen, MD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Cyber Security Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA), a competitively selected consortium, is formed to advance the theoretical foundations of cyber science in the context of Army networks.  This CRA consists of academia, industry and government researchers working jointly with the objective of developing a fundamental understanding of cyber phenomena so that fundamental laws, theories, and theoretically grounded and empirically validated models can be applied to a broad range of Army domains, applications, and environments.  This research will focus on three interrelated aspects of cyber security and will be conducted using a trans-disciplinary approach that takes into account the human element of the network.  The three aspects of cyber that are addressed are: 1) vulnerabilities and risks of cyber networks to malicious activities, 2) anticipating, detecting, and analyzing malicious activities, and 3) agile cyber maneuver to thwart and defeat malicious activities.  Overarching goals of cyber security are to significantly decrease the adversary's return on investment when considering cyber attack on Army networks, and minimizing the impact on (Army) network performance related to implementing cyber security.  The CRA research creates a framework that effectively integrates the knowledge of cyber assets and potential adversary capabilities and approaches, and provides defense mechanisms that dynamically adjust to changes related to mission, assets, vulnerability state, and defense mechanisms.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this project is performed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in Adelphi and Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project fosters research through the Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA), a competitively selected industry and university consortium, to leverage world-class research in support of future force and Army transformation needs.  Escalating levels of complexity and uncertainty on the current and future battlefield present conditions which have never existed before now.  Solution strategies and approaches must be developed or tailored.  The emerging field of neuroergonomics, which seeks to understand the brain at work and to leverage that understanding to optimize system design, offers tremendous potential for providing the solutions needed to meet the needs of Army forces in the future.  This CTA addresses the solution strategies and approaches needed to design systems to fully exploit investments in revolutionary technological advances in areas such as robotics, microelectronics, and computer and network information systems.  These technologies present significant opportunities to enhance Army mission capabilities, but impose significant burdens on the human brain, which will ultimately limit Soldier-system effectiveness, sustainability, and survivability.  The technical barriers associated with this project include: immature knowledge base to guide the neuroergonomic approach to human-system integration; inadequate capabilities to sense and extract information about brain activity in dynamic, operational environments; lack of valid measures to robustly and uniquely characterize operationally-relevant cognitive performance; lack of techniques for integrating advanced understandings of brain activity into systems designs, including real-time use of measures of cognitive behavior as system inputs and the capability to account for individual differences in maximizing Soldier-system performance.  This CTA conducts an intensive and accelerated program to formulate, validate, and transition basic research findings through multi-dimensional approaches focused in three areas: understanding fundamental principles underlying Soldier neurocognitive performance in operational environments, advancing computational approaches for the analysis and interpretation of neural functioning, and fundamental advancement in neurotechnologies that enhance Soldier-system interactions and performance.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports research at the Army's Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies (ICB), led by the University of California-Santa Barbara, and two major supporting partners, the California Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The ICB was established as a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to support leveraging biotechnology for: advanced sensors; new electronic, magnetic, and optical materials; and information processing and bioinspired network analysis. The objective is to perform sustained multidisciplinary basic research supporting technology to provide the Army with biomolecular sensor platforms with unprecedented sensitivity, reliability, and durability; higher-order arrays of functional electronic and optoelectronic components capable of self-assembly and with multi-functions; and new biological means to process, integrate, and network information.  These sensor platforms will incorporate proteomics (large scale study of proteins) technology, DNA sequence identification and detection tools, and the capability for recognition of viral pathogens.  A second ICB objective is to educate and train outstanding students and post doctoral researchers in revolutionary areas of science to support Army Transformation.  The ICB has many industrial partners, such as IBM and SAIC, and has strong collaborations with Argonne, Lawrence Berkley, Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Sandia National Laboratories, the Army's Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies, the Institute for Creative Technologies, and U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC) laboratories.

                                            <r2:Text>The goal of the ROM for underbody blast project is to develop predictive capability for practical underbody blast applications.  Earlier work demonstrated feasibility by adopting DoD engineering software Conventional Weapons Effects (ConWep).  This phase will develop highly non-linear mathematical formulations and implement fully coupled, high-fidelity blast-structure interaction problem-solving.  A number of new energy conserving algorithms in the context of ROM will be developed and implemented for this multi-physics transient application.  Will validate, verify and transition research software working with Army partners; continue exascale algorithms development under LISZTFE (domain specific finite element code) environment;  investigate a new class of direct solvers, called fast direct solvers (FDS), which use low-rank-matrix approximations to reduce the computational complexity; and transition software developed for blood transfusion and continue new scalable algorithmic development research for simulating inhalation of toxic agents for realistic patient-specific geometric features.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project fosters basic research through the Micro Autonomous Systems and Technology (MAST) Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA), a competitively selected industry-university consortium which leverages world-class research necessary to address future force and Army Transformation needs. The CTA links a broad range of government technology agencies, as well as industrial and academic partners with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL).  The MAST CTA focuses on innovative research in four main technical areas related to the coherent and collaborative operation of multiple micro autonomous platforms: microsystem mechanics, processing for autonomous operation, microelectronics, and platform integration.  Payoff to the warfighter will be advanced technologies to support future force requirements in situational awareness.  The CTA facilitates the exchange of people among the collaborating organizations to provide cross-organizational perspectives on basic research challenges, and to make available to the Alliance state-of-the-art facilities and equipment at the participating organizations.   

Work in this project complements and is fully coordinated with the U.S. Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center  (TARDEC); the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center (NSRDEC); and the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the International Technology Centers (ITCs), the Foreign Technology (and Science) Assessment Support (FTAS) program, and the Basic Research Center for Network Science located at the United States Military Academy (USMA).  

The nine ITCs located in Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Chile, Argentina, and Singapore support the Army's goals of providing the best technology in the World to our Warfighters by leveraging the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investments of our international partners.  The ITCs perform identification and evaluation of international technology programs to assess their potential impact on the Army's S&amp;T investment strategy.  ITC 'technology finds' are submitted as technology information papers (TIPs) to various Army S&amp;T organizations for evaluation and consideration for further research and development.  The ITC TIPs also serve as input into the international section of the Army S&amp;T Master Plan.  The FTAS program builds upon the TIPs submitted by the ITCs.  In some cases the TIP is truly unique and may well meet an Army requirement or potentially support ongoing Army S&amp;T investments.  In such cases, the FTAS program can provide initial resources (seed money) to fund basic research in these technology areas identified by the TIPs as having potential relevance to the Army's S&amp;T plan.  The research will provide information useful in making early assessments of the technology's potential contributions to the Army's S&amp;T strategy.  

Work in this project related to the USMA Basic Research Center for Network Science is fully coordinated with and complementary to PE 0601104/Project H50 (Network Science CTA). 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project concentrates scientific resources on materials research for lightweight vehicle protection and is executed through Cooperative Research Agreements (CRAs).  The effort funds collaborative research in three Materials Science and Engineering Research Areas (MSERAs): Composite Materials Research; Advanced Metals and Ceramics Research; and Polymer Materials Research.  Each MSERA pursues thematic research thrusts that address topics pertinent to lightweight vehicle protection and that are aligned with the Army's strategic materials research vision enabling long term synergistic collaboration between the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) scientists and university researchers.  The Materials Cooperative Research Agreements provide for mutual exchange of personnel and sharing of research facilities with the University of Delaware, Johns Hopkins University, Rutgers University, Drexel University, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.  Lightweight, multi-functional composites, advanced armor ceramics, dynamic response of metals, protective polymer, and hybrid systems are emphasized.  

Work in this project built fundamental knowledge supporting ARL in-house materials research projects (PE 0601102A/ project H42) and accelerated the transition of technology to PE 0602105A (Materials Technology).  In FY12, work in this effort concluded.  In FY13, the advanced materials emphasis for the Army focuses on multi-disciplinary, multi-scale materials behavior in extreme environments conducted in PE 0601104A/project VS2 (Multi-Scale Materials Modeling Centers). 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports simulation and training technology research at the Army's Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) at the University of Southern California.  The ICT was established as a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to support Army training and readiness through research into simulation and training technology for applications such as mission rehearsal, leadership development, health and medical, and distance learning.  The ICT actively performs research and engages industry to exploit dual-use technology and serves as a means for the military to learn about, benefit from, and facilitate the transfer of applicable technologies into military systems.  In addition the ICT works with creative talent from the entertainment industry to leverage techniques and capabilities and adapt concepts of story and character to increase the degree of participant immersion in synthetic environments in order to improve the realism and usefulness of these experiences.  In developing a true synthesis of the creativity, research, technology, and capability of industry and the research and development community, the ICT is revolutionizing capabilities for the Army by  making it more effective in terms of cost, time, range of experiences and the quality of the result.  Resulting research, techniques, and technologies and techniques are transitioned for maturation to PE 0602308A/project D02.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports sustained multidisciplinary research at the Army's Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies (ISN) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The ISN was established as a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to support research to devise nanotechnology-based solutions for the Soldier.  The ISN emphasizes revolutionary materials research for advanced Soldier protection and survivability.  The ISN works in close collaboration with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), and other U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) elements, as well as several major industrial partners, including Raytheon and DuPont, in pursuit of its goals.  This project emphasizes revolutionary materials research toward an advanced uniform concept.  The future uniform will integrate a wide range of functionality, including ballistic protection, responsive passive cooling and insulating, screening of chemical and biological agents, biomedical monitoring, performance enhancement, and extremities protection.  The objective is to lighten the Soldier's load through system integration and multifunctional devices while increasing survivability.  The new technologies will be compatible with other Soldier requirements, including Soldier performance, limited power generation, integrated sensors, communication and display technologies, weapons systems, and expected extremes of temperature, humidity, storage lifetimes, damage, and spoilage. 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.
    
Work in this project is performed by the U.S. Army Research Lab (ARL) in Adelphi, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports science activities that encourage elementary/middle/high school and college youths to develop an interest in and pursue higher education and employment in the science, mathematics, and engineering (STEM) fields. These activities are consolidated within the Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP) that links and networks appropriate components to derive the best synergies to present the Army to a larger pool of technical talent and to provide students with Army-unique practical experiences at Army laboratories, centers, and institutes to fill future Army Science and Technology workforce needs. AEOP increases interest and involvement of students and teachers across the nation in science, mathematics, and engineering at all proficiency levels and backgrounds to include under-represented and economically disadvantaged groups through exposure to Army sponsored research, education, competitions, internships, and practical experiences. This project enhances the national pool of science and engineering personnel that in turn supports defense industry and Army laboratory and research, development, and engineering center needs.

In FY13, activities and funds for educational outreach were consolidated from PE 0605803/project 729 into PE 0601104/project J14.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus area, the Army Modernization Strategy, the Department of Defense STEM Educational Outreach Strategic Plan and the President's "Educate to Innovate" campaign for STEM education.

Work in this project is performed by the U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), the U.S. Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC), the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC), and the United States Military Academy (USMA).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports two competitively awarded Collaborative Research Alliances (CRAs) to provide the Army with next generation multi-functional materials for ballistic and electronic applications and to address the extreme challenges associated with understanding and modeling materials subject to Army operational environments. The Materials in Extreme Dynamic Environments consortium, led by Johns Hopkins University partnered with CalTech, Rutgers University, and University of Delaware, focuses on understanding materials under high strain-rates.  The Multiscale/Multidisciplinary Modeling of Electronic Materials consortium, led by University of Utah partnered with Boston University, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, focuses on microscale properties to design macroscale behavior for electronics.  Research at both CRAs will address the modeling and experimental challenges associated with developing multidisciplinary physics simulations across multiple length scales for materials to include: a limited ability to relate materials chemistry, structure, and defects to materials response and failure under extreme conditions; an inadequate ability to predict the roles of materials structure, processing, and properties on performance in relevant extreme environments and designs; and the lack of experimental capabilities to quantify multiscale response and failure of materials under extreme conditions.

This project supports two extramural research consortiums, each of which will bring together a critical mass of preeminent university researchers to explore and develop critical emerging concepts in Quantum Information Science (QIS).  Focus will be on two areas of QIS that are expected to provide disruptive impacts on Army warfighter capabilities, and to perform collaborative research with Army in-house scientists and engineers to help accelerate the transition of the research. One focus area will be on quantum simulations to provide previously unattainable capabilities to model and design high-performance materials crucial for the individual soldier and Army equipment. The other focus area is in precision measurement using quantum sensing and imaging to provide leap-ahead imaging capabilities that would have been considered impossible using classical physics and current state of the art engineering.  In addition to providing the required focused level of effort, the consortiums will also provide the broad unified multidisciplinary effort the field of QIS needs to accelerate progress, ranging from pure mathematics to engineering.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas, and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this project is performed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in Adelphi, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
