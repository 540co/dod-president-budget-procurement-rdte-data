                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Experimentation (JE) Program Element provides funding for the Department’s Joint Concept Development &amp; Experimentation (JCD&amp;E) effort, carried out by the JCD&amp;E Community.  The JCD&amp;E Community is comprised of the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Joint Staff, National Guard Bureau (NGB), United States Coast Guard (USCG) and several Defense agencies.  Intra-government agencies and coalition partners often participate in JCD&amp;E processes and projects.  The Director for Joint Force Development (DJ-7) leads the joint force development efforts on behalf of the Chairman.  The J-7 staff coordinates all efforts with respect to the JCD&amp;E Community.

To ensure the program focuses on needs of the warfighters, JCD&amp;E initiatives originate from an annual call for nominations from CCMD's and Services, and from assessment of CCMDs identified critical warfighting capability gaps articulated in the Comprehensive Joint Assessment (CJA).  JCD&amp;E project submissions undergo preliminary analysis by the JCD&amp;E Community to confirm suitability for experimentation and, where feasible, to associate closely related subjects for economy of effort.  Preliminary analysis also confirms alignment to the Chairman’s priorities for developing Joint Force 2020 and Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) strategic priority areas.  The resulting annual list of project submissions includes concepts for development and experimentation efforts eligible for design and execution.  These efforts are prioritized and approved by the CCMDs and Service members of the Synchronization Board and forwarded to the Joint Capabilities Board (JCB)/Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) for approval.

JCD&amp;E activities examine potential solutions for CCMD operational needs emphasizing non-materiel solutions through targeted Doctrine, Organizational, Training, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOT-LPF-P) improvements.  JCD&amp;E tackles joint concept and capability issues demanding sophisticated analysis, innovative design and complex execution.  JCD&amp;E projects address topics that would prove difficult for individual combatant commands and Services to capture in the context of their immediate operational and force generation responsibilities.  In partnership with the CCMDs and Services, JCD&amp;E mitigates operational risk by establishing procedural models to conduct emergent concepts that are not yet instantiated in conventional force generation.  The results are briefed to Functional Capability Boards (FCB) who integrate solutions into their functional investment plans.

Based on leadership guidance, JS J7 shed themselves of the experimentation functions originally outlined in the Joint Experimentation R2.  While JS J7 divested this piece, the other portions such as concept development and wargaming were retained. The shift in focus aligns more closely with those functions under BA6 RDT&amp;E Management Support.  As a result, this line was zeroed and the remaining requirement was realigned to PE 0204571J, Joint Staff Analytical Support.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff directed the J7 to transform the Joint Experimentation program.  The reduction in BA3 funding between FY 2013 and FY 2014 is part of the transformation from Joint Experimentation to a Joint Assessment Program.

Based on leadership guidance, JS J7 shed themselves of the experimentation functions originally outlined in the Joint Experimentation R2.  While JS J7 divested this piece, the other portions such as concept development and wargaming were retained.

The JCD&amp;E Community is comprised of the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Joint Staff, the National Guard Bureau (NGB), the United States Coast Guard (USCG), and several Defense agencies.  Intra-government agencies and coalition partners often participate in JCD&amp;E processes and projects.  The Director for Joint Force Development (DJ-7) leads the joint force development efforts on behalf of the Chairman.  The J-7 staff coordinates all efforts with respect to the JCD&amp;E Community.

To ensure the program focuses on needs of the warfighters, JCD&amp;E initiatives originate from an annual call for nominations from CCMD's and Services, and from assessment of combatant command identified critical warfighting capability gaps articulated in the Comprehensive Joint Assessment (CJA).  JCD&amp;E project submissions undergo preliminary analysis by the JCD&amp;E Community to confirm suitability for experimentation and, where feasible, to associate closely related subjects for economy of effort.  Preliminary analysis also confirms alignment to the Chairman’s priorities for developing Joint Force 2020 and Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) strategic priority areas.  The resultant annual list of project submissions includes concepts for development and experimentation efforts eligible for design and execution. These efforts are prioritized and approved by the combatant command and Service members of the Synchronization Board and forwarded to the Joint Capabilities Board (JCB) and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) for approval.

JCD&amp;E activities examine potential solutions for CCMD operational needs emphasizing non-materiel solutions through targeted Doctrine, Organizational, Training, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOT-LPF-P) improvements.  JCD&amp;E tackles joint concept and capability issues demanding sophisticated analysis, innovative design, and complex execution.  JCD&amp;E projects address topics that would prove difficult for individual combatant commands and Services to capture in the context of their immediate operational and force generation responsibilities.  In partnership with the combatant commands and Services, JCD&amp;E mitigates operational risk by establishing procedural models to conduct emergent concepts that are not yet instantiated in conventional force generation.  The results are provided to Functional Capability Boards who integrate solutions into their functional investment plans.

Based on leadership guidance, JS J7 shed themselves of the experimentation functions originally outlined in the Joint Experimentation R2.  While JS J7 divested this piece, the other portions such as concept development and wargaming were retained. The shift in focus aligns more closely with those functions under BA6 RDT&amp;E Management Support.  As a result, this line was zeroed and the remaining requirement was realigned to PE 0204571J, Joint Staff Analytical Support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

C4 Assessments performed in the Persistent Command and Control Environment replicate an operational environment and provides Combatant Commands, Services, Agencies and Coalition partners at the joint force headquarters level, a laboratory and assessment venue for the warfighter and capability developer to identify and solve interoperability and integration issues with current and near-term joint and coalition capabilities.  This capability assesses system of systems interoperability, operational capability, procedural compliance, and technical suitability of emerging and existing systems and programs to confirm readiness for deployment.  

By establishing ground truth for interoperability and suggesting remedies for demonstrated shortfalls, C4 Assessments is an enabler for the Chairman’s priorities to:  pioneer new ways to combine and employ emergent capabilities, drive jointness deeper, sooner in-capability development, move quickly toward joint information and simulation networks that support secure and agile command and control, expand the envelope of interagency and international cooperation, and promote multilateral security approaches and architectures.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Deployable Analysis Team (JDAT) mission is to employ scientific methods to research, investigate, test, assess, and evaluate current and emergent Joint command and control (C2) information systems, and associated procedures.  These activities measure capabilities and limitations, identify shortfalls and root cause, recommend and verify solutions, and validate joint capabilities.  The resultant empirical outcomes influence Joint Capability development in areas such as: Policy, Joint Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP), and integration and interoperability of capabilities.  JDAT provides decision-quality data and cogent solutions to customers and stakeholders responsible for improving Joint C2 information systems integration and interoperability, informing acquisition decisions, and ensuring that Services and Agencies field integrated and interoperable systems.

The emphasis of JDAT efforts is the analysis of C2 information systems and supporting procedures to provide Services and Agencies findings and recommendations based on quantifiable data to improve Joint C2 integration and interoperability.  Evaluations range from small, single-focus events to large, multi-event/venue exercises.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Description>JDAT conducts assessments in conjunction with Service and Combatant Command (CCMD) exercises, experiments, and test and evaluation events. 

The primary outputs and efficiencies of JDAT include:
(1) Improvement in the Services’ ability to employ Joint C2 information systems.
(2) Recommendations for C2 system integration and interoperability.
(3) Ability to define appropriate Joint context during system acquisition or development.
(4) Updates/revisions to C2-related Chairman, Joint Chief Staff (CJCS) Instructions and Manuals.

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense Organization (JIAMDO) is the organization within the Department of Defense (DoD) chartered to plan, coordinate, and oversee Joint Air and Missile Defense (AMD) requirements, joint operational concepts, and operational architectures.  As part of the CJCS staff, JIAMDO supports the Chairman in meeting his Title 10 responsibilities as they relate to air and missile defense issues.  JIAMDO serves as the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in air and missile defense, and is the joint air and missile defense resource proponent within the DoD's resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads AMD mission area and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint air and missile defense architectures and concepts.

JIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at all major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  It provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the conduct of Military Utility Assessments and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO represents the Joint Staff in work on the AMD Capabilities Based Assessment Joint Service Team.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to US Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) for homeland air surveillance issues.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

JIAMDO also leads AMD mission area and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint air and missile defense architectures and concepts.

JIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at all major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements. In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S. It provides the Chairman, JCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the conduct of Military Utility Assessments and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO represents the Joint Staff in work on the AMD Capabilities Based Assessment Joint Service Team. JIAMDO also provides direct support to U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) for homeland air surveillance issues.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense Organization (JIAMDO) is the organization within the Department of Defense (DoD) chartered to plan, coordinate, and oversee Joint Air and Missile Defense (AMD) requirements, joint operational concepts, and operational architectures.  As part of the CJCS staff, JIAMDO supports the Chairman in meeting his Title 10 responsibilities as they relate to air and missile defense issues. JIAMDO serves as the operational community's proponent for characteristics, requirements, and capabilities in air and missile defense, and is the joint air and missile defense resource proponent within the DoD's resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads AMD mission area and utility analyses, integrates air and missile defense within the Force Protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations and demonstrations of joint air and missile defense architectures and concepts.

JIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at all major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the U.S.  It provides the Chairman, JCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review the cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements. At the request of USSTRATCOM, and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the conduct of Military Utility Assessments and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO represents the Joint Staff in work on the AMD Capabilities Based Assessment Joint Service Team and provides direct support to US Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) for homeland air surveillance issues.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The development of the Secretary of Defense's "Forces for Unified Commands" Memorandum Assignment Tables has historically been a labor intensive staffing process conducted annually.  The automated GFM Toolset is the first downstream consumer of force structure data resident in the seven organization (org) servers that are made available by the GFM DI effort.  CIRT has streamlined force management, increased common understanding of force assignment, and supported timely force management decisions.  The objective is to automate the generation of the Global Force Management Implementation Guidance (GFMIG) and Forces For Unified Commands (Forces For) Assignment, Apportionment, and Allocation tables.  These efforts will flatten, streamline, and automate the current process while providing high fidelity data and transparency, and enhance Combatant Commander risk assessment to operational plans.  The Joint Organizational Server (JOS) will be the enabler system for Joint Staff personnel to be entered, near-real-time, into the automated Forces For Process.  Failure to fund for this effort negatively impacts the ability of the Services, CCMDs, JS and OSD to efficiently manage force structure resources.</r2:Description>
