                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) safeguards America and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives) by providing capabilities to reduce, eliminate, counter the threat, and mitigate its effects.  The Basic Research Initiative program provides for the discovery and development of fundamental knowledge and understanding by research performers drawn primarily from academia and world-class research institutions in government and industry.  This leverages the Department of Defense’s (DoD) $2 billion plus annual investment in basic research by ensuring a motivation within the scientific community to conduct research benefiting WMD-related defense missions and by improving Agency knowledge of other research efforts of potential benefit to DTRA nonproliferation, counter proliferation, and consequence management efforts.  

These efforts are closely coordinated with the Chem-Bio Technology portfolio, which executes a basic research program under the joint Chem-Bio Defense Program.  Agency research interests are coordinated with those of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Service basic research programs through the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group.  DTRA reviews research interests annually to focus on technology areas not clearly addressed by other basic research efforts.

The DTRA’s Basic Research portfolio supports several National and Department initiatives directly related to countering WMD including: Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Nuclear Defense Research and Development Roadmap, FY2013-2017; Defense Budget Priorities and Choices for FY14 (2013); Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Science and Technology Priority Steering Council Roadmap (2012); National Military Strategy (2011); and the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review.  In general, these documents direct capability enhancements, projects and S&amp;T that support countering WMD and reducing global nuclear dangers. Specifically they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential foes, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based or inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements.  Basic research supporting all of these needs is included in this program element under Project RU-Fundamental Research for Combating WMD.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the discovery and development of fundamental knowledge and understanding by research performers drawn primarily from academia and world-class research institutions in government and industry.  This leverages the Department of Defense’s (DoD) $2 billion annual investment in basic research by ensuring a motivation within the scientific community to conduct research benefiting Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)-related defense missions and by improving Agency knowledge of other research efforts of potential benefit to Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) nonproliferation, counter proliferation and consequence management efforts. 

These efforts are closely coordinated with the Chem-Bio Technology Portfolio, which executes a basic research program under the joint Chem-Bio Defense Program.  Agency research interests are coordinated with those of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Service basic research programs through the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group.  DTRA reviews research interests annually to focus on technology areas not clearly addressed by other basic research efforts.

The DTRA’s Basic Research Initiative program element Project RU (Fundamental Research for Combating WMD) supports several National and Department initiatives directly related to countering WMD including: Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Nuclear Defense Research and Development Roadmap, FY2013-2017; Defense Budget Priorities and Choices for FY14 (2013); Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Science and Technology Priority Steering Council Roadmap (2012); National Military Strategy (2011); and the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review.  In general, these documents direct capability enhancements, projects, and Science &amp;Technology (S&amp;T) that support countering WMD and reducing global nuclear dangers.  Specifically they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are individuals, networks, or states; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based and inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements. Specific activities for Project RU can be described as follows: Sensing and Recognition – Generation of information that provides knowledge of the presence, identity, and/or quantity of material or energy in the environment that may be significant; Network Sciences – Enhance fundamental knowledge of theory, representations, and mapping to improve the WMD-related robustness, resiliency, recovery of, and informational and operational utility associated with and derived from, complex disparate but interdependent networks; Protection Sciences – Advance knowledge for protection of personnel, resources, sensitive systems and infrastructure from WMD; Sciences to Defeat WMD – Phenomena that improves success of defeat actions (use of weapons) including explosives, accessing and defeating target WMDs such as bio agents and weapons modeling; Sciences to Secure WMD – Improve understanding of phenomena for verification and compliance with treaties, including test detection. Discover revolutionary control methods to monitor and secure components, materials, and weapons, as well as disrupt proliferation pathways; and Cooperative Research with Global Partners – Research to reduce the global threat of WMD in collaboration with a broad range of international partners. Finally, this project supports and administers the Cooperative Biological Engagement Program for academic engagements, which has the core goals to secure dangerous pathogens, promote open and active disease reporting and response, advance transparent research to understand pathogens, and develop potential countermeasures.

The increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the relative net impact of Congressional reductions in FY 2013 and increased investment in Fundamental Research in FY 2014 to maintain zero real growth in funding per the Defense Planning Guidance for activities related to the discovery and development of fundamental knowledge for the benefit of Counter WMD-related defense missions.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 reflects a reduced effort in combating WMD basic research resulting in reductions to the number of active basic research awards.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is to safeguard the United States and its Allies from Global Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) threats by integrating, synchronizing, and providing responsive expertise, technologies, and capabilities unequalled by our adversaries.  This mission directly reflects several national and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance/vision documents to include the National Security Strategy, Unified Command Plan, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Counterproliferation Interdiction, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, National Military Strategy, Global Development of Forces, Global Employment of Forces, National Military Strategy for Combating WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex), and Nuclear Posture Review.  To achieve this mission, DTRA has identified principal objectives along with strategies and tasks to ensure the objectives are met.  These objectives are: 
1)	Ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent;
2)	Anticipate emerging WMD threats;
3)	Provide Combating WMD situational awareness;
4)	Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities;
5)	Prevent proliferation and use of WMD;
6)	Defend against WMD threats;
7)	Defeat WMD threats;
8)	Recover from WMD consequences;
9)	Synchronize countering WMD activities. 
 
A focused and strong threat reduction technology base is critical to meeting these objectives and ultimately achieving DTRA's mission.  This technology base is closely tied with the operational support programs that make up DTRA’s combat support mission.  DTRA has taken the steps to develop this technology base and provide a foundation for transformational activities within the WMD arena.

Activities funded by Program Element 0602718BR implement a wide set of National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 17 and emerging Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) guidance for prevention of proliferation of WMD and WMD terrorism.  Projects support strengthening nonproliferation, through the development of the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES) and Arms Control inspection training and operational capabilities.  Through development of new sensor systems, sensor networks, counterforce and fundamental CWMD research, these programs contribute to securing and interdicting WMD, WMD delivery systems and related materials.  Finally, programs in this area fund development and operational support of the DTRA Technical Reachback analysis center, which supports United States (U.S.) and Allied Forces, interagency and civil authorities with 24/7 Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-yield Explosives (CBRNE) event analysis support.

Project RA (Information Science and Applications) develops innovative technologies and modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities; collaborative net-centric CBRNE modeling access and support capabilities between DoD and key interagency and international partners;  and provides Technical Reachback support to create decision advantage for the U.S. and our Allies through improved situational understanding across the complete CWMD mission space.

Project RE (Counter Terrorism-Technologies) provides research and development support to Joint U.S. Military Forces, specifically U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in the areas of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Device Defeat and counter-WMD technologies for warfighters.

Project RF (Detection and Forensics Technologies) develops technologies, systems and procedures for post detonation nuclear forensics, and to detect, identify, track, tag, locate, monitor and interdict strategic and improvised nuclear and radiological weapons, components, materials, or infrastructure in support of Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counterproliferation and nonproliferation, homeland defense, and international initiatives and agreements.  

Project RG (Defeat Technologies) develops advanced technologies and weapon concepts and validates their applicability as counter WMD weapon systems.

Project RI (Nuclear Survivability) provides the capability for DoD nuclear forces and their associated control and support systems and facilities in wartime to avoid, repel, or withstand attack or other hostile action, to the extent that essential functions can continue or be resumed after the onset of hostile action.  

Project RL (Nuclear &amp; Radiological Effects) develops nuclear and radiological assessment modeling tools to support military operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design decisions.  

Project RM (WMD Counterforce Technologies) provides (1) novel and enhanced weapons energetic materials and structures, full-scale testing of counter WMD weapons effects, weapons effects modeling, and weapon delivery optimization, (2) WMD sensor, surveillance and data processing technologies, and (3) the DTRA Experimentation Lab.  
   
Project RR (Combating WMD Test and Evaluation) provides a unique national test bed capability for simulated WMD facility characterization, weapon-target interaction, and WMD facility defeat testing to respond to operational needs by developing and maintaining test beds used by the DoD, the Services, the Combatant Commanders and other federal agencies to evaluate the implications of WMD, conventional, and other special weapon use against U.S. military or civilian systems and targets. 

Project RU (Fundamental Research for Combating WMD) fosters transition of early applied research into technology development.  Provides (1) strategic studies to support DoD, (2) decision support tools and analysis to support combating WMD research and development investments, and (3) early applied research for technology development.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The advanced analytics program provides SE and research and development with requirements, technology, architecture analyses and proof-of-principle capabilities necessary for making decisions on strategic planning, research and development investments, new initiatives, cooperation, and ventures with new customers, and accomplishment of high-level, short notice special projects.  It also conducts the development, validation, and fielding of the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES) as a part of the United States commitment under arms control treaties.  The innovative counterproliferation effort conducts research and development to investigate, identify, develop, and transition short term, high payoff technologies from Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), other government agencies, industry, academia, and international Science and Technology (S&amp;T) partners into the respective DTRA, and other research and development programs, and to end user organizations.  The Technical Reachback effort provides 24 hour/7 days per week information and analyses on potential impacts of WMD events to Warfighters and First Responders in consult with DTRA’s Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Research and Development subject matter experts.  Net-centric modeling access and support provides a real-time accessible framework which enables the DTRA Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-yield Explosives (CBRNE) modeling and simulation codes to provide an integrated suite of CWMD decision support capabilities.  This project also provides support to international Counter-WMD science and technology cooperation by developing modifications and improvements to new technologies and information tools suitable for foreign release and cooperative efforts.
	
The increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the relative impact of Congressional reductions in FY 2013.  The increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominantly due to the net effect of reduced investment in systems engineering collaboration with external partners/customers, slowing development and fielding of innovative technologies to the warfighter, and increased investment in advanced analytics, modeling and simulation, and hazardous effects characterization.

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops technologies, systems, and procedures to detect, identify, track, locate, monitor, and interdict strategic and improvised nuclear and radiological weapons, components, materials, or infrastructure in support of Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counterproliferation and nonproliferation, homeland defense, and international initiatives and agreements. This project researches, develops, demonstrates, and transitions advanced technologies to improve operational capabilities to detect and identify nuclear and radiological weapons.  It supports the attribution process through development, demonstration, and transition of improved post-detonation National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) operational capabilities in the areas of materials collection, debris diagnostics and materials analysis, and prompt diagnostics and device reconstruction.  Efforts under this project also support international peacekeeping and nonproliferation objectives, on-site and aerial inspections and monitoring, on-site sampling and sample transport, and on-site and off-site analysis to meet forensic, verification, monitoring and confidence-building requirements.

The decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the redirection of the nuclear detection portfolio toward a more holistic Nuclear Threat Detection portfolio that integrates both passive and active radiation detection into a comprehensive Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) solution. This resulted in a decreased investment in advanced detector technology to fund increased investment in nuclear weapons effects in Project RI - Nuclear Survivability and system vulnerability and assessment capabilities in Project RL - Nuclear and Radiological Effects.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominantly due to reduced investment in concept studies and prototype testing of CWMD defeat technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defeat Technologies project develops, integrates, demonstrates and transitions innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon capabilities to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders (CCDRs) to deny, disrupt, and defeat adversarial use of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) while minimizing collateral effects from incidentally released agents.  Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of advanced technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems or rapid WMD elimination capabilities that are most relevant to the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) WMD Defeat Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and their Area of Responsibility (AOR).  This program includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation (DT&amp;E) of next-generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved based on this technology.  The program is addressing defeat of adversaries' offensive WMD programs through integration of current conventional weapons capabilities and next generation kinetic and non-kinetic solutions to provide full-spectrum asymmetric defeat options.  The program addresses requirements delineated in the Quadrennial Defense Review and Strategic Planning Guidance as codified in the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), Service requirements documents, and COCOM and Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Combating-WMD capability.

The program places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within some mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials.  Our end-state is to provide COCOMs with accurate and timely WMD defeat expertise, tailored technologies, and customized solutions that provide offensive weapons and capabilities to combat WMD in any target while mitigating collateral contamination effects.  Without these capabilities our nation cannot effectively hold at risk our adversaries’ WMD capabilities thus giving them strategic advantage.

The increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the net effect of Congressional reductions in FY 2013 and increased investment in Counter-WMD (CWMD) hard target defeat weapons development in FY 2014.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominantly due to reduced investment in Next Generation CWMD Weapon Concept research and demonstration of Agent Defeat Penetrator technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Nuclear Survivability project provides enabling technologies for Department of Defense (DoD) nuclear forces and their associated control and support systems and facilities in wartime to avoid, repel, endure, or withstand attack or other hostile action, to the extent that essential functions can continue or be resumed after the onset of hostile action.  Emphasis is on ionizing radiation effects. The Nuclear Survivability project provides Radiation Hardened (RadHard) Microelectronics and Nuclear Weapons Effects (NWE) experimentation research.  Funding in this project also supports the expanding role of the Nuclear Test Personnel Review (NTPR) program into Science &amp; Technology development for human survivability.

Pulsed power and laser-driven NWE simulators are available to validate nuclear survivability requirements for DoD missile and space systems, conduct radiation effects research in materials and electronics, and validate computational models.  The Nuclear Survivability Experimental Capabilities program is working with the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the United Kingdom (UK) Atomic Weapons Establishment to jointly develop new, enabling technologies for improved NWE experimentation capabilities for x-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons.
 
The Nuclear Technology Analysis Support provides support for the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group (JAIEG) and the international Weapon Effects Steering Committee (WESC) through the NWE Users’ Group.  The WESC establishes standards for United States. and UK nuclear weapons effects simulation codes and models as defined and prioritized by the nuclear community, and serves as a forum for sharing information on nuclear technologies, capability gaps, and plans.

The increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the relative net impact of Congressional reductions in FY 2013 and increased investment in nuclear weapons effects experimental capabilities.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominantly due to reduced investment in nuclear effects simulation/experimentation capability and radiation hardened nanoelectronics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Counterforce Technologies project provides applied research to support 1) full and sub-scale testing required to investigate countering WMD weapon effects and sensor performance, 2) weapon effects modeling algorithm development, and 3) development of visualization and situational awareness tools to support the next generation Technical Reachback analysis cell.

This project provides combatant commanders the prediction capability and the attack options to engage WMD targets, to include related Hard &amp; Deeply Buried Targets (HDBTs) as the proliferation and hardness of this class of targets increases.  The project conducts weapon effects phenomenology (WEP) tests, analyzes data, conducts high performance computer simulations, and creates/modifies software to more accurately model cratering effects, fragmentation (both primary &amp; secondary), internal air blast, equipment/container damage, structural response, agent release, near miss lethality, and penetration.  These efforts will lead to advanced modeling and simulation capability in the countering WMD planning tools, to include the Integrated Munitions Effects Assessment (IMEA) planning tool used for weaponeering and the Vulnerability Assessment and Protection Option (VAPO) planning tool used for force/structure protection.  The Advanced Energetics Program develops new novel energetic materials and weapon design technology for rapid, directed and enhanced energy release, providing new capability to defeat difficult WMD/HDBTs. The Advanced Energetics Program develops new high energy systems well above current chemical energy levels to defeat WMD targets beyond the reach of traditional high explosive blast/frag warhead technology.

The decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the relative impact of Congressional reductions in FY 2013 and reduced investment in DTRA wargaming.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominantly due to reduced investment in small and medium-scale validation and parametric study experiments for advanced energetics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Test Infrastructure project provides a unique national test bed capability for simulated Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) facility characterization, weapon-target interaction, and WMD facility defeat testing to respond to operational needs by developing and maintaining test beds used by the Department of Defense (DoD), the Services, the Combatant Commanders, and other federal agencies to evaluate the implications of WMD, conventional, and other special weapon use against United States military or civilian systems and targets.  It leverages fifty years of testing expertise to investigate weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferate nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD (nuclear, biological and chemical).  The project maintains testing infrastructure to support the testing requirements of warfighters, other government agencies, and friendly foreign countries on a cost reimbursable basis.  It creates testing strategies and a WMD Test Bed infrastructure focusing on the structural response of buildings and Hard &amp; Deeply Buried Targets that house nuclear, biological, and chemical facilities.  It provides support for full and sub-scale tests that focus on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels.  This capability does not exist anywhere else within the DoD and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Combat WMD.

The increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the net impact of Congressional reductions in FY 2013 and the realignment of test bed facilities from RT-Target Assessment Technologies in Program Element (PE) 0603160BR to RR-Test Infrastructure in PE 0602718BR to better reflect the nature of those activities.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominately due to decreased investment in test technology.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The advancement of technology and science into applied technology development efforts focus upon increasing the stability and utility of mid-to-long term, moderate risk but high payoff science, and emerging technologies for transition to other DTRA applied technology programs.  This effort serves as the bridge between the bench scientist and the applied technologist.

The decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to decreased investment in University Strategic Partnership (USP) activities.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominately due to the completion of University Strategic Partnership activities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s (DTRA) mission is to safeguard the United States and our allies from global Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) threats by integrating, synchronizing, and providing responsive expertise, technologies, and capabilities unequalled by our adversaries.  This mission directly reflects several national and Department of Defense level guidance/vision documents to include the National Security Strategy, Unified Command Plan, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Counterproliferation Interdiction, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, National Military Strategy, Global Development of Forces, Global Employment of Forces, National Military Strategy for Combating WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex), and Nuclear Posture Review.  To achieve this mission, DTRA has identified principal objectives along with strategies and tasks to ensure the objectives are met.  These objectives are:
1)	Ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent;
2)	Anticipate emerging WMD threats;
3)	Provide Counter WMD (CWMD) situational awareness;
4)	Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities;
5)	Prevent proliferation and use of WMD;
6)	Defend against WMD threats;
7)	Defeat WMD threats;
8)	Recover from WMD consequences;
9)	Synchronize countering WMD activities.

The Proliferation, Prevention, and Defeat program element reduces WMD proliferation and enhances WMD defeat capabilities through advanced technology development.  To accomplish this objective, eight project areas were developed: RA-Information Science and Applications, RE-Counter-Terrorism Technologies, RF-Detection and Forensics Technologies, RG-Defeat Technologies, RI-Nuclear Survivability, RM-WMD Counterforce Technologies, RR-Combating WMD Test and Evaluation, and RT-Target Assessment Technologies.  These projects support technology requirements in line with the Joint Functional Concepts (Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease in FY 2013 from the previous President's Budget submission is predominately due to Congressional reductions and the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) transfer.  The increase in FY 2015 from the previous President's Budget Submission is a result of the net effect of decreased investments in nuclear detection, nuclear treaty technology, counter-terrorism/counterproliferation support and reachback tools and increased investment in the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize, and assess technologies in RT-Target Assessment Technologies.  This project has the only identified solution capable of meeting a time sensitive, mission critical technology gap.  Reduced investment impacted RA-Information Science and Applications, RE-Counter Terrorism Technologies, RF-Detection and Forensics Technologies, RG-Defeat Technologies, and RI-Nuclear Survivability.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Information Science and Applications project provides (1) Technical Reachback support to create decision advantage for the United States and our Allies through improved situational understanding across the complete Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) mission space and (2) research and development support for cooperative programs, technology demonstrations, and vulnerability assessments that enhance foreign partner ability to assess, prevent, and respond to threats and events involving weapons of mass destruction.  The Technical Reachback effort provides 24 hour/7 days per week information and analyses on potential impacts of a WMD event to Warfighters and First Responders in consult with DTRA’s Combating WMD Research and Development subject matter experts. This effort develops and integrates capabilities and processes to support WMD effects and consequences, to include secondary and tertiary effects.  This project also provides support to international CWMD science and technology cooperation by developing modifications, improvements, or new technologies and information tools suitable for foreign release and cooperative efforts. Further, this project provides the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) on-site support to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers, Europe (SHAPE) with a current primary focus on support to U.S. European Command (USEUCOM), NATO, and SHAPE in combating WMD and maintaining the NATO nuclear deterrent.  A significant element of this project includes support to Command Elements and the warfighting Combatant Commands (COCOMs) on strategies for reducing/countering the WMD threat in the COCOMs Areas of Responsibility.  This project also provides for the solution to the Secretary of Defense mandate for DTRA to account, maintain, report, and track the National Nuclear Weapons Stockpile &amp; Nuclear Weapon-Related Materiel during peacetime, crisis, and wartime.  In support of national requirements necessary to maintain a viable nuclear deterrent, the Defense Integration and Management of Nuclear Data Services provides a platform to ensure continued sustainability and viability of the nuclear weapons stockpile.

The decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the consolidation of Reachback Support operations in Project RM - WMD Counterforce Technologies in Program Element (PE) 0603160BR and increased investment in research and development analysis support funded by a transfer from PE 0602718BR.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to the completion of efforts in building partner capacity development activities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Counter-Terrorism Technologies project is an over-arching project that develops and transitions a full spectrum of new technologies to counter emergent Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) thus enabling warfighters to improve their ability to detect, disable, interdict, neutralize, and destroy chemical, biological, nuclear production, storage, and weaponization facilities.  This project supports Joint U.S. Military Forces, and in particular, the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  This research and development support directly enhances USSOCOM, the highest priority mission areas in the National Security Strategy, the National Strategy to Combat WMD, the National Military Strategy to Combat WMD, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the Guidance on the Employment of the Force, and is therefore a high priority for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).  The following efforts are included in this project:

The Counter WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) Counterproliferation (CP) research and development program is a collaborative effort with USSOCOM where the DTRA manages and sub-allocates funding directly to USSOCOM to develop warfighter-unique technologies in support of USSOCOM’s Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation (CT/CP) mission.  New CT/CP technologies are developed under USSOCOM management that provides warfighters with the operational capability to counter WMD threats.

The Counter WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) technologies program builds upon collaborative efforts with the warfighter.  This program develops proofs of concept and subsequent advancements in research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and provides multi-mission capabilities that may be applied throughout the entire spectrum of warfare while significantly eliminating collateral damage.  The CWMD-T technologies program develops technologies to enable the warfighter to locate, identify, characterize, and access Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) WMDs, their production and storage facilities, and associated enablers along multiple nodes concurrently or simultaneously within the terrorist pathway to disrupt, delay, degrade, destroy, or deny WMDs while minimizing risk to U.S. forces in support of CT/CP offensive operations.

The USSOCOM Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction – Terrorism Support Program (SCSP) addresses Commander USSOCOM responsibilities under the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Unified Command Plan (UCP) for integrating and synchronizing operations and activities to prevent terrorists from developing, acquiring, proliferating, or using WMD.

The increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to increased investment in CWMD-T support to USSOCOM in FY 2014 for planned high fidelity CWMD test article development and testing and increased capabilities to address CWMD information gaps. The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominantly due to reduced investment in CWMD-T support to USSOCOM due to planned efficiencies in tool and application developments to counter WMD upstream defeat efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This project develops technologies, systems and procedures to detect, identify, track, locate, monitor and interdict strategic and improvised nuclear and radiological weapons, components, or materials in support of Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counterproliferation and nonproliferation, homeland defense, and international initiatives and agreements.  This project researches, develops, demonstrates, and transitions advanced technologies to improve operational capabilities to detect and identify nuclear and radiological weapons.  It supports the attribution process through development, demonstration, and transition of improved post-detonation National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) capabilities in the areas of materials collection, debris diagnostics and materials analysis, and prompt diagnostics and device reconstruction.  Efforts under this project also support international peacekeeping and nonproliferation objectives, on-site and aerial inspections and monitoring, on-site sampling and sample transport, and on- and off-site analysis to meet forensic, verification, monitoring, and confidence-building requirements.

The increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the relative effect of Congressional reductions in FY 2013 causing decreased investment in radiation detection.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominantly due to reduced investment in novel advanced nuclear/radiological detection technologies and emerging requirements in support of nuclear treaties implementation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of advanced technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems or rapid WMD elimination capabilities that are most relevant to the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) WMD Defeat Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and their Area of Responsibility (AOR).  This program includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation (DT&amp;E) of next-generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved based on this technology.  The program is addressing defeat of adversaries' offensive WMD programs through integration of current conventional weapons capabilities and next generation kinetic and non-kinetic solutions to provide full-spectrum asymmetric defeat options.  The program addresses requirements delineated in the Quadrennial Defense Review and Strategic Planning Guidance as codified in the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), Service requirements documents, and COCOM and Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Counter-WMD (C-WMD) capability.

The increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to increased investment in C-WMD Hard Target Defeat (HTD) Weapons Technologies efforts in FY 2014.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominantly due to reduced investment in Next Generation C-WMD Weapon Concept research and demonstration of select technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Nuclear Survivability project develops and demonstrates Radiation Hardened Microelectronics (RHM) for nuclear hardening and survivability of Department of Defense’s (DoD) systems and provides for the execution of force-on-force evaluations and nuclear weapons surety efforts to enhance the protection of nuclear resources.

The RHM program responds to DoD space and missile system requirements for RHM and photonics technology to support mission needs.  This program develops and demonstrates radiation-hardened, high performance prototype microelectronics to support the availability of RHM and photonics for DoD missions from both private sector and government organizations. 

Mighty Guardian Force-on-Force Tests aid in satisfying requirements for the Services by providing denial of access to nuclear resources in all environments: operational, storage and in transit.  The results of the evaluations identify security vulnerabilities to weapons systems that are then addressed through targeted application of research and development projects requested by the resource owners.  These projects are designed to demonstrate, test, and evaluate security enhancement systems prior to service procurement.

Nuclear Weapons Surety, as tasked by the DoD Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program, provides Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Services, and Joint Chiefs of Staff with technical analyses, studies, research, and experimental data necessary to identify and quantify risks of plutonium dispersal and Loss of Assured Safety due to accidents, fires, or natural causes during peacetime operations of the nation’s nuclear weapon systems.  Additionally, this will provide studies necessary to quantify the probability of success against targeted terrorist attacks on DoD facilities, while leveraging these risk assessment advances.  It also provides new and innovative technologies for the protection of nuclear resources in support of COCOMs and Services.  

The increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the relative impact of Congressional reductions to nuclear surety in FY 2013.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominately due to the net impact of increased investment in stockpile logistics and decreased investment in nuclear surety in FY 2015.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Counterforce Technologies project develops, integrates, demonstrates and transitions emerging/innovative technologies to support the counter WMD Mission.  This activity specifically focuses on three critical components in countering the WMD threat: (1) end-to-end planning capabilities; (2) emerging/innovative technologies; and (3) Technical Reachback support.

Developing end-to-end planning capabilities includes: weaponeering tools to aid the Combatant Command's (COCOM) targeting and weapons officers in choosing the proper weapon, fuze, and employment parameters to optimize the defeat of WMD and related hard targets delivering modernized, validated and fast running attack planning tools, and integrating software.  Leveraging attack planning tools to support force protection planners and vulnerability assessment teams.

Emerging/innovative technologies are developed, integrated, demonstrated and transitioned to provide the warfighter with an enhanced near real-time combat and battle damage assessment capability.  Capability is achieved through the development of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and weapon-based sensors, platforms, taggants, seekers and other innovative technologies to:  remotely sense, identify, track and target WMD-related threats; perform battle damage assessment/indication of strikes against these threats; and locate, track, collect, detect, selectively identify, and characterize Chemical Weapon and Biological Weapon aerosol agents released during these WMD counterforce strikes.

The Technical Reachback support provides 24 hour/7 days per week information and analyses on potential impacts of a WMD event to Warfighters and First Responders in consult with DTRA’s Combating WMD Research and Development subject matter experts.  This effort develops and integrates capabilities and processes to support WMD effects and consequences, to include secondary and tertiary effects.  

The increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to increased investment in WMD Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance activities and the consolidation of Reachback support operations from Project RA-Information Science and Applications.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>For some Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) targets and hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs), physical destruction may not be possible, practical, or desirable with current conventional weapons and employment techniques.  It may be possible or preferable, to achieve operational objectives by denying or disrupting the mission or function of the target facility.  Functional defeat, however, requires extensive and highly detailed analysis of the target.  The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining its vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and if necessary, suppressing reconstitution efforts and re-attacking the facility.  Target Assessment Technologies develops for the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) and the Intelligence Community (IC), the analytical tools and processes required to find and characterize WMD targets and HDBTs and then, in near-real-time, assess the results of attacks against those targets.  Overall objectives are to develop new methodologies, processes and technologies for detecting, locating, identifying, physically and functionally characterizing, modeling, and assessing new and existing hard and deeply buried targets to support physical or functional defeat.  Applying these processes to WMD time-dependent target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge.  The Target Assessment Technologies project is meeting this challenge through three subordinate and related activities: (1) Targeting and Intelligence Community Technologies Development; (2) Find, Characterize, Assess Technologies Development; and (3) Counter-WMD Analysis Cell (C-WAC) Technologies Development.

This program supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threat priority/focus areas 3) Capability Expansion and 4) Leveraging Science.  The Counter WMD Analysis Cell (C-WAC) Technologies Development program has cooperative Research and Development projects with the United Kingdom and Commonwealth nations.  The C-WAC project is also developing the Bio Dual-Use Analytical Tool as an aid in discriminating the employment of dual use technologies in the disguised development of bio warfare capabilities.

The increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the relative impact of Congressional reductions in FY 2013 impacting the Counter-WMD Analysis Cell (C-WAC).  The increase from FY 2014 to FY2015 is due to increased investment in the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software. This project has the only identified solution capable of meeting a time sensitive mission critical technology gap.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Nuclear Arms Control Technology (NACT) Program provides Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation (RDTE) to meet International Monitoring System (IMS) technology requirements in support of Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) implementation, compliance, monitoring, and inspection, and other existing and emerging nuclear arms control activities.  The project directly provides for the United States contribution to the IMS and addresses Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) monitoring requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD AT&amp;L).  This project conforms to the administration’s research and development priorities as related to WMD arms control and disablement.  Technical assessments are made to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs and provide the data required to inform compliance assessments, and support US monitoring policy- and decision-makers and negotiation teams.  Technology developments and system improvements are conducted to ensure the availability of these CTBT monitoring capabilities.  

Primary program emphasis is on improving sensors sustainability, operational availability, and detection capabilities against a wide range of nuclear test phenomena and associated threat origins.  The program includes development, fielding, and sustainment of specialized monitoring and analysis equipment and capabilities, procedures, persistent monitoring and associated monitoring data in direct support to the IMS and CTBT requirements.  NACT also directly supports US and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital monitoring data that are extensively used by warfighter planners, Department of Defense (DoD) and other U.S. government agencies, and international agencies.  This project directly supports the warfighting capability area of combatting WMD.

The increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the transfer of the NACT program to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).  The NACT program transferred from the United States Army Space Missile Development Command (SMDC) to DTRA in FY 2014.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

- Continue prototype sensor development, station calibration, and metrology planning. 
- Continue development of monitoring station array element calibration with focus on developing in-situ array calibration and performance monitoring capabilities.  Conduct signal capture and identification studies to reduce signal clutter, false alarms, and improve noise rejection methods and algorithms.
- Continue planning to evaluate options for performing experiments or demonstrations to evaluate system performance to monitor a planned underground or underwater detonation.  The detonation will be non-nuclear in nature but configured to simulate the release of suitable surrogate nuclear testing signatures.  All associated signatures will be acceptable to environmental and health regulations and of a nature suitable to challenge IMS monitoring technologies.
- Continue radio-xenon gas detection system development and research.  Study and evaluate atmospheric and subsurface xenon backgrounds and transport phenomenon.  
- Continue a study of baseline noble gas detection schemes and select the pathway for future radio-xenon detection options providing enhanced detection and operational capabilities and reliability.  This study is paying close attention to timeline and feasibility of implementation alternatives.
- Continue infrasound information system enhancements and development of infrasound propagation models to improve detection, identification, and discrimination of sources and signatures of interest.
-  Continue field experiments to collect data required to constrain and validate models.  Models will include fine-scale atmospheric conditions, topography, 3-D winds and effects of non-linear propagation.
-  Continue to develop a portable/rapid deployable infrasound array and standard sound source for calibrating infrasound stations/arrays.  
- Continue on-location infrasound event calibration and metrology research at established engineering and development test centers (EDTC), continue development of EDTCs to support research, testing, and evaluation relevant to station shutdowns, configuration changes, and invasive procedures, and  use EDTCs to perform primary evaluations of prototype monitoring arrays and related new technologies and all associated field testing.   
- Continue R&amp;D on support system to collect and prioritize station operator requirements to inform required design-build-test activities across the monitoring system.  Focus areas continue to be improvements to radionuclide detector cooling and functionality, filtration medium and sample head, and electronic controls.
- Continue U.S. IMS sensor event signal identification technique research and development of the transportable xenon laboratory (TXL) and associated xenon detection system and prepare for international deployment exercises and demonstrations.  Operations and maintenance performed in advance of the TXL foreign deployment will establish an operations baseline for this xenon monitoring capability and provide unique opportunities to diagnose and resolve remaining operational and technical concerns and issues, including investigating the “memory effect” recently encountered in these systems as a result of the unintended radio-xenon releases from the Fukushima reactors.  Also planned is a continuation of infrasound event clutter and false alarm reduction, and noise mitigation analyses.  
- Continue to drive improvements in radionuclide detection and measurement, including xenon gas collection/analysis systems research.  Evaluate detection limits, and yields.  The PTS technical requirements dictate that the US radionuclide laboratory (RL-16) gas system requires additional capability to meet required detection thresholds.  Develop test methods to increase xenon gas yields, improve detection efficiencies, and decrease dead volume.  To ensure RL-16 is making a high precision measurement, analysis samples will be peer reviewed and calibrated at certified laboratories.
- Continue to develop a robust, high-precision method to calibrate nuclear detectors and calibration methods to obtain the absolute calibration of the system’s nuclear detector.</r2:Text>

                                                <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threat priority/focus areas 3) Capability Expansion and 4) Leveraging Science.  Under Project RL, the Net-Centric Architecture program integrates legacy capabilities and facilitates data sharing through a net-centric framework. It provides near-real time collaborative analysis capabilities between Department of Defense (DoD) and key interagency and international partners through a globally accessible net-centric framework known as the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset (IWMDT).  The IWMDT migrates Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive (CBRNE) modeling and simulation codes to provide an integrated suite of Countering WMD decision support capabilities. The framework is the only operational CBRNE framework in the world which provides capabilities through web applications, net-centric web services, and stand-alone mobile deployments which are validated and accredited for operational use by International, National, State, and local authorities.  

The Net-Centric Architecture program includes three functional areas: 1) IWMDT, 2) IWMDT Codes, and 3) Software Assurance, Certification, and Accreditation.  The IWMDT functional area develops the architecture, defines and implements the standards to consolidate validated DTRA tools, and through this architecture, enables rapid access for planning, emergency response, and assessment capabilities.  These capabilities are used by a wide range of planners, managers, and operational and technical personnel facing the full spectrum of CBRNE threats.  The IWMDT Codes functional area develops analysis and simulation codes, and then integrates the codes into the IWMDT architecture. These activities are unique to this effort across the DoD. They directly support analysis capabilities in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Studies and Analysis Group, and Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (OSD CAPE), US Pacific Command and United States Forces Korea (USFK) offices, Republic of Korea (ROK) Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Defense Taiwan, as well as providing unique simulation capabilities to the Air Force Distributed Mission Operation Center.  The Software Assurance, Certification and Accreditation functional area supports all aspects of DTRA software development and fielding.  This sub-project extends research and development to system development and demonstration. 

The increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to increased investment for fielding of IWMDT in FY 2014.  The decrease in FY 2015 is due to the completion of IWMDT investments based on Agency priorities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
