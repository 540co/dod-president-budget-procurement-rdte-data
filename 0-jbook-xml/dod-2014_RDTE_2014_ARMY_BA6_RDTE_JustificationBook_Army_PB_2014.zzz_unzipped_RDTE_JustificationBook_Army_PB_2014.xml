                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports the design, development, acquisition, integration and fielding of realistic mobile threat simulators and realistic threat simulation products utilized in Army training and developmental and operational tests.  While this project originally funded simulators representing Soviet equipment, the changing world order has expanded the scope of this program to address other world threats.  Army Threat Simulator and Threat Simulation products are utilized to populate test battlefields for U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), to conduct developmental and operational tests, and to support Program Executive Office (PEO) required user testing in System Integration Laboratories and hardware/simulation in-the-loop facilities.  Army threat simulator and threat simulation products developed or fielded under this program support Army-wide, non-system specific threat product requirements. Each capability is pursued in concert and coordination with existing Army and tri-service capabilities to eliminate duplication of products and services, while providing the proper mix of resources needed to support Army testing and training. These battlefield simulators represent systems (e.g. missile systems, command, control and communications systems, electronic warfare systems, etc.) that are used to portray a realistic threat environment during testing of U.S. weapon systems. Simulator development is responsive to Office of the Secretary of Defense and General Accounting Office guidance for the Army to conduct operational testing in a realistic threat environment. Actual threat equipment is acquired when appropriate (in lieu of development) and total package fielding is still required (i.e., instrumentation, operations and maintenance, manuals, new equipment training, etc.). Threat simulator development is accomplished under the auspices of the Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, Threat Simulator Investment Working Group.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Network Exploitation Test Tool is a comprehensive Computer Network Operations (CNO) tool, designed for T&amp;E, to portray evolving hostile and malicious Threat effects within the cyber domain.  The program provided an integrated suite of open-source/open-method exploitation tools which were integrated with robust reporting and instrumentation capabilities.  NETT was used by Threat CNO teams to replicate the tactics of state and non-state Threat and was supported by a robust CNO development environment.  Current hacking tools and capabilities were being introduced daily to the hacking community.  The NETT program researched these new capabilities and used an in-depth process to clean, fix, and integrate required Threat tools, tactics, and techniques that were needed during T&amp;E.  Funding in FY12 allowed for the continued integration of these threats and tools, including an Application Programming Interface (API).  Updated Information Assurance and Threat validation certifications required for T&amp;E were also supported.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:Text>Continued EMD for the TIEW ENV:  TIEW ENV provided the constructive Threat representation environment for Army T&amp;E and provided the primary capability to interact between live, virtual, and constructive Threat Information Operations (IO) environments. The TIEW ENV integrated Threat IO (Electronic Attack, Electronic Support, Computer Network Operations) models into the One Semi-Automated Force (OneSAF) baseline. The models' representative effects were also integrated through use with Communications Effects Servers. Integration of OneSAF with the Integrated Threat Force (ITF) enabled the Live and Constructive T&amp;E environments to interface.  To date the program had completed numerous models to include Communications Jamming (simulates frequencies, ranges, spot, barrage, and other behaviors); Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) Jamming (can jam GPS frequencies in variety of ways by adjusting the parameters and can emulate real GPS jammers); GPS Repeater Jammer (offset GPS signals so as to provide false location reports.  Had several adjustable behavioral parameters); Spoofer Jammer (offsets GPS signals so as to provide false location reports with several adjustable behavioral parameters); and Signal Intelligence/Direction Finding (SIGINT/DF) (detector models that work with each other to triangulate and then report on emissions of various frequencies and was parameter adjustable).  The program continued to develop the Computer Network Operations (CNO) cyber model which build CNO entities (hacker entities, systems, networks, etc.) that can be attacked, defended, and exploited (Disruption, Delay, Denial of Service, Destruction, and Injection) as well as allowed live attacks to interact with the constructive environment for large enterprise asset emulation cyber attacks, all within OneSAF.  The program also began the development of the Threat Cellular Network Model (TCNM) which was building the threat cellular and landline interfaces needed to emulate the communications systems often found in theater as used by enemy combatants.  The TIEW ENV program also integrated the capability to communicate, via the ITF, with live assets including the CICADA jammer, Threat Signal Injection Jammers (TSIJ), Wideband Configurable Controlled Jammer (WCCJ) and the Networked Electronic Support Threat Sensors (NESTS).</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program funds aerial and ground target hardware and software development, maintenance, and upgrades.  The overall objective is to ensure validation of weapon system accuracy and reliability by developing aerial and ground targets essential for test and evaluation (T&amp;E).  These targets are economical and expendable, remotely controlled or stationary, and often destroyed in use.  The Army is the Tri-Service lead under Reliance for providing rotary wing, mobile ground, towed, and designated targets for T&amp;E.  The Army executes development of some Service-peculiar target requirements in support of quality assurance, lot acceptance, and training and continues development of Service-peculiar and on-going target materiel upgrades to maintain continuity with current weapons technology and trends in modern and evolving Army weapons.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Aerial Targets support Army Transformation by providing for development, acquisition, operation, storage, update, and maintenance of realistic surrogate or acquired threat high-performance, multi-spectral aerial targets and development of virtual target computer models of aerial targets. Modern weapons require test, evaluation, and training using threat representative aerial targets to assess their effectiveness on the battlefield.  This program encompasses a family of rotary and fixed-wing targets; full-scale, miniature, and subscale targets; virtual targets; ancillary devices; and their control systems.  These products are required to adequately stress weapon systems undergoing test and evaluation (T&amp;E).  In order to stress systems during T&amp;E, aerial targets must have flight characteristics, signatures, and other performance factors that emulate the modern threat.  This program includes long-range planning to determine future target needs and development of coordinated requirement documents; the management of target research, development, test and evaluation process; execution of the validation process to ensure that surrogate targets adequately represent the threat; development and acquisition of surrogate and acquired targets; and continuing maintenance, storage, and development/enhancement/update via engineering services of the developed and acquired threat targets to ensure availability for the T&amp;E customer.  The Army is the Reliance lead for rotary wing targets and towed target developments and the Tri-Service lead for procurement and enhancement of the MQM-107 fixed wing target.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program funds Army efforts to support test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of advanced weapon systems and supports Army Transformation by developing surrogates, acquiring foreign equipment and developing virtual target computer models of ground vehicle targets. These products are required to adequately stress weapon systems undergoing T&amp;E. This tasking includes long-range planning to determine future target needs and development of coordinated requirement documents; the centralized management of the ground target research, development, test and evaluation processes; execution of the validation process; acquisition of foreign equipment; and continuing maintenance, storage, and development/enhancement/update via engineering services of developed and acquired targets to ensure availability for T&amp;E customers. This program also manages use of current assets and operates centralized spare parts program. The US Army is the Tri-Service lead for providing mobile ground targets for T&amp;E.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The program also funds development and acquisition of Operational Test Command's (OTC) major field instrumentation.  Requirements for instrumentation are identified through a long range survey of project managers, Research Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs), and Battle Laboratories developing future weapon systems and the test programs that support these systems.  Army testing facilities are also surveyed to determine major testing capability shortfalls.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops and acquires major test instrumentation to perform developmental testing of weapon systems at U. S. Army Test and Evaluation Command's (ATEC) activities which include: Yuma Test Center (YTC), AZ; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), MD; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), AZ; White Sands Test Center (WSTC), NM; Redstone Test Center (RTC), AL. 

Projects are designated as a major test program based on their visibility, assessed relative technical risk (medium-high), schedule risk, cost (generally greater than $1.5 Million per year or $7.5 Million for the total project) and applicability to other mission areas or services.  These projects are technically demanding, state-of-the-art, unique instrumentation assets or suites to meet the technology shortfalls, and generally result from development programs managed by a professional project management team.  
Fiber Optic Network II (FON II) is the installation of digital fiber optic cable and transmission electronics to modernize, secure and expand the backbone telecommunication and data transmission network in support of Aberdeen Test Center.  Systems Test and Integration Laboratory (STIL) is the development of a systems integration and test lab for use in developmental testing and integration engineering, including a virtual test environment to support integration testing of aviation electronic systems as a part of modernization of army aircraft.  Advanced Distributed Modular Acquisition System (ADMAS) Product Improvement Program (PIP) develops very small and low power pocket sized ADMAS systems which will extend the Versatile Information Systems Integrated Online system's (VISION) capabilities to support dismounted and small robotic platforms.  Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP) will replace obsolete tracking radars at Redstone Test Center (RTC), Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) and Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) with modern instrumentation radars.  CRIIS Objective Program provides precision location instrumentation which will significantly increase the T&amp;E ranges' capability to meet the test instrumentation needs of the tri-service range users.  Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) Electromagnetic Radiation Effects (EMRE) Systems Modernization will upgrade equipment at the WSMR EMRE site where E3 testing is performed to evaluate survivability and vulnerability of military systems.  Project will upgrade and replace signal transmitters, refurbish an anechoic test chamber, replace data acquisition equipment and install a new turntable to support test items.  Nuclear Effects Test Capability Modernization upgrades nuclear facilities at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR).  These upgrades include the Relativistic Electron Beam Accelerator (REBA), Fast Burn Reactor, Gamma Range Facility, Linear Electron Accelerator (LINAC), Electromagnetic Pulse and the Solar Furnace. Warrior Injury Assessment Manikin (WIAMan) Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) plans to develop and produce Warrior-representative ATDs that incorporate associated biomedically-validated injury assessment tools to better characterize dynamic events and injury risks measured in Live Fire Test &amp; Evaluation (LFT&amp;E) and vehicle development efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Major Instrumentation and Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) in Support of Network Integration Test will develop Major Instrumentation and M&amp;S efforts in support of Network Integration Test related to data and voice communications upgrades for White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), additional common data collection devices, and updated, Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC)-wide, distributed data storage, analysis software, and tools. In addition, development and fielding a Real-Time, Hardware-in-the-Loop, M&amp;S Federation, which can be accredited and portray Blue and Threat Computer Network Device (CND) and Controller Area Network (CAN). 
 
Test and Training Common Technology Initiative, Network, Real Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA), Data Collection and After Action Review (AAR) will develop and sustain Army Test and Training Instrumentation Test Bed, support Trade-Off Studies, Development of Common Standards, Analysis of Alternatives, Cost Benefit Analyses, Test Technology Demonstrations and/or Technology Readiness Events. This capability will also provide risk reduction to future developed assets required to meet test and training needs. These tools will collect, store and analyze data from this new dimension of digital battlefield warfare. This effort responds to the current Operations Tempo (OPTEMPO) and Personnel Tempo (PERSTEMPO) demands to force the U.S. Army by virtually replicating a greater number of troop resources in force-on-force testing and training exercises to conduct more realistic, accurate, and comprehensive evaluations at reduced costs.  

Operational Test Command (OTC) Advanced Simulation &amp; Instrumentation Systems (OASIS) Enterprise Integration System (EIS) supports the OTC simulation and test support capabilities will transition to Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) Test and Evaluation Enterprise Architecture (ATEA).  Operational testing of enterprise/systems of systems (SoS) capabilities requires an integrated test technology tools enterprise: 1) Test Planning &amp; Control systems/networks, 2) Live-virtual-constructive (LVC) simulations, 3) Data Collection, Reduction, Analysis (DCRA), and visualization tools and 4) tactical systems and networks. The OASIS-EIS will support test tool integration in three major areas:  1) harmonize OT test technology integration with other acquisition efforts (RTCA, networks, data collection) at the ATEC level, 2) Joint Network Emulation (JNE) program management to PEO-STRI (PM-ITTS) to support leverage by other PEO STRI and ATEC offices (initially TSMO, EPG and RTC), and 3) develop an ATEC and PEO-STRI program to achieve efficiencies and cost savings through shared development and enhancement of key simulation (primarily gaming, virtual, and constructive), and LVC integration capabilities.  Initial focus for shared simulation/LVC enablers will be in the area of network, fires and ISR simulations and LVC architecture planning, engineering and integration tools.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Funding provided the connecting infrastructure within the enterprise to create a comprehensive operational testing Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) environment which also enabled and supported test control, and data collection, reduction and analysis (DCRA).  Developed and delivered capabilities that were necessary to adequately support evaluation of emerging systems.  Systems lacked the capabilities needed to collect test data during operational tests to provide an adequate level of confidence.  Without the necessary data, evaluations of Army systems will be inaccurate and incomplete. Testing of complex systems was too expensive, and augmentation of system under test and ensuring confidence in the test is the only cost effective method.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program funds the RAND Arroyo Center, the Department of the Army's Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) for studies and analysis.  The Arroyo Center draws its researchers from RAND's staff of nearly 700 professionals trained in a broad range of disciplines.  Most staff members work in RAND's principal locations-Santa Monica, California; Arlington, Virginia; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The RAND Arroyo Center provides for continuing analytical research across a broad spectrum of issues and concerns, grouped in four major research areas:  Strategy, Doctrine, and Resources; Military Logistics; Manpower and Training; and Force Development and Technology.  The RAND Arroyo Center research agenda is primarily focused on mid/long-term concerns.  Results and analytical findings directly affect senior leadership deliberations on major issues.  Arroyo Center research is sponsored by the Chief of Staff, Vice Chief, the Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the Army; the Army Assistant Secretaries; and most of the Army's major commands.  The Arroyo Center is provided guidance from the Army through the Arroyo Center Policy Committee (ACPC), which is co-chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology).  The ACPC reviews, monitors, and approves the annual Arroyo Center research plan.  Each project requires General Officer (or SES equivalent) sponsorship and involvement on a continuing basis.  RAND Arroyo provides the Army with a unique multidisciplinary capability for independent analysis.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Note: In FY14 along with funding being realigned to Army Kwajalein Atoll, additional increase reflects two major focus areas:  increase in facility Sustainment, Restorization, and Modernization (SRM) / increase to address critical Information Technology (IT) infrastructure / DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) compliance.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll/Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (USAKA/RTS), located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Its function is to support test and evaluation of major Army and DoD acquisition programs and to provide space operations (surveillance and object identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and space programs.  Programs supported include Army missile defense, Air Force and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonic developmental tests; Missile Defense Agency (MDA) demonstration/validation tests; , USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (inc contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and NASA Space Shuttle and orbital debris experiments.  USAKA/RTS is a government-managed/contractor-operated (GMCO) site and is dependent upon its associated support contractors for operations and maintenance (O&amp;M).  Program funds contractors to accomplish O&amp;M for both the RTS instrumentation suite and installation/base operations and provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optics cable system.  Funding is required to maintain O&amp;M support, while accepting moderate risk of continued degradation of USAKA/RTS infrastructure (housing, offices, and facilities), higher future repair costs, and reduced logistical support capability.  The instrumentation suite consists of a number of sophisticated, one-of-a-kind, radar, optical, telemetry, command/control/communications, safety, and data reduction systems.  These systems include the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site (KREMS); Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker (SRADOT) long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by nine antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis/reduction hardware/software.  The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar (ALTAIR), and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment (TRADEX) radars located at USAKA/RTS, are two of only three radars world-wide that have deep-space tracking capability.  The Millimeter Wave Radar (MMW) is the most powerful imaging radar in the world.  Funding enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at USAKA/RTS.  This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of USAKA/RTS.  Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system and the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon technology development program; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, Flexible Target Family (FTF), and Family of Systems; NASA's Space Transportation System (STS), Small Expendable Deployer System and Orbital Debris Measurement Programs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The U.S. Army Kwajalein (USAKA) located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Its function is to support test and evaluation of major Army and DoD acquisition programs and to provide space operations (surveillance and object identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and space programs.  USAKA is a government-managed/contractor-operated (GMCO) site and is dependent upon its associated support contractors for operations and maintenance (O&amp;M).  Program funds contractors to accomplish O&amp;M for installation/base operations other Installation Services Support (ISS).  Funding is required to maintain O&amp;M support, while accepting moderate risk of continued degradation of USAKA infrastructure (housing, offices, and facilities), higher future repair costs, and reduced logistical support capability.  Other ISS consists of: Medical services, education services, food /grocery services and logistical requirements needed to support Installation Operations and Management and ensure the continued T&amp;E and space operations of the Regan Test Site as a Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) activity.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS), located with the U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll (USAKA) in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Its function is to support test and evaluation of major Army and DoD acquisition programs and to provide space operations (surveillance and object identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and space programs.  Programs supported include Army missile defense, Air Force and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonic developmental tests; Missile Defense Agency (MDA) demonstration/validation tests; , USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (inc contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and NASA Space Shuttle and orbital debris experiments.  RTS is a government-managed/contractor-operated (GMCO) site and is dependent upon its associated support contractors for operations and maintenance (O&amp;M).  Program funds contractors to accomplish O&amp;M for RTS instrumentation suites and provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optics cable system.  The instrumentation suite consists of a number of sophisticated, one-of-a-kind, radar, optical, telemetry, command/control/communications, safety, and data reduction systems.  These systems include the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site (KREMS); Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker (SRADOT) long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by nine antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis/reduction hardware/software.  The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar (ALTAIR), and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment (TRADEX) radars located at USAKA/RTS, are two of only three radars world-wide that have deep-space tracking capability.  The Millimeter Wave Radar (MMW) is the most powerful imaging radar in the world.  Funding enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at RTS.  This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of RTS.  Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system and the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon technology development program; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, Flexible Target Family (FTF), and Family of Systems; NASA's Space Transportation System (STS), Small Expendable Deployer System and Orbital Debris Measurement Programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

FY14 is the first year of incremental funding until 100% of the requirement is funded in FY 2017 and beyond.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Army Experimentation mission enables integrated examinations with US Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), Army Test and Evaluation Commnad (ATEC), Research, Development and Experimentation Command (RDECOM), Army battle laboratories, operational units, researach labs materiels developers, industry and academia to collaborate in the development, refinement, and assessment of future force concepts.  The intended outcome of this integrative effort is to develop concept capability plans that inform the Capabilities Integration Development System (CIDS) process and define future requirements, enabling identification and acquistion of critical Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leader Development, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) capabilities for the future force to provide land power capabilities needed by Joint and Army commanders.  In FY 2012-2018, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding specifically enables the World Class Blue Force (subject matter experts overseeing and coordinating experiments efforts from Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) proper in collaboration with the Schools and Centers), support for Red Cell analysis, and support to Maneuver Brigade Experiments.  Experimentation enables enhanced situational awareness, planning requirements, employment and management of accelerated decision cycles in a network-enabled force, and training requirements of new and emerging technologies.

ARCIC, Accelerated Capabilities Division (ACD) (formerly Asymmetric Warfare Division) develops immediate capability solutions in support of the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA) prioritized Current Force capability gaps (i.e. Force Protection, Networked Battle Command, Logistics and Medical in Counterinsurgency Operations (COIN) and Soldier Protection).  ACD conducts Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and DOTMLPF analysis required to ensure capability gap candidate solutions are properly integrated prior to being equipped to deployed forces.  Supports pre-deployment and in-theater assessments to ensure candidate solution meet identifiied requirements, support tactics, techniques and procedures development for use by deployed forces, and ensure equipped systems provide the necessary capability to fill an identified gap.  These assessments support determination of a path forward for equipped system by identifying them as a potential Program of Record (POR) or sustain in theater.  CONOPS, DOTMLPF-Cost analysis and assessment assist deployed forces by ensuring they are able to properly employ equipped systems and assist senior Army leadership in determining how best to resource solution to high priority capability gaps.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Army Experimentation is the conduct of experiments involving Soldiers and Leaders within live, virtual, and contructive environments of exploring concepts, capability requirements and solutions across Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) domains in order to learn and mitigate risk for current and future forces.  Experiments inform Army future concepts and assess high-risk conceptual assumptions in order to focus required capabilities and represent the user's requirements in the future Army.  TRADOC's partnership with ASA(ALT) in connecting Soldiers to the ideas and capabilities earlier rather than later, provides essential user feedback and assists the acquisition community with informing the Army's investment portfolio and decreasing the number of engineering design changes.  Army experiments use the combined resources of Army battle laboratories, operational units, research labs, materiel developers, industry and academia to collaborate in the development, refinements, and assessment of future force concepts - to inform capability developments and validate concepts for current and future force.  In FY12-18, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding enables World Class Blue Force (WCBLUFOR) to provide technical and tactical expertise in Army experiment efforts, in collaboration and integration with Joint, Interagency, Intergovermental, and Multinational partners.  In the near-term, Army experimentation will focus on Prevent, Shape, and Win as foundational elements for this campaign, assessed across all joint campaign phases, with Army level issues across the breadth of a champaign that highlights integration of Army 2020 initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>The Army has not established an approved mechanism to train non-standard equipment within operational formations or CoEs.  This deficiency compels training independent of evaluated/verifiable methods.  There is minimal assistance in the development of Training Support Packages (TSP) and varying levels of oversight to validate if the maximum benefit of the training and capability has been attained.  This incongruity is detrimental to effective and consisitent training for the force.  Training for accelerated capabilities is accomplished primary through mandated New Equipment Training (NET) with no process for follow on efforts.  Supports TRADOC CoEs in development of Pilot Training Programs to establish process for the integration on non-standard capability training.</r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>11. Adjustments to Budget Years - Army consolodated three Test and Evaluation Command Headquarters: Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), Developmental Test Command (DTC), and Army Evaluation Center (AEC). As a result of this consolidation, ATEC aligned all requirements under one Program Element. Funds reprogrammed effective FY14.

13. Other Adjustments 2 - Restoral of RMD703 wedge placed erroneously in PE0605601A: efficiency - civilian hiring freeze (99,568 in FY2012).

14. Other Adjustments 3 - Adjustment due to RMD700A1 issued 7 December 2012, directing HME funding by realigning funds from PE0605601A to PE0605602A for fiscal years FY2014 (3,464) and FY2015 (4,152)</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This project provides the institutional funding required to operate the developmental test activities, in accordance with Section 232 of the FY2003 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), required by Department of Defense (DOD) Program Executive Officers, Program and Product Managers, and Research, Development, and Engineering Centers.  Resources provided by this project operate seven elements of the DOD Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB):  White Sands Test Center (WSTC),White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; High Energy Laser System Test Facility (HELSTF), White Sands Test Center, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; and Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC) Fort Greely, Alaska and Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC) at various locations.  This project also funds the Army's developmental test capability at Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. 
This project finances the overhead (institutional) test operating cost not appropriately billed to test customers, recurring test infrastructure/capability sustainment requirements, replacement of test equipment, test operating procedures, and test revitalization/upgrade projects to maintain current testing capabilities and improvements to safety, environmental protection, efficiency of test operations, and technological advances.  The developmental test capabilities at these test ranges have been uniquely established, are in place to support test and evaluation (T&amp;E) requirements of funded weapons programs, and are required to assure technical performance, adherence to safety requirements, reliability, logistics supportability, Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation, transportability, environmental effects, electromagnetic effects, and quality of materiel in development and in production.
In accordance with the FY03 NDAA, this project funds the indirect test costs associated with the rapid testing of systems and equipment needed in support of the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), such as individual soldier protection equipment and up-armoring the Army's wheeled vehicle fleet.  This project sustains the developmental Test &amp; Evaluation capability required to support Army as well as Joint Service or Other Service systems, materiel, and technologies.  Types of systems scheduled for developmental testing include; Aircraft, Air Delivery, Unmanned Aerial Systems, Unmanned Ground Vehicles, Air and Missile Defense Systems, Engineering Equipment, Direct fire, Indirect fire, Nonlethal weapons, Ammunition, Automotive Systems, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Ground Soldier System, Missiles, Rockets, Directed Energy Weapons, Network Centric and Command, Control, and Communication.
Specific systems supported in FY13 with continued support in FY14 include:  Network Integration Evaluations (NIE), personnel protective equipment (including Body Armor), up-armoring vehicle ballistic protection on route clearance vehicles, Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles Long Term Armor Strategy (FMTV LTAS), and Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV); Stryker upgrades; armor gun shields for tactical vehicles; reactive and active armor; Individual Semi-Automatic Airburst System (XM25 ISAAS); the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles; Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (RAM); Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Unitary Rocket; Counter Remote Control IED (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW); Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T); Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A); Aviation Transformation (AH-64 Block III); aviation protection systems (Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) and Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM), missile defense (PAC-3), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)); Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS); Unmanned Aerial Systems (Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems, Extended Range Multi-Purpose, Hunter, RQ-16 Class I UAS, Long Endurance Multi-INT Vehicle (LEMV, Telluride, Raven)); Unmanned Ground Vehicles (Small Unmanned Ground Vehicle (SUGV), Grey Eagle, Kiowa Warrior Upgrades, CMWS Hostile Fire Indication, Excalibur, Green Ammo, Nett Warrior, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P) Aircraft Hostile Fire Detection System (HFDS), Paladin Integrated Management (PIM), and Longbow Hellfire Modular Missile System (LBHMMS)).
Direct costs are borne by materiel developers in accordance with DoD Directive 3200.11 and DOD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14R.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides the institutional funding required to operate the developmental test activities, in accordance with Section 232 of the FY2003 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), required by Department of Defense (DOD) Program Executive Officers, Program and Product Managers, and Research, Development, and Engineering Centers.  Resources provided by this project operate seven elements of the DOD Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB):  White Sands Test Center (WSTC),White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; High Energy Laser System Test Facility (HELSTF), White Sands Test Center, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; and Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC) Fort Greely, Alaska and Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC) at various locations.  This project also funds the Army's developmental test capability at Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. 
This project finances the overhead (institutional) test operating cost not appropriately billed to test customers, recurring test infrastructure/capability sustainment requirements, replacement of test equipment, test operating procedures, and test revitalization/upgrade projects to maintain current testing capabilities and improvements to safety, environmental protection, efficiency of test operations, and technological advances.  The developmental test capabilities at these test ranges have been uniquely established, are in place to support test and evaluation (T&amp;E) requirements of funded weapons programs, and are required to assure technical performance, adherence to safety requirements, reliability, logistics supportability, Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation, transportability, environmental effects, electromagnetic effects, and quality of materiel in development and in production.
In accordance with the FY03 NDAA, this project funds the indirect test costs associated with the rapid testing of systems and equipment needed in support of the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), such as individual soldier protection equipment and uparmoring the Army's wheeled vehicle fleet.  This project sustains the developmental Test &amp; Evaluation capability required to support Army as well as Joint Service or Other Service systems, materiel, and technologies.  Types of systems scheduled for developmental testing include; Aircraft, Air Delivery, Unmanned Aerial Systems, Unmanned Ground Vehicles, Air and Missile Defense Systems, Engineering Equipment, Direct fire, Indirect fire, Nonlethal weapons, Ammunition, Automotive Systems, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Ground Soldier System, Missiles, Rockets, Directed Energy Weapons, Network Centric and Command, Control, and Communication.
Specific systems supported in FY13 with continued support in FY14 include:  Network Integration Evaluations (NIE), personnel protective equipment (including Body Armor), up-armoring vehicle ballistic protection on route clearance vehicles, Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles Long Term Armor Strategy (FMTV LTAS), and Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV); Stryker upgrades; armor gun shields for tactical vehicles; reactive and active armor; Individual Semi-Automatic Airburst System (XM25 ISAAS); the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles; Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (RAM); Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Unitary Rocket; Counter Remote Control IED (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW); Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T); Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A); Aviation Transformation (AH-64 Block III); aviation protection systems (Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) and Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM), missile defense (PAC-3), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)); Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS); Unmanned Aerial Systems (Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems, Extended Range Multi-Purpose, Hunter, RQ-16 Class I UAS, Long Endurance Multi-INT Vehicle (LEMV, Telluride, Raven)); Unmanned Ground Vehicles (Small Unmanned Ground Vehicle (SUGV), Grey Eagle, Kiowa Warrior Upgrades, CMWS Hostile Fire Indication, Excalibur, Green Ammo, Nett Warrior, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P) Aircraft Hostile Fire Detection System (HFDS), Paladin Integrated Management (PIM), and Longbow Hellfire Modular Missile System (LBHMMS)).

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Army consolidated three Test and Evaluation Command Headquarters - Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), Developmental Test Command (DTC), and Army Evaluation Center (AEC).  As a result of this consolidation, ATEC aligned all requirements for the program management and oversight of test technology and instrumentation investment accounts under one Program Element. Funds reprogrammed effective FY2014.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program provides critical front-end investments for development of new test methodologies, test standards, advanced test technology concepts for long range requirements, future test capabilities, and advanced instrumentation prototypes for subordinate commands of the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC). These capabilities are required to support developmental testing requirements of high priority Army systems being rapidly fielded to Afghanistan, and those systems supporting Army modernization efforts. Where practical, efficiencies will be gained through the common use of developmental instrumentation in operational testing.  A key element is sustaining aging instrumentation which maintains existing capabilities at test facilities by replacing unreliable, uneconomical and irreparable instrumentation, as well as lifecycle replacement and incremental upgrades of instrumentation and software, reducing their average age to assure adequate testing capabilities. This project develops and sustains developmental test instrumentation and capabilities that provide the data necessary to support acquisition milestone decisions for all commodity areas throughout the Army. Significant examples include new instrumentation for the testing of body armor and other soldier protective equipment, advanced methods for testing the survivability of ground vehicles and aircraft, refurbishment of kineto-tracking mounts (precise optical instruments used in missile and aviation testing), and an expanded instrumentation suite in support of the growing mission to test Command, Control, Communication and Computer (C4) systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Homemade explosives are the prevalent underbody threat in Operation Enduring Freedom area of operation. Currently live fire testing cannot use Army G2-validated homemade explosive surrogate because its performance has varied greatly from test-to-test. This study will characterize subscale and full scale repeatability of Army G2-validated surrogate homemade explosive charge for use in live fire test events and compare the performance relative to TNT standard. Results from this homemade explosive characterization will inform efforts to improve combat vehicle survivability.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The US Army Test and Evaluation Command (USATEC) plans, conducts and reports on operational tests, assessments and experiments in order to provide essential information for the acquisition and fielding of War Fighting Systems.  Operational Test (OT) Instrumentation collects required data from both the systems being tested and the surrounding activities.  OT simulation enhances the live forces conducting operational testing by simulating additional units, message traffic, effects, and terrain. The Army's OPTEMPO has reduced the number of tactical units and vehicles available to support OT, making augmentation through simulation needed at times to test in a realistic, operational environment. The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) provides development of major simulation and instrumentation systems while ATEC adapts systems from other organizations, purchases off-the-shelf systems, develops minor new systems, and sustains all ATEC simulation and instrumentation systems.  The OT Simulation and Instrumentation (S&amp;I) (Sustainment and Minor Development) program funds the expertise and the adaptation, purchases, minor development and sustainment requirements that support systems undergoing OT. Costs unique to specific systems under test may require Program Manager (PM) funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This project funds analytical products necessary for inherently-governmental Army Test &amp; Evaluation Command/Army Evaluation Center's (ATEC/AEC) mission.  Products result from investigating, analyzing, assessing, and reporting on the survivability of Soldiers, and on the survivability, lethality and vulnerability (SLV) of the highest priority Army systems whether those systems are employed during stability, support, defensive, or offensive missions.  Developed through measurement, experiment, test support, and modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), the products funded by this project are used in many ways to make the Army force more survivable.  The project provides quantitative lethality and survivability analyses and data for fielded and developmental systems as the Army makes the required choices to decisively transform into a modular Brigade Combat Team (BCT) based organization.  Specific survivability analysis products include assessments of systems such as Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T), Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP), Stryker, Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV), Army fire support systems, direct fire munitions; Army air defense and missile defense systems; Army aviation systems including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; network communications and other network enabled battle command systems communication systems; and selected joint services systems particularly relevant to the Army's joint and expeditionary role.  Products also include analysis and data concerning individual Soldier items including protective equipment such as helmets and vests.  These survivability products are leveraged into rapid-equipping initiatives and other technical support for operational forces involved in the current fight.  Continued development of these products also guarantees preservation of the Army's vitally needed technical corporate memory for expert survivability advice.

Survivability analyses funded by this project are conducted across the spectrum of battlefield threats to include guns, missiles, mines and other methods of inflicting physical damage; jammers, countermeasures, and other electronic warfare techniques; information assurance and computer network operations; and directed energy weapons.  This survivability information enables developers, users, and decision makers to perform credible survivability tradeoffs for both Soldiers and materiel.  These technical survivability details enable properly informed decisions concerning systems and tactics that maximize both the combat power and survivability of Army forces.  Survivability data and analysis results funded by this project are efficiently leveraged for many different Army uses, reducing total cost to the Army by eliminating the need for duplicative capabilities funded by individual system developers.  Central funding of this mission assures the Army accurate and consistent treatment of survivability across all classes of systems, across all formal system Evaluations, and across the Army's AR 5-5 studies process.  Work program is prioritized principally by the ATEC/AEC and is used by them in the Army's formal Evaluation process in such a way that ATEC can comply with its legally mandated responsibility to assess system survivability along with effectiveness and suitability.  Program Managers (PM) and the Program Executive Officers (PEO) use the survivability analyses and data funded by this project to make design decisions that are optimized for survivability, to direct specific weapon system development efforts that are needed for survivability enhancement, and to structure product improvement programs. Soldier survivability data and analysis is leveraged to support the survivability portion of the HQDA G1 MANPRINT program.  TRADOC combat developers exploit the survivability products funded by this project to initiate and improve survivability/lethality requirements, and to develop and refine doctrine and tactics.  Also, the quantitative analytical results funded by the project are leveraged as core inputs to formal AR 5-5 studies and other studies as directed by Army leaders.  While the Army is at war, analytical results funded by this project are also directly leveraged for survivability support to current operations.  Finally, for particularly urgent or controversial survivability issues, data and analysis funded by this project are used directly by senior Army decision makers to assure technically sound program/production decisions.   
 
This project also supports highly technical specialized information assurance and computer network defense survivability analysis of Army battle command/networked systems as well as Army network architectures and technology.  Supports ATEC and other electronic warfare vulnerability testers and evaluators by developing and providing highly technical specialized field countermeasure environments that threat forces may employ against Army communications networks, air defense and other systems.

In conjunction with PMs and Army intelligence agencies, analyzes technical vulnerabilities of foreign weapons, network related systems, and intelligence Electronic Warfare (EW) systems to U.S. Army EW systems.  Provides survivability analysis to SoS Network Vulnerability Assessments to CIO G6, Network Integration Evaluation (NIE)to triad (the Brigade Modernization Command (BMC), the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), and the System of Systems Integration (SoSI)Directorate).  Without the survivability products funded by this project, ATEC would not have a technically credible account of survivability issues at milestone decision points and systems could be fielded with unknown vulnerabilities leading to unnecessary US casualties.  PMs would make design choices that failed to properly optimize survivability, TRADOC would generate requirements that were not technically credible, and the Army studies process would rest on an inaccurate and inconsistent basis.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility (HELSTF) provides a one-of-a-kind, broad based high energy laser (HEL) test and evaluation capability which directly supports testing of laser variants of the Future Combat Systems (FCS).  Specifically, HEL weapons will play a major role in the Counter Rockets, Artillery and Mortars (CRAM) initiative and can be a key component of the Future Force supporting Full Dimensional Protection. HELSTF is part of the Department of Defense (DoD) Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) and supports Tri-Service HEL research and development to include damage, vulnerability, propagation, and lethality laser testing as well as HEL weapon developmental and operational test and evaluation (DTE&amp;OTE).  The HELSTF's laser development support capabilities include a fully certified open-air HEL test range, test cells for bringing breadboard to brassboard test devices, fully integrated Command, Control, Communications &amp; Intelligence (C3I) systems and a suite of beam directors to perform both static and dynamic tracking tests.  Other capabilities include an extensive array of fully instrumented test sites, full laser meteorological support, and an approved site for above-the-horizon dynamic HEL testing certified for predictive avoidance by the Laser Clearing House.  HELSTF's location on White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) provides unparalleled testing flexibility because of WSMR's 3200 square miles of controlled land mass and 7000 square miles of controlled airspace.  This location also enables HELSTF to leverage the existing WSMR T&amp;E infrastructure. Current HELSTF facilities include the Sea Lite Beam Director (SLBD), the Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser (MIRACL), the Large Vacuum Chamber (LVC) with associated Vacuum Test System (VTS), the Solid State Laser testbed, the Tactical High Energy Laser (THEL) testbed, and the Low Power Chemical Laser (LPCL).  This multiple use facility supports testing of laser effects for targets ranging from material coupon testing up through full-scale static and dynamic targets, explosive targets, and testing of targets in a high altitude space environment.  HELSTF has embarked on its own modernization to fully upgrade its mission control systems, develop state-of-the-art HEL diagnostic capabilities, data reduction, and a mobile HEL diagnostic test suite to support DTE and OTE for potential HEL weapons in the Army Future Force in all relevant combat environments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Airworthiness Certification program ensures flight safety and safe operation of Army aircraft and aviation systems by means of technical design approval and qualification of systems to appropriate airworthiness standards.  It provides independent airworthiness qualification of all assigned developmental and in-production Army aircraft, both manned and unmanned, as required by AR 70-62, and is essential for ensuring the safe operation of Army aircraft.  This program, when fully funded, performs all engineering functions (design, analysis, testing, demonstrations, and system specification compliance) essential for certifying the airworthiness of assigned Army aircraft, to include performing safety-of-flight investigations/assessments, evaluating system risks, developing Airworthiness Impact Statements, developing Airworthiness Releases, and evaluating Safety of Flight Messages and Aviation Safety Action Messages for new and upgraded aircraft systems.  This program also provides management/execution of the Army's Aeronautical Design Standards (ADS) program; management/execution of airworthiness approval for new systems and materiel changes for all assigned Army aircraft systems; airworthiness engineering support to the Program Executive Office for Aviation (PEO Avn) and the Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO, the Army's Special Operations Aircraft program office) in developing requirements for major development/modification and for any future systems/subsystems; and management of the test and evaluation process in support of the airworthiness qualification process.  The Airworthiness Certification program also performs general research and development in support of aircraft qualification and overarching airworthiness projects that involve multiple aircraft models.  Current ongoing programs requiring airworthiness qualification are PEO Aviation and TAPO Future Force systems including Longbow Apache Block II and III; Chinook F-model; Blackhawk M-model and; Special Operations MH-47G and MH-60M; Armed Aerial Scout (AAS); Light Utility Helicopter; Gray Eagle  unmanned aircraft system (UAS); Enhanced Multi-sensor Airborne Reconnaissance and Sensor System (EMARSS); and Shadow-C UAS.  Additionally the Airworthiness Certification program supports application of other critical aviation subsystems onto Army aircraft, including Aircraft Survivability Equipment (e.g. Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM), Common Missile Warning System (CMWS), Aviation Mission Equipment (e.g. advanced multiband radios like the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) and digital data links), Common Sensor (electro-optical multi-spectrum visual sensor), and Blue Force Tracker.  The D092 funding profile for the FY14 President's Budget Submission marginally funds the airworthiness certification program and therefore the effort will be limited to resourcing military use civil derivative aircraft technical qualification through the Federal Aviation Administration's Military Certification Office; development of airworthiness procedures, specifications, critical standards, and other design and qualification documents; participation in airworthiness related tri-service activities (e.g. National Airworthiness Council, Joint Aeronautical Commanders Group) and international airworthiness related activities mandated by treaty (e.g. Flight Into Non-segregated Airspace (FINAS); and limited early airworthiness involvement in Technology Transition projects ( e.g. Joint Multi Role (JMR) Technology Demonstrator  and Future Vertical Lift aircraft) and other Office of the Secretary of Defense initiatives.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>All functions and resources in this Program Element (PE) are managed by the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC).  Meteorological support to research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) activities provides standard and specialized weather forecasts and data for test reports to satisfy Army/Department of Defense RDT&amp;E test requirements for modern weaponry, e.g., (1) unique atmospheric analysis and sampling to include atmospheric transmittance, extinction, optical scintillation, infrared temperature, aerosol/smoke cloud dispersion characteristics, and ballistic meteorological measurements; (2) test event forecasting to include prediction of sound propagation for ballistic firing tests, specialized prediction of light levels and target to background measurements, and predictions for electro-optical testing and ballistic artillery/mortar firing; and (3) advisory and warning products such as go/no-go test recommendations for ballistic and atmospheric probe missiles, smoke/obscurant tests, hazard predictions for chemical agent munitions disposal, monitoring dispersion of simulant clouds for chemical/biological detector tests, simulated nuclear blasts, and weather warnings for test range safety.  Provides technical support to Army Program Executive Officers (PEOs), Project Managers (PMs), and the Army test ranges and sites at:  White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen  Proving Ground, Maryland; Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama;  Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona (including the Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, AK); Fort Belvoir, Virginia; and Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia.  This program develops methodologies and acquires instrumentation and systems that allow meteorological teams to support current and future Army/DoD RDT&amp;E requirements.  It finances indirect meteorological support operating costs not billable to customers and replacement/upgrade of meteorological instrumentation and support systems.  Direct costs for meteorological support services are not funded by this PE, but are borne by the customer (i.e., materiel/weapons developers and project/product managers) in accordance with DoD Directive 7000.14R, October 1999.  This program is essential to the accomplishment of the Army's developmental test mission in that precise weather modeling and measurements directly influence test item performance and quantify test item weather dependencies and vulnerabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Provides technical support to Army Program Executive Officers (PEOs), Project Managers (PMs), and the Army test ranges and sites at:  White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen  Proving Ground, Maryland; Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama;  Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona (including the Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, AK); Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas; Fort Belvoir, Virginia; and Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia.  This program develops methodologies and acquires instrumentation and systems that allow meteorological teams to support current and future Army/DoD RDT&amp;E requirements.  It finances indirect meteorological support operating costs not billable to customers and replacement/upgrade of meteorological instrumentation and support systems.  Direct costs for meteorological support services are not funded by this PE, but are borne by the customer (i.e., materiel/weapons developers and project/product managers) in accordance with DoD Directive 7000.14R, October 1999.  This program is essential to the accomplishment of the Army's developmental test mission in that precise weather modeling and measurements directly influence test item performance and quantify test item weather dependencies and vulnerabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element funds Department of the Army (DA) civilians at the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA) to conduct responsive and effective materiel systems analysis in support of senior Army decision making for equipping the U.S. Army.  AMSAA conducts systems and engineering analyses to support Army decisions in technology; materiel acquisition; and the design, development, fielding, and sustaining of Army weapon/materiel systems.  As part of this mission, AMSAA develops and certifies systems performance data used in Army studies, and develops baseline systems performance methodology and Models and Simulations (M&amp;S).  

AMSAA exercises HQDA responsibility for verification, validation, and accreditation of item-level performance M&amp;S for combat effects, including the development and maintenance of common data formats.  Similarly, AMSAA also exercises HQDA responsibility for developing, maintaining, improving, verifying, validating and accrediting item-level performance data and M&amp;S for combat effects and logistics.  In support of its materiel systems analysis mission, AMSAA analyzes the performance and combat effectiveness of conceptual, developmental, and fielded systems.  Unique models and methodologies have been developed to predict critical performance variables, such as weapon accuracy, target acquisition, rate of fire, and probability of inflicting catastrophic damage, survivability, mobility and system reliability.  AMSAA generates performance and effectiveness measures and ensures their standard use across major Army and Joint studies.  AMSAA conducts and supports various systems analysis efforts across the entire materiel system life cycle, such as:  Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs); system cost/performance tradeoffs and early technology trade-offs to inform system and acquisition program risk assessments; weapons/systems mix analyses; business case analyses and cost benefit analyses; requirements analyses; technology insertion studies; reliability growth studies; Physics of Failure (PoF) analyses; and analytical support for Test and Evaluation.  AMSAA also maintains, pursuant to Army Acquisition Executive direction, the Center for Army Acquisition and Materiel Lessons Learned (CAAMLL).  These analyses are used by the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command; Army Materiel Command; Training and Doctrine Command; Army Test and Evaluation Command; Program Executive Officers/Project Managers; Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) (both Army Staff and Assistant Secretaries in the HQDA Secretariat); and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD)/Department of Defense (DoD) Leadership.  AMSAA analyses and data are used by these organizations in making acquisition, procurement, and logistics decisions in order to provide quality equipment and procedures to the Soldier. 

AMSAA's M&amp;S capabilities support the development, linkage, and accreditation of live, virtual, and constructive simulations, and provide unique tools that support systems analysis of individual systems and the combined-arms environment.  AMSAA maintains a significant number of models and simulations, most of which were developed in-house to address specific analytical requirements.  This M&amp;S infrastructure provides a hierarchical modeling process that is unique to AMSAA and allows for a comprehensive performance and effectiveness prediction capability that can be utilized to make trade-off and investment decisions prior to extensive and expensive hardware testing of proposed systems/technologies for Current and Future Force efforts.  AMSAA is the Army's executive agent for the verification, validation, and accreditation of item/system level performance models.  In this role, AMSAA assists model developers with the development and execution of verification and validation plans to ensure new models and simulations provide credible information/results for decision making.

AMSAA exercises HQDA responsibility for Army reliability methodology development.  In this role, as the Army's Executive Agent for reliability and maintainability standardization improvement, AMSAA develops and implements reliability and maintainability reform initiatives that support acquisition decisions and lifecycle management.  AMSAA develops and applies engineering approaches that assess the reliability of Army materiel and also provides recommendations on ways to improve reliability, thereby reducing logistics footprint, reducing life cycle costs, and extending failure-free periods for deployed equipment.  AMSAA's electronic and mechanical Physics of Failure (PoF) program pioneered the Army's involvement in utilizing computer-aided engineering tools in the analysis of root-cause failure mechanisms at the component level during the system design process.  AMSAA's reliability engineering and PoF tools/analyses have been used extensively to support the design improvement of developmental and fielded systems used in Current Operations resulting i</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

AMSAA conducts and supports various systems analysis efforts across the entire materiel system life cycle, such as:  Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs); system cost/performance tradeoffs and early technology trade-offs to inform system and acquisition program risk assessments; weapons/systems mix analyses; business case analyses and cost benefit analyses; requirements analyses; technology insertion studies; reliability growth studies; Physics of Failure (PoF) analyses; and analytical support for Test and Evaluation.  AMSAA also maintains, pursuant to Army Acquisition Executive direction, the Center for Army Acquisition and Materiel Lessons Learned (CAAMLL).  These analyses are used by the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command; Army Materiel Command; Training and Doctrine Command; Army Test and Evaluation Command; Program Executive Officers/Project Managers; Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) (both Army Staff and Assistant Secretaries in the HQDA Secretariat); and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD)/Department of Defense (DoD) Leadership.  AMSAA analyses and data are used by these organizations in making acquisition, procurement, and logistics decisions in order to provide quality equipment and procedures to the Soldier. 

AMSAA's M&amp;S capabilities support the development, linkage, and accreditation of live, virtual, and constructive simulations, and provide unique tools that support systems analysis of individual systems and the combined-arms environment.  AMSAA maintains a significant number of models and simulations, most of which were developed in-house to address specific analytical requirements.  This M&amp;S infrastructure provides a hierarchical modeling process that is unique to AMSAA and allows for a comprehensive performance and effectiveness prediction capability that can be utilized to make trade-off and investment decisions prior to extensive and expensive hardware testing of proposed systems/technologies for Current and Future Force efforts.  AMSAA is the Army's executive agent for the verification, validation, and accreditation of item/system level performance models.  In this role, AMSAA assists model developers with the development and execution of verification and validation plans to ensure new models and simulations provide credible information/results for decision making.

AMSAA exercises HQDA responsibility for Army reliability methodology development.  In this role, as the Army's Executive Agent for reliability and maintainability standardization improvement, AMSAA develops and implements reliability and maintainability reform initiatives that support acquisition decisions and lifecycle management.  AMSAA develops and applies engineering approaches that assess the reliability of Army materiel and also provides recommendations on ways to improve reliability, thereby reducing logistics footprint, reducing life cycle costs, and extending failure-free periods for deployed equipment.  AMSAA's electronic and mechanical Physics of Failure (PoF) program pioneered the Army's involvement in utilizing computer-aided engineering tools in the analysis of root-cause failure mechanisms at the component level during the system design process.  AMSAA's reliability engineering and PoF tools/analyses have been used extensively to support the design improvement of developmental and fielded systems used in Current Operations resulting in improved reliability, reduced Operational and Support costs, and reduced logistics expenditures and footprint.  AMSAA, in conjunction with the Army Evaluation Center, has formed the Center for Reliability Growth (CRG), which is developing critical tools, methodology, policies, formal guidance, and educational materials needed to help acquisition programs to achieve their required reliability during the acquisition process.  The reliability improvements achieved for major weapon systems will translate into billions of dollars in operating and support cost savings across the life cycle.

AMSAA's unique analytical capabilities are supporting the Army Evaluation Center to assess and determine the essential analytical requirements to enhance Army evaluations and reduce extensive testing.  AMSAA's support in this area improves evaluation products and result in better materiel solutions to the Warfighter.  AMSAA assists in various systems evaluations which support various Acquisition Category (ACAT) materiel system decisions, and provides quick response analyses in support of rapid initiatives for Current Operations.

As the Army's center for materiel systems analysis, AMSAA provides the technical capability to support Army and DoD decision makers throughout the entire acquisition process in responding to analytical requirements across the full spectrum of materiel.  AMSAA's unique in-house, consistent, integrated analytical capability is a critical asset that provides Army leadership with timely, independent, unbiased, reliable, and high quality analysis to support complex decisions required for Army Transformation and Current Operations.  AMSAA's integrated set of skills and tools are focused on its core mission to be responsive to the breadth and depth of systems analysis requirements critical in supporting Army decisions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

As a result of this consolidation, ATEC aligned all requirements for Joint Tests and Follow-On Test and Evaluations, under one Program Element. Funds reprogrammed effective FY2014.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the Army's direct costs of planning and conducting Multi-service Tests and Evaluations (MOTE) for which there is no Army Project Manager (PM) and Army requirements for Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E).  These are required to evaluate concepts and address needs and issues that occur in joint military environments and provide information required by Congress, Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Unified Commands, and the Department of Defense components relative to joint operations.  This project also funds Follow-on Test and Evaluation (FOTE), as necessary.  FOTE may be required after a full production decision to assess system training and logistics, to verify correction of deficiencies identified during earlier testing and evaluation, and to ensure that initial production items meet operational effectiveness, suitability and supportability thresholds.  There has been a shift of focus for items funded by this project due to continuing operations in the US Central Command (CENTCOM).  Traditional system workload has dropped off and has been replaced by rapid fielding initiatives.  In response to this shift, the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) has established a forward operational assessment team in theater and a rapid response cell.  These groups facilitate MOTE, JT&amp;E, and FOTE events in the rapid environment.  Traditional acquisition requirements are expected to return to normal when operations in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Army consolidated three Test and Evaluation Command Headquarters, Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), Developmental Test Command (DTC), and Army Evaluation Center (AEC).  As a result of this consolidation, ATEC aligned all requirements for the Operational Test Command (OTC), subordinate command to ATEC, under one Program Element. Funds reprogrammed effective FY2014.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Operational Test Command (OTC) conducts operational tests required by public law that provide significant data to the Army decision-makers on key Army systems and concepts.  This project finances recurring costs for the Operational Test Command that are essential for conducting realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training.  These recurring costs include civilian pay, requirements for test support contracts, temporary duty, supplies and equipment.  This project funds requirements for the Operational Test Command's eight test directorates and one support activity located at Fort Hood, TX; Fort Bragg, NC; Fort Sill, OK/Ft. Bliss, TX; and Fort Huachuca, AZ. The primary mission of these test directorates is to perform detailed planning, execution, and reporting of Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOTE), and Force Development Test and Experimentation (FDTE). Project V02 currently provides support for the one Test and Evaluation Coordination Offices (TECOs) located at Fort Leonard Wood, MO and one Infantry Support Cell at Fort Benning, GA.  TECOs previously located in Fort Lee, VA and Fort Knox, KY have been consolidated in Fort Benning, GA.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army Evaluation Center (AEC) provides independent and integrated technical and operational evaluations, and life-cycle Continuous Evaluation (CE) of assigned Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP), Major Automated Information Systems, and In-Process Review (IPR) programs for major milestone decisions, materiel changes, and materiel releases in support of the Army Acquisition Executive, other Service Acquisition Executives, Joint Program Executive Officers, other governmental agencies, and force development.  AEC is The Army's independent evaluator.  AEC develops the evaluation strategy, designs tests, and evaluates the test results to address a system's combat effectiveness, suitability, and survivability factors pertinent to the decision process, such as:  Critical Operational Issues and Criteria (COIC), system performance, soldier survivability, performance in countermeasures, system survivability, reliability, supportability, etc.  AEC has the lead in planning and execution of Army Live Fire Tests and Continuous Evaluations through its evaluation and test design responsibilities.  The evaluations produced by AEC are required by the Army Chief of Staff, the Army Acquisition Executive, other Army, Service, Joint, and agency senior leaders and the Department of Defense Director of Operational Test and Evaluation for acquisition decisions.  In addition, Army leadership has recognized the numerous benefits of an early involvement initiative.  Test management and safety verification is also supported by this program element.

This project funds the salaries of civilian employees conducting T&amp;E early involvement, evaluation and test design missions and associated personnel support/sustainment costs including: temporary duty, professional training, supplies, and equipment.  This project does not finance test facility operations, test instrumentation or test equipment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Endstate was to have a valid, accredited model to evalute crew survivability. Also, provided Center for Reliability and Growth in response to DUSD (ATL) and AAE policies mandating Reliability Growth programs and periodic assessments for major systems.  These DOD and DA policies became Public Law 111-23 (The Weapon System Reform Act of 2009 - signed 22 May 2009).  The Law emphasized that the service acquisition executive must ensure acquisition personnel had appropriate training and expertise to formulate robust RAM growth programs.   The policies and Law were a result of a Defense Science Board report on Developmental Test and Evaluation (May 2008), showing that there had been a significant increase in the number of Department of Defense weapon system programs evaluated as not being operationally suitable.  The report showed that about two thirds of Army systems from 1997 to 2006 failed to meet their realiability requirements during operational testing - primarily due to lack of material readiness due to poor system reliability and maintenance (RAM).  Funding provided resources dedicated to developing critical tools, methodologies, policies, formal guidance, and educational materials required to implement new policies and improve weapon system reliability.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:Description>Supports the Commanding General's early involvement initiative which positions acquisition certified liaison officers at 2 Joint and 9 Army Program Executive Offices (PEO), TRADOC/ARCIC, REF, JIEDDO, and RDECOM.  Assigned personnel provide continuous support to materiel and combat developers from the inception of their programs.  The early involvement of LNOs supports the sections of the ATEC Mission Essential Task List (METL) that apply to ongoing contingency operations.  ATEC performance continues to meet 120 day rapid equipping requirement set by the CSA. Liaison officers continue to enable ATEC to sustain rapid, flexible T&amp;E support in the evaluation of Rapid Initiative Systems, Counter IED systems, and Urgent Material Releases.  Effort results in cost savings, cost avoidance and critical design efficiencies being identified early in a system's development, thereby avoiding more expensive product improvement programs later in a system's life cycle.  T&amp;E efficiency gains continue to be realized through early identification of instrumentation, modeling and simulation tools, and other resources needed for testing, as well as making more efficient use of data from developmental testing and experiments.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>"Army Modeling and Simulation Cross-Command Collaboration and Integration (M&amp;SC3I)" promotes the goal to achieve affordable, interoperable and networked Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities.  In support of Army operations, Generating-Force functions and institutional processes, M&amp;SC3I addresses analytical efforts underlying decision making, capability development, and life-cycle costs by capitalizing on M&amp;S technologies (accomplished through collaborative efforts of the training/operations and acquisition communities).  The RDTE component of M&amp;SC3I encompasses efforts that (1) develop/improve new/existing models and simulations to reduce time, resources and risks associated with operational/institutional decision making and the acquisition process and (2) advance the following disciplines: M&amp;S research, analysis and experimentation; simulation technology; and M&amp;S tools and services.  M&amp;SC3I addresses development of tactics and doctrine, experimentation and exercises, traditional weapon system development, and assessment and transition of advanced technologies to operational capabilities.  The overarching goal of M&amp;SC3I is to reduce time and cost of providing improved capabilities to the war fighter.  Emerging information-age technologies continue to revolutionize the Army's ability to collaborate among all stakeholders using data descriptions, digital representations, and virtual prototypes to improve understanding of required capabilities, shorten procurement time, reduce procurement and sustainment costs, and, ultimately, reduce total life-cycle cost.  M&amp;SC3I advocates the use of advanced technologies to enable future capabilities through improved understanding of operational requirements, collaborative analyses of emerging technologies, and cross-community participation in experiments and exercises.  The following are discussions of efforts under the two projects of PE 0605718.  Under project S03, "Analysis M&amp;S Tools and Services," the Army develops M&amp;S tools and services (e.g., hardware, software, infrastructure) for the Army's analysis community.  The primary users of these tools and services are the Training and Doctrine Command Analysis Center (TRAC), the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), and the Center for Army Analysis (CAA).  Efforts focus on (1) development of analysis tools that will enable assessment of emerging technologies during concept exploration and (2) development of infrastructure and enabling technologies to support the Current and Future Force.  These critical efforts are required for (1) analysis-of-futures work to justify Army requirements, (2) assessment of alternative approaches to satisfy those requirements, (3) development of current and emerging war fighting doctrine from the tactical to the operational levels of warfare and (4) the closing of capability gaps in the areas of irregular warfare, M&amp;S data and standards, cyberspace operations, army network modeling and non-lethal weapons.  Under project S05, "Army Simulation Technology (SIMTECH)," the Army enhances force effectiveness by inducing research organizations on a short-term basis to conduct high-priority, promising simulation research initiatives that are outside the scope of Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) and Army Science and Technology (S&amp;T) programs.  Beginning with FY14, SIMTECH activities fall under the project S03, "Analysis M&amp;S Tools and Services." Project S05 ends with FY13 programs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Under the project "Analysis M&amp;S Tools and Services" the Army develops Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) tools and services (e.g., hardware, software, infrastructure) for the Army's analysis community.  The primary users of these tools and services are the Training and Doctrine Command Analysis Center (TRAC); the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA); the Center for Army Analysis (CAA); the Army Materiel Command; the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO-STRI).  Efforts focus on (1) development of analysis tools to enable assessment of emerging technologies during concept exploration, (2) development of infrastructure and enabling technologies to support the Current and Future Force and (3) application of M&amp;S capabilities to One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) that increase overall use of OneSAF software and hence reduce Army life-cycle costs.  These critical efforts are required for four essential purposes: analysis-of-futures work to justify Army requirements; assessment of alternative approaches to satisfy those requirements; development of current and emerging war fighting doctrine from the tactical to the operational levels of warfare; and the closing of capability gaps in areas of irregular warfare, M&amp;S data and standards, cyberspace operations, army network modeling, and non-lethal weapons. Project S03 also includes, beginning with FY14, the Army Simulation Technology (SIMTECH) program, which enhances force effectiveness by assisting Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) research agencies and organizations in conducting low-cost, promising simulation technology research that is outside the scope of the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) and the Army science and technology programs.  The SIMTECH program provides a source of competitive funds to Army research agencies and organizations to stimulate high quality, innovative M&amp;S research with significant opportunity for payoff in Army war fighting capability.  The SIMTECH program serves as a vehicle for major M&amp;SC3I-relalted technology breakthroughs in war gaming, embedded simulation, collaboration cabability, rapid prototyping, commercial innovation and related simulation technology (M&amp;SC3I = Modeling and Simulation Cross-Command Collaboration and Integration.)

                                    <r2:Description>Application and expansion of M&amp;S capabilities to OneSAF increases overall use of the OneSAF software to reduce Army life-cycle costs.  Increasing OneSAF capabilities leads to the goal of implementing ONE TIME (rather than through the use of multiple software products) updates and changes associated with transformation, modernization and operations across the simulation life cycle. The reduction of reduncies; i.e., multiple software products with similar or interchangable features, is an esstential outcome of the expanded OneSAF domain.  Current efforts: threat-jamming precision-guided weapons in OneSAF; micro-satellite BF SIGINT capabilities; set of web-based XML services to support integrated initialization of simulation-based mission rehearsal, planning and training with C2 standards, C2 Core and JC3IEDM. XML = Extensible Markup Language.   BF SIGINT =   Blue-Force Signals Intelligence.   C2 = Command and Control.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides funding for Headquarters (HQ) activities that support the medical research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTE) program at the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Fort Detrick, Maryland to: (1) perform planning, programming, and budgeting; (2) manage resources; and (3) ensure compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory and safety requirements.  It also provides for continued operations of contracting and acquisition management functions performed by the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of the USAMRMC Medical RDTE Program.    
    
Additionally, the USAMRMC is implementing the Medical Research Information Technology System (MeRITS), an electronic data and document-handling system needed to standardize animal and human clinical trial documentation in support of FDA requirements. This system will create centralized storage and access between Headquarters and its five subordinate laboratories.  MeRITS is an integral part of an overall USAMRMC effort to enhance its laboratories performance, efficiency, and accountability and will be integrated in FY11 with minor sustainment cost in FY 2012.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program partially funds the travel costs and administrative support (studies, analysis, interpretation, equipment, etc.) required to participate in international fora, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Army Armaments Group (NAAG), Defense Against Terrorism (DAT) and to pursue new cooperative R&amp;D initiatives and international cooperative agreements such as memoranda of understanding. This program also includes:  the United States' share of costs of the NATO Civil Budget, Chapter IX, which funds the NATO Industrial Advisory Group (NIAG) and the Special Fund for Cooperative Planning (U. S. Army is Executive Agent for this NATO bill); partially funds the Five Power Senior National Representatives, Army [SNR (A)], the Technical Cooperative Program, Bilateral SNR(A)s, and Army armaments working groups with many nations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) supports upgrading the accuracy, timeliness, availability, and accessibility of scientific, technical, and management information at all levels of the Army Research and Development (R&amp;D) community.  Management of this information is critical to achieve the goals established by the Army's Senior Leadership.  Use of accurate and timely technical information is essential to successfully meeting the milestones required on the path to the future force, allowing Army Science and Technology (S&amp;T) leadership to refine investment strategy and quickly react to emerging opportunities and issues.  This program includes initiatives to improve information derivation, storage, access, display, validation, transmission, distribution, and interpretation; to develop and enhance a single business model for Army S&amp;T knowledge management information technology; to provide for Independent Review Team analysis of technology maturity as part of the Technology Area Readiness Assessment as required by DoDI 5000.2 dated May 12, 2003 as well as the Army Science Board (ASB) (projects 720 and 727).  This program addresses the need to increase the competitiveness and availability of scientific, engineering, and technical skills in the DoD and National workforce through outreach programs aimed at middle school through college students and teachers.  By providing direct working experience for these students in Army laboratories, the programs expose these students to the working world of science and engineering (project 729).  The program includes funding for studies and analyses using behavioral science-based analytic tools to provide policy and decision makers with Soldier-oriented recommendations concerning manpower, personnel, and training issues (project 730).  The program includes funding for support for Army high performance computing centers (project 731).  The program includes funding for improvements to the Army's acquisition process (project 733).  This program supports combatant commanders and major Army commands by providing science advisors to address scientific and technical issues and by providing engineering teams to solve field Army technical problems (project C16).  Finally, this program funds studies by the Board on Army Science and Technology (BAST) (project C18).  Coordination of this program with the other Services is achieved through inter-service working groups.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secreatary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides funding for technology transfer activities to support acquisition, storage, and utilization of technical information for both military and domestic applications.  Effective exploitation of science and technology (S&amp;T) information is critical to achieving the goals established by senior Army leadership.  Activities include Army support for Federal Laboratory Consortium (FLC) as required by Public Law; the Army Science Board; the Army Science Conference; S&amp;T database management efforts; and administration of the Army's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) in accordance with the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982, the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992 and subsequent reauthorizing legislation.  Technology transfer activities make technical information available to both the public and private sectors to reduce duplication in Research and Development programs and to increase competitiveness in the US business community.  Database management efforts support development of decision aids, databases, and automation support for the management and execution of the Army Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) appropriation.  In addition, this project provides funding for patent legal expenses and fees for all Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) subordinate commands and laboratories, as required by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.

It includes the hardware, software, and contractor support required to develop and implement a set of management decision aids, databases, and hardware/software tools to support technical and budgetary decisions at the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Department of the Army (DA), including support of the Army Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Master Plan. Most of the efforts in this project are on-going activities to support Army Research, Development, and Acquisition programs.  Effective exploitation of S&amp;T information is critical to achieving the goals established by Senior Army Leadership for the future force. Funding in this program supports Independent Review Team analysis of technology maturity as part of Technology Readiness Assessments as required by DoDI 5000.2 dated May 12, 2003.  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secreatary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this project is performed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Acquisition, Logistics and Technology, The Pentagon, Washington, DC.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education activities that encourage elementary thru high school students to develop and interest in STEM and to further go on and pursues higher education and employment in the STEM fields.  Activities are consolidated under the Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP) which links and networks appropriate components to derive the best synergies to "present the Army" a larger pool of technical talent.  Programs  provide students with Army-unique practical experiences at Army laboratories, centers, and institutes; provide incentives for student competitions and support career development opportunities for students.  AEOP increases interest and involvement of students and teachers across the nation in STEM at all proficiency levels and backgrounds to include under-represented and economically disadvantaged groups through exposure to Army sponsored research, education, competitions, internships, and practical experiences.  This project enhances the national pool of science and engineering personnel that in turn supports defense industry and Army laboratory and research, development, and engineering center needs.  Educating the nation's youth in STEM will help ensure a technologically literate citizenry that is required to promote the security and economic competitiveness of the United States.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the Army's behavioral and social science research-based studies and analyses to address current and near term Soldier, training, and leader development issues.  The research provides a unique capability to address a number of issues that directly or indirectly affect Soldier and unit performance and readiness, such as the effects of changes in training on individual and unit performance, the personnel costs of alternative programs and policies and the effects of program changes on retention of quality Soldiers.  Requirements for these critical studies and analyses are solicited on an annual basis from the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA), U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (ASA(M&amp;RA)), the Army Deputy Chief of Staff(G-1), and the Human Resources Command (HRC).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides support for the Field Assistance in Science and Technology (FAST) program. The FAST program provides Science advisers, recruited from Army Materiel Command (AMC) headquarters and all AMC Major Subordinate Commands (MSC) to serve combatant commands and major commands worldwide.  FAST tours of duty provide significant professional growth opportunities for the Army's scientists and engineers and enable them to focus AMC resources on rapidly identifying and solving field technical problems that enable the improvement of readiness, safety, training, and reduce operations and support (O&amp;S) costs.  The FAST activity is supported by Quick Reaction Coordinators within the engineering centers.  The FAST program recoups many times its cost in O&amp;S savings.  FAST also provides emerging technology demonstration opportunities to the engineering centers and executes a biannual Technology Applications Conference (TAC) on a rotating basis between Forces Command, US Army Europe, US Forces Korea/Eighth Armyassists COCOMS with their annual Science and Technology Conferences.  FAST also maintains close coordination with the Navy Science Advisor Program (Naval Fleet Forces Technology Integration Office).FAST supports warfighters in OEF with embedded Science and Technology Assistance Teams (STATs) as well as Science and Technology Acquisition Corps Advisors (STACAs).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the Board on Army Science and Technology (BAST).  The BAST functions under the auspices of the National Research Council (NRC) an organization within the National Academies of Sciences and provides an external, independent, and objective source of advice to the Army.  The BAST serves as a convening authority for the discussion of science and technology issues of importance to the Army and oversees independent Army-related studies conducted by the National Academies.  Working in close coordination with the Army, the BAST helps define problems, brings together experts to study these problems, and provides recommendations.  Committees are assembled in accordance with established NRC procedures and BAST studies often take 12 months or more to conclude.  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secreatary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this project is executed extramurally by the Army Research Laboratory, Army Research Office (ARO), Research Triangle Park, NC.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element supports continuing technology investigations.  It provides a coordinated tri-service mechanism for the collection and free exchange of technical data on the performance and effectiveness of all non-nuclear conventional munitions and weapons systems in a realistic operational environment.  It provides for NATO interchangeability testing (F21); Joint munition effectiveness manuals used by all services; development of standardization agreements (STANAGS) and associated Manuals of Proof and Inspection (MOPI); operation of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC); evaluation of demilitarization methods for existing conventional ammunition (F24); evaluation of useful shelf life, safety, reliability and producibility of pyrotechnic munitions; and improvement of explosives safety criteria for DOD munitions via the DOD Explosives Safety Board (857).  Pyrotechnic Reliability and Safety (296) supports pyrotechnic research, development and testing to identify, characterize and resolve reliability, safety, storage and manufacturing issues that impact production availability and field use of pyrotechnics.  Project 296 will result in the development and demonstration of new, safe, reliable and environmentally acceptable munitions.  Munitions Survivability and Logistics (297) will make Army units more survivable by applying technologies to reduce the sensitivity of munitions to unplanned stimuli (e.g. bullet impacts, fragment impacts, fast cook off, slow cook off, sympathetic detonation, shaped charge jets) and by testing and demonstrating munitions logistics system solutions that prevent or minimize catastrophic explosive events and accelerate ammunition resupply.  Project 297 also supports the Army Insensitive Munitions (IM) Board's reviews.  The Army Explosives Safety Management Program (858) was established in FY01. The U.S. Army Technical Center for Explosives Safety uses the funds in this project to evaluate current explosives safety standards and develop new, scientific and risk-based standards to meet U. S. Army explosives requirements.  The Life Cycle Pilot Program (LCPP) (859) will assess production base capabilities and needs over the acquisition life cycle of various munitions and will address the producibility of ammunition including the transition to type classification and production, and the ability of the production base to cost effectively produce quality products on schedule.  The Fuze Technology Integration program (862) will improve performance and lower the costs of existing proximity fuzes and enable new applications in submunitions and medium caliber fuzes, addressing advanced proximity fuze sensor technology, Micro-electromechanical Systems (MEMS), Safety and Arming (S&amp;A) technology, and Electronic S&amp;A (ESA) technology for smart munitions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>The M4A1 SLAM has four modes of operational engagement of its vehicle targets.  One of the modes is a Side-Attack Mode which utilizes the SLAM's built-in passive infrared (PIR) sensor to detect the thermal signatures of passing vehicles to trigger and fire its explosively formed penetrator (EFP) warhead to defeat the target.  If the current US Landmine Policy were to exceed to the Ottawa Convention Treaty, then the existing M4A1 SLAM's PIR feature will render the SLAM non-compliant to the Ottawa restrictions.  The current PIR design does not have the ability to discriminate between vehicle and personnel when a potential target is detected. Without a replacement PIR design, the SLAM will lose one of its four operation modes to engage vehicle targets and unable to meet all of its intented missions.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the future force by making Army units more survivable through the investigation, testing and demonstration of munitions logistics system improvements that prevent or minimize catastrophic explosive events and accelerate ammunition resupply.  Key thrusts are munitions storage area survivability, Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology integration and compliance, ammunition management and asset visibility, weapon system rearm, munitions configured load enablers and advanced packaging and distribution system enhancements.  Within each thrust, a broad array of solutions will be identified, tested, and evaluated against developed system measures of effectiveness.  Optimum, cost effective solutions that enable the rapid projection of lethal and survivable forces will be demonstrated.  The early stages of force deployment are especially critical.  Theater ammunition storage areas are vulnerable and present the enemy with lucrative targets.  These areas and distribution nodes contain the only available munitions stocks in theater.  Loss of these munitions could cripple the force, jeopardize the mission, and result in high loss of life.  This project mitigates vulnerabilities and ensures a survivable fighting force.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program will identify, mature, and integrate new technologies into current fuzing and safe and arm devices. This program will implement these technologies into fuzing systems to preclude obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions. The program addresses two major areas: (1) risk mitigation and (2) block upgrades. Risk mitigation efforts will evaluate and demonstrate second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce cost by providing competition, and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available. It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect and identify latent defects. The second major area is block upgrades, which will evaluate and perform studies on improvements to fuzes; increase commonality of fuze components and requirements. Block upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuzing design current to avoid obsolescence issues, and add capabilities. 

This program will also identify, mature, and integrate new technologies for enhanced lethality, range extension and standardization to improve target engagement effectiveness; increase reliability, safety, and exportability; and reduce taxpayer costs including elimination of sole source supply of indirect fires ammunition materials as well as studies and evaluations of such technology solutions in comparison to current stock pile indirect fire conventional munitions and their associated production processes. Additionally, environmental impacts of legacy propellants, explosives and metal parts will be studied. Replacement of hazardous materials such as Ammonium Perchlorate, Diphenylamine, Lead, etc. and addition of propellant anti-tubewear additives will remain a focus. This program support the standardization and interoperability of legacy and new production ammunition to maximize munitions battlefield interchangeability/compatibility between 52 and 39 caliber guns under the auspices of the international Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU) as well as rifled and smooth-bore mortars. Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will potentially increase FMS sales of US products to maintain domestic production and economies of scale.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program assures complete interchangeability of direct fire ammunition and weapons among all NATO countries with all of the associated logistic, strategic and tactical advantages. Project involves development and testing compliance of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGS) and staffing of the NATO North American Regional Test Center (NARTC). The program also includes warhead improvements and capability insertions to enhance lethality and effectiveness of existing cartridges.

FY 2014 funds will continue to maintain the NARTC and support NATO standardization of direct fire caliber ammunition for battlefield interchangeability. Additionally, this funding will be used to support direct fire ammunition ranging from small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade, medium caliber cannon ammunition and large caliber ammunition enhancements to effectiveness, survivability, accuracy and general improvements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program resources environmental quality technology (EQT) related management support functions including support of research, development, test and evaluation required for EQT technical integration efforts at demonstration/validation test sites, technical information and activities, test facilities and general test instrumentation, and EQT requirement assessments.  Funds required to support the management of technology transfer associated with technology demonstrated and validated as part of Army EQT projects are included in this program element.  In addition, support to the Army weapon system acquisition community to address generic pollution prevention related requirements are included under the Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition/Logistics Program.

The Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition/Logistics project includes program management for developing acquisition strategies that both achieve system key performance parameters and sustain the environment without permanent and unacceptable change in the natural environment or human health from system concept refinement through disposal.  It includes systematic consideration of environmental impacts, energy use, natural resources, installation impacts, economics, and quality of life.  It provides support to the system acquisition community, e.g., program and project managers, to integrate environmental quality analyses into the system acquisition process.  The goal is to resolve environmental quality issues related to weapon systems that are identified during design, development, testing, operation, or support to reduce Army environmental liabilities and total ownership costs and includes efforts to eliminate the use of hazardous and ozone-depleting materials from weapon systems and facilities and to ensure the availability of Halon 1301 to support weapon system fire suppression requirements.  

The Unexploded Ordnance Detection and Clearance project, beginning in FY 2004, is being overseen by the Army.  The project had been overseen by Office of the Secretary of Defense in prior years.  This project funds the Unexploded Ordnance Center of Excellence (UXOCOE) to provide for coordination of unexploded ordnance (UXO) technologies across the Department of Defense.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition/Logistics (ESAL) project provides support to the system acquisition community to integrate environmental quality (EQ) issues and concerns into the life cycle system acquisition process.  To a much lesser extent, safety, occupational health (OH) and energy efficiency are also addressed.   The focus of ESAL is on improving readiness, improving acquisition processes, reducing supportability burden, and minimizing total ownership cost.  The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment [ASA(IE&amp;E)] has defined the functions of the ESAL project in coordination with the Army Acquisition Executive and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology).  This project provides direct support to the Army acquisition community to pursue environmental sustainability and comply with legal statutes, policies and regulations during the life cycle of Army materiel.  ESAL helps the Army achieve compliance with its weapon systems, industrial base, field and deployed activities directed by international treaties, Federal statutes, Executive Orders, Department of Defense (DoD) and Army policies and regulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This project provides funding for the salaries and related personnel benefits for the authorized civilian personnel positions that provide for the management functions and the technical direction of the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) mission located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.  ATEC plans, conducts and integrates developmental testing, independent operational testing, independent evaluations, assessments and experiments to provide essential information to Soldiers and acquisition decision makers supporting the American Warfighter. 

This project includes staff/management functions of resource management, safety, security, environmental, strategic planning and information/technology support for command-wide databases in support of the developmental, evaluation and operational test mission with technical direction to the Army Evaluation Center (AEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, to the Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas and to the seven Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFBs) and one non-MRTFB test range:  Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico; Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona; Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, Alaska; and Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC) at various locations, as well as for Redstone Test Center (RTC) Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. This is the operating budget for ATEC Headquarters, which provides technical direction for the annual execution of over 3,300 developmental tests; more than 110 operational events; and more than 1,100 documents supporting acquisition programs.  ATEC has an authorized workforce of more than 9,500 workyears, and a $2.0 billion program.

This project also funds the salaries of civilian employees conducting Test and Evaluation early involvement, evaluation and test design missions and associated personnel support/sustainment costs including: temporary duty, professional training, supplies, and equipment.  This project does not finance test facility operations, test instrumentation or test equipment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Description>Supports the Commanding General's early involvement initiative which positions acquisition certified liaison officers at 2 Joint and 9 Army Program Executive Offices (PEO), TRADOC/ARCIC, REF, JIEDDO, and RDECOM.  Assigned personnel provide continuous support to materiel and combat developers from the inception of their programs.  The early involvement of LNOs supports the sections of the ATEC Mission Essential Task List (METL) that apply to ongoing contingency operations.  ATEC performance continues to meet 120 day rapid equipping requirement set by the CSA. Liaison officers continue to enable ATEC to sustain rapid, flexible T&amp;E support in the evaluation of Rapid Initiative Systems, Counter IED systems, and Urgent Material Releases.  Effort results in cost savings, cost avoidance and critical design efficiencies being identified early in a system's development, thereby avoiding more expensive product improvement programs later in a system's life cycle.  T&amp;E efficiency gains continue to be realized through early identification of instrumentation, modeling and simulation tools, and other resources needed for testing, as well as making more efficient use of data from developmental testing and experiments.</r2:Description>

                                    <r2:Title>Joint Operational Testing and Evaluation</r2:Title>
                                    <r2:Description>This project funds the Army's direct costs of planning and conducting Multi-service Tests and Evaluations (MOTE) for which there is no Army Project Manager (PM) and Army requirements for Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E).  These are required to evaluate concepts and address needs and issues that occur in joint military environments and provides information required by Congress, Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Unified Commands, and the Department of Defense components relative to joint operations.  This project also funds Follow-on Test and Evaluation (FOTE), as necessary.  FOTE may be required after a full production decision to assess system training and logistics, to verify correction of deficiencies identified during earlier testing and evaluation, and to ensure that initial production items meet operational effectiveness, suitability and supportability thresholds.  There has been a shift of focus for items funded by this project due to continuing operations in the US Central Command (CENTCOM).  Traditional system workload has dropped off and has been replaced by rapid fielding initiatives.  In response to this shift, the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) has established a forward operational assessment team in theater and a rapid response cell.  These groups facilitate MOTE, JT&amp;E, and FOTE events in the rapid environment.  Traditional acquisition requirements are expected to return to normal when operations in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down.</r2:Description>
