                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The central idea of the Focused Logistics Joint Functional Concept “is to build sufficient capacity into the sustainment pipeline, exercise sufficient control over the pipeline from end to end, and provide a high degree of certainty to the supported joint force commander that sustainment, and support will arrive where needed and on time.”  The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Research and Development (R&amp;D) program helps achieve this vision by pioneering advanced logistics concepts and business processes that provides the leanest possible infrastructure, the use of the best commercial and government sources, and the application of business practices.  The Logistics R&amp;D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that will provide a significantly higher level of support at lower costs, than would be otherwise attainable.  The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits.  One example is the Department of Defense (DOD) Electronic MALL (EMALL).  DOD EMALL was the first web based, distributed architecture on-line ordering capability.  It has been adopted by the Army, Navy and the Department of Homeland Security.  DLA’s overall Log R&amp;D program has demonstrated positive net present value and a positive return on investment.  </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>Netcentric Infrastructure and Implementation (NII) – Provided the Defense Medical Logistics enterprise with a .NET web service provisioning Netcentric Framework based on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).  A service-oriented information environment allows the timely exchange of data among business systems in an efficient and effective manner.  It also enables authoritative data sources distributed throughout the Enterprise to be leveraged, and reduces unnecessary replication of data repositories.  The Netcentric Framework limits ad hoc design, discourages stove-pipe development, and reduces the development lifecycle of web services.  It also adds a metrics logging capability to provide feedback on the value of web services and identify future enhancements of the capability.  In May 2011, the Netcentric Framework was transitioned to the Defense Medical Logistic Standard Support Wholesale (DMLSS-W) team.  

Defense Medical Logistics Transformation (DMLT) – Developed enterprise architecture (EA) products to support the business process reengineering project on Medical Equipment Life Cycle Management.   Project deliverables included (To-Be) process models, opportunities for improvement, and a Functional Capabilities Document.  The plan was approved by the DML board of directors and transitioned to the Joint Medical Logistics Functional Development Center (JMLFDC) for Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) consideration and implementation resourcing.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:Text>Planning Process Improvement:  The Peak Policy pilot at DLA Aviation continued through the year and continued to show impressive performance improvements over the control group of all N items in aviation; e.g., at the end of FY2011 Peak reduced the number of Procurement Requests (PRs) by 41.3% while the control group PRs increased by 9.3%, and Peak reduced the number of Unfilled Orders by 40.4% while the control group reduced by 13.8%. Efforts to transition Peak Policy and the Next Generation Inventory Model (Next Gen) for R items included participation in two different Forecastability Assessments, wherein the two models performed better than all competing approaches in both. Requirements were successfully developed for an integrated stocking model that integrates Next Gen for R items and the Peak Policy for N items with a more effective method of managing the movement of items between the R and N categories, and the results were delivered to the Planning Process Owner.  An effort was initiated to support the roll out of Inventory Policy Optimization (IPO) to the Air Force through a range of analyses to better understand the software, resolve problems and improve its performance. Efforts to develop new projects in the Planning Process area were initiated working with the Process Owner and Sub Process Owners.

Technical/Quality Process Improvement:  The FY 2010 projects dealing with the piloting of new business processes containing specific review procedures for assessing PQDRs to identify systemic quality issues so that the root causes can then be evaluated, and the effort to define process improvements for specific notifications to customers of quality alerts were successfully completed and transition planning and support activities undertaken. Efforts were initiated to transition the recommendations resulting from the Counterfeit Parts strategic roadmap project into daily use within the DLA Aviation, Land &amp; Maritime, and Troop Support sites, as well as HQ. The Parts Management/Data Sharing project initiated in FY 2010 was completed and transitioned through creation of a new DoD process for component standardization, with the first step being formation of a Connectors Working Group. The CAGE Hopping analysis effort was completed with a number of business process improvement recommendations that the T/Q process owner accepted and incorporated into a new Decision Support Pilot project. A project was initiated to demonstrate the feasibility of product marking with DNA to prevent introduction of counterfeit parts in the supply chain. The project to develop a DLA-wide approach for enhancing customer service by the Product Test Centers was completed and the recommendations accepted by the T/Q Process Owner.  A new Product Verification Process project was initiated to transition those recommendations into daily policy and processes.

Procurement Process Improvement:  The project to assess the feasibility of using RFID or other automatic identification technology to improve GFP inventory accuracy was completed and the results transitioned to J-74.  The Wide Area Workflow (WAWF)-focused project initiated in FY2010 was completed to understand issues with receipt and destination acceptance for Direct Vendor Delivery (DVD) and Industrial Product-Support Vendor (IPV) shipments as they impact DOD’s ability to correctly pay supplier invoices and recommend alternatives to address those issues, and the recommendations delivered to J-33. A Decision Support Pilot project was initiated to evaluate the capabilities of a number of commercially available tools to detect fraudulent practices early – before award if possible. The results of the pilot will include definition of requirements for a DLA-wide decision support capability.  </r2:Text>

Efforts will continue to develop a plan with the Planning Process Owner to transition Peak Policy and Next Gen either as DLA capabilities or as part of the JDA suite of planning tools. The FY2010 project to develop and validate the benefits of a multi-echelon version of Next Gen applicable to wholesale and retail levels will be completed early in the year, and the results will become part of the transition planning. IPO support efforts will be completed and the results transitioned to IPO.  A new project will be initiated to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the Prime Vendor concept to the management of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) items in order to greatly improve support to FMS customers.  Another new project wherein suppliers manage the ordering and delivery of parts for DLA wholesale stock will be initiated to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept and its benefits in cost reduction and support to the warfighter. 
Other new FY2012 projects in the planning process area will be initiated as a result of problem definition efforts undertaken with the planning process team in FY2011 and early FY2012.  One of three projects completing in FY2012 will transition in FY2012.

Technical/Quality Process Improvement: The PQDR Analysis Tool will be transitioned to full operation across the DLA enterprise as part of the product Data Reporting and Evaluation Program at NAVSEA Portsmouth, whose intention is to ultimately make it available throughout DoD. The projects to transition the Counterfeit Parts Strategic Roadmap and Product Verification Process improvements will be completed during the year. Efforts to support the Connectors Working Group and to demonstrate the feasibility of DMA marking to deter counterfeiting will continue through FY2012. New project starts will be defined and initiated in the T/Q interest of areas of modern technical data, supply chain risk and incorporation of green considerations in procurements by joint planning with the T/Q process owner, and activities initiated as appropriate. All of the three projects completing in FY2012 will transition in FY2012.

Procurement Process Improvement:  The Decision Support Pilot project to evaluate the capabilities of a number of commercially available tools to detect fraudulent practices early – before award if possible – and define requirements for a DLA-wide decision support capability will be continued through the year. Efforts will be made to work with J7 procurement policy personnel to identify additional projects for initiation in FY2012 and FY2013.  No projects will complete in FY2012.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) program objective is to research, identify, and implement potential or existing technologies using high-risk, high-payoff tools, methods, techniques, and products.  The DLIR program partners with commercial industry to perform short-term projects (STPs) in various logistics business areas which align with the Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA’s) strategic vision. DLIR improves functional and business processes using the latest technologies available, which support the nation’s warfighter. The technical areas of interest are:

1.)  Development of Logistics Data Interoperability &amp; Availability. Enhances the functionality and compatibility of data in a complex data environment using supply chain relationships and lifecycle management to allow flexible visibility.  2.)  Next Generation Automated Electronic Commerce and Sourcing.  The Next Generation Automated Electronic Commerce and Sourcing technical area of interest focuses on employing the best of breed processes, practices, and technology to enable and/or streamline electronic commerce from the customer’s point-of-need to point-of-satisfaction.

DLIR is working several short term projects in the first area of interest only.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>DLIR successfully completed a large portion of exchanging Model Based (3D) technical data on the A-10 wing replacement project. This effort relates to Technical Data Package (TDP) business process improvement and enabling Logistical Product Data to be automatically extracted from Model Based tech data being delivered by Original Equipment Manufacturers. The intent is to move away from paper-based technical data and move to computer-based models to obtain data. This will allow DLA to obtain more and better quality data.

DLIR successfully developed a web based contractor hosted Parametric search tool that allows DLA the opportunity to enhance Parts Management.

These tools are being pursued in order to provide Defense Logistics Information Service with more productive and efficient technologies by enhancing the use of information technology and reducing the human footprint required. Using advanced technologies to capture technical data and identifying what technical data is needed for logistics will improve the quantity and quality of logistics information. This will enable DLA Logistics Information Service to manage its resources better and provide more services by reducing costs and improving productivity. It will also reduce costs by improving the quality and quantity of logistics information.</r2:Text>

                                    <r2:Description>E-Mall Access for TENTNET:  This project will make it possible for MilSpec Tent information to be available to all EMALL users.  It will expand the number of tent and shelter products that have rich technical and performance information available on DOD EMALL. The project is structured to benefit the entire tent manufacturing community by making their product more visible and, more importantly, it will improve the quality of product information available to the warfighter.  Plans include completing data collection and web design for three additional MILSPEC tents, complete modifications, and develop web-based training capability.  

Extension of Supply Chain Simulation project:  This represents additional tasking for an existing project.  The project will simulate the capability of the tent supply chain to surge production under varying conditions and requirements.  We expect this project to produce an effective decision making tool for DLA’s Industrial Capabilities Programs allowing program management to evaluate the effect of placing buffer stocks at various levels within the supply chain.  Anticipate completion by Sept 2011.</r2:Description>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) lessons learned and daily operations indicate that current distribution and logistics processes remain outdated and are rarely capable of providing required warfighter support in an agile, efficient and economical manner.  Designation of United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) as the Distribution Process Owner (DPO) and shift within the Department to transform the distribution and logistics processes, demands the examination and improvement of the entire supply chain.  Unpredictable and extended global distribution routes, limited visibility of sustainment requirements, force packaging limitations, lift constraints, anti-access/aerial denial, complex supply chains, as well as non-networked battlefield command and control (C2), planning, and decision support tools impede timely warfighter logistical support.  The centralization of distribution and logistics intermodal research and development facilitates the development/fielding of transformational enhancements to validated distribution capability gaps.  The USTRANSCOM Research, Development, Test, &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program explores and matures promising technologies to enhance support to combatant commanders and other customers of Department of Defense’s (DOD’s) distribution and transportation systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enhanced end-to-end visibility of all aspects of the projection and sustainment is required to improve the effectiveness/efficiency of deployment/distribution/redeployment operations to ensure warfighter support and confidence.  This requires investigation into next generation Automated Information Technology (AIT)/Total Asset Visibility (TAV) technologies and/or container security to improve end-to-end distribution visibility and enhance planning/ execution and transform sustainment operations.  Includes the ability to determine immediate, reliable, and accurate shipment status through system access or event management.  Develop an over-arching process and system architecture which will automate and integrate existing and innovative new programs across the supply chain to provide complete In Transit Visibility (ITV) data, to include visibility of non-DOD cargo during humanitarian/disaster relief operations. The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Also need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DOD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Synchronizing strategic/theater delivery capabilities to meet increasingly dynamic customer needs.  Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by the disparity of systems, differing data standards, and insufficient interfaces.  Queries and retrieval of status and shipment information cannot be executed due to lack of connectivity between the various components of the supply chain.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct "what -if" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset’s course, speed or departure/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.  The ability of USTRANSCOM to supply transportation support for homeland defense and/or disaster relief depends on effective ways to link with other governmental and civilian agencies.  Also need to explore the many barriers across the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), to include non-DOD government entities, coalition partners, non-government organizations, and commercial industry, which can create confusion/conflict or detract from the optimization of the JDDE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Capabilities which improve deployment, distribution and supply chain decision-making/collaboration (planning stage to real-time execution and retrograde operations) without need for highly specialized operators.  Projects in this area address the following: decision support tools, distribution process simulations/analytics, distribution demand forecasting/execution monitoring, training, automated decision-maker support (e.g., queuing, alerting, courses of action), automated status monitoring with information fusion and drilldown capability, and resilient C2 infrastructure capabilities.  Current planning, forecasting and collaboration capabilities do not permit full synchronization of people, processes and assets to execute planned operations. Automated tools must be able to dynamically analyze/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems.  Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by disparate systems, multiple data standards and insufficient interfaces.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct "what -if" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset’s course, speed or departure/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.  This project addresses the required mission support to combatant commanders and other customers in the area of C2, Optimization, and Modeling and Simulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) provides a vital service as the joint Department of Defense (DoD) Center for microelectronics acquisition, adaptive operations and support - advancing future microelectronics research, development, technologies and applications to achieve the Department’s strategic and national security objectives.  An important part of the DMEA mission is to research current and emerging microelectronics issues with a focus on warfighters’ needs.  To this end, DMEA is integrally involved in the development of capabilities and resultant products based on technologies whose feasibility has been demonstrated but which have yet to be applied to real-world and military applications.

DMEA resolves microelectronics technology issues in weapon systems by quickly developing and executing appropriate solutions to not only keep a system operational but elevate it to the next level of sophistication or to meet new threats.  DMEA provides critical microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the DoD is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides critical, quick turn solutions for DoD, intelligence, special operations, cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market.  DMEA’s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions—along with its unique technical perspective—allows it to develop, manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability.  DMEA can then use these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele.  After many years of performing analogous efforts, the technical experience, mission knowledge, and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are often incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects.

Microelectronics technology is a vital and essential technology for all operations within the DoD.  DMEA operates the DoD’s only microelectronic foundry—a “flexible foundry”—with a unique business model that incorporates industry partnership to serve the DoD where industry, alone, has not.  A microelectronic foundry is the factory that takes raw silicon and produces an integrated circuit or “chip.”  The fabrication of an integrated circuit consists of multiple processing steps to form and connect many transistors and other circuit components to form the desired function.  Each type of chip requires a different “recipe” (process) in the foundry.  Semiconductor companies spend great amounts of time and resources developing proprietary recipes.  They abandon these and develop new recipes as new generations of smaller and more powerful microelectronic components are needed. 

The DMEA mission focuses on providing DoD systems with microelectronics components that are no longer provided by industry—called “legacy” components.  Most domestic semiconductor foundries will discontinue low-volume, high-mix integrated circuits in as little as two years because, by then, there is little or no profit margin left; but the DoD requires an assured supply chain for its systems for 20 years or more.  Working alongside industry, DMEA has created a model partnership that provides this capability for the DoD.  DMEA’s unique flexible foundry supports the DoD with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now assured to remain in one location for as long as they are needed.  To obtain these processes, DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses.  These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed intellectual property (IP) and the related processes for DoD needs.  These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry’s first right of refusal.  DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components.  If not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production.  A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners’ valuable IP and processes.  DMEA is Government owned and operated, providing the structure and confidence that an industry partner’s IP is protected from potential competitors.  This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring, installing, and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the DoD. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems, combat operations, and support needs.  As such, DMEA serves the DoD, other US Agencies, industry and Allied nations.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) requires the ability to develop semiconductor technologies down to 90 nanometer (nm) node sizes with the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) low-volume production-capable foundry capability.  This is a critical, time-sensitive requirement to support the DoD's strategy to provide an assured (always available) and trusted source of integrated circuits for critical weapon systems, sensors, and specialized electronic equipment.  The capability enhancement to DMEA’s existing microelectronics foundry will cover a multitude of feature sizes down to 90nm and will be the only assured supply in the world to satisfy critical DOD and US Government program issues for the foreseeable future.

Market demand for more advanced technology drives the need to make microelectronics with more capabilities in smaller sizes.  The way this size is measured is called “node size”.  In addition to utilizing various processes, industry constantly develops newer processes with ever smaller node sizes.  The pace of this progress follows what is known as “Moore's Law”: the transistor density of integrated circuits doubles every two years.

Most domestic semiconductor foundries will discontinue low-volume, high-mix integrated circuits in as little as two years because there is little or no profit margin left.  90nm is a key node size for defense applications but industry forecasts show that the commercial industry will substantially decrease the production of 90nm chips by 2014, thereby making acquisition of this essential technology extremely difficult or impossible in the future.  To keep 90nm technology available, DMEA must immediately begin to extend its current capability to 90nm to allow sufficient time to buy equipment, get the processes in place, transfer IP, etc., and ensure the DoD’s ability to use this technology by then.  This will also allow DMEA to purchase used equipment at extremely low prices from commercial sources that are closing or have already closed their 90nm process lines.  Without enhancing the existing foundry at DMEA to 90nm, in four years the DoD will be without a trusted and assured source for repeatable procurement of the state-of-the-practice integrated circuits that comprise a vast majority of the U.S. arsenal’s microelectronics.  This, in turn, will severely impact real-world operations.  In the meantime, if a Trusted Supplier is available to make a requested component, DMEA will utilize that source of supply first.  This enhancement of DMEA capabilities is absolutely necessary to provide assured and secure microelectronics design and fabrication for trusted microelectronics systems and semiconductor components to ensure DOD technological superiority over potential adversaries.

The current DMEA foundry capability will accommodate node sizes down to 180nm.  Due to physical limitations in the current DMEA lithography and fabrication equipment, the state-of-the-practice processes down to 90nm that need to be incorporated require an expansion in equipment and facilities to handle the smaller node sizes as well as the larger silicon wafers.  This Project will fund expenses associated with planning and implementing the 90nm capability.  Initial costs will include design and trade studies, costs associated with implementing force protection standards, floor plan layout and planning activities. Further, it will fund the outfitting of the selected property with the required force protection standards, infrastructure, tenant improvements, furniture, and equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) and National Security Agency (NSA) require uninterruptible access to state-of-the-art design and manufacturing processes to produce custom integrated circuits designed specifically for military purposes.  Under DODI 5200.39, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical/essential systems need to be procured from trusted sources in order to avoid counterfeit, tampered, or sabotaged parts.  Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities (foundries) is making fabless semiconductor companies the norm in the U.S.  Sophisticated off-shore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies and engineering labor rates vastly less than engineering rates in the U.S. have resulted in outsourcing of electronics components and integrated circuits.  These trends threaten the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic on-shore suppliers and reducing access to trusted fabrication sources for advanced technology.  These trends are of acute concern to the defense and intelligence community.  Secure communications and cryptographic applications depend heavily upon high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement can translate into a significant force multiplier and capability advantage.  Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors.

The Trusted Foundry program provides DoD and NSA with trusted state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities necessary to meet the performance and delivery needs of their customers.  The program will also provide the Services with a competitive cadre of trusted suppliers that will meet the needs of their mission critical/essential systems for trusted integrated circuit components.  NSA, in their role as the Trusted Access Program Office, has successfully looked to commercial sources to satisfy their requirements.  Access to trusted suppliers is imperative to ongoing and future DoD/NSA systems, and most centrally, Trusted Foundry access is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs for state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Program Mission: The BEIS builds upon the mature, existing infrastructure of DFAS Corporate Database/DFAS Corporate Warehouse (DCD/DCW), Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS), and Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) to provide timely, accurate, and reliable business information from across the DoD to support auditable financial statements as well as provide detailed information visibility for management in support of the Warfighter.
Concept/Scope: Ensure data compliance with SFIS standards; provide security-defined, enterprise-level access to information for ad hoc management queries; and produce external financial management reports/statements based on standardized data. BEIS provides solutions to these goals by:
- Establishing the authoritative source for Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) values and providing for standardization by implementing SFIS and United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) compliant financial reporting capabilities for Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports.
- Providing an enterprise-wide information environment that will serve as the single source for enterprise-wide financial information.
- Serving as the DoD-wide system for Treasury Reporting.
- Providing decision makers with significantly greater access to financial information through data visibility and business intelligence (e.g., Executive Dashboard).
The BEIS functional baseline encompasses a family of services organized into six distinct lines of business:
- Financial Reporting Services: BEIS will provide SFIS compliant financial statements and budgetary reports for DoD.
- Cash Accountability Reporting Services: BEIS will provide SFIS compliant reports of the Department’s cash position to the Treasury.
- Enterprise Level Business Intelligence Services: BEIS will provide data aggregation services, collecting select transaction level data from DoD systems of record
to support business intelligence. BEIS will also deliver corporate business intelligence capabilities such as contingency reporting, status of funds reporting and
management dashboards.
- Integration Support Services: This support will be funded by the requesting activity on a fee-for-service basis.
- Reference Data Services: BEIS will establish a centralized repository for maintaining and exposing referential data to the DoD enterprise. This encompasses the
SFIS Library data, Master Appropriation data, Corporate Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) data, and the Transportation Global Edit Table data.
- General Ledger Services: BEIS will provide general ledger (i.e., financial management information) services for USSOCOM and select Defense Agencies.
Impact: BEIS will provide DoD enterprise-wide financial visibility to meet Enterprise Transition Plan milestones. It will serve as the centralized financial data source and the single source for enterprise Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports. Through the BEIS enterprise business intelligence capability, DoD decision makers will gain improved visibility into the information they need to make strategic budget decisions. The BEIS financial management capabilities will be used by the Military Services, Defense Agencies, and the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). Modernization efforts for the functionality identified for BEIS Family of Systems (FoS) Increment 1 was completed in FY10. However, there are further enhancements/product improvements required to accomplish deployment/implementation of BEIS Increment 1 capabilities in order to achieve Full Operating Capability (FOC), as well as additional modernization efforts associated with BEIS Increment II capability which require out-year funding.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>BEIS leveraged existing infrastructure in DoD’s investment in DCD/DCW, DDRS, and DCAS. BEIS formally implemented a portfolio management approach to program management that helped to ensure a management strategy was in place to better reallocate assets within the portfolio. BEIS has and will continue to deliver needed capabilities more rapidly and efficiently using a Family of Systems concept providing a functional baseline organized into six distinct lines of business: General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, Enterprise Level Business Intelligence Services, Cash Accountability and Reporting Services, and Financial Reporting Services. Capabilities are being developed incrementally with multiple releases per year to meet the Enterprise Transition Plan milestones provided to Congress. At end of FY11, BEIS has achieved FOC for the following system components/services: DCD/DCW, to include General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, and Enterprise Level Business Intelligence Services.  Based on the list of requirements, an overall schedule is produced which includes integrated activities as well as identified products and milestones. Contracts are competitively awarded to keep costs down. Intra-governmental services are being used where possible for infrastructure support by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Technical Services Organization and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Information Processing Center.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of the Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI) program is to modernize the participating Defense Agencies’ financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, eliminating material weaknesses, and achieving financial statement auditability for the Agencies and field activities across the DoD. DAI will transform the budget, finance, and accounting operations of the participating Defense Agencies to achieve accurate and reliable financial information for financial accountability and efficient decision making. The DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that effectively addresses the requirements depicted in such tools as the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product. The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a .mil environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 100,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions to support the warfighter.

DAI will implement a compliant COTS business solution with common business processes and data standards for the following business functions:  procure to pay; order to cash; acquire to retire; budget to report; cost accounting; as well as time and labor.  Grants financial management, budget formulation, and re-sales accounting will be implemented by full Deployment. The Defense Agencies are committed to leveraging their resources and talents to build an integrated system that supports standardized processes and proves that the DoD is capable of using a single architecture and foundation to support multiple, diverse components.

The benefits of DAI are:
- Common business processes and data standards;
- Access to real-time financial data transactions;
- Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;
- Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities;
- Standardized line of accounting with the use of Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS); and
- Use of USSGL Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.

The system integration services for the DAI will include the following:
Project management; Blueprinting; Design, Build, and Unit Test; Reports, Interfaces, Conversion, Extensions (RICE); Testing (integration, functional, performance, conversion, security, user acceptance, operational); End-User Training/Change Management; System Deployment; Conversion; Information Assurance; Sustainment; Data Service; Help Desk Support; Studies and Analysis Support; and Site Surveys.

Delivered DAI Time and Labor capabilities to Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), Defense Technology Security Administration (DTSA), Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO), and Defense Security Services (DSS). DAI incorporated a Procure to Pay (P2P) pilot called One Stop Portal that enables vendors to use DAI data directly from the Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) portal.  This process ensures invoices contain correct accounting and contract data for more perfect matching, reduces errors and speeds up invoice reconciliations and vendor payments.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defense Information System for Security (DISS) will improve information sharing capabilities, accelerate clearance processing timelines, reduce security vulnerabilities, and increase DoD’s security mission capability. The DISS mission is to consolidate the DoD security mission into an Enterprise System that will automate the implementation of improved national investigative and adjudicative standards to eliminate costly and inefficient work processes and increase information collaboration across the community. DISS is currently under development and will replace the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS), a legacy system. When fully deployed this will be a secure, authoritative source for the management, storage and timely dissemination of and access to personnel clearances with the flexibility to provide additional support structure for future DoD security process growth. When deployed, it will accelerate the clearance process, reduce security clearance vulnerabilities, decrease back-end processing timelines, and support simultaneous information sharing within various DoD entities as well as among a number of authorized federal agencies. DISS will provide improved support to the Insider Threat and Personal Identity programs and will be comprised of capabilities that are currently part of the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) and will create a robust and real-time capability for all DoD participants in the Military Departments, and DoD Agencies. It will also include automated records check (ARC) functionality and the creation of an adjudicative case management capability with e-Adjudication functionality. DISS will also provide the following operational capabilities - single point of entry for: personnel security, adjudicative case management, and decision support functionality to all DoD adjudicators. DISS will provide near continuous intra-Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) communications on a web-based enabled platform utilizing a unified architecture with security management.

The DISS program specifically addresses the requirements of Section 3001(e)  of PL 108-458, Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA).  Additionally the DISS program supports the FY12 DoD Strategic Management Plan (SMP)'s Business Goal 6: "Re-engineer / use end-to-end business processes to reduce transaction times, drive down costs, and improve service."

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Travel System (DTS) is a fully integrated, electronic, end-to-end financial management system that automates temporary duty travel for the Department of Defense (DoD). DTS meets unique DoD mission, security and financial system requirements within the guidelines of Federal and DoD travel policies and regulations. DTS automates travel authorizations, reservations and arrangements, voucher processing, payment, reconciliation, accountability and archiving. DTS employs Digital Signature and Login/Authentication which requires users to provide a signed response using a valid DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate to gain access to the DTS application. Travel documents created in DTS are digitally signed with the user’s PKI certificate to provide a means of identifying the signer, verifying the document’s integrity, and enforcing non-repudiation of the signature by the signer.

DTS is a Major Automated Information System (MAIS), Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1AC program. DTS delivers capability by evolutionary acquisition utilizing incremental development; recognizing up front the need for future capability improvements. DTS has a flexible design so that each increment builds upon its core functionality, dependent on available, mature technology providing increasing capabilities to travelers, travel administrators, and process owners. Full Operational Capability (FOC) was declared in March 2010. Future capability improvements will be implemented as P3I beginning FY11.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Virtual Interactive Processing System (VIPS) will modernize and automate the Information Technology (IT) capabilities for qualifying Applicants into the Military Service during wartime, peacetime, and mobilization. VIPS will enable a responsive, flexible and efficient means to qualify Applicants to meet manpower resource requirements for the uniformed Services, Coast Guard, and National Guard routine and contingency operations. VIPS will be the future accessioning system to be used by the US Military Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM) and will replace their legacy system, USMEPCOM Integrated Resource System (USMIRS). USMEPCOM serves as the single entry point for determining the physical, aptitude, and conduct qualifications of candidates for enlistment. VIPS will provide the capability to electronically acquire, process, store, secure, and seamlessly share personnel data across the Accessions Community of Interest (ACOI). When fully implemented, VIPS will reduce the cycle time required to induct enlistees to meet the needs of Homeland Defense, reduce the number of visits to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS), reduce manual data entry errors, and reduce attrition through better pre-screening practices. GAO has reported that better pre-screening practices will yield cost savings and cost avoidance of $83M per year for the VIPS automated elements, when Increment 2.0 is deployed.  The overall annual estimated cost avoidance is $479M across the DoD as referenced in the 1997 GAO Study 97-39 Military Attrition: DoD could save Millions by Better Screening Enlisted Personnel.  The implementation of a Modular Open System Architecture (MOSA) approach will enable accession data to be securely available to applicants and ACOI partners such as Recruiting and Training Commands, Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), Military Health System, Human Resource Management (HRM), and Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO). VIPS will support compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) direction for a net-centric environment and take advantage of automated data capture technology, e.g., medical equipment with the capability to capture and electronically transmit exam results. The accessioning system of the future will be location independent, virtually paper-free, and automated to assist with bringing the right people at the right time to operational commanders. The VIPS Program has not yet been baselined.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In accordance with BCL, the VIPS Program will use an incremental approach to satisfy USMEPCOM’s requirements. Requirements have been articulated to support the development of the core platform for VIPS as well as capabilities to fully assess a candidate into the military. The revised Increment 1.0 content provides sufficient capability to retire the legacy system, USMEPCOM Integrated Resource System (USMIRS) through a series of capability deployments beginning in FY2014. Future increments will address the full VIPS capabilities necessary to realize the Return on Investment (ROI).

Originally the VIPS Increment 1.0 was procured under a single contract, competitively awarded to provide both a core infrastructure and business functions to support the accessions process. The VIPS PMO awarded a single Increment 1.0 contract on September 30, 2010 that will initially provide for the design of VIPS Increment 1.0 through PDR. The prime contractor also completed the design, development, and acceptance testing of the ROC prototype. Once the CCR report is completed, the program will seek a Milestone B decision. Following a successful Milestone B decision, the Government will assess appropriate contracting options to complete design, testing, deployment, fielding and training support. The system integration will include management of the technical configuration baseline and sustainment across VIPS. The VIPS PMO has adopted rigorous cost controls using earned value management and a comprehensive risk management program to manage program execution.

annually in processing cost and avoided interest (over $77.6 M in FY10). WAWF brings together the invoice, the receiving report, and the contract from EDA to provide the accounting and entitlement systems with the three-way match needed to authorize payment. WAWF is also the Enterprise data entry point for the Item Unique Identifier (IUID) and Government Furnished Property (GFP) programs, the source of receipt and acceptance data for Service Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERP), and is central for the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) enterprise solutions for Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) and Inter Governmental Transfer (IGT). The benefits to DoD are a single face to industry suppliers, global accessibility of documents, reduced need for re-keying, improved data accuracy, real-time processing, secure transactions with audit capability, and faster processing resulting in reduced interest penalties. For vendors, benefits include the capability to electronically submit invoices, reduction of lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contract payment records.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD) is a multi-service/multi-agency solution established as a key initiative to provide full visibility of funds distributed through echelon I and II for the Military Departments and at all levels for the Defense Agencies to improve and modernize the OUSD(C) funds distribution process.   Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place.  

Within the current OUSD(C) environment, the Directorates have a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems.  This lack of standardization and integration limits the visibility of funding information, introduces manual efforts and undue complexities into the management of budget authority, and impedes the flow of funding documents.  This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous.  The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions.   

The envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow.  Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data.  Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.

The operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment.  The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding.

                                            <r2:Text>Currently there is no funding for Phase II and III of EFD. EFD achieved Initial Operating Capability in September 2010.  The Congressional Tracking and Continuing Resolution capabilities have performed successfully in an operational environment; however, the Budget Enactment capability has not been exercised in an operational environment due to continuing resolutions and has further delayed an operational assessment. The delays in the FY2011 budget enactment and the need to accommodate additional business processes will delay the start of Phase II of EFD until at least FY12 assuming initial funding can be obtained during the execution year. Phase II will be completed in FY 2013.


Functionality for EFD in Phase 1:

	Full visibility of appropriated funds as funds pass through and across different levels of the enterprise
	An improved funds distribution processes at echelon I and II for all DoD appropriations
	Standardized funds distribution data across the enterprise
	Automated audit trail between the President’s budget submission and appropriation enactments at Budget Line Item (BLI) level
	Automated processing of OUSD(C) funds authorization documents (FADs)
	Automated tracking of reprogrammed funds
	Automated tracking of distributed funds
	An authoritative “program value” data source at the BLI level
	Access to funds distribution functionality and data

Functionality for EFD in Phase II 
	Automated funds distribution capability for Defense Agencies (TI-97, echelon III and below)
	Interfaces with Service Funds Distribution Systems
	ERP interfaces
	Interface with DDRS-Budgetary
	Interface with Treasury

Potential functionality For EFD in Phase III 
	Revolving Funds
	Trust Funds
	BRAC
	General Ledger account identification to support 132 and 133 reporting
	US Army Corps of Engineers (TI 96)
	
EFD operational environment organizations include the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), U.S Treasury, Congressional Committees, Defense Agencies, and Component headquarters (Army, Navy, Air Force). After the OMB apportionment, funding authorization documents are issued at the Echelon I and II level.  These funds are then further sub-allocated by the Defense Agencies, and Components. 

(U) Issue:  

Currently there is no funding for Phase II and III of EFD. EFD achieved Initial Operating Capability in September 2010.  The Congressional Tracking and Continuing Resolution capabilities have performed successfully in an operational environment; however, the Budget Enactment capability has not been exercised in an operational environment due to continuing resolutions and has further delayed an operational assessment. The delays in the FY2011 budget enactment and the need to accommodate additional business processes will delay the start of Phase II of EFD until at least FY12 assuming initial funding can be obtained during the execution year.

                                            <r2:Text>Phase III addresses residual functions related to funds distribution and is planned to begin during FY13 and be completed during FY 14. 
EFD Phase II enables replacement of a combination of manual processes and PBAS-Funds Distribution Defense Wide (PBAS-FD DW).  PBAS is built on mature mainframe technology and programmed in COBOL language.  The risk of using outdated technology increases as the system ages. EFD Phase 2 plans included configuring EFD to support TI-97 funds distribution at echelons III and below – those currently executed in PBAS-FD DW.  

EFD Phase III addresses a number of residual functions currently performed in the PBAS system involving Trust Funds, Revolving Funds, BRAC, etc. Final determination of which elements of functionality will be incorporated into EFD or another solution will be based on an analysis of both technical and functional requirements. This analysis will occur likely during FY12.    

RDT&amp;E funding is requested for FY 13 - FY 15 to support development / implementation of EFD phases II and III.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY 2009, DLA Troop Support Subsistence sold $4.75 billion in subsistence goods and services to the Department of Defense, making it the largest supply chain managed by DLA Troop Support.  Sales in subsistence continue to grow, largely due to requirements for overseas contingency operations.  The Combat Rations Program is focused on improving the manufacturing technologies related to the production and distribution of the combat rations that are at the forefront of these operations, including Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) as well as Unitized Group Rations (UGR).  The objectives are increased readiness, improved quality, and better ration variety.  CORANET research efforts also help control the cost of the combat rations.  The CORANET program engages all elements of the supply chain including producers, military Services, Army Natick Soldier Center, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), US Army Veterinary Command, US Army Public Health Command, DLA Logistics R&amp;D, DLA Troop Support Subsistence and academia to research and transition improved technologies for operational rations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense, through the Defense Logistics Agency, purchased $2.1 billion of clothing and textile items in FY 2010.  The lead-time is up to 15 months and the current inventory acquisition value is over $1.4 billion.  The current focus of DLA military clothing research is Customer Driven Uniform Manufacturing (CDUM).  CDUM explores the application of advanced technologies and process reengineering to the end-to-end management of clothing and individual equipment (CIE).  CDUM is focusing on three thrust areas:

  1.  Supply Chain Process Reengineering and Advanced Technology for Military Clothing 
  2.  Central Issue Facility (CIF) Process Reengineering and Shared Visibility
  3.  Manufacturing Methods for Product Performance and Quality Improvement</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:Text>CDUM II will continue the TDP project to address gaps in product specifications by developing a flexible environment that integrates multiple input and output formats to improve management, configuration control and communication between the Government and Defense Industrial Base manufacturers. Technical initiatives include developing a semantic data driven product data environment. Data mining will be adapted to populate the data models. The primary benefit will be a significant reduction in TDP errors and improved data access by the multiple tiers of industrial base.  In addition, the technology facilitates communication among the Service Design Agencies, the Industrial Base and DLA Troop Support-Clothing and Textiles.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Weapon system spare parts which use castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of backorders.  Cast parts are 2% of National Stock Numbered parts but represent 4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% of them are castings.  This program develops innovative technology and processes to improve the procurement, manufacture, and design of weapon system spare parts which use castings.  The Procurement Readiness Optimization-Advanced Casting Technology (PRO-ACT) program takes a systems view and considers not only the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) perspective but also the Military Service Engineering Support Activities (ESA) which DLA works with to solve technical issues, as well as the industrial supply base.  The program has three components:  Rapid Acquisition, Quality, and Cost Effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Weapon system spare parts that use forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA backorders.  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered parts but represent ~4% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% of them are forgings. This program develops methods and technology to improve the supply of forged parts.  This program takes a holistic view of the problem and attacks root causes inside DLA, at DLA’s engineering support activity partners in the Services, and at DLA forging suppliers.  The program has three thrusts:  Business Enterprise Integration to improve supply support approaches; FORGE-IT to develop and improve technical problems; and R&amp;D which develops new technology for forging suppliers, including new methods for making forge dies (typically the longest lead time item) and for simulation of metal flow inside the forge die (to eliminate trial and error development of the die).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Develop a capability to emulate most obsolete digital integrated circuits (ICs) in the Federal catalog using a single, flexible manufacturing line.  DoD has estimated $2.9 billion is spent every five years redesigning circuit card assemblies.  Many of these circuit card redesigns are performed to mitigate IC obsolescence.  Commercial ICs have short Product Life Cycles (often only 18 months).  IC Manufacturers subsequently move on to later generations of ICs, leaving little to no sources for their previous IC products.  DoD maintains weapons systems much longer than IC lifecycles, resulting in an obsolescence problem.  In order to avoid costs and potential readiness issues associated with buying/carrying excess inventories acquired before commercial availability ceases, or redesigning the next higher assembly to mitigate the obsolete IC, DLA (as the manager of 88% of the IC Federal Stock Class) must have the capability to manufacture needed IC devices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These technologies will be demonstrated through performance based specification and Weapons System IC insertions.  In addition, there has been increased DoD concern over trusted sourcing issues, as most IC design and production has migrated to overseas suppliers.</r2:Text>

It will initiate 250 nanometer Emulation fabrication process (High Performance (speed) and Density) development providing additional FSC 5962 coverage.  It will continue 350 nanometer Emulation fabrication process development; bringing new capabilities to the Customers and Agency.  It will integrate the Integrated Circuit Characterization tool advancements into Emulation flow, enabling supply for non-procurables.  It will transition fully-developed and verified 800 nanometer emulation production capabilities to DLA Land and Maritime for full-scale production of previously non-procurable ICs.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:Text>MAE will transition additional Advanced CMOS Digital Microcircuit Emulation capability into full-scale production increasing DLA’s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs.  MAE will also transition higher density Read-Only- and Random-Access Memory Emulation Capability into full-scale production further increasing DLA’s ability to re-establish sourcing of non-procurable microcircuit NSNs. The newly transitioned emulation capabilities will address several discontinued device families and will increase the potential emulation production envelope by several hundred NSNs.  MAE will also initiate specific process, design and test verification developments in its new Linear Emulation thrust. It will initiate planning for the specific emulation technology implementations to support specific device family groups. It will continue 250 nanometer Emulation fabrication process development providing additional FSC 5962 coverage in its Digital Emulation thrust. It will complete assessment of a Trusted Design capability, responding to Agency, Customer, and DoD concerns. It will continue 350 nanometer Emulation fabrication process development, bringing new capabilities to the Customers and Agency.</r2:Text>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The BATTNET R&amp;D partners were established by contract September 2009 through a competitive Broad Area Announcement (BAA) allowing for maximum competition. Partner Contracts were based upon proposals that demonstrated knowledge, experience, and expertise in the following areas of interest: Automation, Battery Maintenance, Competition &amp; Contracting Requirements, Diminishing Manufacturing &amp; Supply, Lithium Battery Safety, Reducing Acquisition Costs, Shelf Life, Supply Chain Logistics, Surge/Sustainment, and Technology Transition/Insertion. The BATTNET, which includes a Government Steering Group (GSG) of power source technical experts from the military services R&amp;D groups, is informed of general R&amp;D requirements for supply chain improvement. The partners develop among themselves related R&amp;D projects, which are then formally evaluated by the GSG. Selected projects are then chartered within DLA and planned for contract STP awards when funds are available.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Each Short Term Project (STP) will have performance metrics appropriate to its scope. Also all STPs will include a business case to demonstrate return on investment, or a readiness case to calculate warfighter impact versus costs.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>
