                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) Intelligence Advanced Development (IAD) demonstrates and validates advanced technologies required to support warfighter needs for timely all-source intelligence information.  IAD research supports global awareness, consistent battlespace knowledge, precision information, and the execution of time-critical missions.  IAD projects provide better on-time information to the warfighter by using new and existing data sources, streamlining data analyses, reducing the required intelligence footprint, and by extending the life of sensors in place as well as enhancing their performance.  The Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site, Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division (AFRL/RIE) works directly with users, employing a rapid prototyping evolutionary approach, and then integrating finished modules directly into the field.  The programs are oriented towards specific shortfalls and deficiencies as documented by the major commands, combatant commands, and intelligence organizations in their mission and functional area plans.  The goal of this activity is to expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use via rapid prototyping.  This activity is focused on technology insertion to correct Air Force intelligence deficiencies at tactical and operational levels.  The effort bridges the transition of new technologies from Advanced Technology Demonstrations and Integrated Technology Thrust Programs into current/new systems, and also supports the associated Defense Technology Objectives.  IAD may reallocate existing resources to support out-of-cycle new/updated warfighter requirements.  

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The project objectives are to develop, demonstrate and evaluate a near-real-time all source correlation/fusion capability by applying state-of-the-art data processing techniques for the receipt, correlation, templating, and analysis of battlefield information.  Capabilities will be developed in an open systems architecture environment allowing for the greatest efficiency in terms of integrating or interfacing with other systems.  There are Air Force, DoD, and Coalition needs to correlate various sources of intelligence information (Communications Intelligence - COMINT, Electronic Intelligence - ELINT, Imagery Intelligence - IMINT and Measurement and Signature Intelligence - MASINT) within seconds/minutes as opposed to hours/days with current manual and semi-automated methods.  The project includes development of data correlation and predictive intelligence algorithms as well as target analysis and prioritization, air order of battle update, and tactical analysis techniques.  This computerized approach will speed up the correlation of data from diverse sources of intelligence information, including COMINT, ELINT, IMINT and MASINT; providing faster situational awareness and threat assessment, and replace manual systems with automated capabilities.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Requirements for new advanced sensor exploitation technologies are gathered and prioritized by the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA), formerly the Air Intelligence Agency.  Development of the new / improved capabilities to meet the requirements is managed by AF Research Laboratory (Rome Research Site).  Prototype products (usually software), once evaluated by the users, are fielded in incremental capability spirals.  All contracts within this project are awarded after full and open competition.  </r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project demonstrates and validates the capability to more accurately and quickly interpret digital imagery and video by developing/evaluating computer-assisted techniques to manipulate and overlay imagery, cartographic data, signals intelligence (SIGINT), and on-line intelligence data.  The result of this effort will be more precise target locations and identifications, precise target reference scenes, and more accurate damage assessments for the operator; all developed for easy supportability on low-cost, commercially-available computer workstations.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  

This program is in Advanced Component Development &amp; Prototypes (ACD&amp;P), Budget Activity 4, because it demonstrates and validates advanced technology which enhances information / intelligence systems' capabilities and techniques.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project improves Global Awareness, Dynamic Planning, and Execution by providing knowledge bases and inference engines to exploit collected data for nine major commands and Air Force (AF) intelligence organizations.  The development of the analytical aids is based on artificial intelligence techniques.  The increased timeliness, efficiency and effectiveness derived will provide enhanced warning time and accuracy, allowing national/military authorities a greater range of options to avert, diminish or control a crisis.

The purpose of this program is to develop, demonstrate, and test physical security equipment (PSE) systems, to include Force Protection.  This program supports the protection of tactical, fixed, and nuclear weapons systems, AF personnel and AF facilities.  The PSE program is organized to provide PSE RDT&amp;E for Air Force specific needs but as a complement to and in conjunction with the PSE RDT&amp;E programs funded by the DOD Physical Security Equipment Action Group (PSEAG).  As such this program will develop, demonstrate, and test PSE in the same manner and to the same standards and architecture as PSEAG funded projects to ensure interoperability with PSEAG developed PSE.   In development of PSE, this RDT&amp;E program includes RF frequency and communication security (cyber) requirements.  This Program Element also includes funding for Force Protection Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (FP COTS) evaluation and testing.  The FP COTS testing applies to all available technologies, which are considered effective for AF physical security use.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Develop and acquire Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) satellites, mission control segment and cryptography for survivable, anti-jam, worldwide, secure communications for the strategic and tactical warfighters.  AEHF satellites will replenish the existing EHF system (Milstar) providing much higher capacity and data rate (5x increase over Milstar II) capabilities.  AEHF is a cooperative program that includes International Partners (Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands).    

Space Vehicle-1 (SV-1) launched on 14 August 2010.  SV-1 experienced a propulsion anomaly and was raised to its geostationary orbit using alternative orbit raising techniques.  The original plan was to begin SV-1 on-orbit checkout in FY11, but in order to conserve fuel SV-1 arrived at its on-orbit checkout location on 24 October 2011.  SV-2 has an April 2012 projected launch.      
  
With SV-1 launched and SV-2 scheduled to launch in April 2012, the AEHF program has nearly completed its development phase and is now addressing obsolescence, production continuity, supplier stability and industrial base issues.  Future AEHF satellites will be procured using the Department of Defense (DoD) Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) concept, formerly known as Evolutionary Acquisition for Space Efficiency (EASE).  The ESP concept is a procurement approach which seeks stable production and efficient sub-contractor product management through the block buy of two space vehicles at one time (please see Advanced EHF MILSATCOM P-40 Exhibit).  

In addition, the ESP concept includes use of RDT&amp;E funding for a MILSATCOM Space Modernization Initiative (SMI), formerly known as the Capability and Affordability Insertion Program (CAIP), to fund engineering activities to reduce future production costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements, improve capabilities through insertion of new technologies, and replace obsolete parts, crypto and materials.  The SMI efforts will provide opportunities for competition to develop potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for future satellites of the current or any follow-on system.  SMI efforts will include obsolescence management and mitigation efforts, technology maturation, qualification of new components, subsystem and component prototyping, architecture and system concept studies (to include hosted payloads), and pathfinder efforts to address MILSATCOM capability gaps identified in the Joint Space Communications Layer (JSCL) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and the forthcoming "Resilient Basis for SATCOM in Joint Operations" study.

The FY13 request funds efforts such as SV-2 on-orbit test &amp; operations support, incremental Mission Control Segment (MCS) development including ground mobile command and control, test/fielding and support, and studies/analyses as required.  The FY13 request funds Interim Contractor Support (ICS).  As SV-2 completes on-orbit test and incrementally developed MCS becomes operational, ICS sustains the AEHF system until Initial Operational Capability (IOC) declaration, projected late FY14.  Additionally, the FY13 request funds preliminary design for the transition of the AEHF Key Management Architecture from the Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) to the Key Management Infrastructure (KMI).  The EKMS and KMI are cryptography key management systems that enable transmission and communications security for the Protected SATCOM enterprise.  The FY13 request also funds continued parts obsolescence studies and redesign, and risk reduction on MILSATCOM technologies.  

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, since it funds Advanced EHF technology validation and modeling.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Advanced MILSATCOM, also known as Advanced EHF (AEHF), program is a sole source acquisition to a contractor team comprised of  Lockheed Martin (prime/integrator) and Northrop-Grumman (provider of the satellite payload). This team will perform the Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) and Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD) of two RDT&amp;E-funded satellites and associated mission command and control ground capabilities under Cost Plus Award Fee line items on the contract.  AEHF will incorporate lessons learned and improvements from Milstar and commercial SATCOM practices into the next generation EHF secure, anti-jam military communications satellite system.  </r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds a MILSATCOM Space Modernization Initiative, (SMI), formerly the Capability and Affordability Insertion Program (CAIP), which includes engineering activities that assess promising new components and systems to confirm their suitability (capable, affordable, and producible) for the MILSATCOM mission across the payload, terminal and network segments.  SMI pursues evolutionary or alternative MILSATCOM technologies and concepts to reduce obsolescence risks and improve affordability, resiliency, and responsiveness of replenishment programs, and identifies relevant commercial opportunities for potential hosted payload developments to demonstrate proof of concept for operations and future distributed architecture.  In addition, SMI begins rapid acquisition capabilities supporting concept definitions and demos for small protected tactical hosted payloads or commercial-based free-flyer satellites, anti-jam enhanced theater antennas, and increased military Ka-band coverage and capacity.  

The FY13 funds efforts such as parts obsolescence studies and redesign, crypto repackaging and risk reduction on MILSATCOM technologies.  Additionally, FY13 funds System Engineering and Program Management to include Program Office support such as Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) analyses, System Engineering Technical Assistance (SETA) and Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) to support Protected Broad Agency Announcements, Resilient Basis Study efforts, Remotely Piloted Aircraft concept definition, radiation-hardened parts productizaton and qualification, protected MILSATCOM Test Bed development, and affordable Information Assurance approach efforts.   </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports a range of activities including technology planning, development, demonstrations and prototyping, as well as modeling, simulations and exercises to support development of tactics and procedures in the Space Control mission area.  The types of Space Control activities accomplished are Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Defensive Counterspace (DCS) , Offensive Counterspace (OCS) and Command and Control and Battle Management.  For use in the Space Control mission area, SSA includes monitoring, detecting, identifying, tracking, assessing, verifying, categorizing, and characterizing, objects and events in space and terrestrial based space capabilities.  DCS includes defensive activities to protect U.S. and friendly space-systems assets, resources, and operations from enemy attempts to negate or interfere and prevention activities that limit or eliminate an adversary's ability to use U.S. space systems and services for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.  OCS activities disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy space systems, or the information they provide, which may be used for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.   Consistent with DOD policy, the negation efforts of this program currently focus on negation technologies which have temporary, localized, and reversible effects.  Command &amp; Control efforts include identifying technology solutions to enable fusion of data for use in multi-level security environments, near-real-time data delivery and decision support to war fighter needs.  Rapid Reaction Capabilities in response to immediate war fighter needs are developed within this program.  

Funding in FY11/12/13 also supports the development of the technology and infrastructure for space control elements of the Space Test and Trainging Range (STTR).  This includes development and demonstration of test assets, special test equipment, capabilities and systems required to test, validate, and verify performance of integrated space control systems.  Additionally, this program supports the development of test range assets required to support developmental and operational test, exercises, training, and tactics development for space control systems.  A collaborative command &amp; control capability will be integrated into several range systems to provide real time communications during test event scenarios.  

Spacetrack Integration Node Global Enhanced Reporting (STINGER) project converts an enhanced processing capability developed for missile warning radar to use for the space situation awareness program radars.   

These projects are in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports a range of activities including technology planning, development, demonstrations and prototyping, as well as modeling, simulations and exercises to support development of tactics and procedures for a responsive and resilient Space Control mission area.  The types of Space Control activities accomplished are Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Defensive Counterspace (DCS) , Offensive Counterspace (OCS) and Command and Control and Battle Management.  For use in the Space Control mission area, SSA includes monitoring, detecting, identifying, tracking, assessing, verifying, categorizing, and characterizing, objects and events in space and terrestrial based space capabilities.  DCS includes defensive activities to protect U.S. and friendly space-systems assets, resources, and operations from enemy attempts to negate or interfere and prevention activities that limit or eliminate an adversary's ability to use U.S. space systems and services for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.  OCS activities disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy space systems, or the information they provide, which may be used for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.   Analysis to support vulnerability and survivability studies and projects.  Consistent with DOD policy, the negation efforts of this program currently focus on negation technologies which have temporary, localized, and reversible effects.  Command &amp; Control efforts include identifying technology solutions to enable fusion of data for use in multi-level security environments, near-real-time data delivery and decision support to war fighter needs.  Rapid Reaction Capabilities in response to immediate war fighter needs are developed within this program. 

Funding also supports the development of the technology and infrastructure for space control elements of the space test and training range.  This includes development and demonstration of test assets, special test equipment, capabilities and systems required to test, validate, and verify performance of integrated space control systems.  Additionally, this program supports the development of test range assets required to support developmental and operational test, exercises, training, and tactics development for space control systems.  A collaborative command &amp; control capability will be integrated into several range systems to provide real time communications during test event scenarios.

Spacetrack Integration Node Global Enhanced Reporting (STINGER) project converts an enhanced processing capability developed for missile warning radar to use for the space situation awareness program radars.  
 
These projects are in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports the development of Space Test and Training Range (STTR) capabilities required to support developmental and operational test, training, exercises and tactics development for Space Control systems and related architecture.  This includes development and demonstration of test assets, special test equipment, capabilities and systems required to test, validate, and verify performance of integrated space control systems.  Additionally, this program supports the development of test range assets required to support developmental and operational test, exercises, training, and tactics development for space control systems.  A collaborative command &amp; control capability will be integrated into several range systems to provide real time communications during test event scenarios.  

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Combat Identification (CID) Technology program element analyzes, develops, demonstrates and evaluates promising target identification technologies to facilitate platform transition decisions prior to System Development and Demonstration (SDD).  Numerous joint needs statements, operational documents, lessons learned, and NATO requirements state the need for positive CID.  High confidence CID increases combat effectiveness, prevents fratricide, and reduces collateral damage.  It also enables combatant commanders to effectively command and control their forces in all weather, day or night.  This program element focuses on the cooperative and non-cooperative technologies that have the capability to positively identify surface and air targets in both air-to-surface and air-to-air engagements.  

In order to rapidly make available promising CID technologies for platform SDD decisions, the program element funds design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, and other efforts associated with integration and modification of CID related technologies and systems on platforms.  It also supports the development, testing, and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, Allied, and coalition interoperability.  

Non-cooperative CID employs a number of sensing technologies and signal processing techniques.  The observations may be compared to a database of known objects to identify surface or air threats from air platforms.  These technologies include: (1) Laser Vision, an Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) imaging system that significantly increases ID ranges and includes exploiting synergies between non-cooperative and cooperative identification systems (radio, millimeter wave, infrared, and laser). The Laser Vision Program is working on performance improvements, laser vibrometry development, 3-dimensional laser detection and ranging, laser radar, Synthetic Aperture Laser (SAL) radar, hyper spectral phenomenology exploitation, aided/automatic target recognition, image fusion and studies to support decisions on future EO/IR technologies; (2) Radar Vision, an air-to-ground radar imaging technique to identify stationary and moving targets using their radar signatures; (3) Hydra Vision (formerly Fusion Vision), a balanced (robust) amalgamation of sensor data from multiple sources to provide warfighters with higher confidence CID results on surface or air targets potentially including fusion with intelligence sources,  identification of non-traditional targets, fusion to counter camouflage, concealment and deception (CCD), and multi-phenomenology features for sustainable databases and (4) X-Patch, a validated set of prediction codes and analysis tools that use the Shooting-and-Bouncing Ray (SBR) method to predict realistic far-field radar signatures from 3D target models in order to predict 1D and/or 2D data.  X-Patch is vital for development of radar signatures of potential high-threat weapons systems; it is a critical capability of database production centers which support Joint Sensors Signature Database (JSSD) pathfinders.  

Cooperative CID employs technologies required to rapidly identify friendly platforms.  The program develops, integrates and evaluates technologies that provide AF platforms with a means of positively identifing an air or ground platform as a friendly, via active or passive cooperative ID capabilities.  Development funded by this program element ensures availability of a Mode 5 upgrade path for implementing ground and air platforms across the Air Force fleet.  Within the air-to-air domain, programs funded to meet this intent include: (1) Mode 5 Technology Insertion Program (TIP): The program element funds preliminary RDT&amp;E for Mark XIIA, the next generation Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) standard for the DoD and NATO.  Mark XIIA represents a substantial enhancement to the Mark XII IFF system.  It is expected to achieve joint initial operational capability in 2014.  The "A" denotes the addition of Mode 5 (an encrypted challenge-and-reply mode) to the other Mark XII system modes (Modes 1, 2, 3/A, C, S, and 4).  The Mode 5 secure IFF program is a DoD-wide, Navy-led development and acquisition program.  The Mode 5 TIP specifically addresses implementing air platforms.  (2) Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)TIP:  This program element will fund preliminary RDT&amp;E for integration of ADS-B architecture into the APX-119 Mark XIIA transponder. The ADS-B TIP will develop ADS-B "In" and "Out" capability which leverages synergies between ADS-B and Mode 5 Level 2 (M5L2) to achieve M5L2 "In" capability.  The ADS-B TIP specifically addresses implementing air platforms. (3) Digital IFF Control Panel: This program element is developing a Digital IFF Control Panel (DCP) to support Mode 5 and ADS-B insertion programs into Air Force platforms with an Aeronautics Research Incorporated (ARINC)  429 based avionics architecture.  The DCP will provide a standard control panel for AF aircraft with growth capability for ADS-B and beyond.  

Within the air-to-ground domain, development funded by this program element ensures development, integration, test and evaluation of friendly identification systems focused on reducing air-to-ground fratricide.  A potential program to meet this intent includes:  (1) Radio Based Combat Identification:  An active challenge reply system leveraging Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) capable ground and aircraft targeting pod mounted radios for air-to-ground friendly identification. 
 
This program element also funds the Air Traffic Control Beacon Systems Identification Friend or Foe Mark XII/XIIA Systems (AIMS) Program Office.  The DoD International AIMS PO has system level interoperability management responsibilities for the present Mark XII system, development and integration of Mark XIIA (Mode 5) and transition to Mark XIIA Mode S systems. 

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. 

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Cooperative Combat Identification (CID) employs technologies required to rapidly identify friendly platforms.  The program develops, integrates and evaluates technologies that provide AF platforms with a means of positively identifying an air or ground platform as a friendly, via active or passive cooperative identification capabilities.  Development funded by this program element ensures availability of a Mode 5 upgrade path for implementing ground and air platforms across the Air Force fleet.  Within the air-to-air domain, programs funded to meet this intent include: (1) Mode 5 Technology Insertion Program (TIP): The Program Element (PE) funds preliminary RDT&amp;E for Mark XIIA, the next generation Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) standard for the DoD and NATO.  Mark XIIA represents a substantial enhancement to the Mark XII IFF system.  It is expected to achieve Joint Initial Operational Capability in 2014.  The "A" denotes the addition of Mode 5 (an encrypted challenge-and-reply mode) to the other Mark XII system modes (Modes 1, 2, 3/A, C, S, and 4).  The Mode 5 secure IFF program is a DoD-wide, Navy-led development and acquisition program.  The Mode 5 TIP specifically addresses implementing air platforms.  (2) Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Technology Insertion Program (TIP):  This PE will fund preliminary RDT&amp;E for integration of ADS-B architecture into the APX-119 Mark XIIA transponder. The ADS-B TIP will develop ADS-B "In" and "Out" capability which leverages synergies between  ADS-B and Mode 5 Level 2 (M5L2) to achieve M5L2 "In" capability.  The ADS-B TIP specifically addresses implementing air platforms. (3) Digital IFF Control Panel: This PE is developing a Digital IFF Control Panel (DCP) to support Mode 5 and ADS-B insertion programs into Air Force platforms with an ARINC 429 based avionics architecture.  The DCP will provide a standard control panel for AF aircraft with built in capability for IFF support of ADS-B and beyond.  

Within the air-to-ground domain, development funded by this program element ensures development, integration, test and evaluation of friendly identification systems focused on reducing air-to-ground fratricide.  A potential program to meet this intent includes:  (1) Radio Based Combat Identification:  An active challenge reply system leveraging Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) capable ground and aircraft targeting pod mounted radios for air-to-ground friendly identification. 

This PE also funds the Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon Systems Identification Friend or Foe Mark XII/XIIA System (AIMS) Program Office.  The DoD International AIMS PO has system level interoperability management responsibilities for the present Mark XII system, development and integration of Mark XIIA (Mode 5) and transition to Mark XIIA Mode S systems.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>A principal goal of the NATO Cooperative R&amp;D program is to effectively utilize the aggregate resources invested by the US and our allies in conventional defense R&amp;D.  This program element provides the critical funding incentive needed to pursue ICRD&amp;A agreements and helps to (a) leverage USAF and allied resources through cost sharing and economies of scale; (b) exploit the best US and allied technologies for equipping coalition forces; (c) demonstrate areas of commonality or interoperability with our allies; and (d) accelerate the availability of defense technology and systems. Candidate projects are reviewed and approved by the USD(AT&amp;L).  An international agreement defining project objectives, responsibilities and costs is required prior to release of funds.  To obtain these funds and ensure service commitment, projects are selected from existing or new RDT&amp;E programs funded in the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP).  Project offices must show matching funds and contributions from associated program elements and equitable allied funding.  As appropriate, funding responsibility for out-year requirements and follow-on efforts are transferred to the project office and associated program elements.  Any new contracts are awarded after full and open competition.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>A principal goal of the International Space Cooperative R&amp;D program is to effectively utilize the aggregate resources invested by the US and our allies in space-related R&amp;D.  This program element provides the critical funding incentive needed to pursue space-related ICRD&amp;A agreements and helps to (a) leverage USAF and allied resources through cost sharing and economies of scale; (b) exploit the best US and allied technologies for equipping coalition forces; (c) demonstrate areas of commonality or interoperability with our allies; and (d) accelerate the availability of defense technology and systems. Candidate projects are reviewed and approved by the USD(AT&amp;L).  An international agreement defining project objectives, responsibilities and costs is required prior to release of funds.  To obtain these funds and ensure service commitment, projects are selected from existing or new space-related RDT&amp;E programs funded in the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP).  Project offices must show matching funds and contributions from associated program elements and equitable allied funding.  As appropriate, funding responsibility for out-year requirements and follow-on efforts are transferred to the project office and associated program elements.  Most contracts are awarded after full and open competition.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Growing dependence on space and demonstrated vulnerabilities have highlighted the need to actively plan for and respond to threats against national security space effects and deliver informed options to national leaders and system acquirers.  Due to the asymmetric nature of the threat environment, it is increasingly imperative that the Nation take quick action to remain ahead of threats and progressively evolve our approach as those threats evolve. 
 
In response to these needs,  the AF and National Reconnaisance Office (NRO) formed a strategic partnership and leveraged a combination of Department of Defense (DoD) and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) resources in March 2008 to establish and execute the Space Protection Program (SPP); a joint, enduring program to develop and execute an integrated protection approach for the Nation covering all defense, intelligence, civil, commercial and allied space systems.  The SPP is a core protection competency that unifies and integrates AF, NRO, DoD and Intelligence Community (IC) activities to deliver strategic recommendations and options to senior leaders and inform their decisions on how best to protect our space systems and stay ahead of an increasingly sophisticated threat environment.

The DoD/AF portion of this program is consolidated under a dedicated Program Element Code to: streamline DoD SPP activities under a single appropriation; clearly categorize/convey the DoD investment in SPP; and provide visibility/transparency to AF, DoD, Congress and other offices with equities in space protection.  A fully-functioning SPP effort allows for the active planning, comprehensive analysis and timely delivery of products, tools and recommendations to respond to threats against national security space effects and deliver independent and informed options to national leaders and system acquirers.  This includes the key element of providing Combatant Commanders (COCOM) a range of mitigation options which are cross-domain, integrated and aimed at preserving space effects for warfighting missions.

The FY13 President’s Budget request represents a minimum level required to operate and execute a synchronized and effective space protection effort for the Nation.  The FY13 request preserves the skill-set, knowledge base and multi-organizational construct required to remain ahead of threats and to evolve programmatic direction and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) across multiple orbital regimes in a way that minimizes duplication and inefficiency.  To that end, SPP will provide a central focus for unifying and integrating Title 10/50 roles and responsibilities (AF and NRO efforts) to deliver research, analysis, studies, tools and capabilities necessary to identify, prioritize, and develop the most effective and economical recommendations for space protection options to preserve national space capabilities and guide/influence future requirements, acquisitions, Science and Technology (S&amp;T) research and investment focus areas. 
 
Specifically, SPP’s FY13 efforts involve a diligent focus on identifying/defining threats, determining National Security Space (NSS) vulnerabilities to clarify threat impacts and developing corresponding opportunities to reduce or altogether mitigate the threats.  This will involve dedicated protection program activities centered on Ops Engagement, development/refinement of specific protection measures coming out of technical vulnerability assessments, instituting key cyber initiatives for space protection, completing the delivery/transition of the space capabilities and interdependencies database, coordinating strategic space protection communication strategies, and specific engagement in Indications &amp; Warning (I&amp;W) and Space Situational Awareness (SSA) architecture assessments/modeling.

SPP's focus on Ops Engagement provides unique space protection analytic capabilities to support the COCOM's ability to prepare to operate in a degraded space environment; providing analyses of COCOM space dependencies, vulnerabilities and consequence of loss, and the ability to develop and test mitigation options for evaluation in COCOM exercises.  SPP will provide space protection subject matter experts and analysis to participate in all phases of crucial exercises and wargames; improving the validity of event and influencing future requirements, acquisitions, budgets and operations.  The program will then leverage the key conclusions and recommendations coming out of each of these events to develop recommended courses of action (COAs) such as those outlined in the WARNORD for Space Operations, CONOPS, Tactics Techniques &amp; Procedures (TTPs) and strategic protection strategies (based on additional SPP research, analysis and validation).  

SPP intends to continue its efforts to deliver operational warfighting capabilities that attribute and defeat attacks on space systems through specific, focused defense initiatives which maintain our inherent right of self defense in space and deny the benefit of attack to our adversaries.  The program also plans to expand its focus to include assessments of non-space related effects that would ensure the survivability of space assets and institute key defense initiatives to address vulnerabilities in multiple orbit regimes.  Cyber effects will become a larger focus of SPP, and the program will focus on the delivery of tools and capabilities to the operational community within the DOD and the IC; further integrating cyberspace into the National Infrastructure Protection Framework.  SPP will make recommendations to improve and operationalize a limited set of cyber capabilities in 2013, and will continue to investigate other utilities and opportunities in the years that follow. 

SPP will continue to leverage resident space protection intelligence expertise to identify and anticipate threats to space systems.  Key efforts in this area include analysis and inputs to provide specific detailed direction to intelligence agencies on crucial intelligence data collection/analysis and providing comprehensive and accurate threat impact assessments.

In coordination with NRO and AFSPC acquisition and requirements communities, SPP will perform analyses and assessments to identify options to enhance the survivability and effectiveness of specific architectures.   SPP will work with the community to build integrated architectures for I&amp;W and SSA in order to develop recommendations to support requirement development, budget formulation, and/or technical performance requirements across Title 10/50 organizations.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) fulfills the warfighter's requirements for worldwide threat warning and situational awareness information with timely production and simultaneous dissemination of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) derived combat information.  It also provides target tracking data to support threat avoidance, targeting, force protection, and situational awareness.   This information is continually refined in near real time by strategic, operational and tactical sensors.  

This PE funds/has previously funded IBS system development as described below:
- A Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) on UHF satellite channel using a Common Message Format (CMF) and a MIL-STD Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) compliant waveform and Line of Sight (LOS) using the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT). 

- IBS-Network Services (IBS-NS) includes two Global IBS Network Servers (GINS) and four Theater Interface Nodes (TINs) to support the geographic Combatant Commanders; all built to validated warfighter requirements. 
 -- Two GINS that receive data from each theater and integrate this data into a worldwide picture available to all network/broadcast users. 
 -- Four regional TINs, where out-of-theater (and local) users not directly receiving the broadcast can receive the information broadcast on the CIB.  Additionally, the TIN will receive and inject data into the CIB for producers without access to the theater CIB. 

- An XML-based Common Message Format (CMF) Data Element Dictionary (DED) that defines IBS messages for broadcast of  IBS information over available communications paths including the CIB and other Global Information Grid (GIG) networks. 

- A Modular Advanced TRanslation Interchange with XML (MATRIX) Reformatter that provides a modular, platform-independent, multi-use translator to support migration with legacy radios and provide a long term solution for IBS Full Operational Capability (FOC) radio users.  

Funds the development of an evolving suite of interoperable planning and decision support capabilities comprised of software, hardware and communication products.  This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) fulfills the warfighter's requirements for worldwide threat warning and situational awareness information with timely production and simultaneous dissemination of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) derived combat information.  It also provides target tracking data to support threat avoidance, targeting, force protection, and situational awareness.   This information is continually refined in near real time by strategic, operational and tactical sensors.  

This PE funds/has previously funded IBS system development as described below:
- A Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) on UHF satellite channel using a Common Message Format (CMF) and a MIL-STD Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) compliant waveform and Line of Sight (LOS) using the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT). 

- IBS-Network Services (IBS-NS) includes two Global IBS Network Servers (GINS) and four Theater Interface Nodes (TINs) to support the geographic Combatant Commanders; all built to validated warfighter requirements. 
 -- Two GINS that receive data from each theater and integrate this data into a worldwide picture available to all network/broadcast users. 
 -- Four regional TINs, where out-of-theater (and local) users not directly receiving the broadcast can receive the information broadcast on the CIB.  Additionally, the TIN will receive and inject data into the CIB for producers without access to the theater CIB. 

- An XML-based Common Message Format (CMF) Data Element Dictionary (DED) that defines IBS messages for broadcast of  IBS information over available communications paths including the CIB and other Global Information Grid (GIG) networks. 

- A Modular Advanced TRanslation Interchange with XML (MATRIX) Reformatter that provides a modular, platform-independent, multi-use translator to support migration with legacy radios and provide a long term solution for IBS Full Operational Capability (FOC) radio users.  

Funds the development of an evolving suite of interoperable planning and decision support capabilities comprised of software, hardware and communication products.  This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program ensures a responsive design and development engineering infrastructure to address emerging issues and technology insertion within the current Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), future strategic systems/capability, and other common strategic mission areas, where appropriate, to develop enhanced multi-use capabilities.  Efforts identify methods to reduce life cycle costs, improve nuclear safety and surety, and ensure strategic missile viability.  Demonstration and validation projects include guidance applications, propulsion applications, reentry vehicles, development of enhanced command/control capabilities, rocket system launch program efforts, long range planning efforts, and Ground Based Strategic Deterrence (GBSD).  

BA4 - This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Guidance Applications Program ensures the development of strategic capability in response to the Nuclear Posture Review, recommendations of the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) Strategic Advisory Group, USSTRATCOM Commander guidance, and the Defense Science Board Task Force on Nuclear Deterrence.  Efforts are focused on current and future requirements and technologies, reduced life cycle costs, and increased nuclear surety and safety.  Activities leverage the efforts of the Science and Technology community and are coordinated with the Navy strategic application program to enhance synergy and avoid duplication.  Key elements include developing responsive technologies with common applications for future strategic guidance capabilities.  

BA4 - This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Reentry Vehicle (RV) Applications Program ensures the ICBM force is equipped with the safest and most reliable RVs and explores options for common, multi-mission capabilities.  The program enables a responsive engineering infrastructure to support RVs beyond their original design life by addressing operational system issues and ensuring the availability of long-lead components/materials while identifying life cycle cost reduction methods. In addition, the program also develops and tests advanced RV technologies to meet future requirements.  The program leverages investments by the Science &amp; Technology community and Navy reentry systems applications program.  Products are tested on a space available basis on Minuteman and Trident Force Development Evaluation (FDE) flights.

BA4 - This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The purpose of the ICBM Rocket System Launch Program (RSLP) is to perform studies and analyses that determine the most constructive and cost effective use of missile assets after they are deactivated or considered excess and added to the RSLP inventory.

BA4 - This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Note: In FY 2013, Project 641025 Ground Based Strategic Deterrence (GBSD) includes efforts to begin Materiel Solution Analysis and the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for a follow-on to the Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Mssile (ICBM).  This is not a new start, efforts previously funded under project 644209 Long Range Planning.

</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Ground-Based Strategic Deterrence (GBSD) seeks to identify viable concepts and materiel solutions for a Minuteman III follow-on in support of the Air Force's strategic deterrence and global strike capabilities.  Funding supports pre-Milestone A activities, to include an AoA and associated concept refinement activities of potential materiel solutions.  This effort will explore materiel technology alternatives at the system and sub-system levels during the Materiel Solution Analysis Phase leading to a Milestone-A decision.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P), because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Long Range Planning (LRP) task analyzes systems to identify common potential modifications of the Minuteman III required to meet user objectives relative to long term sustainment, technology insertion, employment, and force structure.  The studies focus on system supportability, operability, reliability, and maintainability.  Options/concepts generated by these studies are evaluated for feasibility, system impacts, and cost.  The LRP also lays the groundwork for analysis supporting future weapon systems development and deployment.  Pre-milestone activities may be conducted for current or future Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) weapon systems to include entry criteria for milestone activities.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) System, previously known as Wideband Gapfiller Satellites, provides DoD users with high data rate military satellite communication (MILSATCOM) services in accordance with the Joint Space Management Board-approved MILSATCOM architecture (Aug 96), the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-approved MILSATCOM Capstone Requirements Document (Oct 97), and the JROC-approved WGS Operational Requirements Document (May 00).  Dual-frequency WGS satellites augment, then replace the DoD's Defense Satellite Communications Systems (DSCS) X-band service and augment one-way Global Broadcast Service Ka-band capabilities.  In addition, WGS provides a new high capacity two-way Ka-band service.  

WGS Block I consists of satellites 1-3.  These satellites were successfuly launched on 10 Oct 07, 3 Apr 09, and 5 Dec 09, respectively.    

WGS Block II consists of satellites 4-6.  Block II satellites will incorporate minor modifications to better support the Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance mission.  Launch for satellite 4 is scheduled for 19 Jan 12. Launch for satellite 5 is planned for Jan 13.   

A United States-Australia WGS partnership was codified 14 Nov 07.  Australia provides funds needed to buy WGS-6 in exchange for access to constellation-wide resources.  Launch for satellite 6 is scheduled for May 13.  

WGS Block II Follow-on currently consists of satellites 7-9 with projected launches in FY16, FY17 and FY18, respectively.  

A multilateral partnership between the United States, Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and New Zealand was codified 12 Jan 12.  The United States contributions include existing and programmed infrastructure, to include the acquisition, launch, operations, and sustainment costs of WGS 1-8, and the launch, operations, and sustainment of WGS-9.  Other Partners’ contributions will fund WGS-9 acquisition and support activities.  Each Partner benefits from a unique allocation profile of SATCOM resources commensurate with its level of contribution.  

The MILSATCOM Command and Control System-Consolidated (CCS-C) system provides integrated launch and on-orbit command and control (C2) functionality for MILSATCOM satellites.  CCS-C uses modified commercial off the shelf hardware/software to control all emerging and legacy MILSATCOM systems to include Milstar, DSCS, WGS and AEHF satellites.  The CCS-C project 644870 funds database development for WGS Block I and II satellites, and AEHF satellites 1 through 3.  The WGS and AEHF procurement program elements will fund the mission unique databases for the WGS Block II Follow-On satellties and the AEHF 4-6 satellites, respectively.  CCS-C will also evolve the system architecture to provide increased performance for additional satellites; to comply with DoD, Air Force, and AFSPC-directed standards for Information Assurance, Satellite Control, and Net-Readiness; and to support space situational awareness and new C2 training systems.    

Funding is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, as it supports component development and prototyping for Wideband MILSATCOM.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) System, previously known as Wideband Gapfiller Satellites, will provide the DoD with high data rate military satellite communication (MILSATCOM) services in accordance with the Joint Space Management Board-approved MILSATCOM architecture (Aug 96), the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-approved MILSATCOM Capstone Requirements Document (Oct 97), and the JROC-approved WGS Operational Requirements Document (May 00).  These dual-frequency WGS satellites will augment the DoD's Defense Satellite Communications Systems X-band service and one-way Global Broadcast Service Ka-band capabilities.  In addition, WGS will provide a new high capacity two-way Ka-band service.  

No funds are requested for FY13.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The WGS program made considerable use of commercial practices and technology in its FAR Part 12, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) acquisition for satellites 1-3.  The WGS program received MS II/III approval in November 2000 and awarded a FFP contract in January 2001 (three satellites and options for an additional three).  Options for satellites 4-6 were not exercised prior to the 31 December 2003 expiration date. 

Since WGS-type capabilities were no longer being offered commercially, it was no longer appropriate to use a Firm Fixed Price contract for satellites 4-6.  A Fixed Price Incentive Fee contract, which balances uncertainty of parts obsolescence/production gap with experience gained from WGS 1-3 production, was approved.  The Not-to-Exceed letter contract was awarded for satellites 4 and 5 (with unfunded priced option for 6th satellite) in 2nd Qtr FY06.  The contract definitized on 17 October 2006.  The Block II Follow-on contract (satellites 7-9) was awarded on 30 Aug 2011.  All satellites are purchased with procurement funds, and the Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) is funded with RDT and E.  An updated Acquisition Strategy for the WGS Block II Follow-on satellites was approved by the MDA on 25 Jan 2010.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) Command and Control System-Consolidated (CCS-C) system provides integrated launch and on-orbit command and control (C2) functionality, and backup operations at Schriever AFB and Vandenberg AFB, for MILSATCOM satellites as the legacy capability provided by the Air Force Satellite Control Network (PE 0305110F) has phased out according to plan.  CCS-C uses modified commercial off the shelf hardware/software to control all emerging and legacy MILSATCOM systems including Milstar, Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS), WGS and AEHF satellites.  The CCS-C project 644870 funds database development for WGS Block I and II satellites, and AEHF satellites 1 through 3.  The WGS and AEHF procurement program elements will fund the mission unique databases for the WGS Block II Follow-On satellties and the AEHF 4-6 satellites, respectively.  CCS-C will also evolve the system architecture to provide increased performance for additional satellites; to comply with DoD, Air Force, and AFSPC-directed standards for Information Assurance, Satellite Control, and Net-Readiness; and to support space situational awareness and new C2 training systems.    

  

FY13 funds provide required command and control capability to launch WGS and AEHF satellites. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funds will be used to target R&amp;D activities that demonstrate and prototype alternative weapon system manufacturing, remanufacturing, and maintenance materials and processes that reduce or eliminate hazardous chemicals, materials and waste streams through cost-effective programs and practices, while improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Specifically, funds target pollution prevention technologies that reduce or eliminate chromium, cadmium, and nickel, as well as reduce or eliminate Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPS), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and Class I and II Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS), global warmers and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and to increase the use of renewable and alternative fuels.  This effort is in Budget Activity 04, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, because the emphasis is on proving component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major and complex systems and may involve risk reduction initiatives.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funds will be used to target R&amp;D activities that demonstrate and prototype alternative weapon system manufacturing, remanufacturing, and maintenance materials and processes that reduce or eliminate hazardous chemicals, materials and waste streams through cost-effective programs and practices, while improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Specifically, funds target pollution prevention technologies that reduce or eliminate chromium, cadmium, and nickel, as well as reduce or eliminate Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPS), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and Class I and II Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS), global warmers and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and to increase the use of renewable and alternative fuels.  This effort is in Budget Activity 04, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, because the emphasis is on proving component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major and complex systems and may involve risk reduction initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>While the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) is an ACAT ID program, the Air Force Exhibit R-3 does not include "to complete" costs as the JPALS Land-Based Increment 2 (Air Force lead) is pre-Milestone B (FY13) and not Section 2366a certified.  The Sea-Based Increment 1a (Navy lead) is post-Milestone B and Section 2366a certified.  Reference Navy JPALS R-Doc for data (PNO 238).  

</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>JPALS is an Acquisition Category ID program with joint partners for requirements and acquisition including the USAF, USN/USMC, USA, and the Federal Aviation Administration (under the Next Generation (NextGen) Air Transportation System Program).  JPALS development includes an incremental approach employing a family of systems (FoS) to ensure joint, allied, coalition and Federal Aviation Administration/International Civil Aviation Organization interoperability.  On 16 March 2007, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved the Capability Development Document (CDD) for the JPALS FoS and Increment 1 for the Sea-Based System and designated the Navy as the JPALS lead Department of Defense (DoD) Component.  On 19 January 2010, the JROC approved Increment 2 for the Land-Based System and designated the Air Force as the lead component for the Land-Based System.   

JPALS is the next generation global positioning system (GPS)-based precision approach and landing system for the DoD.  It will replace several aging and obsolete aircraft landing systems with a FoS that will function in more operational environments and in a wide range of meteorological conditions.    

Because a cornerstone of the JPALS implementation strategy is worldwide and civil interoperability, JPALS must harmonize with US and International Civil Global Navigation Satellite Systems.  This is accomplished through participation in the development testing, and implementation of international standards through the North American Treaty Organization (NATO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization.  

Interoperability of the JPALS ground systems with all military and civil aircraft is a key aspect of the planned system.  Military aircraft must have worldwide access to civil and military airfields/air stations/operating locations in benign and hostile (GPS jamming) environments.  The JPALS Land-based Increment 2 system will provide a civil interoperable capability and also a military interoperable encrypted, jam-resistant capability.  JPALS will close capability gaps identified in the Precision Approach and Landing Capability Initial Capabilities Document.  These gaps include: interoperability for naval aircraft landing at shore-based airfields operated by other services, interoperability for Navy/Marine Corps and Army aircraft landing at civil airports, and for the Civil Reserve Air Fleet landing at DoD airfields. 

FY13 efforts focus on MS B documentation preparation and source selection to support contract award.  A MS B is planned for May 2013 with source selection continuing through Jul 2013.  The Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) contract will be awarded in Aug 2013.    


This program is in budget activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment. </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>JPALS is an Acquisition Category ID program with joint partners for requirements and acquisition including the USAF, USN/USMC, USA, and the Federal Aviation Administration (under the Next Generation (NextGen) Air Transportation System Program).  JPALS development includes an incremental approach employing a family of systems (FoS) to ensure joint, allied, coalition and Federal Aviation Administration/International Civil Aviation Organization interoperability.  On 16 March 2007, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved the Capability Development Document (CDD) for the JPALS FoS and Increment 1 for the Sea-Based System and designated the Navy as the JPALS lead Department of Defense (DoD) Component.  On 19 January 2010, the JROC approved Increment 2 for the Land-Based System and designated the Air Force as the lead component for the Land-Based System.   

JPALS is the next generation global positioning system (GPS)-based precision approach and landing system for the DoD.  It will replace several aging and obsolete aircraft landing systems with a FoS that will function in more operational environments and in a wide range of meteorological conditions.    

Because a cornerstone of the JPALS implementation strategy is worldwide and civil interoperability, JPALS must harmonize with US and International Civil Global Navigation Satellite Systems.  This is accomplished through participation in the development testing, and implementation of international standards through the North American Treaty Organization (NATO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization.  

Interoperability of the JPALS ground systems with all military and civil aircraft is a key aspect of the planned system.  Military aircraft must have worldwide access to civil and military airfields/air stations/operating locations in benign and hostile (GPS jamming) environments.  The JPALS Land-based Increment 2 system will provide a civil interoperable capability and also a military interoperable encrypted, jam-resistant capability.  JPALS will close capability gaps identified in the Precision Approach and Landing Capability Initial Capabilities Document.  These gaps include: interoperability for naval aircraft landing at shore-based airfields operated by other services, interoperability for Navy/Marine Corps and Army aircraft landing at civil airports, and for the Civil Reserve Air Fleet landing at DoD airfields. 

FY13 efforts focus on MS B documentation preparation and source selection to support contract award.  A MS B is planned for May 2013 with source selection continuing through Jul 2013.  The Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) contract will be awarded in Aug 2013.    


This program is in budget activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In FY 2014, Project 6002, Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3DELRR), transfers to PE 0207455F, Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3DELRR), Project 6002, in order to provide this pre-Major Defense Acquisition Program its own Program Element.

The Cost to Complete and Total Cost for MDAP projects in this program element are documented in the R3. The Cost to Complete and Total Cost on the R2 are entered as "Continuing" and not reflective of the total cost for MDAP projects since the R2 does not account for prior years funding.

</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Beginning in FY12, PE 0604283F funds the development of the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) which will replace the current legacy AN/TPS-75 radar.  3DELRR will be the principal USAF long-range, ground-based sensor for detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting aircraft and missiles in support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) through the Ground Theater Air Control System (GTACS).  The primary mission of the 3DELRR will be to provide long-range surveillance, control of aircraft, theater ballistic missile detection, and Combat Identification (CID).  The 3DELRR will respond to the operational need to detect and report highly maneuverable, small radar cross section targets to enable battlespace awareness while at the same time mitigating the reliability, maintainability, and sustainability issues plaguing the AN/TPS-75 radar system.  The 3DELRR will provide air controllers with a precise, real-time air picture of sufficient quality to conduct close control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions.  In the case of theater missile defense operations, the 3DELRR will have the capability to detect, track, and disseminate target information to respective command and control nodes, such as the Control and Reporting Center (CRC), for warning and engagement.  Similarly, the joint targeting process will benefit from trajectory information provided by the 3DELRR, including launch and impact locations. 

The Pre-EMD efforts of the 3DELRR Program begin in FY12 and continue through FY13.  Acquisition activities during this Pre-EMD effort timeframe will include, but are not limited to, source selection to award multiple contracts, requirements refinement, completion of the preliminary design development, continued software and hardware subsystem-level development, modeling and simulation to support the system development, implementation of mitigation techniques to combat existing and emerging system threats (including cyber warfare), test planning, and implementation of the program protection plan. A Preliminary Design Review (PDR), and Capability Demonstration C Event will be conducted during this timeframe to ensure that the program is successful in the development of a mature preliminary system design.  Activities will also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning as well as finalization of Milestone B documentation and preparation for a Milestone B review.


In FY11 PE 0604283F BMC2 Sensor Development funded the Next Generation Aerial Ground Surveillance Radar strategy development.   The primary mission of Next Generation Radar (NGR) is the development of an Open System Architecture (OSA) specification to guide all future USAF Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) /Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) development.  NGR will develop an integration environment to define, validate, and verify compliance with the government OSA specification, through analysis and demonstration.  NGR will develop a GMTI/SAR roadmap that assesses current and future radar technologies to guide future USAF investment strategy.  NGR will provide the USAF a platform-independent OSA radar technology maturation and risk reduction effort.  NGR will enable the future development of OSA prototype radar to allow the rapid fielding of capabilities addressing evolving needs of detection and tracking in support of future requirements and capability gaps.


This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Beginning in FY12, PE 0604283F funds the development of the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) which will replace the current legacy AN/TPS-75 radar.  3DELRR will be the principal USAF long-range, ground-based sensor for detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting aircraft and missiles in support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) through the Ground Theater Air Control System (GTACS).  The primary mission of the 3DELRR will be to provide long-range surveillance, control of aircraft, theater ballistic missile detection, and Combat Identification (CID).  The 3DELRR will respond to the operational need to detect and report highly maneuverable, small radar cross section targets to enable battlespace awareness while at the same time mitigating the reliability, maintainability, and sustainability issues plaguing the AN/TPS-75 radar system.  The 3DELRR will provide air controllers with a precise, real-time air picture of sufficient quality to conduct close control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions.  In the case of theater missile defense operations, the 3DELRR will have the capability to detect, track, and disseminate target information to respective command and control nodes, such as the Control and Reporting Center (CRC), for warning and engagement.  Similarly, the joint targeting process will benefit from trajectory information provided by the 3DELRR, including launch and impact locations. 

The Pre-EMD efforts of the 3DELRR Program begin in FY12 and continue through FY13.  Acquisition activities during this Pre-EMD effort timeframe will include, but are not limited to, source selection to award multiple contracts, requirements refinement, completion of the preliminary design development, continued software and hardware subsystem-level development, modeling and simulation to support the system development, implementation of mitigation techniques to combat existing and emerging system threats (including cyber warfare), test planning, and implementation of the program protection plan. A Preliminary Design Review (PDR), and Capability Demonstration C Event will be conducted during this timeframe to ensure that the program is successful in the development of a mature preliminary system design.  Activities will also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning as well as finalization of Milestone B documentation and preparation for a Milestone B review.


In FY11 PE 0604283F BMC2 Sensor Development funded the Next Generation Aerial Ground Surveillance Radar strategy development.   The primary mission of Next Generation Radar (NGR) is the development of an Open System Architecture (OSA) specification to guide all future USAF Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) /Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) development.  NGR will develop an integration environment to define, validate, and verify compliance with the government OSA specification, through analysis and demonstration.  NGR will develop a GMTI/SAR roadmap that assesses current and future radar technologies to guide future USAF investment strategy.  NGR will provide the USAF a platform-independent OSA radar technology maturation and risk reduction effort.  NGR will enable the future development of OSA prototype radar to allow the rapid fielding of capabilities addressing evolving needs of detection and tracking in support of future requirements and capability gaps.


This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Note:  In FY 2012, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) transferred this program to the Air Force.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Technology Transfer was called Defense Technology Transfer and Defense Technology Link (TechLink) in previous OSD budgets.  This program was devolved from OSD to achieve efficiencies in program management.

The three-fold mission of Technology Transfer is:
(1) integration of advanced commercial-sector technologies into Department of Defense (DoD) systems, particularly from non-traditional defense contractors;
(2) spin-off of DoD-developed technologies to industry to make these technologies available for military acquisition; and
(3) establishment of collaborative Research and Development (R&amp;D) projects with the private sector for cost-sharing of new dual-use technology development.

This effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, since it involves system specific efforts that help expedite technology transfer to and from the commercial sector for operational use.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Technology Transfer was called Defense Technology Transfer and Defense Technology Link (TechLink) in previous OSD budgets.  This program was devolved from OSD to achieve efficiencies in program management.

The three-fold mission of Technology Transfer is:
(1) integration of advanced commercial-sector technologies into Department of Defense (DoD) systems, particularly from non-traditional defense contractors;
(2) spin-off of DoD-developed technologies to industry to make these technologies available for military acquisition; and
(3) establishment of collaborative Research and Development (R&amp;D) projects with the private sector for cost-sharing of new dual-use technology development.

This effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, since it involves system specific efforts that help expedite technology transfer to and from the commercial sector for operational use.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Direct Strike Penetrator Systems project includes development of Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), an advanced precision guided penetrator munition that will provide the Air Force with an improved capability using air-to-surface conventional munitions to attack HDBTs, such as bunker and tunnel facilities, with fewer weapons and number of missions necessary to defeat targets and increase overall survivability.  The system will hold at risk those highest priority assets essential to the enemy's warfighting ability, which are heavily defended and protected, providing a critical global strike capability not currently met by inventory conventional weapons.  Direct Strike Penetrator Systems also includes an analysis and report to evaluate the performance, operational suitability, and cost of alternative hard target defeat systems.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because effort are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Direct Strike Penetrator Systems project includes development of Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), an advanced precision guided penetrator munition that will provide the Air Force with an improved capability using air-to-surface conventional munitions to attack HDBTs, such as bunker and tunnel facilities, with fewer weapons and number of missions necessary to defeat targets and increase overall survivability.  The system will hold at risk those highest priority assets essential to the enemy's warfighting ability, which are heavily defended and protected, providing a critical global strike capability not currently met by inventory conventional weapons.  Direct Strike Penetrator Systems also includes an analysis and report to evaluate the performance, operational suitability, and cost of alternative hard target defeat systems.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because effort are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Next Generation Missile (NGM), or JDRADM, completed the pre-MSA phase of acquisition with risk reduction and critical technology maturity efforts supported by the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL).  The program completed an MDD Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) in Nov 10 and proceeded into the MSA phase.  Development of the NGM acquisition/contract strategy and formalizing requirements continues to evolve pending the completion of the evaluation of alternative weapons effort.  The preliminary findings of this effort have determined that the technology maturation is not consistent with proceeding to the Technology Development (TD) phase and the cost at this time is too prohibitive; therefore, the program has been terminated.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Requirements Analysis and Maturation (RAM) program addresses a critical need for decision-quality information prior to initiating a new acquisition program by executing integrated materiel studies and analyses across the Air Force (AF) enterprise (air, space, and cyber).  A number of Department of Defense (DoD), Government Accountability Office, and industry studies point to a need for more disciplined, early-phase systems engineering and pre-systems acquisition planning to produce the detailed acquisition information that previously did not surface until after the initiation of a program.  Activities funded by the RAM program element include system and sub-system concept development, acquisition strategy development, modeling and simulation, cost analysis, pre-planning required for successful demonstration and validation of prototypes and systems-of-systems demonstrations, and costs associated with these activities, to include travel.  This comprehensive approach supports acquisition courses of action to initiate high-confidence acquisition programs.  Specific efforts are determined each year by requests submitted from AF Major Commands and subsequently prioritized and approved by the AF Development Planning Governance Structure.  This effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, since it involves system specific efforts that expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Weather Satellite Follow-on (WSF) activities were funded in this PE (0604422F) starting in FY 2012.

</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Weather Satellite System (DWSS) program in RDT&amp;E, AF PE 0305178F was terminated per Congressional direction in FY 2012.  DoD will utilize the remaining Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites to satisfy DoD overhead weather requirements until a follow-on capability can be acquired.  

Weather Satellite Follow-on (WSF) activities support requirements analysis, analysis of alternatives (AoA), and acquisition of capabilities which will satisfy DoD overhead terrestrial and space weather requirements during, and after, fly-out of DMSP.

WSF activities provide a foundation to transition from the current DMSP program to a future capability which will satisfy DoD overhead weather requirements.  The range of WSF activities include requirements development and trades, analysis and possible implementation of alternative sources of weather data, architecture and systems engineering analysis, and technical risk reduction for viable sensor and spacecraft technologies.  Use of affordable, mature technology will be emphasized for the WSF activities.  

BA-4 - This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Weather Satellite Follow-on (WSF) activities were funded in this PE (0604422F) starting in FY 2012.
</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Weather Satellite System (DWSS) program in RDT&amp;E, AF PE 0305178F was terminated per Congressional direction in FY 2012.  DoD will utilize the remaining Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites to satisfy DoD overhead weather requirements until a follow-on capability can be acquired.  

Weather Satellite Follow-on (WSF) activities support requirements analysis, analysis of alternatives (AoA), and acquisition of capabilities which will satisfy DoD overhead terrestrial and space weather requirements during, and after, fly-out of DMSP.

WSF activities provide a foundation to transition from the current DMSP program to a future capability which will satisfy DoD overhead weather requirements.  The range of WSF activities include requirements development and trades, analysis and possible implementation of alternative sources of weather data, architecture and systems engineering analysis, and technical risk reduction for viable sensor and spacecraft technologies.  Use of affordable, mature technology will be emphasized for the WSF activities.  

BA-4 - This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element funds technology demonstration, development and study efforts for future Satellite Communications (SATCOM) capability enhancements.  These capabilities could be utilized on future blocks of current SATCOM systems, hosted SATCOM payloads, or next-generation SATCOM systems.  The goal of the effort is to sufficiently mature new technologies, system architectures, and business concepts to reduce overall risk of future SATCOM efforts and improve space/ground/terminal synchronization.  No funds are requested in FY13.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF) is an advanced system designed to provide fuzing and void sensing functions for a weapon to penetrate and destroy hardened targets protected by multiple layers of soil and/or reinforced concrete.  The HTVS Fuze shall also provide in-flight cockpit programmability, safing and arming, multi-function (time delay and void sensing) and multi-delay arming.  FY 2012 and FY 2013 funding includes follow-on risk reduction and Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) efforts to the the Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF) Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) previously funded in PE 0604602F, Armament Ordnance Development for Research, Development, Test &amp; Engineering (RDT&amp;E).  This Program Element was created to include the whole spectrum of fuze development and is positioned in Budget Activity 4 - Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.

Procurement of the HTVSF is funded in PE 0208030F, WRM Ammunition, in Procurement of Ammunition, Air Force (PAAF).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF) is an advanced system designed to provide fuzing and void sensing functions for a weapon to penetrate and destroy hardened targets protected by multiple layers of soil and/or reinforced concrete.  The HTVS Fuze shall also provide in-flight cockpit programmability, safing and arming, multi-function (time delay and void sensing) and multi-delay arming.  FY 2012 and FY 2013 funding includes follow-on risk reduction and Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) efforts to the the Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF) Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) previously funded in PE 0604602F, Armament Ordnance Development for Research, Development, Test &amp; Engineering (RDT&amp;E).  This Program Element was created to include the whole spectrum of fuze development and is positioned in Budget Activity 4 - Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.

Procurement of the HTVSF is funded in PE 0208030F, WRM Ammunition, in Procurement of Ammunition, Air Force (PAAF).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Alternative Fuels program manages the certification of current and future alternative fuels for operational use in all legacy and future weapons systems, applicable support equipment, and fuel delivery and storage infrastructure.  The alternative fuel types being evaluated and certified include various synthetic fuels, bio-mass derived fuels, and fuel blend technologies.  This effort includes complete system evaluations, studies and analysis, subsystem and system-level testing, safety, environmental analysis, fuel stock purchase, fuel storage and transport and other USAF certification costs.  Scope of activities include interaction with all USAF weapon system single managers to accomplish complete certification activities for applicable weapon systems.  Initiative supports USAF assured fuels effort to decrease US dependence on foreign oil and secure additional fuel-types on which to conduct world-wide operations.

Disposition of certification requirements for all USAF Commercial Derivative Aircraft (CDA) using the HRJ fuel blend will be accomplished.  Evaluation of infrastructure, toxicology, ESOH, and fire suppression effectiveness of the HRJ blend will be completed.  Acquisition of supplemental quantities of HRJ fuels is also planned (as required).  MIL-HDBK-510 will be revised and published.  

An F-16 Field Service Evaluations (FSEs) using the HRJ blend is being conducted to verify extended operational use durability. 

Transportation and storage of fuel for test locations will be accomplished including associated management and support costs. 

Phase I of the ATJ pathway is underway and includes the purchase of approximately 11K gallons of RDT&amp;E fuel stocks and a feasibility demonstration of an A-10 Weapon System (flight test, materials, engine, sub-systems, etc).  </r2:Text>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Beginning in FY 2013, 0604857F, ORS, efforts are being descoped, and the remaining efforts transferred to other space programs in order to better integrate the ORS concept into the entire space architecture.

There is no funding required for this program beyond the FYDP.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The successful integration of space-based capabilities into the core of U.S. national security operations has resulted in dramatically increased demand for and dependence upon space capabilities. As a result, U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) identified three needs: 1) to rapidly augment existing space capabilities when needed to expand operational capability; 2) to rapidly reconstitute/replenish critical space capabilities to preserve “continuity of operations” capability; 3) to rapidly exploit and infuse space technological or operational innovations to increase U.S. advantage. 

Since the ORS standup in 2007, the terms resiliency and responsiveness in association with space programs are now seen in almost every policy and guidance document, not just at the DoD level, but at a National level as well.  Resilience has become a key criterion in evaluating alternative architectures, including cost-effective space system protection, hosting payloads on a mix of platforms in various orbits, drawing on distributed international and commercial partner capabilities, and developing and maturing responsive space capabilities.  We are transitioning the activities of the ORS program, and synergistically applying its efforts to other space technology efforts.

This refocused effort will integrate the operationally responsive space efforts, principles and activities into the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC).  SMC will then be better able to develop various enablers to ensure resilience, survivability and flexibility and to explore space mission augmentation options.  SMC will also be better positioned to incorporate responsive and resilient R&amp;D efforts into other platforms.

The Department of Defense will support the new approach by developing architectures for space mission areas that will include international cooperation and commercial solutions  and will also look at how space missions are sustained and augmented to support the warfighter in all contingencies.  This strategy will also integrate the lessons learned from the ORS program office’s accomplishments into existing space programs of record.  The end result of the program’s termination will be that operationally responsive space activities are fully integrated into SMC’s ongoing architectures and Space Modernization Initiative, increasing resilience and flexibility in space systems.

This program is in Budget Activity 04, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, because the efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes, and prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic environment.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>ORS Common Services supports the entire ORS partnership (Services, Intelligence Community, Reserve Component, NASA, and our Allies).  These activities include studies and analysis to maintain the ORS investment roadmap and coordination and planning activities across the ORS Enterprise.  ORS Common Services works with Joint Force Commanders (JFC) and the Services to identify the most likely emergent space needs, make plans and preparations to meet those needs, evaluate results of operational experimentation, and prepare plans and procedures for operational employment and transition.  These foundational activities ensure ORS enabler investments are optimally targeted to quickly mature ORS's ability to execute rapid responses to time-critical needs when they arise.  Common Services identifies and presents options for concepts/solutions and experimentation including international efforts, conducts concepts development, solutions assessment, rapid evaluation of alternatives, experimentation planning, modeling and simulation, and develops budgetary recommendations for ORS solutions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY 2013, 0604857F, ORS, efforts are being descoped, and the remaining efforts transferred to other space programs in order to better integrate the ORS concept into the entire space architecture.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Operationally Responsive Space projects were optimized for prioritized theater use and/or surge, augmentation and replenishment of traditional space capabilities.  The ORS Concept of Operations (CONOPS) drives the need for satellites featuring high degrees of modularity, standard interface vehicles, and the use of plug and play payloads and buses.

The Air Force will continue to maintain ORS-1, launched 29 Jun 2011 to respond to USCENTCOM’s urgent need, validated by USSTRATCOM, to provide ISR for theater warfighters.  The additional ORS Office efforts of maturing enabling elements will be descoped and the knowledge base will be transitioned as appropriate to other space programs including Global Positioning System, Advanced EHF Milsatcom, Space Based Infrared System, Space Control Technology, and the rest of the space architecture.

ORS is working with the University of Hawaii’s (U of H) Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory (HSFL) and Sandia National Laboratory on the Low Earth Orbit Nanosatellite Integrated Defense Autonomous Systems (LEONIDAS) program.  LEONIDAS is to design, fabricate, launch, and perform on-orbit operations of small and micro-satellites for early detection of missile launches by hostile forces.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Technology Transition Program (TTP) provides funding to mature and demonstrate technologies to enable or accelerate their transition to legacy or acquisition programs of record.  It addresses the gap that exists between when a technology is first demonstrated and when it can be successfully acquired as an operational capability.  TTP bridges that gap by funding promising system and subsystem concepts for technology integration and demonstration to continue beyond the laboratory.  It allows acquisition program managers (the developers and providers) and warfighters (the end users) to integrate, prototype, and demonstrate candidate technologies and assess them in an operational environment.  As a result, the warfighters can assess the capability first-hand and accurately fund the follow-on acquisition program during the next budgeting cycle.  TTP includes research and development funds for the following transition activities: (1) prototyping of promising, high-priority concepts and technologies in an operational environment to lower acquisition risk by raising the technology readiness level; (2) performing pre-acquisition systems engineering to facilitate transition from a demonstration program into acquisition programs of record; (3) assessing interface requirements of candidate concepts, technologies, and demonstration projects to better understand true engineering costs resulting from insertion of new technologies into the Air Force architecture; and (4) capturing data through information technology tools and databases to help formulate strategies and gather proposals for development that have the potential to perform Department of Defense (DoD) missions.  The program provides funding to mature adaptive turbine engine technologies for next generation propulsion systems.  The program will leverage adaptive turbine engine science and technology demonstrations to develop a multi-platform common adaptive engine built around a commercially derived core.  It will enable multiple high confidence engine acquisition programs through the common engine architecture, and accomplishment of early risk reduction and early competition prior to an acquisition program.  TTP funding will also provide for the demonstration of systems and technology to enable increasingly responsive, resilient, and affordable architectures via development of hostable payloads, small satellites, interface standards, and government/commercial hosting opportunities.  These efforts are in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, since they involve system specific efforts that help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Technology Transition Program (TTP) provides funding to mature and demonstrate technologies to enable or accelerate their transition to legacy or acquisition programs of record.  It addresses the gap that exists between when a technology is first demonstrated and when it can be successfully acquired as an operational capability.  TTP bridges that gap by funding promising system and subsystem concepts for technology integration and demonstration to continue beyond the laboratory.  It allows acquisition program managers (the developers and providers) and warfighters (the end users) to integrate, prototype, and demonstrate candidate technologies and assess them in an operational environment.  As a result, the warfighters can assess the capability first-hand and accurately fund the follow-on acquisition program during the next budgeting cycle.  TTP includes research and development funds for the following transition activities: (1) prototyping of promising, high-priority concepts and technologies in an operational environment to lower acquisition risk by raising the technology readiness level; (2) performing pre-acquisition systems engineering to facilitate transition from a demonstration program into acquisition programs of record; (3) assessing interface requirements of candidate concepts, technologies, and demonstration projects to better understand true engineering costs resulting from insertion of new technologies into the Air Force architecture; and (4) capturing data through information technology tools and databases to help formulate strategies and gather proposals for development that have the potential to perform Department of Defense (DoD) missions.  The program provides funding to mature adaptive turbine engine technologies for next generation propulsion systems.  The program will leverage adaptive turbine engine science and technology demonstrations to develop a multi-platform common adaptive engine built around a commercially derived core.  It will enable multiple high confidence engine acquisition programs through the common engine architecture, and accomplishment of early risk reduction and early competition prior to an acquisition program.  TTP funding will also provide for the demonstration of systems and technology to enable increasingly responsive, resilient, and affordable architectures via development of hostable payloads, small satellites, interface standards, and government/commercial hosting opportunities.  These efforts are in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, since they involve system specific efforts that help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>TTP enables a more effective and prioritized transition of technologies to the warfighter. It allows more accurate cost estimating and more comprehensive systems integration to occur through the use of prototypes and user assessments until the sponsoring MAJCOM can incorporate the technology into their subsequent budget submission. The Air Force, through appropriate program offices, will manage the acquisition and development process for the integration and fielding of SAE-approved TTP projects. Each project will have a complete acquisition plan defined and approved as a criterion for subsequent funding.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The restructure from the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) program to the Defense Weather Satellite System (DWSS) was finalized in FY 2011.  The DWSS program was terminated per Congressional direction in FY 2012.  DoD will utilize the remaining Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites to satisfy DoD overhead weather requirements until a follow-on capability can be acquired.  All FY 2012 activities in this PE support DWSS program termination.

Weather Satellite Follow-on (WSF) activities were funded starting in FY 2012 using a new RDT&amp;E, AF PE (0604422F).

The Cost to Complete and Total Cost for MDAP projects in this program element are documented in the R3. The Cost to Complete and Total Cost on the R2 are entered as "Continuing" and not reflective of the total cost for MDAP projects since the R2 does not account for prior years funding.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Presidential Decision Directive/National Science and Technology Council-2 (PDD/NCTC-2) (May 1994) directed the DoD, Department of Commerce (DOC), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to establish a converged national polar-orbiting weather satellite program.  The converged program, the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS), combined the follow-on to DoD’s Defense Meteorological Satellite System (DMSP) and the DOC’s Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) program. 

On 1 February 2010, the Executive Office of the President announced a restructure of the NPOESS program which directed the acquisition and development of separate military and civil weather satellite programs.  The Air Force began acquisition of the Defense Weather Satellite System (DWSS) to satisfy military weather requirements.  The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will acquire the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) and a shared common ground system to address civil weather and environmental requirements.  The DWSS system was designed to produce environmental data records for regional/global meteorological, oceanographic, environmental, climatic data, and space environmental remote sensing information.  DWSS capabilities would enable the anticipation and exploitation of atmospheric and space environment conditions for military operations planning.  DWSS data would also be instrumental to civilian weather forecasters as they work to improve climate forecasting and severe weather modeling and prediction, reducing the potential for loss of civilian life and property.

The DWSS program was designed to satisfy DoD’s environmental monitoring requirements in the early morning orbit by developing and launching two satellites [flight-1 (F1) and flight-2 (F2)], each with an electro-optical sensor, Space Environment Monitor (SEM-N), and a microwave sensor, with a planned initial launch capability no earlier than 2018.

RDT&amp;E funds in FY 2011 were used for early development of the two DWSS satellites, contract restructure efforts, and continued transition of non-DoD payloads to NASA/NOAA for JPSS.

RDT&amp;E funds in FY 2012 were used to support DWSS program termination activities such as: leveraging and/or transitioning government investments in the NPOESS/DWSS program including electro-optical, microwave, and space weather sensors, spacecraft, materials, algorithms and other DoD-specific elements of the common ground system; acquiring if necessary, any intellectual property rights and data; storage of program assets for potential future use; and covering any contractor or government liabilities incurred while performing termination activities.  FY 2012 funds were also used to complete the transition of non-DoD payloads and support to NOAA/NASA for the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Presidential Decision Directive/National Science and Technology Council-2 (PDD/NCTC-2) (May 1994) directed the DoD, Department of Commerce (DOC), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to establish a converged national polar-orbiting weather satellite program.  The converged program, the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS), combined the follow-on to DoD’s Defense Meteorological Satellite System (DMSP) and the DOC’s Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) program. 

On 1 February 2010, the Executive Office of the President announced a restructure of the NPOESS program which directed the acquisition and development of separate military and civil weather satellite programs.  The Air Force began acquisition of the Defense Weather Satellite System (DWSS) to satisfy military weather requirements.  The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will acquire the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) and a shared common ground system to address civil weather and environmental requirements.  The DWSS system was designed to produce environmental data records for regional/global meteorological, oceanographic, environmental, climatic data, and space environmental remote sensing information.  DWSS capabilities would enable the anticipation and exploitation of atmospheric and space environment conditions for military operations planning.  DWSS data would also be instrumental to civilian weather forecasters as they work to improve climate forecasting and severe weather modeling and prediction, reducing the potential for loss of civilian life and property.

The DWSS program was designed to satisfy DoD’s environmental monitoring requirements in the early morning orbit by developing and launching two satellites [flight-1 (F1) and flight-2 (F2)], each with an electro-optical sensor, Space Environment Monitor (SEM-N), and a microwave sensor, with a planned initial launch capability no earlier than 2018.

RDT&amp;E funds in FY 2011 were used for early development of the two DWSS satellites, contract restructure efforts, and continued transition of non-DoD payloads to NASA/NOAA for JPSS.

RDT&amp;E funds in FY 2012 were used to support DWSS program termination activities such as: leveraging and/or transitioning government investments in the NPOESS/DWSS program including electro-optical, microwave, and space weather sensors, spacecraft, materials, algorithms and other DoD-specific elements of the common ground system; acquiring if necessary, any intellectual property rights and data; storage of program assets for potential future use; and covering any contractor or government liabilities incurred while performing termination activities.  FY 2012 funds were also used to complete the transition of non-DoD payloads and support to NOAA/NASA for the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS).

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Broadcast Service provides DoD with an efficient, high data rate broadcast capability from distributed information sources to dispersed warfighters who receive the broadcast directly on small, inexpensive user terminals.  This Program Element funds the broadcast transmit activities associated with the GBS architecture.  The GBS broadcast receive segment consists of  Service-funded terminals, known as Receive Suites, which receive the broadcast and then disseminate information to local users.   Service Receive Suites and the integration into service networks are funded in other Program Elements.  GBS broadcast data includes video (especially from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), imagery, logistics, weather data, maps and operational orders.  The GBS space segment includes transponders on operational Navy satellites, currently Ultra High Frequency Follow-On (UFO) 8 and UFO 10, augmentation by commercial leased Ku-band transponders, and now the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) System.  

Currently, the GBS broadcast segment consists of Satellite Broadcast Managers (SBMs) for the broadcast build and Primary Injection Points (PIPs) for the broadcast uplink, and the Transportable Satellite Broadcast Managers (TSBMs) for the broadcast build in theatre.  The SBMs and PIPs, together known as Transmit Suites, are located at Navy facilities.  The Theatre Injection Point (TIP) is a ground mobile satellite terminal suite transportable via two heavy High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV) consisting of the TSBM and the Army Phoenix terminal.  

During FY09-13, the broadcast creation transitions to existing Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs). This transition addresses SBM hardware/software obsolescence issues.  The DECC transition contract was awarded on 15 May 09.  This effort was designated as an ACAT III program and funding was realigned (i.e., a separate project was created) to delineate between the current ACAT I GBS program and the ACAT III SBM Transition program.    

In FY13, this effort completes SBM transition/upgrade to DECCs, as well as systems transmission security, test, information assurance, program office support and Operational Requirements Document (ORD) III studies.

Funding is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, since program is fielding pre-production equipment.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provide for the technical oversight of all Air Force (AF) nuclear weapons, delivery systems, and support systems to include all phases of acquisition.  Provide the engineering and technical management expertise required in critical areas of nuclear weapons safety, security, reliability, operations, modernization, testing, certification, and counter proliferation.

Analyze and document nuclear weapons issues related to risk assessment, data collection, model development, model validation, and weapon effectiveness in support of the DoD-DoE Annual Surety Report; DoE Stockpile Stewardship Plan; DoD-DoE Nuclear Weapon Annual Assessment; and DoD-DoE nuclear stockpile planning and requirements assessment. 

Air Force Legacy Nuclear Stockpile:  In accordance with DoDI 5030.55 and AFI 63-103, funding is used for scheduled, planned, and unplanned activities that support current active and inactive stockpile.  Activities include stockpile maintenance; exploratory testing associated with significant finding investigations; DoD leadership, management, and oversight of the Air Force-led, joint DoD-DoE Nuclear Project Officer and Life Extension Groups to manage the B61, B83, W78, W87, W80 and W84 nuclear warheads and associated weapons; testing in support of DoE; associated AF components, and independent technical reviews of DoE National Laboratory processes.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Execute technical &amp; operational analysis support for system specific programs, using commands, and leadership as directed.

Develop proposed materiel solutions.  Transition selected nuclear and non-nuclear concepts into an acquisition development effort to include identifying funding, and developing technical, schedule, and programmatic content.

Prepare the necessary acquisition-related documentation to support program and/or decision reviews.

Develop, evaluate, and utilize tools required for the employment of current inventory and new concepts for combating WMD weapons to include intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; battle damage assessment; and target defeat and collateral effects predictions for current and future operations.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Supports Air Education and Training Command's (AETC) implementation of Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) and the Department of Defense initiative for joint pilot training.  The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) is a joint USAF/USN venture to replace the Services' fleets of primary trainer aircraft (T-37 and T-34 respectively) and their associated Ground Based Training Systems (GBTS) with the T-6 and its GBTS.  The Air Force is the Executive Service.  The T-38 AUP is an integrated modernization of the T-38A and AT-38B cockpits to support mission ready fighter and bomber training.  The Advanced Trainer Replacement (T-X) program is a replacement for the T-38 trainer aircraft used in the advanced fighter/bomber SUPT track.    

Provides for development and test of upgrades and enhancements to aircraft and the Ground Based Training System (GBTS) hardware and software components. 

Provides for studies and development of the next generation of advanced fighter/bomber pilot trainer aircraft and GBTS.

This program element is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it primarily involves the missionization of commercial derivative and essentially non-developmental aircraft, equipment, and components.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) is a joint USAF/USN venture to replace the Services' fleets of primary trainer aircraft (T-37 and T-34, respectively) and associated Ground Based Training Systems (GBTS).  The T-6 aircraft and GBTS are used to train entry-level student aviators in the fundamentals of flying so they can transition into advanced training tracks leading to qualification as military pilots, combat systems officers, and naval flight officers.  The program includes the purchase of aircraft, simulators, and other associated ground-based training devices, Training Integration Management System (TIMS), instructional courseware, and logistics support to include Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) and development activities related to DMSMS.  FY2013-FY2017 JPATS funding will be used to develop and test upgrades and enhancements to hardware and software components.  

FY2011, FY2013 and FY2015 include funding to upgrade software and threat libraries for the Simulator for Electronic Combat Technology (SECT), a generic electronic warfare simulator used to train student combat systems officers.  Although in the same project, SECT is unrelated to the JPATS program.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JPATS was competitively awarded with the intent of maximizing the use of commercially available equipment and best commercial practices.  Initially, the JPATS Program competitively awarded two contracts:  a Firm Fixed Price Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) Operations and Maintenance funded contract and a Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF) manufacturing development (MD)/production contract with seven options.  The FY2002 (Lots 9-13) production contract for both the air vehicle and GBTS is Firm Fixed Price, FAR Part 12 (commercial).  The FY2007 production follow-on contract for both the air vehicle and GBTS was awarded as a FAR Part 15 action. 

The SECT upgrade effort is an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to the competitively awarded Firm Fixed Price Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The T-38C Avionics Upgrade Program (AUP) installed a “Glass Cockpit” in the T-38 upgrading T-38A/B models to T-38C models.  The AUP modification, which utilizes a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) approach to acquire kits, is currently in sustainment phase and requires regular block upgrades to incorporate software, hardware improvements, and new requirements as mandated by Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration and National Aerospace System (DoD/FAA/NAS) and flight safety issues into both the aircraft and Aircrew Training Devices (ATD).  This effort also includes support to obtain Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) certification associated with each block upgrade.  Further, engineering services, studies, analysis and support to determine the feasibility of incorporating changes for making informed lifecycle cost business decisions based on Diminishing Manufacturing Resources and Material Shortages (DMSMS).

This project is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it primarily involves the missionization of NDI or COTS equipment and components.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Trainer Replacement, T-X, will replace the USAF T-38 aircraft and associated Ground Based Training System (GBTS) currently used in the fighter/bomber advanced Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) track as well as in the Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) program.  The T-38 was first introduced in 1961.  FY13 will consist of studies and acquisition activities to support future technology, engineering and manufacturing development.

This project is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it primarily involves the missionization of essentially non-developmental aircraft, equipment, and components.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) consolidates Air Force funding and management of common Electronic Warfare (EW) systems from Materiel Solutions Analysis through Engineering and Manufacturing Development and transition to operational capability.  EW is an integral warfighting effect supporting AF Global Strike, Global Persistent Attack and Global Mobility operations as well as Joint-Coalition operations.  EW systems influence, deceive, disrupt, degrade, deny, and destroy threats to air operations throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. This PE supports Electronic Support (ES), Electronic Protection (EP), and Electronic Attack (EA).  ES programs support the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information related to the detection, geo-location, characterization, and identification of threats to air operations.  EP Programs preserve the electromagnetic spectrum for use by friendly forces.  EA programs provide self-protection through active and passive measures that deceive threats to air operations using kinetic and non-kinetic means to defeat threats that rely on the electromagnetic spectrum (Radio Frequency (RF), Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR)).  

This program is in budget activity 5 - System Development and Demonstration of common EW systems to meet user requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Infrared Countermeasure (AIRCM) project contains related aircraft self-protection efforts aimed at increasing aircraft survivability against the increasing threat of sophisticated infrared-guided surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles.  These missiles may employ sophisticated next-generation electro-optics or dual-mode IR and radio frequency seekers.  AIRCM will provide advanced IR expendable countermeasures and/or IRCM techniques that will be functionally compatible with existing dispenser systems and employed across multiple USAF weapons systems.  This also explicitly includes any and all flare and decoy development and testing that may be demanded or needed in current operations supporting the war on terrorism regardless of aircraft platform.  Similar activities that are supplementary to this effort may be accomplished ad hoc using platform specific funding or through other testing activities such as joint services or NATO test groups.

This program is in budget activity 5 - System Development and Demonstration of common EW systems to meet user requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AN/ALR-69A Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) is an evolutionary development program consisting of a core digital receiver/processor with growth increments.  The core ALR-69A program objectives are to improve identification of threat type, detect threat signals while outside of the threat envelope, and operate in a dense signal environment.  Evolutionary growth spirals include single and multi-ship Precision Geolocation (PG) as well as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI).  The underlying technologies and algorithms enabling PG and SEI are often collectively referred to as Precision Location and Identification (PLAID).

ALR-69A development is currently focused on a replacement RWR for AFSOC and AMC C-130 aircraft.  The ALR-69A is also under consideration by AFSOC, AMC and ACC for integration and installation in other mission design series aircraft.

This program is in budget activity 5 - System Development and Demonstration of common EW systems to meet user requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops the Miniature Air Launched Decoy Jammer (MALD-J). The jammer is a variant of the MALD decoy and will be able to operate in both decoy and jammer modes.  The decoy and jammer configurations are key enablers supporting the Air Force Global Strike, Global Response, Space and C4ISR, and the Air and Space Expeditionary Force Concepts of Operations.  MALD-J will provide stand-in jamming capability for the Airborne Electronic Attack Systems of Systems.  It will be launched against a preplanned target and jam specific radars in a stand-in role to degrade or deny the Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) detection of friendly aircraft or munitions.  

Planned efforts for this program are risk reduction (to include prototyping) and Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) of the jammer configuration and any other direct increment or variant.  This will include design, development, test, aircraft integration, and seamless verification.

This program is in budget activity 5 - System Development and Demonstration of common Electronic Warfare (EW) systems to meet user requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY2012, This project is broken out from BPAC 655305.
In FY2013 Project 657004, MALD-J Increment II was terminated.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops the Miniature Air Launched Decoy Jammer (MALD-J) Increment II.  Increment II will have increased effective radiated power, sensitivity, and improved techniques to counter emerging threats and will be able to operate in both decoy and improved jammer modes.  Increment II will be a key enabler for the Airborne Electronic Attack Systems of Systems supporting the Air Force Global Strike, Global Response, Space and C4ISR, and the Air and Space Expeditionary Force Concepts of Operations.  It will be launched against a preplanned target and jam specific radars in a stand-in role to degrade or deny integrated air defense system detection of friendly aircraft or munitions. 

This program is terminated in FY13.  The Air Force is completing concept refinement and will initiate program shutdown activities.

This program is in budget activity 5 - System Development and Demonstration of common EW systems to meet user requirements.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The JTRS Budget Item Justification is located in the Navy's FY 2013 President's Budget under Joint Tactical Radio System Program (PE 0604280N, BA 5).  The JTRS development program is a joint program managed through the JTRS JPEO.  The funding for the program resides in the Navy budget.   Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) is the Department of Defense family of common software-defined programmable radios that will form the foundation of radio frequency information transmission for Joint Vision 2020.  JTRS radios are intended to interoperate with existing radio systems and provide the warfighter with additional communications capability to access maps and other visual data, communicate via voice and video and obtain information directly from battlefield sensors.  JTRS will provide internet protocol (IP)-based capability to the warfighter and will replace all existing tactical radios based on the Services' migration plans.  The JTRS program is built around an open Software Communications Architecture (SCA), allowing common software waveform applications to be implemented across the family of radios to provide joint-service, allied, and coalition interoperability.  JTRS is a key enabler that will provide dynamic connectivity throughout the battle space to operate within the network centric operational environment.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production. </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The JTRS development program is a joint program managed through the JTRS JPEO. Each of the joint services, including the Air Force, transfers its funding to the Navy's budget under Joint Tactical Radio System Program (PE 0604280N, BA 5). This annual transfer of funds to the Navy PE is the cause of the seemingly drastic change from current ($180M in FY12, and $65M in FY13) to future fiscal years. The reduction in funding in RDT&amp;E predicted from FY 2013 to 2016 is based upon the anticipated maturation of program development.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Data Networks Enterprise (TDNE) contributes to the development, delivery and deployment of the next generation aerial layer network through a portfolio of legacy and advanced waveform and network management development/management efforts that advance interoperability and connectivity.  This will be accomplished via fielded and future ground and gateway investments while addressing warfighter urgent demands through the establishment of Quick Reaction Capabilities (QRC).  The TDNE conceptualizes, acquires and fields aerial networking capabilities to support legacy, current, in-development, and future systems across all domains of information exchange that enables strike, mobility, special operations, Command and Control (C2), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), air, surface, subsurface and space operations.  These capabilities ensure a robust and agile extension of the global information domain down to the tactical edge in support of the warfighter.

Funding will provide for the study, analysis, enhancement, development, integration, demonstration, test, and evaluation of Tactical Data Links (TDLs) as a subset of the broader Aerial Layer Network.  TDLs are used in both peace time and combat environments to exchange information such as character-oriented and fixed-formatted messages, data, radar tracks, target information, platform status, imagery, free-text messaging and command assignments.  TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions.  TDLs increase mission effectiveness by providing enhanced situational awareness, positive combat identification of aircraft in the network, correlation of on- and off-board sensor data, digital sharing of machine to machine target and threat information, thereby, enabling time critical targeting and other mission assignment tasking. TDLs are used by all Service Theater Command and Control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors. TDLs include, but are not limited to: Link 16, Link 11, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Variable Message Format (VMF), Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), and other Advanced Tactical Data Link technologies, such as Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT), and Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL). 

Funding also supports Family of Gateway study, analysis, enhancement, development, integration, demonstration, test, and evaluation efforts that will allow joint combat forces to exchange information quickly and accurately by bridging discrete airborne, terrestrial, maritime, and space-based C4ISR networks to produce operational effects not possible within individual networks.  Gateway functions include enabling interoperability between data formats, protocols, and communication mediums.  Additionally, gateway functions extend the range of connectivity, consolidate data from multiple networks into high capacity links for transmission to key C4ISR nodes, routes information between disadvantaged users, and correlates data from multiple sources to improve accuracy.  Gateway functions also provide application hosting, shared data storage, on-demand information access, smart data forwarding, and system monitoring/network management.  Funding will also support Quick Reaction Response capability requests by the warfighter and support activities associated with the Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN) Analysis of Alternatives.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding will provide for the study, analysis, enhancement, development, integration, demonstration, test, and evaluation of Tactical Data Links (TDL) as a subset of the broader Aerial Layer Network.  TDLs are used in both peacetime and combat environments to exchange information such as character-oriented and fixed-formatted messages, data, radar tracks, target information, platform status, imagery, free-text messaging and command assignments.  TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions.  TDLs increase mission effectiveness by providing enhanced situational awareness, positive combat identification of aircraft in the network, correlation of on- and off-board sensor data, digital sharing of machine to machine target and threat information and, thereby, enabling time critical targeting and other mission assignment tasking. TDLs are used by all Service Theater Command and Control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors.  

The number of Air Force platforms hosting TDLs has expanded from C2 aircraft (E-3, E-8, etc.) to the fighter, bomber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), tanker, airlift and other tactical fleets (F-15, F-16, F-22A, Rivet Joint, B-1, B-2, B-52, etc.), as well as to precision guided munitions. Utilization of TDLs in a joint environment requires the integration of terminals into host platforms and interoperability of TDL networks across all deployed joint and coalition platforms.

Efforts in this project include waveform and integration activities. 

Waveform:
Waveform activities include, but are not limited to, enabling and supporting Joint Interoperability of Tactical Command and Control Systems (JINTACCS), interoperable System Management and Requirements Transformation (iSMART), Coalition Interoperability, Cursor on Target, Tactical Edge Network C2 efforts, and Link 16 Enhancements.  Funding will provide training, logistics development, certification of individual TDL implementations to joint/allied standards, establishment of service-wide network management procedures/operations, and system wide enhancements/testing.

Integration:
Integration activities include, but are not limited to, the Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), Data Link Test Facility (DTF), Air Force Participating Test Unit (AFPTU), Network Centric Capability Assessment (NCCA), the Joint Warfighting Integrated NetOps (JWIN) Joint Concept Technology Demonstration (JCTD), and Tactical Communications Suite (TCS).  Funding will ensure continued enhanced interoperability of Air Force and joint assets through efforts such as the development/coordination of all TDN standards and management capabilities, configuration management, platform/system interoperability assessments, participation in the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) consortium, and interoperability certification testing.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning efforts for Tactical Data Networks.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports Family of Gateway study, analysis, enhancement, development, integration, demonstration, test, and evaluation efforts that will allow joint combat forces to exchange information quickly and accurately by bridging discrete airborne, terrestrial, maritime, and space-based C4ISR networks to produce operational effects not possible within individual networks.  Gateway functions include enabling interoperability between data formats, protocols, and communication mediums.  Additionally, gateway functions extend the range of connectivity, consolidate data from multiple networks into high capacity links for transmission to key C2ISR nodes, route information between disadvantaged users, and correlate data from multiple sources to improve accuracy.  Gateway functions also provide application hosting, shared data storage, on-demand information access, smart data forwarding, and system monitoring/network management.  Funding in this project will also support Quick Reaction Capability requests by the warfighter such as the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN), 5th to 4th Generation efforts, and the STRATCOM Distributed Nuclear Command and Control (DNC2) capabilities.  Additionally, funding will support activities associated with the Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN) Analysis of Alternatives.

Efforts in this project include waveform, ground, and quick reaction capability activities.

Waveforms:
Waveform activities include, but are not limited to Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP), Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), and 5th to 4th Generation efforts. CLIP is a software-only, platform-independent middleware application that provides gateway services between diverse message sets and waveforms. CLIP will initially be fielded on the B-1 and B-52 platforms.  SADL integrates US Air Force close air support aircraft with the digitized battlefield via the US Army's Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS).

Ground:
Ground activities include, but are not limited to the Joint Air Defense System Integrator (JADSI), Joint Range Extension (JRE) functionality [which includes the JRE Transparent Multi-Platform Gateway (TMPG) Equipment Package (JTEP)], Pocket J, and Link 16 Alaska (LAK).  Funding will support enhancements to the interoperability and capabilities of fielded gateways through processing capability upgrades, operating system updates, display/graphical user interface upgrades, incorporation of additional messaging standards and protocols, and completion of gateway architecture fielding.

Quick Reaction Capability:
Quick Reaction Capability activities include, but are not limited to, BACN, Communications Airborne Layer Expansion (CABLE), and STRATCOM DNC2.  Funding will support AF rapid acquisition requirements for communications bridging of waveforms through Gateway technology.  Additionally, funding will be utilized for STRATCOM classified capabilities.  

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning efforts for Family of Gateways.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program is a budget activity level 5 based on the engineering and manufacturing development activities ongoing within the program.  The purpose of this program is to develop, demonstrate, and test physical security equipment (PSE) systems, to include Force Protection.  This program supports the protection of tactical, fixed, and nuclear weapons systems, AF personnel and AF facilities.  The PSE program is organized to provide PSE RDT&amp;E for Air Force specific needs but as a complement to and in conjunction with the PSE RDT&amp;E programs funded by the DOD Physical Security Equipment Action Group (PSEAG).  As such this program will develop, demonstrate, and test PSE in the same manner and to the same standards and architecture as PSEAG funded projects to ensure interoperability with PSEAG developed PSE.   The program element also supports the identification and redesign of developmental, non-developmental, and commercial-off-the-shelf equipment to meet physical security requirements.  Activities within this program will seek to reduce risk associated with integrating, fielding, and supporting the equipment once it becomes part of the overall security system.  Two key means of accomplishing this mission will be through the support and conduct of PSE demonstrations and validating RF frequency and communication security (cyber) solutions.  This program supports the maintenance and test support at Site C-3 and the Cold Weather Test Site (CWTS), as annotated in DoD Directive 3200.11, listing the 46TW as a Major Range and Test facility, conducting developmental and operational testing as the primary mission.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Small Diameter Bomb Increment II (SDB II) is a joint interest United States Air Force (USAF) and Department of Navy (DoN) ACAT ID program, with the Air Force (AF) as the lead service.  SDB II provides the warfighter the capability to attack mobile targets from stand-off, through weather. SDB II addresses the following warfighter requirements: attack moving and stationary targets, adverse weather operations, multiple kills per pass, multiple ordnance carriage, precision munitions capability, reduced munitions footprint, increased weapons effectiveness, minimized potential for collateral damage, reduced susceptibility of munitions to countermeasures and provides a network enabled weapon capability via Link-16 and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Weapon Data Link. The threshold aircraft for the AF is the F-15E, and the threshold aircraft for the DoN are the F-35B and F-35C. Objective aircraft include the F-22, F-16, F-35A, B-2, A-10, MQ-9, B-1, B-52, and the F/A-18 E/F.  SDB II will be compatible with the BRU-61/A miniature munitions carriage, the CNU-660/E carriage system, the Common Munitions Bit and Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE), and the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).  The SDB II program will develop and field a single weapon storage container (USAF) and a dual weapon container (DoN). 

SDB II completed a 42-month competitive Risk Reduction phase in October 2009. Milestone B approval to enter the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase was received on 29 July 2010 and the subsequent Acquisition Program Baseline was signed on 08 October 2010. A Fixed Price Incentive Firm EMD contract was awarded on 09 August 2010. SDB II is a key component of the Air Force’s Global Strike Task Force CONOPs and Global Precision Attack Core Function.

Prior years funding estimate is $493.1M. 

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting Engineering and Manufacturing Development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Small Diameter Bomb Increment II (SDB II) is a joint interest United States Air Force (USAF) and Department of Navy (DoN) ACAT ID program, with the Air Force (AF) as the lead service.  SDB II provides the warfighter the capability to attack mobile targets from stand-off, through weather. SDB II addresses the following warfighter requirements: attack moving and stationary targets, adverse weather operations, multiple kills per pass, multiple ordnance carriage, precision munitions capability, reduced munitions footprint, increased weapons effectiveness, minimized potential for collateral damage, reduced susceptibility of munitions to countermeasures and provides a network enabled weapon capability via Link-16 and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Weapon Data Link. The threshold aircraft for the AF is the F-15E, and the threshold aircraft for the DoN are the F-35B and F-35C. Objective aircraft include the F-22, F-16, F-35A, B-2, A-10, MQ-9, B-1, B-52, and the F/A-18 E/F.  SDB II will be compatible with the BRU-61/A miniature munitions carriage, the CNU-660/E carriage system, the Common Munitions Bit and Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE), and the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).  The SDB II program will develop and field a single weapon storage container (USAF) and a dual weapon container (DoN). 

SDB II completed a 42-month competitive Risk Reduction phase in October 2009. Milestone B approval to enter the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase was received on 29 July 2010 and the subsequent Acquisition Program Baseline was signed on 08 October 2010. A Fixed Price Incentive Firm EMD contract was awarded on 09 August 2010. SDB II is a key component of the Air Force’s Global Strike Task Force CONOPs and Global Precision Attack Core Function.

Prior years funding estimate is $493.1M. 

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting Engineering and Manufacturing Development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The SDB II Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract was awarded using competitive procedures. At the completion of the 42-month Risk Reduction phase in October 2009, one contractor was selected in April 2010 and awarded the EMD contract in August 2010. The EMD contract is a Fixed-Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) contract with priced production options for the first five production lots. SDB II production Lots 1-3 are FPIF. Production Lots 4-5 are fixed price not-to-exceed pricing with an economic price adjustment clause for labor and materials. The Government is buying the SDB II based on the contractor System Performance Specification (SPS). The contractor is accountable for system performance as defined in the SPS and a system warranty as defined in the EMD contract. Accordingly, the contractor is accountable to the Government for the design of the weapon system, as well as the planning and execution of the Development Test &amp; Evaluation (DT&amp;E) program to verify the system performance. The Government formally arranges and funds the use of Government flight test support for DT&amp;E.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                    <r2:Remarks>Remarks:The EMD contract budget and Target Value differ due to:
1) EMD contract is budgeted to the contract ceiling price.
2) EMD contract budget includes funding for 28 additional developmental tests identified during Milestone B. The addition of the tests requires a modification to the contract and thus is not included in the current Target Value.

The EMD Target Value includes AF funding only.  The target value for the contract including Navy funding is $450.827.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports the conduct of critical planning, technology and capability insertion, and system acquisition in support of Air Force space control systems and associated command and control development to meet current and future military space control needs.  Development and acquisition of counterspace systems will be conducted, capitalizing on the technology development and risk reduction efforts of PE 0603438F, Space Control Technology.  This funding supports the acquisition process including concept development, risk reduction, design, and demonstration.  Space control systems include both offensive counterspace (OCS) and defensive counterspace (DCS) systems.  OCS systems include the means to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy an adversary's space systems, or the information they provide, which may be used for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.  DCS systems include both active and passive measures to protect U.S. and friendly space related capabilities (satellites, communications links, and supporting ground systems) from enemy attack or interference.  This includes development efforts to prevent adversarial ability to use U.S. space systems and services for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.   Counterspace Command and Control ( C2) supports the development of command and control and mission planning capabilities in support of the fielding and employment of counterspace systems.  This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because it is conducting demonstration, engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated counterspace and space control requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RAIDRS program performs attack detection, geolocation, reporting, characterization and mission impact assessment for US owned, operated or used space systems.  RAIDRS capabilities support the National Security Strategy of the United States. RAIDRS is focused on detecting, characterizing, geolocating and reporting satellite communications (SATCOM) radio frequency interference (RFI) using currently existing Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Government-Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) technology.  The event information provided by RAIDRS will allow operators to identify possible interference against space capabilities and enable rapid employment of protective responses.  This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements in preparation for deployment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This effort supports the development of command and control and mission planning capabilities in support of the fielding and employment of  Counterspace Systems.  It provides for the integration and development of collaborative tools to link deployable counterspace systems with Joint Warfighting C2 systems and to enable integrated planning and execution of the counterspace mission.  Developed capabilities will be integrated into current and future command and control systems.  This program will leverage the Joint Execution and Tasking System for Space (JETSS) effort in the development of C2 for future space control and counterspace mission capabilities.  This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because it supports the engineering and manufacturing development of counterspace and space control systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is knowledge of all aspects of space related to operations.  As the foundation for space control, SSA encompasses intelligence on adversary space operations; surveillance of all space objects and activities; detailed reconnaissance of specific space assets; monitoring space environmental conditions; monitoring cooperative space assets; and conducting integrated command, control, communications, processing, analysis, dissemination, and archiving activities.  This program element develops new Air Force sensors, and improved information capabilities for integration across the SSA network; it also includes developmental planning and technology forecasting for future blocks and emerging needs.

A companion program element, 0305940F, Space Situational Awareness Operations, fields, upgrades, operates, and sustains existing sensors and information integration capabilities within the SSA network.  An additional companion program element, 0305614F, JSpOC Mission System, processes surveillance of all space objects and activities, maintains detailed reconnaissance of space assets, fuses space data, maintains awareness of cooperative space assets, and allows JFCC-Space to conduct integrated C2 of space forces. 

Development activities are necessary to deploy new advanced sensors capable of finding, fixing, tracking, and reconnoitering the expanding number of debris objects on orbit as well as the increasing number of satellites launched by other nations, of which many are smaller and more capable than previous spacecraft.  These activities are also required to better integrate the disparate elements of SSA in order to enable rapid, responsive space operations. 

The efforts in PE 0604425 are in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because they are conducting development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Building upon the success of the Space-Based Visible (SBV) technology demonstration, which proved the utility of surveilling orbiting objects from space, the Space-Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) Block 10 satellite (launched on 25 September 2010) provides the capability to search, detect, and track objects primarily in deep space. It accomplishes this via collecting and processing space object identification and satellite metric data, then communicating it to command and control nodes. Surveillance from space augments existing ground sensors with timely 24-hour, all-weather, all-geography object search capabilities. In conjunction with information from other Space Situational Awareness (SSA) network sensors, SBSS data enables more timely detection and tracking of space objects, particularly those in deep space. The SBSS Follow-On program will enable space-based SSA after the mean mission life of the Block 10 system. 

The efforts for this project are in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because they are conducting development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Fence effort will develop a system of ground-based sensors to replace and improve upon the aging Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS), a Very High Frequency radar operational since 1961.  The Space Fence will provide timely detection of smaller orbiting objects, primarily those in low-earth orbit (LEO) by using co-located higher frequency radar transmitters and receivers at globally dispersed sites.  As a result, it will greatly expand the uncued detection and tracking capacity of the Space Surveillance Network, from around 20,000 to up to 100,000 objects, while working in concert with other network sensors.

The efforts for this project are in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because they are conducting development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Air Force competitively awarded requirements definition contracts in FY 2006 and subsequently awarded three Phase A System Design Review (SDR) contracts in  June 2009 to Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon.  In February 2010, Northrop Grumman was terminated due to insufficient program funding as a result of a $30M FY10 Congressional reduction. SDR concluded on 10 December 2010.

A full and open competition occurred in FY11 that awarded contracts for development through Preliminary Design Review (PDR) to Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.  Milestone B and a final full and open competition are planned following PDR to award a production and deployment contract through Critical Design Review (CDR) with follow on options to complete the build. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) will consist of the first radar site and successful operations at a to be determined Command and Control center location. </r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Net-centric Sensors and Data Sources efforts migrate the space surveillance network, non-traditional SSA sensors and data sources for use by any entity (primarily the JSpOC) into a net-centric enterprise, enabling more rapid distribution of data to the warfighter based on an AFSPC provided prioritization list.  This effort will define and implement the technical architecture, and support the concept to provide the foundational data necessary to enable rapid, responsive decisions by the Commander, US Strategic Command's Joint Functional Component Commander for Space and other national capability users to detect, evaluate, attribute space events.  This effort builds upon and operationalizes the successful Extended Space Sensor Architecture Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ESSA ACTD) and prototypes how disparate and legacy space sensor network data can be translated into a net-centric operating environment.  Data will be exposed as defined by published DoD and community interface standards to ensure technical interoperability.  

These efforts are in Budget Activity 5, System Development &amp; Demonstration, because they develop and demonstrate validated requirements for better integration of SSA data.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) prototype is a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program to develop an advanced ground-based optical system to enable detection and tracking of faint objects in deep space, while providing rapid, wide-area search capability. After demonstrating the successful application of state-of-the-art optical, curved charge couple device (CCD) and large telescope control technologies, DARPA and Air Force Space Command will conduct a Military Utility Assessment (MUA). This budget item funds the delivery, evaluation and completion of developmental technical data in order to establish a complete technical baseline of the as-built system, required to reproduce, operate, and support the system. The SST prototype will become a contributing Space Surveillance Network sensor during the MUA. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY13, the project 65A038, SSA Environmental Monitoring (SSAEM), was terminated. The sensors that have completed development will be available for rideshare on the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC-2) satellite system or other available host platform.  Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring (SSAEM) continues the key space environment measurements of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) program de-manifested from the planned next generation weather program. These measurements contribute to the nation's space environment analysis and forecasting models that provide support to all  aspects of SSA, offensive and defensive space control, GPS accuracy assurance, system anomaly resolution, attribution and responsive actions, and force protection from communication outages/degradation modulated by solar activity.  SSAEM includes the fielding of a space-based sensing capability to gather space environment measurement data, developing and procuring sensors.  SSAEM funds risk reduction efforts for space sensors by leveraging existing prototypes, operational systems and Joint/Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs/ACTDs). SSAEM sensors will integrate into the overall SSA mission, comply with net-centricity requirements, and provide timely critical decision making data to the SSA battlespace management infrastructure. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Studies have been conducted to determine the optimum strategy for acquiring space-based environmental data sources resulting in a decision to pursue a rideshare opportunity on the COSMIC 2 program to host SSAEM sensors.  Existing sensors with high Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) will be leveraged and technology modernization of SSAEM sensors will be performed by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). The operational SSAEM sensors will be acquired through competitive contract awards. 

Current sensor development contract period of performance will continue through FY13 to deliver sensors in 4QFY13. </r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports the development of the critical electronic attack capabilities, from technology demonstrations through transition to operational capability, for Air Force and joint operations to include the Global Strike and Persistent Global Attack Concepts of Operations (CONOPS).  Based on the 2001 Joint Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) and the follow-on 2002 Joint Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (Joint SEAD) presentation to OSD (AT&amp;L), the AEA capability will consist of a number of components working together in a joint system of systems.  The Joint SEAD presentation identified the Navy AEA components as the EA-6B Improved Capability (ICAP) III and EA-18G modified escort platforms and indicated the Air Force will be responsible for coordinating overall AEA system of systems requirements.  AF component capabilities include the Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) and its stand-in jammer variant called MALD-J, the EC-130H Compass Call Baseline 0 (formerly Block 35) configuration and Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar equipped aircraft, and potentially, recoverable unmanned stand-in and manned long range stand-off jammer platforms.  Additionally, this program element supports the planning, development and demonstration of capabilities for use in Irregular Warfare against non-Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) targets.  This includes targets such as communications networks, remote controlled improvised explosive devices, and man portable air defenses.  It also supports examining alternatives to counter both IADS and non-IADS components such as communications networks, computers, command and control links, etc in both major combat and irregular warfare scenarios.  

This program is included in budget activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because of the development and/or testing associated with Airborne Electronic Attack.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project concentrates on the overall systems engineering, modeling and simulation, architecture and network requirements development, effectiveness assessment and requirements allocation to component systems of the Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) System of Systems (SoS).  It also includes establishment and use of virtual test capabilities for system of systems effectiveness testing/evaluation for AEA, studies and technology risk mitigation demonstrations for AEA SoS components and AEA SoS battle management, development planning, and the development and maintenance of the Air Force electronic warfare capability investment strategy.  These efforts are crucial in the development of critical electronic attack capabilities in support of Air Force and joint operations to include Global Strike and Persistent Global Attack Concepts of Operations (CONOPS).

The joint AEA SoS includes the Navy EA-6B and EA-18G core components; the Air Force Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) and its stand-in jammer variant, MALD-J; the EC-130H Compass Call Baseline 0 (formerly Block 35) configuration; Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar equipped aircraft; potentially an unmanned recoverable stand-in jamming platform; potentially a manned low/mid frequency, high power component capable of location and reactive jamming suppression of enemy integrated air defense system (IADS) radars outside the ranges of the associated Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs) and non-IADS targets.  Recent events have led to an increased focus on developing advanced electronic attack capabilities for use in irregular warfare against non-IADS targets such as communication networks, remote controlled improvised explosive devices and man portable air defenses.  In addition, there is an increased focus on examining non-traditional electronic attack alternatives to counter both IADS and non-IADS components such as communication networks, computers, command and control links, etc. in both major combat and irregular warfare scenarios.

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY2013, Project 655193, Electronic Attack Pod was terminated.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is to develop, acquire, and field an advanced electronic attack capability to operate in an Irregular Warfare environment and counter non-Integrated Air Defense targets (e.g., counter communications, counter Remote Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices).  Included is the integration needed to interface and test the resulting pod on the threshold aircraft, the MQ-9.

This program is included in budget activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because of the development and/or testing associated with Airborne Electronic Attack.

This project is terminated in FY13.  The Air Force is completing risk reduction and determining required funding for program termination.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Space-Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) primary mission is to provide initial warning of a ballistic missile attack on the US, its deployed forces, and its allies.  SBIRS will incorporate new technologies to enhance detection and improve reporting of intercontinental ballistic missile launches, submarine launched ballistic missile launches, and tactical ballistic missile launches.  SBIRS supports Missile Defense, Battlespace Awareness, and Technical Intelligence missions by providing reliable, accurate, and timely data to Unified Combatant Commanders, Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, the intelligence community, and other users.  SBIRS provides increased detection and tracking performance in order to meet requirements in Air Force Space Command's Operational Requirements Document.  The SBIRS system includes both space and ground elements.  The space segment consists of  Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites, payloads hosted on satellites in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO), and Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites.  The ground segment consists of both fixed and mobile data processing elements, communications infrastructure, and relay ground stations serving all SBIRS space elements. The HEO-1 and HEO-2 payloads are on-orbit and certified for Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) missile warning operations and technical intelligence operations.  The GEO-1 satellite is on-orbit and is undergoing testing and calibration to prepare for operational acceptance.  GEO-2 is scheduled for delivery in 3Q FY12 and launch in FY13.  Ground segment development continues through the FYDP.  Concept studies/activities may be implemented to investigate obsolescence issues, Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) solutions to potential operational concerns, and future evolution paths of the ground and/or space segment.

Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) efforts will include enhancing the current SBIRS to increase transmission security (TranSec), to manage obsolescence, and to mitigate risk.  Evolved SBIRS Architecture activities will investigate affordable ways to modify the pointing control assembly, simplify existing payload and potentially accelerate calibration activities enabling an early operational acceptance of on-orbit staring capabilities.  Data exploitation activities include OPIR data processing, data publication, algorithm development, network connectivity, data archiving and sensor performance assessments.  The efforts will identify affordable, responsive, and resilient measures to get critical battlespace awareness information to the warfighter. They will also investigate substantial reductions in sensor-to-shooter processing and transmittal times so that tactical commanders can respond to enemy threats more quickly and accurately.  Hosted payload technology testbed efforts will explore technology maturation, qualification of new components, and subsystem/component prototyping.  These efforts will include demonstrations, architecture, system integration and testing, and data exploitation activities.  

The Department of Defense terminated the Third Generation Infrared Surveillance (3GIRS) program (PE 0604443F) beginning in FY11.  3GIRS included development efforts for the Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload (CHIRP) demonstration.  FY11 and FY12 funds supporting the CHIRP demonstration for technology maturation of space and ground technologies were moved to the SBIRS RDT&amp;E program element under a separate project number.  CHIRP will perform risk reduction and evaluation of Wide-Field-of-View (WFOV) IR staring and data processing technology to potentially evolve future SBIRS staring sensors and processing algorithms.  An on-orbit demonstration will quantify performance levels of a WFOV sensor in an operational environment. CHIRP sensor testing will also provide Focal Plane Array (FPA) performance/calibration characteristics, validate WFOV staring algorithm performance in an operational environment, and investigate compatibility with current Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) ground systems for missile warning, missile defense, and other mission areas.

This program is assigned to Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it funds the development and integration of mature systems, and the test, evaluation, and demonstration of those systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space-Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) primary mission is to provide initial warning of a ballistic missile attack on the US, its deployed forces, and its allies.  SBIRS will incorporate new technologies to enhance detection and improve reporting of intercontinental ballistic missile launches, submarine launched ballistic missile launches, and tactical ballistic missile launches.  SBIRS supports Missile Defense, Battlespace Awareness, and Technical Intelligence missions by providing reliable, accurate, and timely data to Unified Combatant Commanders, Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, the intelligence community, and other users.  SBIRS provides increased detection and tracking performance in order to meet requirements in US Strategic Command's Capstone Requirements Document and Air Force Space Command's Operational Requirements Document.  The SBIRS system includes both space and ground elements.  The space segment consists of  Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites, payloads hosted on satellites in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO), and Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites.  The ground segment consists of both fixed and mobile data processing elements, communications infrastructure, and relay ground stations serving all SBIRS space elements. The HEO-1 and HEO-2 payloads are accepted and certified for Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) missile warning operations and technical intelligence operations.  The GEO-1 satellite is on-orbit and is undergoing testing and calibration to prepare for operational acceptance. Concept studies/activities may be implemented to investigate obsolescence issues, Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) solutions to potential operational concerns, and future evolution paths of the ground and/or space segment.

This program is assigned to Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it funds the development and integration of mature systems, and the test, evaluation, and demonstration of those systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>The SBIRS Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) is funded in PE 0604441, project 657009 and begins in FY13.  In the FY12 PB, project 657009 funds were included in project 653616 from FY13 - FY16.  </r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Future Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) satellites will be procured using the Department of Defense (DOD) Evolutionary Acquisition for Space Efficiency (EASE) concept. The EASE concept is a procurement approach which seeks stable production and efficient sub-contractor product management through the block buy of two space vehicles at one time (please see SBIRS P-40 Exhibit). In addition, the EASE concept includes use of RDT&amp;E funding for SBIRS Space Modernization Initiative (SMI)(formerly referred to as Capability and Affordability Improvement Program (CAIP)) to fund engineering activities to reduce future production costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements and to improve capabilities through insertion of new technologies to replace obsolete parts and materials. The SMI efforts will provide opportunities for competition to develop potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for future satellites of the current or any future follow-on system. SMI efforts will include enhancing the current SBIRS to increase transmission security (TranSec), to manage obsolescence, and to mitigate risk. Evolved SBIRS Architecture activities will investigate affordable ways to modify the pointing control assembly, simplify existing payload and potentially accelerate calibration activities enabling an early operational acceptance of on-orbit staring capabilities. Data exploitation activities include OPIR data processing, data publication, algorithm development, network connectivity, data archiving and sensor performance assessments. The efforts will identify affordable, responsive, and resilient measures to get critical battlespace awareness information to the warfighter. They will also investigate substantial reductions in sensor-to-shooter processing and transmittal times so that tactical commanders can respond to enemy threats more quickly and accurately. Hosted payload technology testbed efforts will explore technology maturation, qualification of new components, and subsystem/component prototyping. These efforts will include demonstrations, architecture, system integration and testing, and data exploitation activities.

This program is assigned to Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it funds the development and integration of mature systems, and the test, evaluation, and demonstration of those systems.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense terminated the Third Generation Infrared Surveillance (3GIRS) program (PE 0604443F) beginning in FY11.  3GIRS included development efforts for the Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload (CHIRP) demonstration.  FY11 and FY12 funds supporting the CHIRP demonstration for technology maturation of space and ground technologies were moved to the SBIRS RDT&amp;E PE under a separate project number.

CHIRP will perform risk reduction and evaluation of Wide-Field-of-View (WFOV) IR staring and data processing technology to potentially evolve future SBIRS staring sensors and processing algorithms.  An on-orbit demonstration will quantify performance levels of a prototype WFOV sensor in an operational environment. CHIRP sensor testing will also provide Focal Plane Array (FPA) performance/calibration characteristics, validate WFOV staring algorithm performance in an operational environment, and investigate compatibility with current Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) ground systems for missile warning, missile defense, and other mission areas.

This program is assigned to Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it funds the development and integration of mature systems, and the test, evaluation, and demonstration of those systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Armament Ordnance Development program provides for initial and continuing development of weapons/munitions (kinetic and non-kinetic) and munitions equipment for support and operational use.  This PE develops and improves the following weapons and weapons subsystems:  bombs, bomb fuzes, insensitive explosive fills (Insensitive Munitions - IM), aircraft ammunition, stores-aircraft interface upgrades to include the Universal Armament Interface (UAI), directed energy technology transition to weapons, munitions materiel handling equipment (MMHE), munitions containers, and other weapon subsystems.  
- Armament Subsystems:  This project develops and improves conventional weapons/munitions (kinetic and non-kinetic) and fuzes.  The project also provides an opportunity to quickly insert emerging technologies into existing and developing aircraft munitions.  The project provides for research, development, and testing of medium caliber ammunition and enterprise management of guns, ammunition, and Munitions Materiel Handling Equipment (MMHE) systems integration and testing to ensure tested and certified medium caliber ammunition is provided to users.  The project helps the AF meet Insensitive Munitions (IM) compliance through strategic planning, development of insensitive explosive fills, and bomb case modifications to make weapons insensitive to unplanned stimuli.   Armament Standardization/Control/Munitions Materiel Handling Equipment (MMHE) is a continuing project to develop and improve the standardization and commonality of munitions handling and armament equipment to preclude duplication.  This project also funds the operation of the tri-service Container Design Retrieval System (CDRS), maintaining a container database to preclude proliferation and duplication of munitions containers and supporting organic container design.
- Stores-Aircraft Interface: This project conducts stores-aircraft interface upgrades and standards development to include the Universal Armament Interface (UAI).  UAI is an Air Force initiative to develop standardized software interfaces in aircraft, weapons and mission planning to support integration of weapons independent of aircraft Operation Flight Program (OFP) cycles.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and munufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

(a) Medium Caliber Ammunition project assesses, refines, and develops medium caliber ammunition, to include, but not limited to, conducting PGU‐28A/B qualification testing (F‐22) and performing a 20mm clean sheet (alternate round) assessment.
(b)  Fixed Wing Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (FW APKWS II) Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) will integrate the existing APKWS II, a rotary wing (helicopter) system, onto the fixed-wing A-10 platform and provide a precision laser guided, low collateral damage capability against static and moving targets.
(c)  This project funds follow-on development activities for legacy fuzes, including reliability enhancements and producibility improvements.
- Insensitive Munitions (IM). IM develops explosive fills and bomb case modifications to make conventional weapons insensitive to unplanned stimuli. The project also supports AF IM strategic planning to achieve IM compliance IAW U.S. Code, Title 10, Subtitle A, Part N, Chapter 141, Section 2389, "Ensuring safety regarding insensitive munitions."
- Munitions Materiel Handling Equipment (MMHE) and Container Design Retrieval System (CDRS).  Armament Standardization/Control/Munitions Materiel Handling Equipment (MMHE) is a continuing project to develop and improve the standardization and commonality of munitions handling and armament equipment to preclude duplication.  Efforts are limited to the study, design, and development of MMHE and armament control systems.  Procurement will be performed and funded by the applicable weapons system project.  The tri-service  Container Design Retrieval System (CDRS) is a database intended to preclude proliferation and duplication of munitions containers.  It also supports organic container design, acquisition transportation, prototyping, testing capabilities, as well as the Joint Ordnance Commander's Working Group (JOCG) for Packaging, Handling, and Loading.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and munufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Universal Armament Interface (UAI) is an Air Force program to develop, enhance, and implement standardized interfaces in current and future aircraft (manned or unmanned), weapons and mission planning to support integration of weapons independent of aircraft Operational Flight Program (OFP) cycles. UAI is currently being implemented on the F-15E, F-16 Block 40/50, and EPAF(European Participating Air Forces) F-16 aircraft, Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) I and II, Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Laser JDAM, Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM) and Precision Guided Munitions Planning Software (PGMPS). Additional aircraft and weapons, including but not limited to, Joint Strike Fighter (JSF/F-35), MQ-9, as well as Army and Navy systems, have program plans to implement UAI. The UAI program office is responsible for development and enhancement of the standard (U.S. and allied),  support to coalition/allied/joint interoperability efforts for weapons-platform interface efforts, provision of certification tools (test assets) and implementation support to aircraft and weapons.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and munufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In December 2004, under the authority of a class Justification and Approval (J&amp;A), the UAI program office awarded individual Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts to Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon.  Each OEM is responsible for a different piece of the total UAI requirement based on its product-specific (platform/weapon) expertise.  During FY10 these contracts expired.  Under the authority of a new class J&amp;A, Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) contracts were awarded to the four UAI vendors in August 2010.  Follow-on period of performance was awarded in August 2011 for 18 months to better align future contract awards with funding through the FYDP.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project Chicken Little continues to provide vital research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) support to developmental smart munitions, seekers/sensors and their platforms, networked weapons, advanced weapon concepts, and innovative targeting technologies employed against a wide variety of vehicle targets, theater air defense units, and an extensive array of foreign threat systems and associated equipment.  Hostile combat systems and related equipment exhibit physical characteristics (i.e. signatures), as well as certain vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by various targeting technologies leading to the elimination or incapacitation of the threat through the application of force (e.g. smart munitions or directed energy) or application of intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) methods.  Chicken Little collects physical, functional, and signature attributes of actual foreign threat systems and related equipment to construct high-fidelity models for use in scientific analysis (e.g. vulnerability and effectiveness assessments) and weapon/targeting system design.  Chicken Little collects high resolution signature data using a variety of ground, air, and space-based sensors against both new and existing (obtained, sustained, and maintained to be signature representative) foreign targets; with and without the presence of camouflage, concealment, and deception materials; and operated using enemy tactics/CONOPS.  The resulting highly reliable, realistic  data directly supports munitions/targeting development programs and helps mitigate overall acquisition risk. The project serves as a major focal point for joint signature exploitation, collection, and dissemination amongst the DoD and intelligence community (IC). Chicken Little is a prime contributor in the time critical process to rapidly exploit, assess, and determine US and allied weapon/targeting performance against high value targets.  Customers include: the major Defense and Service Intelligence Centers, all Services, the Joint Technical Coordinating Group (JTCG) who develop the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs), Combatant Commands, AF Major Commands, US Air Force Weapons School curriculum support, and others. Current projects include, but are not limited to: target signature exploitation, target geometric modeling (for identifying vulnerabilities), improving air capabilities against protected structures (specifically hard and deeply buried targets), and the testing of multiple seekers, sensors, and targeting technologies in representative environments against COCOM/MAJCOM/IC high value targets.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides capabilities to rapidly deploy, defend and sustain airfield operations, command and control activities, and force protection to ensure readiness.  In addition, this PE provides tactical and strategic aeromedical evacuation systems, automated information systems, and medical treatment equipment to meet unique Air Force medical readiness and operational requirements.  These activities are prerequisites to establishing air superiority.  Development of Agile Combat Support (ACS) systems provides beddown for aircraft, support equipment, and forces at both main operating bases and contingency operating locations, which may have only a runway and a water source.  They also offer crucial utilities, runway stabilization and repair, explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), rescue and recovery aids, aeromedical evacuation and treatment equipment, and security and reconnaissance capabilities to support aircraft deployment, launch, recovery and regeneration.  Lighter-weight, rapidly deployable equipment has become essential in providing the ability to quickly establish operations, security, and base defense in support of numerous global contingencies, including various humanitarian/relief efforts, and special operations throughout the world.  

The Agile Combat Support program is in RDT&amp;E Budget Activity 5 - Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) because it supports development, testing and evaluation of materials and equipment for contingency basing, detection and handling of explosive ordnance, tactical shelters, and aeromedical systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2012, Project 65412A, Life Support Systems, the Modular Aircrew Common Helmet (MACH) program was terminated.
In FY 2013, Project 65412A, Life Support Systems, includes new starts for Cold Weather Aviation System (CWAS) and Integrated Aircrew Body Armor System programs.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides for recapitalization, continuing research and development, and integration of aircrew flight equipment/airmen combat effectiveness equipment and subsystems to satisfy operational command requirements for improved/enhanced airmen performance capabilities.  Aircrew flight equipment/airmen combat effectiveness systems consist of human-centered programs that enable weapons systems to use more of their full mission envelopes, maximize combat capabilities, and protect airmen.  This includes, but is not limited to, the following projects: directed energy protective equipment, flight helmets and visors, oxygen breathing equipment for aviators, radios and locator beacons to include support equipment, nuclear flash blindness protection, night vision devices, noise reduction devices, anti-g suits, flame resistant/retardant and blast protective gear, aircraft seating, impact protection, flotation devices, and personnel parachutes.  Program management support includes tasks to assess deficiencies of currently fielded equipment, evaluate and demonstrate feasibility of new technologies, provide for the transition of new technologies to development programs/projects, conduct business case analyses, assess suitability of commercially available items, and support all current aircrew flight equipment/airmen combat effectiveness programs.

The Integrated Aircrew Ensemble (IAE) develops a readily-configurable integrated flight ensemble to improve safety, survival, and performance using modern materials, and addresses full spectrum of aircrew requirements for manned non-space aircraft and foster commonality across most aircraft platforms.  IAE will replace the multiple layers of flight gear, to include the flight suit, g-suit, survival vest, and other equipment, used during flying operations.  The system will increase acceleration protection, maximize performance and reduce thermal burden throughout full range of military operations.  There are three proposed variants: ejection seat, rotary wing, and non-ejection seat aircraft.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In FY 2013, Project 65412A, Life Support Systems, includes new starts for Cold Weather Aviation System (CWAS) and Integrated Aircrew Body Armor System programs.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element provides for recapitalization, continuing research and development, and integration of aircrew flight equipment/airmen combat effectiveness equipment and subsystems to satisfy operational command requirements for improved/enhanced airmen performance capabilities.  Aircrew flight equipment/airmen combat effectiveness systems consist of human-centered programs that enable weapons systems to use more of their full mission envelopes, maximize combat capabilities, and protect airmen.  This includes, but is not limited to, the following projects: directed energy protective equipment, flight helmets and visors, oxygen breathing equipment for aviators, radios and locator beacons to include support equipment, nuclear flash blindness protection, night vision devices, noise reduction devices, anti-g suits, flame resistant/retardant and blast protective gear, aircraft seating, impact protection, flotation devices, and personnel parachutes.  Program management support includes tasks to assess deficiencies of currently fielded equipment, evaluate and demonstrate feasibility of new technologies, provide for the transition of new technologies to development programs/projects, conduct business case analyses, assess suitability of commercially available items, and support all current aircrew flight equipment/airmen combat effectiveness programs.

The Integrated Aircrew Ensemble (IAE) develops a readily-configurable integrated flight ensemble to improve safety, survival, and performance using modern materials, and addresses full spectrum of aircrew requirements for manned non-space aircraft and foster commonality across most aircraft platforms.  IAE will replace the multiple layers of flight gear, to include the flight suit, g-suit, survival vest, and other equipment, used during flying operations.  The system will increase acceleration protection, maximize performance and reduce thermal burden throughout full range of military operations.  There are three proposed variants: ejection seat, rotary wing, and non-ejection seat aircraft.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Combat Training Range (CTR) Program Element (PE) provides equipment and support to Air Force units and combat training ranges for mission testing, training, and evaluation of aircrews, as well as the operational testing of weapon systems and tactics under simulated combat conditions.  This PE provides funding for the development of electronic warfare training capabilities, telecommunications, instrumentation equipment/systems, and evolutionary upgrades to facilitate live/virtual/constructive connectivity and standardization across all platforms to include coalition, F-22A and F-35 aircraft, and interoperability for joint test/training exercises in varied environments.  The P5 Combat Training System (P5CTS), a collaborative development between USAF and USN, provides air combat training systems for both services at operational locations worldwide.  Increments include hardware and software upgrades,  an encrypted software communications architecture compliant Advanced Data Link to facilitate interoperability in a multiple independent level security environment and training with F-22A and F-35, internal pod replacement subsystems, integration of new aircraft Operational Flight Programs, and the development of solutions to enable live/ virtual/ constructive capabilities. This PE also includes the development of advanced threat emitters. The Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) continues the development of a comprehensive suite of threat signals for aircrew tactics and electronic combat training for simulated penetrations of hostile airspace. This program complements existing range threat simulators by emulating signals that simulate current and future air defense and threat radars. JTE Increment 1 is currently in production. Consistent with the evolutionary acquisition strategy and documented ACC training requirements, development will continue with next generation threat systems. Future increments will continue to add additional capability to the warfighter's training ranges. This PE includes Legacy Range Threat Systems including Miniature Multiple Threat Emitter Systems-M3P (Mini-MUTES), Multiple Threat Emitter System (MUTES), Modular Threat Emitter (MTE) and Tactical Radar Threat Generator (TRTG), Band Simulator and Unmanned Modular Threat Emitter (UMTE) Systems, which are being considered for modernization that will extend the system's service life and allow for upgrades to antiquated components for increased reliability and capabilities. 

This program is in Budget Activity 5 - Systems Development and Demonstration because the CTR Program directly contributes to the effectiveness and survivability of US combat forces by providing training capabilities to simulate real combat conditions to prepare the warfighter for actual combat.

This PE provides funding for the development of electronic warfare training capabilities, telecommunications, instrumentation equipment/systems, and evolutionary upgrades to facilitate live/virtual/constructive connectivity and standardization across all platforms to include coalition, F-22A and F-35 aircraft, and interoperability for joint test/training exercises in varied environments.  The P5 Combat Training System (P5CTS), a collaborative development between USAF and USN, provides air combat training systems for both services at operational locations worldwide.  Increments include hardware and software upgrades,  an encrypted software communications architecture compliant Advanced Data Link to facilitate interoperability in a multiple independent level security environment and training with F-22A and F-35, internal pod replacement subsystems, integration of new aircraft Operational Flight Programs, and the development of solutions to enable live/ virtual/ constructive capabilities. This PE also includes the development of advanced threat emitters. The Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) continues the development of a comprehensive suite of threat signals for aircrew tactics and electronic combat training for simulated penetrations of hostile airspace. This program complements existing range threat simulators by emulating signals that simulate current and future air defense and threat radars. JTE Increment 1 is currently in production. Consistent with the evolutionary acquisition strategy and documented ACC training requirements, development will continue with next generation threat systems. Future increments will continue to add additional capability to the warfighter's training ranges. This PE includes Legacy Range Threat Systems including Miniature Multiple Threat Emitter Systems-M3P (Mini-MUTES), Multiple Threat Emitter System (MUTES), Modular Threat Emitter (MTE) and Tactical Radar Threat Generator (TRTG), Band Simulator and Unmanned Modular Threat Emitter (UMTE) Systems, which are being considered for modernization that will extend the system's service life and allow for upgrades to antiquated components for increased reliability and capabilities. 

This program is in Budget Activity 5 - Systems Development and Demonstration because the CTR Program directly contributes to the effectiveness and survivability of US combat forces by providing training capabilities to simulate real combat conditions to prepare the warfighter for actual combat.

It also planned, controlled, organized, staffed and led a diverse team of military, civilian and contracted acquisition and technical professionals that developed leading edge capabilities for the warfighter.  Product Lines developed reusable software components based on Service Oriented Architectures, Core Enterprise Services, and Web Based technologies that enabled the Air Force to achieve net centric operations and warfare capability.  It provided AF-wide enterprise Command and Control functionality. The components are developed in small increments providing continuous deliveries of increasing capability to the warfighter.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Intelligence Equipment (IE) Program Element (PE) performs the engineering development of software, and/or automated information operations techniques to streamline the processing, integration, exploitation, display, and dissemination of strategic and tactical intelligence information.  IE provides continuing development and upgrades of threat analysis capabilities to produce integrated, predictive air and space intelligence to enable military operations, force modernization decisions, and policymaking.  IE accelerates and increases the accuracy of threat estimates and system descriptions to deployed operational forces.  IE also provides clients with accurate, predictive, relevant, and timely intelligence that will support client processes, operational planning, and mission execution.  IE develops new or upgraded analysis, modeling and simulation tools focused on intelligence production in support of all source AF operational and developmental functions.  Each of the development projects within the IE program portfolio transition technologies to the operational communities through the incremental release of upgraded versions over a period of years as the development projects progress towards the final configuration.  IE may reallocate existing resources to support out-of-cycle new/updated warfighter requirements.  Requirements for this PE are gathered and prioritized by the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency (AF ISR Agency).  Development of new/improved capabilities to meet the requirements is managed by AFRL/RIED.  

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because the program develops and inserts new technologies into existing systems and models in order to keep existing systems current and affordable while ensuring system integration, interoperability, and utility.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Requirements for new / upgraded intelligence analysis tools are gathered and prioritized by the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency (AF ISR Agency, formerly the Air Intelligence Agency).  Development of capabilities to meet those  requirements is managed by the AF Research Laboratory (Rome Research Site).  Prototype products (usually software), once evaluated by the users, are fielded in incremental capability spirals.  All major contracts within this project are awarded after full and open competition.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program will develop and deploy a family of  highly common, affordable next generation, stealthy, multi-role strike fighter aircraft that meets the needs of the USN, USAF, USMC and allies with maximum commonality among the variants, consistent with National Disclosure Policy, to minimize life cycle costs. This is a joint program with no executive service. Navy and Air Force each provide approximately equal shares of annual funding to the program. The United Kingdom and seven other international countries, and three Foreign Military Sales cases are participants in the JSF program.    This program is funded under System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it encompasses system development and demonstration of new end items prior to a production approval decision.   The SDD Budget funds a total quantity of 20 RDT&amp;E test articles to include 6 ground test articles and 14 flight test articles for Navy and Air Force use.

BA5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production. </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter program will develop and field a family of aircraft that meets the needs of the USN, USAF, USMC and allies, with maximum commonality among the variants, consistent with National Disclosure Policy, to minimize life cycle costs. This is a joint program with no executive service.  Navy and Air Force each provide approximately equal shares of annual funding to the program. The United Kingdom, other International Partner nations, and Foreign Military Sales customers are also participants in the JSF program.  The program shown here reflects USN, USMC, USAF, and International Partner funding.  The top-line Program Element reflects USAF F-35A Conventional Take-Off and Landing (CTOL) budgetary information, only; however, funding at the accomplishment/planned program level is reported in total (all services and partners) as the activities support all aircraft variants.  Within the Navy contribution is a roughly equal contribution of annual funding by the USN and USMC.

The SDD Budget funds a total quantity of 20 RDT&amp;E test articles to include 6 ground test articles and 14 flight test articles for Navy and Air Force use.  The following fiscal year phasing of the flight test aircraft reflects the schedule first flight of each flight test asset or production line roll out of each ground test asset:

FY07:  1 Conventional Take Off and Landing (CTOL) flight test article 
FY08:  1 Short Take Off and Vertical Landing ((STOVL) flight test article); 1 STOVL ground test article 
FY09:  1 STOVL flight test article; 2 CTOL ground test articles 
FY10:  6 flight test articles: 3 CTOL, 2 STOVL, 1 Carrier Variants (CV); 3 ground test articles: 1 STOVL, 2 CV
FY11:  4 flight test articles: 1 CTOL, 1 STOVL, 2 CV
FY12:  1 CV flight test article 
FY13:  0 flight test articles

BA5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and
Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is
conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting
validated requirements prior to full-rate production.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The System Development and Demonstration program consists of a cost-reimbursement contract awarded to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company to develop the F-35 Air System, consisting of three aircraft variants and its associated logistics support system, for the U.S. Services and international participants.  Similarly, a cost-reimbursement contract was awarded to Pratt &amp; Whitney to develop the F135 propulsion system.  Ground and flight testing will be conducted during development to accomplish validation and verification, with the extensive use of modeling and simulation to offset the risk of this large, complex, and concurrent lifecycle program.  A comprehensive logistics support environment, including an integrated training system for aircrew, maintenance, and support personnel, is also being developed.

On 25 April 2011, the Department of Defense terminated the development of the General Electric Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team F136 propulsion system.  

The F-35 Program has made international involvement a key element of the acquisition strategy.  This includes international partnership in the development, production, and sustainment phases of the lifecycle.  Additional international participation includes Foreign Military Sales arrangements.

In Fiscal Year (FY) 2007, separate cost-type contracts were awarded to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company and Pratt &amp; Whitney to begin low rate initial production for F-35 air vehicles, propulsion systems, and sustainment for the fielded systems.  Transition to fixed-price-type contracts occurred with the fourth low rate lot.  To provide logistics support for delivered aircraft, Performance-Based Logistics cost-type contracts will be awarded to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company and Pratt &amp; Whitney.

At the completion of Low Rate Initial Production, a Defense Acquisition Board review, and Milestone Decision Authority approval, the F-35 Program will enter Full Rate Production.  Fixed-price procurement contracts will be awarded for F-35 air vehicles and propulsion systems for the U.S. Services and international participants.  Multiyear procurement authority for the F-35 Air System will be requested for Full Rate Production.  Concurrently, multiple-year, fixed-price-type Performance Based Logistics contracts for sustainment will be executed to support multi-Service and multi-national requirements.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funds enhancements to the suitability and maintainability of the air system  such as Deployable Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), decentralized maintenance capabilities, low observable (LO) maintenance enhancements, security architecture updates, and integrated training simulators.  These enhancements will provide vital on-demand support to the war-fighter within a deployed environment and are not funded via the existing SDD program or tied to Block 4 OFP development. Funding will result in achieving targeted suitability, maintainability, and affordability returns employing F-35 in deployed or austere locations.

The efforts include design, development, and testing of replacement Electrical-Electronic Equipment Test Sets, Reentry Field Support Equipment, Minuteman Code System Media, the Payload Transporter Tractor and Trailer, Higher Authority Command/Rapid Message Processing Element (HAC/RMPE) Message Generator, the Targeting Application Computer for Single Integrated Operation Plan (SIOP) Targeting Application Computer System (STACS) and Transporter Erectors (TE). 
 
The ICBM Cryptography Upgrade Increment II program expands on the ICBM Cryptography Upgrade Increment I program to incorporate remote key/code change and irreversible transformation of launch/enable codes increasing nuclear weapons security during annual code change cycles. 

ICBM EMD: Fuze Support reflects FY2012 effort related to fuze modernization efforts previously included in PE 0604222F and now included in PE 0604933.

The Operational Equipment program designs, develops, and tests replacement of weapon system equipment.  The efforts include: (1)design, development, and testing of modifications to the Weapon System Processor (WSP) circuit card to prevent status monitoring loss and modifications to WSP circuit card seating hardware; (2)solid rocket motor modernization efforts to define operational requirements and acquisition strategy for a solid rocket motor follow-on program. 

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.  </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Current CSM processes utilize DC300 tape cartridges and 9-track tapes.  Beginning in FY11, the National Security Agency (NSA) is no longer using DC300 tape cartridges and the shelf life expires in 2013 for the remaining 9-track tapes.  The software will be modified to use CD-ROMs as the new media.  Ensures capability through 2030 to load codes/software on MM ICBMs--critical to CY12 code change.</r2:Description>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Increment II of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Cryptography Upgrade program executes USSTRATCOM, Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), and Nuclear Weapon Safety Center (NWSC) requirements by implementing the KS-60 capabilities of remote key/code change and irreversible transformation as mandated in the approved Capabilities Development Document (CDD) dated 4 January 2005 and addresses Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group Operational Safety Review (NWSSG OSR) requirements 98-2, 00-1 and 02-2.  These features will greatly increase security during code changes by reducing the frequency of open sites 75 days annually and reduce associated resource costs for 450 launch facilities (LF) and 45 launch control centers (LCC).

The associated production funding for the program is in PE 0101213F Minuteman Squadrons, MM III Modifications.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>ICBM Fuze Support activities include: (1) ICBM Fuze Modernization program will replace the Mk21 fuze to meet warfighter requirements and maintain current capability (2) Develop a new Mk12A fuze capability to integrate with W78 Life Extension Program (LEP) and (3) provide Air Force direction and oversight of the W78 LEP to meet Presidential Decision Directive 9 (PDD-9, July 2011) and the Requirements Planning Document that directs the number and mix of nuclear weapons to support the national nuclear deterrent.  The Air Force ICBM Fuze Modernization Program will work in conjunction with the W78 LEP, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Navy, and United Kingdom (UK) Ministry of Defense (MOD) to capitalize on the extensive fuze work done to date by the Navy and NNSA, and make maximum use of joint technologies, parts, components, and development/production capabilities.  Additionally, the ICBM Fuze Modernization program will address the associated Minuteman III weapon system modifications, system testing, support equipment, data, training, and fielding efforts required to support the new Mk21 fuze and Mk12A/W78 LEP.

ICBM Fuze Support will continue studies, system engineering, modeling and testing, and development planning leading to a development effort for the Mk21 and Mk12A/W78 LEP replacement fuzes.  Development effort will make maximum use of technologies, parts, and components developed under the Navy Mk5 Alteration Program.  The W78 life extension oversight and engineering will identify and develop the specific LEP for the W78, identifying solutions to problems or deficiencies, opportunities to incorporate enhanced surety concepts to meet National Security Presidential Directive 28 requirements, integration of the Air Force Fuze Modernization Program and the NNSA W78 LEP development, and the related supporting infrastructure.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program is a space launch system that satisfies the government's National Launch Forecast (NLF) requirements.  EELV is a launch service, not a weapon system, primarily funded with procurement funds.

EELV is responsible for launching government manifested payloads.  EELV supports military, intelligence, and international partnership mission requirements.  The program also supports development and qualification of new entrants for launching government manifested payloads.

The program has research and developmental items including: new entrant certification; fleet standardization of the RS-68 main engine upgrade; current RL10 and common upper stage development; integration of space vehicles for research and development purposes; Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) to ensure sustainability (includes, but is not limited to, secondary payload adaptor standard service, Global Positioning System (GPS) Metric Tracking capability, space launch flight termination system (SLFTS), future flight safety strategy, development of replacement components, flight and ground instrumentation); special studies (to include, but not limited to affordable upper stage engine studies), and other related support activities.

As of 21 August 2007, the EELV Program formally entered the sustainment phase.  As of 31 October 2007, Air Force Space Command formally extended the EELV Program an additional 10 years, from 2020 through 2030.  This program element is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because it supports development and demonstration of the EELV concept leading to deployment of a lower cost expendable launch vehicle system.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program is a space launch system that satisfies the government's National Launch Forecast (NLF) requirements.  EELV is a launch service, not a weapon system, primarily funded with procurement funds.

EELV is responsible for launching government manifested payloads.  EELV supports military, intelligence, and international partnership mission requirements.  The program also supports development and qualification of new entrants for launching government manifested payloads.

The program has research and developmental items including: new entrant certification; fleet standardization of the RS-68 main engine upgrade; current RL10 and common upper stage development; integration of space vehicles for research and development purposes; Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) to ensure sustainability (includes, but is not limited to, secondary payload adaptor standard service, Global Positioning System (GPS) Metric Tracking capability, space launch flight termination system (SLFTS), future flight safety strategy, development of replacement components, flight and ground instrumentation); special studies (to include, but not limited to affordable upper stage engine studies), and other related support activities.

As of 21 August 2007, the EELV Program formally entered the sustainment phase.  As of 31 October 2007, Air Force Space Command formally extended the EELV Program an additional 10 years, from 2020 through 2030.  This program element is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because it supports development and demonstration of the EELV concept leading to deployment of a lower cost expendable launch vehicle system.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy> 
The current acquisition strategy separates the launch service price from the launch infrastructure costs. The Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Acquisition Strategy, approved 24 Nov 2011, restructures the approach of the EELV Program to address many challenges the program has experienced throughout the EELV system lifecycle. This acquisition strategy directly addresses the Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 -2019 (Phase 1) timeframe.  In cooperation with the NRO, the Air Force will commit to an annual production rate of launch vehicles establishing better predictability to maintain mission success, stabilize the industrial base, reduce costs, allow competition, prevent or mitigate any cost or redesign impacts to space vehicles, and sustain the program to assure access to space. This strategy will continue to allow the Department of Defense to reliably place medium-, intermediate-, and heavy-class National Security Space (NSS) space vehicles into earth orbit. RDT&amp;E-funded projects are included on the contract as separate contract line items. The acquisition approach supports the 2004 National Space Transportation Policy. The EELV system will launch the majority of the government portion of the NLF through 2030 and the government will continue to work to partner with industry to continuously improve products and processes to enhance reliability and reduce both the contractor's and government's total costs. In October 2011, the Air Force, NRO, and NASA signed a coordinated strategy for certification of commercial new entrants in order to compete to launch EELV-class payloads. 

As of 21 August 2007, the EELV program formally entered the sustainment phase. Section 838 of the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act requires EELV Selected Acquisition Report submittals.
As of 31 Oct 2007, Air Force Space Command formally extended the EELV Program an additional 10 years, from 2020 through 2030.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY11, LRSO efforts were funded in PE 0101122F, Air Launched Cruise Missile, project number 674797.

In FY12, LRSO efforts were transferred from PE 0101122F, Air Launched Cruise Missile, project number 674797 to PE 0101125F, Nuclear Weapon Modernization, project number 657008, in order to support LRSO development.

In FY13, LRSO efforts were transferred from PE 0101125F, Nuclear Weapon Modernization, project number 657008 to PE 0604932F, Long 
Range Standoff Weapon, project number 657011, in order to support LRSO development.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) effort will develop a weapon system to replace the Air Force's Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), operational since 1986.  The LRSO weapon system will be capable of penetrating and surviving advanced Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) from significant stand off range to prosecute strategic targets in support of the Air Force's global attack capability and strategic deterrence core function.  LRSO FY2013 funding supports completion of the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to compare the operational effectiveness, cost, and risks of proposed materiel solutions as well as Milestone A preparation activities. 

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.

In FY12, LRSO efforts were transferred from PE 0101122F, Air Launched Cruise Missile, project number 674797, to PE 0101125, Nuclear Weapon Modernization, project number 657008, in order to support LRSO development.

In FY13, LRSO efforts were transferred from PE 0101125F, Nuclear Weapons Modernization, project number 657008, to PE 0604932F, Longe Range Standoff Weapon, project number 657011, in order to support LRSO development.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) effort will develop a weapon system to replace the Air Force's Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), operational since 1986.  The LRSO weapon system will be capable of penetrating and surviving advanced Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) from significant stand off range to prosecute strategic targets in support of the Air Force's global attack capability and strategic deterrence core function.  LRSO FY2013 funding supports completion of the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to compare the operational effectiveness, cost, and risks of proposed materiel solutions as well as Milestone A preparation activities. 

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY13, this is not a New Start. A separate Program Element has been created for Increment 3.2B in support of milestone B preparations.  All Increment 3.2B efforts and funding prior to FY13 continue to be shown in this F-22 baseline documentation.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Increment 3.2B will integrate the newest air-to-air intercept missiles (i.e., AIM-9X and AIM-120D), further improve the Electronic Protection (EP) capability over Increment 3.2A, and enhance the F-22’s geolocation capability from the Increment 3.1 baseline with the addition of the Geolocation 2 candidate. Increment 3.2B will include the Enhanced Stores Management System (ESMS), as well as, an Intra-Flight Datalink (IFDL) improvement to increase IFDL bandwidth and enable cooperative functions required to realize Increment 3.2B candidates.

In addition to the aforementioned hardware modifications and integration requirements, Increment 3.2B will develop, certify and integrate a new platform operational flight program to ensure the system interoperability and performance of all increment-level developments.

The development program enhances the air vehicle and training system to improve/enhance F-22 weapons, communications, and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.

BA5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production. </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY13, a separate Program Element has been created for Increment 3.2B in support of milestone B preparations.  All Increment 3.2B efforts and funding prior to FY13 continue to be shown in this F-22 baseline documentation.

The Cost to Complete and Total Cost for MDAP projects in this program element are documented in the R3. The Cost to Complete and Total Cost on the R2 are entered as "Continuing" and not reflective of the total cost for MDAP projects since the R2 does not account for prior years funding.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Increment 3.2B will integrate the newest air-to-air intercept missiles (i.e., AIM-9X and AIM-120D), further improve the Electronic Protection (EP) capability over Increment 3.2A, and enhance the F-22’s geolocation capability from the Increment 3.1 baseline with the addition of the Geolocation 2 candidate. Increment 3.2B will include the Enhanced Stores Management System (ESMS), as well as, an Intra-Flight Datalink (IFDL) improvement to increase IFDL bandwidth and enable cooperative functions required to realize Increment 3.2B candidates.

In addition to the aforementioned hardware modifications and integration requirements, Increment 3.2B will develop, certify and integrate a new platform operational flight program to ensure the system interoperability and performance of all increment-level developments.

The development program enhances the air vehicle and training system to improve/enhance F-22 weapons, communications, and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.

BA5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The KC-46 program entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010 and awarded the KC-46 Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract on 24 Feb 2011.  The program schedule and budget request presented in these documents represent a restructure from the FY 2012 President’s Budget (PB) based on this 24 Feb 2011 contract award.

In FY 2009, PE 0401221F, KC-X Replacement Tanker efforts were transferred to PE 0605221F, KC-46 Next Generation Aerial Refueling Aircraft, BPAC 655271, KC-46 RDT&amp;E, in order to move funds to Budget Activity (BA) 05 to correctly represent the phase of the KC-46 Program.

The FY 2010 Defense Appropriations Bill directed the following:  (1) reduced the FY 2010 President’s Budget request by $132.9M in RDT&amp;E, AF, (2) moved $291.715M of FY2010 RDT&amp;E, AF into the Tanker Replacement Transfer Fund (TRTF), and (3) left $15.0M in RDT&amp;E, AF to support program office and source selection activities.  On 6 Jan 2011, $291.615M from TRTF was moved into FY 2010 RDT&amp;E, AF per SECAF Memo to Congress, dated 2 Nov 2010.  These funds have been used to fund the KC-46 EMD effort and for program support activities.

The FY 2011 Defense Appropriations Bill directed the following:  (1) reduced the FY 2011 PB request by $325M in RDT&amp;E, AF, (2) moved $538.875M of FY2011 RDT&amp;E, AF into the TRTF, and (3) left nothing in RDT&amp;E, AF.  On 15 Jun 2011, $538.875M from TRTF was moved into FY 2011 RDT&amp;E, AF per SECAF Memo to Congress, dated 5 May 2011.  These funds are being used to fund the KC-46 EMD effort and for program support activities.

The Cost to Complete and Total Cost for MDAP projects in this program element are documented in the R3.  The Cost to Complete and Total Cost on the R2 are entered as "Continuing" and not reflective of the total cost for MDAP projects since the R2 does not account for prior years funding.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Replacement of the legacy KC-135 fleet will take place in three stages, known as the KC-X (now the KC-46), KC-Y, and the KC-Z.  The initial KC-46 increment will replace roughly a third of the current capability with the purchase of 179 aircraft.  The Air Force completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in Apr 2006 to determine the most appropriate strategy to recapitalize the aging fleet of KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft.  Based on this analysis, the Air Force concluded that a strategy of full and open competition to select a commercial derivative replacement tanker aircraft would result in a best value tanker contract.  To initiate the first phase of the KC-135 replacement, the KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010, and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010.  The KC-46 program held a Milestone B Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter EMD from OSD AT&amp;L on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 EMD contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft.  

The KC-46 will provide fuel to joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will also augment the airlift fleet with cargo, passenger and aeromedical evacuation capabilities.  The KC-46 will be able to operate in day/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment, employment, sustainment and redeployment of U.S. joint, allied, and coalition forces.  The KC-46 will have communication, navigation and surveillance equipment for world-wide operations; will have the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; will have the capability to operate in low-to-medium threat areas and near-high threat areas with self-defense/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and will have necessary battle space awareness to mitigate survivability threats.

The KC-46 development effort will also procure the necessary ground and flight test assets to support development/operational test.  The program plans to procure four RDT&amp;E aircraft for integration and demonstration of capability that will ultimately be operationally fielded after a successful operational test phase.  In addition, both aircrew and maintenance Training System Requirement Analyses (TSRA) are being conducted to determine training requirements.  Aircrew and maintenance training systems will be developed and procured via a future trainer-specific source selection, using KC-46 funding.  A business case analysis will also be conducted to determine if the engines for the production aircraft will be government furnished or contractor furnished.  Initial training and sustainment efforts will be provided via Interim Contractor Support (ICS).  KC-46 funding will also support various studies and analyses including the five-nation Future Technology for Aerial Refueling (FTAR) project, and KC-Y/KC-Z planning activities. 

This program is in Budget Activity 05, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.

                            <r2:ProjectNote>The KC-46 program entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010 and awarded the KC-46 Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract on 24 Feb 2011.  The program schedule and budget request presented in these documents represent a restructure from the FY 2012 President’s Budget (PB) based on this 24 Feb 2011 contract award.  

In FY 2009, PE 0401221F, KC-X Replacement Tanker efforts were transferred to PE 0605221F, KC-46 Next Generation Aerial Refueling Aircraft, BPAC 655271, KC-46 RDT&amp;E, in order to move funds to Budget Activity (BA) 05 to correctly represent the phase of the KC-46 Program.

The FY 2010 Defense Appropriations Bill directed the following:  (1) reduced the FY 2010 President’s Budget request by $132.9M in RDT&amp;E, AF, (2) moved $291.715M of FY2010 RDT&amp;E, AF into the Tanker Replacement Transfer Fund (TRTF), and (3) left $15.0M in RDT&amp;E, AF to support program office and source selection activities.

These funds have been used to fund the KC-46 EMD effort and for program support activities.  

The FY 2011 Defense Appropriations Bill directed the following:  (1) reduced the FY 2011 PB request by $325M in RDT&amp;E, AF, (2) moved $538.875M of FY2011 RDT&amp;E, AF into the TRTF, and (3) left nothing in RDT&amp;E, AF.  On 15 Jun 2011, $538.875M from TRTF was moved into FY 2011 RDT&amp;E, AF per SECAF Memo to Congress, dated 5 May 2011.  These funds are being used to fund the KC-46 EMD effort and for program support activities.

The Cost to Complete and Total Cost for MDAP projects in this program element are documented in the R3. The Cost to Complete and Total Cost on the R2 are entered as "Continuing" and not reflective of the total cost for MDAP projects since the R2 does not account for prior years funding.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Replacement of the legacy KC-135 fleet will take place in three stages, known as the KC-X (now the KC-46), KC-Y, and the KC-Z.  The initial KC-46 increment will replace roughly a third of the current capability with the purchase of 179 aircraft.  The Air Force completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in Apr 2006 to determine the most appropriate strategy to recapitalize the aging fleet of KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft.  Based on this analysis, the Air Force concluded that a strategy of full and open competition to select a commercial derivative replacement tanker aircraft would result in a best value tanker contract.  To initiate the first phase of the KC-135 replacement, the KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010, and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010.  The KC-46 program held a Milestone B Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter EMD from OSD AT&amp;L on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 EMD contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft.  

The KC-46 will provide fuel to joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will also augment the airlift fleet with cargo, passenger and aeromedical evacuation capabilities.  The KC-46 will be able to operate in day/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment, employment, sustainment and redeployment of U.S. joint, allied, and coalition forces.  The KC-46 will have communication, navigation and surveillance equipment for world-wide operations; will have the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; will have the capability to operate in low-to-medium threat areas and near-high threat areas with self-defense/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and will have necessary battle space awareness to mitigate survivability threats.

The KC-46 development effort will also procure the necessary ground and flight test assets to support development/operational test.  The program plans to procure four RDT&amp;E aircraft for integration and demonstration of capability that will ultimately be operationally fielded after a successful operational test phase.  In addition, both aircrew and maintenance Training System Requirement Analyses (TSRA) are being conducted to determine training requirements.  Aircrew and maintenance training systems will be developed and procured via a future trainer-specific source selection, using KC-46 funding.  A business case analysis will also be conducted to determine if the engines for the production aircraft will be government furnished or contractor furnished.  Initial training and sustainment efforts will be provided via Interim Contractor Support (ICS).  KC-46 funding will also support various studies and analyses including the five-nation Future Technology for Aerial Refueling (FTAR) project, and KC-Y/KC-Z planning activities. 

This program is in Budget Activity 05, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The KC-46 Program acquisition strategy is to procure an existing commercial, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified aircraft modified to meet USAF requirements.  The KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010, and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010.  The KC-46 program held a Milestone B Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter EMD from OSD AT&amp;L on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft.  The KC-46 contract procurement was conducted via a full and open competition per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, and resulted in a FY 2011 EMD Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) contract.  The EMD phase will develop, build, and test four KC-46 aircraft, and will qualify receiver aircraft.  

Production will begin in FY 2015 with two Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) lots (Firm Fixed Priced (FFP)) and then Full-Rate Production (FRP) options (FFP with Not to Exceed (NTE) + Economic Price Adjustment (EPA)).  The LRIP and FRP options will be exercised following successful completion of Operational Assessments (OAs) for the LRIP decisions, and a successful completion of Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) for the FRP decision.  

The Government plans to compete the development, deployment, and sustainment of both the aircrew and maintenance training systems separately.

Based on the market research and a cost effectiveness analysis, the engines will be procured as contractor furnished equipment (CFE) for EMD.  Following EMD, the Government will assess the potential of breaking out the engines as a separate procurement based on an updated market analysis.  

The KC-46 Program is responsible for the development, testing, and production of a drogue-equipped, wing-mounted refueling system to meet Capability Development Document (CDD) thresholds and objectives, for simultaneous refueling of two probe-equipped receivers.  The system can be installed or removed from the KC-46 as mission needs dictate.
  
The long-term support concept for the KC-X is organic two-level maintenance (2LM):  organization level (O-level) and depot level (D-level).  For the purposes of this program, all maintenance other than O-level shall be referred to as D-level.  The product support strategy will use a Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) to provide interim support (Interim Contractor Support (ICS)), during the transition to a Government organic maintenance and supply support capability.  Performance Based Logistics (PBL) solutions will be evaluated during EMD as viable approaches to facilitate the transition.  

This acquisition strategy requires sufficient aircraft to be designed, tested, and delivered to meet a Required Assets Available (RAA) date of 78 months after contract award.  RAA is defined as 18 aircraft meeting final production configuration with all required training and support in place.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) will be attained when the Commander, Air Mobility Command (AMC/CC) determines the unit is operationally war ready – AMC has not yet determined an IOC date.  Full Operational Capability (FOC) is expected approximately 24 months after IOC.

654364 – Combat Rescue Helicopter:  Funding will procure a Government Off the Shelf/Contractor Off the Shelf (GOTS/COTS) aircraft configured with mission equipment.  There will be required effort to integrate mature subsystems and the associated software.  The mature subsystems integration and software development will include human systems integration, advanced communication/net ready, and improved survivability among others.  

657001 - Avionics Development and Integration: This effort will fund a fully-integrated avionics upgrade that includes predictive terrain awareness for Air Force helicopters.  

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The CRH program will replace the aging HH-60G system with a new air vehicle and associated training systems and support elements.  The acquisition strategy is to procure a Government Off The Shelf/Contractor Off the Shelf (GOTS/COTS) aircraft configured with mission equipment.  There will be a required effort to integrate mature subsystems and the associated software.  The mature subsystems integration and software development will include human systems integration, advanced communication/net ready, and improved survivability among others.  The effort will also support the development of training systems as well as all necessary support elements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>HC/MC-130 Recapitalization will replace and augment the aging USAF fleets of combat rescue HC-130P/N and special operations MC-130E/P aircraft which are experiencing airworthiness, maintainability and operational limitations.  The HC/MC-130 Recap Capabilities Production Document (CPD) defines a common baseline configuration for the weapon system and a FY 2012 Initial Operational Capability.  The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validated the CPD in Aug 2009. 

FY13 HC/MC-130J funding continues follow on systems engineering and development efforts for the basic aircraft.     

FY13 HC/MC-130J program RDT&amp;E funding also provides for Trial Kit Install (TKI) of the C-130J Block 7.0 into the HC/MC-130J.  The C-130J Block 7.0 program is in PE 0401132F.  Block 7.0 primarily addresses mandated Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.  Block 7.0 is an international collaboration as the common core development costs are being shared by each participating nation (United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the United States).  Block 7.0 requirements include: a) Communication, Navigation &amp; Identification (CNI) upgrades; b) Dual Multi-Mode Receivers (MMR) with a Civil Global Positioning System; c) CNI special processor upgrade; d) Tactical datalink; and e) Mission computer upgrades.  

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production. </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>HC/MC-130 Recapitalization will replace and augment the aging USAF fleets of combat rescue HC-130P/N and special operations MC-130E/P aircraft which are experiencing airworthiness, maintainability and operational limitations.  The HC/MC-130 Recap Capabilities Production Document (CPD) defines a common baseline configuration for the weapon system and a FY 2012 Initial Operational Capability.  The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validated the CPD in Aug 2009. 

FY13 HC/MC-130J funding continues follow on systems engineering and development efforts for the basic aircraft.     

FY13 HC/MC-130J program RDT&amp;E funding also provides for Trial Kit Install (TKI) of the C-130J Block 7.0 into the HC/MC-130J.  The C-130J Block 7.0 program is in PE 0401132F.  Block 7.0 primarily addresses mandated Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.  Block 7.0 is an international collaboration as the common core development costs are being shared by each participating nation (United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the United States).  Block 7.0 requirements include: a) Communication, Navigation &amp; Identification (CNI) upgrades; b) Dual Multi-Mode Receivers (MMR) with a Civil Global Positioning System; c) CNI special processor upgrade; d) Tactical datalink; and e) Mission computer upgrades.  

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In FY12, LRSO efforts were transferred from PE 0101122F, Air Launched Cruise Missile, to PE 0101125F, Nuclear Weapon Modernization, in order to support LRSO development.

In FY13, LRSO efforts were transferred from PE 0101125F, Nuclear Weapon Modernization, project number 657008, to PE 0604932F, Long Range Standoff Weapon, project number 657011.

The Cost to Complete and Total Cost for MDAP projects in this program element are documented in the R3. The Cost to Complete and Total Cost on the R2 are entered as "Continuing" and not reflective of the total cost for MDAP projects since the R2 does not account for prior years funding.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The purpose of this program element is to conduct and support Air Force and Joint DoD-DOE acquisition activities for the modernization and sustainment of nuclear weapons.

B61 Life Extension Program (LEP) is a joint DoD-DOE effort encompassing feasibility, design, cost, and a down-select effort.  DoD leads development and acquisition of B61 Tail Kit Assembly (TKA) as well as integration with current and future aircraft.  

The Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) effort will develop a weapon system to replace the Air Force's Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), operational since 1986.  The LRSO weapon system will be capable of penetrating and surviving advanced Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) from significant stand off range to prosecute strategic targets in support of the Air Force's global attack capability and strategic deterrence core function.  

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>B61 Life Extension Program (LEP):  The LEP of the B61 gravity weapon will extend the service life of the weapon.  Provides leadership, management, and oversight of the Air Force-led, joint Department of Defense (DoD) - Department of Energy (DOE) B61 Project Officer's Group (POG) and the joint DoD-DOE B61 LEP Development Engineering Phase feasibility, design, cost, and down-select study. Program also provides technical oversight of the DOE nuclear package LEP activities; develops weapons trainers, test equipment, tech data, and training for the B61 LEP; and conducts ground and flight tests and support aircraft integration for the B61 LEP.  This may include weapon trainers, test equipment, tech data, training and training materials.  

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY2012 LRSO efforts were transferred from PE 0101122F, Air Launched Cruise Missile, project number 674797, to PE 0101125F, Nuclear Weapon Modernization, project number 657008 in order to support LRSO development.

In FY2013 LRSO efforts were transferred from PE 0101125F, Nuclear Weapon Modernization, project number 657008, to PE 0604932F, Long Range Stand Off, project number 657011, in order to support LRSO development.

</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) effort will develop a weapon system to replace the Air Force's Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), operational since 1986.  The LRSO weapon system will be capable of penetrating and surviving advanced Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) from significant stand off range to prosecute strategic targets in support of the Air Force's global attack capability and strategic deterrence core function.  

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Light Attack Armed Reconnaissance (LAAR) program provides the USAF with a non-developmental training aircraft suitable for training USAF Air Advisors in conducting strike and armed reconnaissance operations under Irregular Warfare (IW) conditions. The USAF Air Advisors will deploy and train pilots from partner nations (PN) in support of Building Partnership Capacity (BPC) for lesser developed PN.  LAAR provides the USAF with a CONUS based capability to prepare PN to conduct indigenous aerial operations.  US Air Force provided training better enables PN to employ a light attack and reconnaissance capability using a representative platform consistent with the partner nation’s sustainment and operational needs.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.  

The LAAR program is terminated.  Light attack air advisors will train in theater using methods similar to those already proven in other light aircraft.  The Air Force has the ability to improve the capabilities of Partner Nation Air Forces using the foundational programs without procuring a niche aircraft to accomplish the training.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Full Combat Mission Training (FCMT) supports Air Force Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) and Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) integration. DMO is an operational readiness initiative enabling the USAF to exercise and train at the operational and strategic levels of war while facilitating unit-level training.  Networked LVC components form the integrated DMO battlespace by linking geographically distributed high fidelity combat and combat support training devices, including Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems. RDT&amp;E for Project 5012, FCMT, efforts are focused on development, demonstration, and transitioning of critical functions associated with the DMO/LVC network and linked simulators.  Project 5354, F-16 Block 40/50 Mission Training Centers (MTC), efforts are focused on development and demonstration of the F-16 Block 40/50 MTC.

This program is funded in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting Engineering and Manufacturing Development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Full Combat Mission Training (FCMT) supports Air Force Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) and Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) integration.  DMO is an operational readiness initiative enabling the USAF to exercise and train at the operational and strategic levels of war while facilitating unit-level training.   FY13 FCMT funding  provides research in areas benefiting the AF DMO/LVC environment as a whole.  Provides research and development to facilitate integration of fielded and newly acquired, Air Force owned training devices into DMO/LVC networks.  Enhances the quality of training for the systems added to the network.  Enables aircrews to network with LVC components to form the integrated DMO battlespace.  Links geographically distributed, high-fidelity combat and combat support training devices including Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems.  Develops, demonstrates and inserts multi-level security capability.  This capability allows the warfighters at home station to exercise and train at the operational and strategic levels of war as well as conduct networked unit-level training.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Each platform joining the Distributed Mission Operations (DMO)/Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) environment selects its own acquisition strategy based on using Command needs, Business Case Analysis (BCA) and the magnitude of the training system changes required to provide DMO capability.  The initial systems in the DMO/LVC environment; F-15C, AWACS, F-16 Block 40/50 and F-15E, all required new training systems.  In addition, the Operations and Integration capability had to be created.  The Training Simulation Service (TSS) acquisition strategy was used to meet a portion of these requirements.  In the TSS approach, the contractor owns and provides the simulator equipment, maintains simulator concurrency with weapon systems, and has incentives to keep the equipment up to date with simulator and network technologies.  The FY07 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) specifically limited the Air Force’s ability to acquire military flight simulators with service contracts.  As a result, training capability currently provided on the F-16 Mission Training Center (MTC) is being replaced under a separate program with training provided with procured flight simulators.  (Acquisition of the F-16 Block 40/50 MTCs is detailed under the Project 655354 in this document.)  The FY08 NDAA language allows continued use of the service contract approach on systems where it was already in use.  Currently fielded and projected Air Force-owned Flight and Mission Training Systems without DMO/LVC capability will be modified using Full Combat Mission Trining (FCMT) funds to ensure compatibility with the DMO-LVC environment.  Additional DMO capable trainers will be acquired for those systems where current quantities are inadequate to meet training requirements using FCMT funds.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>F-16 Block 40/50 Mission Training Center (MTC) supports the development, acquisition, fielding and sustainment of high fidelity, Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable flight simulators for F-16 Block 40 and 50 weapon systems.  Each MTC includes multiple high fidelity Simulator Cockpits, Instructor Operator Stations, a Threat Server and Brief/Debrief and Mission Observation capability.  Each is capable of linking to geographically distributed high-fidelity combat and combat support training devices including Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems.  This capability allows the warfighters at home station to exercise and train at the operational and strategic levels of war as well as conduct networked unit-level training.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Air Force uses Aircrew Training Devices (ATD) to provide realistic, cost effective flight training to aircrews.  Some of the training in the ATDs cannot be fully conducted in the aircraft because of safety, airspace, equipment, and security restrictions.  The MC-12W Mission Training Center (MTC) Program will provide simulation for pilots and mission system operators.

The MC-12W MTC will consist of a cockpit simulator and an aircrew systems simulator, instructor/operator stations, and control equipment work stations.  The MTC will be capable of integrating with the Air Force Distributed Mission Operations network that integrates the Air Force's vast array of weapon system simulators.  Additionally, the MTC will be able to replicate theater-specific environments and combat situations, overcoming constraints that may limit combat preparation.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MC-12W Mission Training Center will be devloped and maintained through the Simulator Systems Program Office.  The procured supplies and services are supported across the full spectrum of system life-cycle management.  Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged committment to Overseas Contingency Operations, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging Combatant Commander requirements.  

A portion of the MC-12W total aircraft inventory will transferred from the Active Duty force structure to the National Guard Bureau beginning in FY 2014.  Final composition of the MC-12W transferred resources has not been determined, to include the MC-2W MTC. </r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The CV-22 is a Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the 1st generation V-22 tilt-rotor, multi-mission aircraft.  CV-22 RDT&amp;E provides development, integration, testing and enhancement of critical capability to insert, extract, and re-supply special operation forces into politically or militarily denied areas.  The CV-22 Block 10 configuration added terrain following radar, additional fuel tanks, additional radios, flare/chaff dispensers, radio frequency/infrared and defensive countermeasures, weapons, situational awareness improvements, and Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) to the V-22 Block B aircraft.  Block 20 development includes, but is not limited to improved communications, situational awareness, software, and other requirements specified in the V-22 Block C/20 Capabilities Production Document.  A future capabilities increment is anticipated following Block 20 to enhance self-deployment capabilities such as Distributed Ice Protection and Engine Time-On-Wing.  CV-22 RDT&amp;E also provides for a baseline CV-22 flight test aircraft for validation/verification of Block 20 and various software and reliability and maintainability mods through 2017.  The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness capabilities in block increments.  Ongoing planning and associated activities will take place to prevent diminishing manufacturing resources and obsolescence issues, as required.  USSOCOM and USAF jointly fund correction of deficiencies and Block 20 development.  USSOCOM funds the development, integration and testing of SOF unique mission capability, while USAF funds interoperability, basic air vehicle enhancements, integration of Air Force and Navy maintenance and information systems used with the V-22, support for operational testing, and CV-22 implementation and testing of MV-22 Block B and Block C changes.  USSOCOM and USAF jointly fund development projects to meet operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness mission needs.  This includes designing, prototyping, integrating, testing and fielding proposed solutions to emerging warfighter issues.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CV-22 is a Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the 1st generation V-22 tilt-rotor, multi-mission aircraft.  CV-22 RDT&amp;E provides development, integration, testing and enhancement of critical capability to insert, extract, and re-supply special operation forces into politically or militarily denied areas.  The CV-22 Block 10 configuration added terrain following radar, additional fuel tanks, additional radios, flare/chaff dispensers, radio frequency/infrared and defensive countermeasures, weapons, situational awareness improvements, and Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) to the V-22 Block B aircraft.  Block 20 development includes, but is not limited to improved communications, situational awareness, software, and other requirements specified in the V-22 Block C/20 Capabilities Production Document.  A future capabilities increment is anticipated following Block 20 to enhance self-deployment capabilities such as Distributed Ice Protection and Engine Time-On-Wing.  CV-22 RDT&amp;E also provides for a baseline CV-22 flight test aircraft for validation/verification of Block 20 and various software and reliability and maintainability mods through 2017.  The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness capabilities in block increments.  Ongoing planning and associated activities will take place to prevent diminishing manufacturing resources and obsolescence issues, as required.  USSOCOM and USAF jointly fund correction of deficiencies and Block 20 development.  USSOCOM funds the development, integration and testing of SOF unique mission capability, while USAF funds interoperability, basic air vehicle enhancements, integration of Air Force and Navy maintenance and information systems used with the V-22, support for operational testing, and CV-22 implementation and testing of MV-22 Block B and Block C changes.  USSOCOM and USAF jointly fund development projects to meet operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness mission needs.  This includes designing, prototyping, integrating, testing and fielding proposed solutions to emerging warfighter issues.

This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production.

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The V-22 Joint Program Office (NAVAIRSYSCOM PMA-275) ensures that CV-22 changes are incorporated into the ongoing V-22 production line with minimal impact.  The JPO is developing new capabilities for the V-22 in blocks.  Block 0 and Block 10 have completed development, and Block 20 is currently underway.  NAVAIRSYSCOM awarded a cost plus fixed fee contract with the prime contractor in Dec 2007 for Block 20 development and test.  Development activities for the V-22 program are performed by the prime contractor selected on a sole-source basis.  Bell-Boeing is a strategic partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Integrated Defense Systems.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2012, the SLC3S-A Communications Program (SCP) was terminated.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription> The Air Force Senior Leader Command, Control, and Communications System - Airborne (SLC3S-A) provides executive airborne communications supporting world-wide command and control capabilities to US government Senior Leaders (i.e., the President of the United States (POTUS); Vice President of the United States (VPOTUS); Secretary of Defense (SECDEF); Secretary of State (SECSTATE); Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS); Unified Combatant Commanders (COCOMs); and their staffs as well as other government senior leaders). The SLC3S-A capabilities include secure and non-secure voice, data, and video connectivity into Defense Information System Network/Global Information Grid, Defense Switched Network, Defense Red Switch Network, Voice Over Secure Internet Protocol Networks, National Security Council's Crisis Management System, and commercial networks up to the Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information security classification level. These capabilities are used daily by the Senior Leaders to carry out their duties and responsibilities. Currently, each Air Force Operational Support Aircraft and Very Important Person Special Airlift Mission (OSA/VIPSAM) aircraft is configured with its own unique communications suite. National Senior Leaders require 100% secure voice, data, and video capability for all activities from general planning and strategy discussions to directing command decisions. The security, reliability, and availability of the AF SLC3S-A services determine America's victories or setbacks on the battlefield. The SLC3S-A Program will standardize the back-end communications architecture, off-board transmission systems, ground support networks, and Roll-on/Roll-off assets. The C-37 Communications Package (CCP) will standardize the airborne local area network, add additional commercial SATCOM capability and increase the Mean Zero Fuel Weight (MZFW) across the fleet of C-37s. CCP activities also include studies and analysis to support execution of these modifications. The CCP program is pre-MDD. The SLC3S-A Transmission System (STS) Program will address the connectivity infrastructure between AF SLC3S-A aircraft internal communications/information system (e.g., C-37 Communications Package) and Executive Airlift Communications Network (EACN) Air-to-Ground Gateway (A2G2). This effort will provide highly reliable, redundant, wideband communications paths off OSA/VIPSAM aircraft and may include an implementation of wideband MILSATCOM and commercial SATCOM capabilities, modification of the ground infrastructure and development of a Black-side Network Operations Center. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. The STS program is pre-MDD. The CCP program is in budget activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) with a planned entry at Milestone B.

                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY2012, the SLC3S-A Communications Program was terminated.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription> The Air Force Senior Leader Command, Control, and Communications System - Airborne (SLC3S-A) provides executive airborne communications supporting world-wide command and control capabilities to US government Senior Leaders (i.e., the President of the United States (POTUS); Vice President of the United States (VPOTUS); Secretary of Defense (SECDEF); Secretary of State (SECSTATE); Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS); Unified Combatant Commanders (COCOMs); and their staffs as well as other government senior leaders). The SLC3S-A capabilities include secure and non-secure voice, data, and video connectivity into Defense Information System Network/Global Information Grid, Defense Switched Network, Defense Red Switch Network, Voice Over Secure Internet Protocol Networks, National Security Council's Crisis Management System, and commercial networks up to the Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information security classification level. These capabilities are used daily by the Senior Leaders to carry out their duties and responsibilities. Currently, each Air Force Operational Support Aircraft and Very Important Person Special Airlift Mission (OSA/VIPSAM) aircraft is configured with its own unique communications suite. National Senior Leaders require 100% secure voice, data, and video capability for all activities from general planning and strategy discussions to directing command decisions. The security, reliability, and availability of the AF SLC3S-A services determine America's victories or setbacks on the battlefield. The SLC3S-A Program will standardize the back-end communications architecture, off-board transmission systems, ground support networks, and Roll-on/Roll-off assets. The C-37 Communications Package (CCP) will standardize the airborne local area network, add additional commercial SATCOM capability and increase the Mean Zero Fuel Weight (MZFW) across the fleet of C-37s. CCP activities also include studies and analysis to support execution of these modifications. The CCP program is pre-MDD. The SLC3S-A Transmission System (STS) Program will address the connectivity infrastructure between AF SLC3S-A aircraft internal communications/information system (e.g., C-37 Communications Package) and Executive Airlift Communications Network (EACN) Air-to-Ground Gateway (A2G2). This effort will provide highly reliable, redundant, wideband communications paths off OSA/VIPSAM aircraft and may include an implementation of wideband MILSATCOM and commercial SATCOM capabilities, modification of the ground infrastructure and development of a Black-side Network Operations Center. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. The STS program is pre-MDD. The CCP program is in budget activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) with a planned entry at Milestone B.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE provides funding for the elements necessary to support the Air Force Electronic Warfare (EW) Test Process, including Directed Energy (DE).  This test process provides a scientific methodology to ensure the effective disciplined and efficient testing of EW and avionics systems.  Each capability or facility improvement is pursued in concert with the others to avoid duplicate capabilities while at the same time producing the proper mix of test resources needed to support the AF EW Test Process and testing of EW systems which can be used in any action involving the use of electromagnetic and DE to control the electromagnetic spectrum or to attack the enemy.  This PE provides funding for the management and technical oversight of implementation activities, development and improvement of digital EW models, measurement facilities improvements, hardware-in-the-loop test facilities improvements, and installed system test facility improvements.  Support includes requirements definition and analysis, project planning, programming and budgeting, technical oversight, and application of T&amp;E facility I&amp;M.  Products include studies, analyses, improved M&amp;S of threat sources, improved or new T&amp;E capabilties to support EW testing and related documentation.  Additionally, this PE provides funding to support the acquisition and analysis efforts of the Foreign Materiel Program and EW intelligence efforts.

This PE is in Budget Activity 6, Management Support, because it is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) effort for I&amp;M of T&amp;E capabilities at AF Test Centers.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides funding to support Foreign Materiel Operational Test and Evaluation (FMOT&amp;E), which ensures the ability of operational commands to test and develop effective Electronic Attack/Electronic Protection (EA/EP) techniques and tactics.  Funds are required for:  deployment of systems to test facilities; travel of personnel to the test sites to evaluate and validate test results;  range and laboratory costs; test consumables; costs for instrumentation of systems; and contracted engineering support for the conduct of tests and subsequent reporting.  Funding for this program is required to prevent future aircraft losses due to improper and inaccurate aircrew tactics (e.g., lack of evasive action or proper tactics training to avoid missile attack).

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF requires a comprehensive set of test facilities to implement the Air Force Electronic Warfare (EW) Test Process in order to test EW systems, including Directed Energy (DE).  To manage program risk effectively throughout the weapons system acquisition process, and conduct T&amp;E effectively and efficiently, a broad multi-spectrum, integrated set of T&amp;E capabilities for modeling and simulation through open-air ranges (OAR) are required. The EW Test Process Support task provides for investment management, coordinated technical oversight, and application of EW T&amp;E facilities, including studies, analyses, and related documentation.  The National Radar Cross Section (RCS) Test Facility (NRTF) at Holloman AFB, NM, provides timely, accurate, and secure RCS and antenna measurements for tri-service and joint program offices, DoD laboratories, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and industry. The NRTF tests fielded and developmental systems and technology to meet Low Observable (a.k.a. stealth) and EW customer requirements.  The Guided Weapons Evaluation Facility (GWEF), 412 EWG/OL-HN and the Digital Integrated Air Defense System (DIADS) provide the ability to realistically evaluate hardware components and simulated weapon systems against manned hardware threat representations throughout the acquisition process.  GWEF provides simulations of advanced Infrared (IR) &amp; Radio Frequency (RF) semi-active Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs), Air-to-Air Missiles (AAMs), RF missile warning, IR and Laser countermeasure functions; integration of actual threat hardware and ground clutter into advanced threat RF and IR missile simulations.  DIADS provides algorithm based enemy command and control (C2) capabilities plus early warning radar detection, limited ground control intercept features and also allows man-in-the-loop interaction for the enemy C2 positions.  The Advanced Warfare Test and Evaluation Capability (AWTEC) will replace 90's technology with state-of-the-art stimulators to upgrade the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) at Edwards AFB, CA and provides EMI/EMC capabilities at the BAF.  Improvement and modernization efforts within this PE are identified for the EW mission area.  EW provides planning, improvements, and modernization needed for test capabilities to conduct and support the AF EW test process, including DE.  This test process provides a scientific methodology to ensure the effective disciplined and efficient testing of EW and avionics systems.

Budget Activity Justification:  This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project's specific purpose is to support USAF Foreign Materiel Program requirements through the acquisition and analysis of foreign materiel.  Items considered for these Foreign Materiel Acquisition (FMA) funds are included in the prioritized Air Force FMA Top 20 list established each year. Each Major Command (MAJCOM) prepares and approves a Foreign Materiel - Mission Requirements Statement for each requirement.  Annually, the MAJCOM commanders establish a list of their top 20 requirements. The MAJCOMs' requirements lists are integrated and prioritized into a classified Air Force requirement list.  Each MAJCOM then approves the FMA Top 20 List and final validation comes from the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff.  System analyses are based on and driven by acquisitions.  The USAF provides assessments and data for threat systems to all DoD components.

This PE is in Budget Activity 6, Management Support, because it is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) effort for I&amp;M of T&amp;E capabilities at AF Test Centers.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE provides planning, improvements, and modernization for test capabilities at three Air Force test organizations: 46 Test Wing (to include 46 Test Group at Holloman AFB NM, and operating locations at Wright-Patterson AFB OH), Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), and Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC).  The purpose is to help test organizations improve and develop their test infrastructure and capabilities to keep pace with improvements in weapon system technologies.  

The improvement and modernization (I&amp;M) requirements are defined through the AF Test Investment Planning &amp; Programming (TIPP) Process.  Also, all projects have been reviewed through the Tri-Service Reliance process (to communicate AF efforts to the other Services and avoid unwarranted duplication of effort) and are documented in Reliance Area Capability Summaries (RACS).  Further, each project has its own planning, development, equipment acquisition, equipment installation, and checkout phases which often require significant differences in funding from one year to the next.  As such, the changes in category funding from year to year do not necessarily indicate program growth, but rather a planned phasing of improvement and modernization efforts.  The test capabilities at these locations enable testing through all phases of weapon system acquisition, from system concept exploration through component and full scale integrated weapon system testing to operational testing.  These test organizations are a part of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), operated and maintained by the Air Force for DoD test and evaluation.  These national test assets are available to others requiring their unique capabilities.

The 46TW, at Eglin AFB, FL, conducts and supports developmental test and evaluation (DT&amp;E) of non-nuclear air armaments; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems; target acquisition and weapon delivery systems; navigation systems; provides a climatic simulation capability; and determines target/test item spectral signatures.  The 46TG at Holloman AFB, NM provides independent test and evaluation of inertial, Global Positioning System and integrated systems used for aircraft navigation and missile guidance systems including vulnerability to electronic interference; provides the liaison function for coordinating and scheduling all US Air Force test operations at White Sands Missile Range; provides subsonic through hypersonic ground testing of aircraft and missiles in a flight-representative environment under highly instrumented conditions; and executes flight test and test support for advanced avionics and weapons development of joint, international and commercial test programs.

AEDC, at Arnold AFB, TN, provides pre-flight and reliability ground environmental test support for DoD aeropropulsion, flight systems, and space and missile programs.  The center has 53 test facilities providing: aerodynamic testing of scale model aircraft, missiles, and space systems; testing of large and full-scale satellites, sensors, and space vehicles in a simulated space environment; altitude environmental testing for aircraft, missile, and spacecraft propulsion systems; and testing of large-scale models such as space boosters together with their propulsion systems.

AFFTC, at Edwards AFB, CA, conducts and supports DT&amp;E and Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) of aircraft and aircraft systems, aerospace research vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, cruise missiles, parachute delivery/recovery/systems, and cargo handling systems.

I&amp;M efforts within this PE are identified in four mission area categories:  Airframe/Propulsion/Avionics (APA); Armament/Munitions (A/M); Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR); and Space.  These categories describe general types of effort that will be conducted in this PE.  APA provides planning, improvements, and modernization needed for test capabilities to conduct and support DT&amp;E and OT&amp;E of aircraft and aircraft systems, aerospace research vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, cruise missiles, parachute delivery/recovery systems, cargo handling systems, and turbine engines.  APA focuses on evaluation of the vehicle airframe, propulsion system, and avionics systems, as well as overall systems integration testing.  It encompasses both ground test facilities and open-air range infrastructure, including instrumentation and data processing.  A/M provides planning, improvements and modernization to conduct DT&amp;E of air-to-ground and air-to-air armaments and munitions, which include gun, chaff and flare systems as well as aerial decoy and target systems.  The A/M category encompasses the full range of DT&amp;E from digital modeling and simulation, to precision measurement testing, to hardware-in-the-loop and installed systems testing, to open-air range testing.  Elements of A/M DT&amp;E include environmental, warhead effectiveness, arena blast/fragmentation, guidance navigation and control, aerodynamics, propulsion, electromagnetic interference and compatibility, mass properties, seeker and signature measurement, survivability, lethality, integration, reliability, net-centric and terminal effects testing.  A/M also involves the design and development of systems needed to support A/M DT&amp;E including the design and development sleds, targets, range support systems and various instrumentation and measurement systems.  C4ISR provides planning, improvements and modernization to conduct DT&amp;E of systems that support C2 functions which range from air campaign planning at the theater level to wing level C2 operations, to planning individual missions, to putting weapons on target using concepts such as machine to machine targeting.  C4ISR includes ground and flight performance testing of airborne C2 networks and tactical data links, air operation centers, mission planning systems, multi-level security systems, radio and communication systems, ISR systems, information assurance systems, and radar systems such as those used by JSTARS and air traffic control systems.  C4ISR conducts DT&amp;E on a full range of systems covering the sensor (detection) to the shooter (weapon), including functional and environmental testing of these systems.  Space provides planning, improvements, and modernization needed for Space test capabilities to perform developmental and operational testing for space and launch acquisition and sustainment programs.  Test capabilities include launch vehicle, satellite, missile, sensor, thermal protection system, signature, hardness, and interface testing.  The capabilities are resident at Vandenberg, Kirtland, Arnold, Patrick, Schriever, Peterson, Holloman Air Force Bases and others.  Infrastructure includes launch sites, mobile control units, thermal vacuum chambers, sled track, arc heated wind tunnels, ballistic test ranges, signature collection, and the requisite personnel.  

Budget Activity Justification:  This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This PE provides planning, improvements, and modernization for test capabilities at three Air Force test organizations: 46 Test Wing (to include 46 Test Group at Holloman AFB NM, and operating locations at Wright-Patterson AFB OH), Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), and Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC).  The purpose is to help test organizations improve and develop their test infrastructure and capabilities to keep pace with improvements in weapon system technologies.  

The improvement and modernization (I&amp;M) requirements are defined through the AF Test Investment Planning &amp; Programming (TIPP) Process.  Also, all projects have been reviewed through the Tri-Service Reliance process (to communicate AF efforts to the other Services and avoid unwarranted duplication of effort) and are documented in Reliance Area Capability Summaries (RACS).  Further, each project has its own planning, development, equipment acquisition, equipment installation, and checkout phases which often require significant differences in funding from one year to the next.  As such, the changes in category funding from year to year do not necessarily indicate program growth, but rather a planned phasing of improvement and modernization efforts.  The test capabilities at these locations enable testing through all phases of weapon system acquisition, from system concept exploration through component and full scale integrated weapon system testing to operational testing.  These test organizations are a part of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), operated and maintained by the Air Force for DoD test and evaluation.  These national test assets are available to others requiring their unique capabilities.

The 46TW, at Eglin AFB, FL, conducts and supports developmental test and evaluation (DT&amp;E) of non-nuclear air armaments; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems; target acquisition and weapon delivery systems; navigation systems; provides a climatic simulation capability; and determines target/test item spectral signatures.  The 46TG at Holloman AFB, NM provides independent test and evaluation of inertial, Global Positioning System and integrated systems used for aircraft navigation and missile guidance systems including vulnerability to electronic interference; provides the liaison function for coordinating and scheduling all US Air Force test operations at White Sands Missile Range; provides subsonic through hypersonic ground testing of aircraft and missiles in a flight-representative environment under highly instrumented conditions; and executes flight test and test support for advanced avionics and weapons development of joint, international and commercial test programs.

AEDC, at Arnold AFB, TN, provides pre-flight and reliability ground environmental test support for DoD aeropropulsion, flight systems, and space and missile programs.  The center has 53 test facilities providing: aerodynamic testing of scale model aircraft, missiles, and space systems; testing of large and full-scale satellites, sensors, and space vehicles in a simulated space environment; altitude environmental testing for aircraft, missile, and spacecraft propulsion systems; and testing of large-scale models such as space boosters together with their propulsion systems.

AFFTC, at Edwards AFB, CA, conducts and supports DT&amp;E and Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) of aircraft and aircraft systems, aerospace research vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, cruise missiles, parachute delivery/recovery/systems, and cargo handling systems.

I&amp;M efforts within this PE are identified in four mission area categories:  Airframe/Propulsion/Avionics (APA); Armament/Munitions (A/M); Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR); and Space.  These categories describe general types of effort that will be conducted in this PE.  APA provides planning, improvements, and modernization needed for test capabilities to conduct and support DT&amp;E and OT&amp;E of aircraft and aircraft systems, aerospace research vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, cruise missiles, parachute delivery/recovery systems, cargo handling systems, and turbine engines.  APA focuses on evaluation of the vehicle airframe, propulsion system, and avionics systems, as well as overall systems integration testing.  It encompasses both ground test facilities and open-air range infrastructure, including instrumentation and data processing.  A/M provides planning, improvements and modernization to conduct DT&amp;E of air-to-ground and air-to-air armaments and munitions, which include gun, chaff and flare systems as well as aerial decoy and target systems.  The A/M category encompasses the full range of DT&amp;E from digital modeling and simulation, to precision measurement testing, to hardware-in-the-loop and installed systems testing, to open-air range testing.  Elements of A/M DT&amp;E include environmental, warhead effectiveness, arena blast/fragmentation, guidance navigation and control, aerodynamics, propulsion, electromagnetic interference and compatibility, mass properties, seeker and signature measurement, survivability, lethality, integration, reliability, net-centric and terminal effects testing.  A/M also involves the design and development of systems needed to support A/M DT&amp;E including the design and development sleds, targets, range support systems and various instrumentation and measurement systems.  C4ISR provides planning, improvements and modernization to conduct DT&amp;E of systems that support C2 functions which range from air campaign planning at the theater level to wing level C2 operations, to planning individual missions, to putting weapons on target using concepts such as machine to machine targeting.  C4ISR includes ground and flight performance testing of airborne C2 networks and tactical data links, air operation centers, mission planning systems, multi-level security systems, radio and communication systems, ISR systems, information assurance systems, and radar systems such as those used by JSTARS and air traffic control systems.  C4ISR conducts DT&amp;E on a full range of systems covering the sensor (detection) to the shooter (weapon), including functional and environmental testing of these systems.  Space provides planning, improvements, and modernization needed for Space test capabilities to perform developmental and operational testing for space and launch acquisition and sustainment programs.  Test capabilities include launch vehicle, satellite, missile, sensor, thermal protection system, signature, hardness, and interface testing.  The capabilities are resident at Vandenberg, Kirtland, Arnold, Patrick, Schriever, Peterson, Holloman Air Force Bases and others.  Infrastructure includes launch sites, mobile control units, thermal vacuum chambers, sled track, arc heated wind tunnels, ballistic test ranges, signature collection, and the requisite personnel.  

Budget Activity Justification:  This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) This program provides for continuing analytical research across a broad spectrum of aerospace issues and concerns. The Project AIR FORCE (PAF) research agenda is focused primarily on mid to long-term problems; in addition, PAF provides quick response assistance for senior Air Force officials on high priority, near term issues. Within these areas, PAF addresses difficult and complex, far-reaching and inter-related questions linked to future strategies, approaches and policies, in order to enhance Air Force senior leadership's deliberations and decisionmaking on major issues. The Air Force Steering Group, chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff, reviews, monitors, and approves PAF annual research efforts. Each project is initiated, processed, and approved IAW PAF Sponsoring Agreement which requires General Officer (or SES equivalent) sponsorship and involvement on a continuing basis.  (U) PAF is organized in four primary research program areas: strategy and doctrine; force modernization employment; manpower, personnel and training; and resource management. Integrative research projects are also conducted at the division level with direct support provided through the most applicable program. Research programs address organizational crosscutting issues as defined by specific research themes approved by the Air Force Steering Group. These research themes encompass a wide spectrum of topics including external challenges to national security; terrorism and homeland defense; joint and coalition operations; integrated roadmap for ISR capabilities; enhancing, tailoring and reducing infrastructure to meet new force requirements; potential changes to the Active/Reserve/National Guard/Civilian/Contractor manpower mix; and improved weapon system costing.    (U) The research program will continue to build upon research foundations, examining the evolving security environment, emerging threats, national and military strategy, transformation approaches including investment strategies to provide capabilities within changing Defense budgets, operational concepts to meet evolving and increasingly joint missions, exploiting advanced technologies, increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of combat support, and developing the total force (Active/Reserve/National Guard/Civilian/Contractor).  These efforts will continue to inform and support the senior Air Force leadership regarding personnel management and training; improving logistical efficiencies and force sustainment; ongoing conflicts and joint operations; force structure capabilities, limitations, and operational concepts; and making force structure tradeoffs within resource constraints to meet future national security and Air Force needs.  (U) Looking ahead, future research will build upon earlier work to continue to help the Air Force to rapidly and appropriately adapt to the changing world environment and emerging threats; continue to modernize and employ its force structure to provide capabilities within changing DoD budgets; assess lessons learned from recent and ongoing conflicts; develop and utilize its total force; and enhance the support of our aerospace forces, ranging from sustainment of the force structure to agile combat support.  (U) PAF research spans functional and organizational boundaries and is managed in a manner to facilitate independence and freedom from organizational bias thereby providing perspectives and insights to senior Air Force leaders free from parochial influences not necessarily in the best interest of the Air Force at large.  (U) Benefits of independent non-Department of Defense analysis of complex present day and emerging issues are shared beyond the immediacy of the Air Force.  PAF study results are given wide dissemination within the DOD on a routine basis and are deposited with the Defense Technical Information Center available to a broad range of qualified government and commercial-sector individuals and activities.  (U) This program is in budget activity 6- Management and Support, because it funds RAND Project AIR FORCE (PAF), the only Air Force Federally Funded Research and Development Center for studies and analyses.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) This program provides for continuing analytical research across a broad spectrum of aerospace issues and concerns. The Project AIR FORCE (PAF) research agenda is focused primarily on mid to long-term problems; in addition, PAF provides quick response assistance for senior Air Force officials on high priority, near term issues. Within these areas, PAF addresses difficult and complex, far-reaching and inter-related questions linked to future strategies, approaches and policies, in order to enhance Air Force senior leadership's deliberations and decisionmaking on major issues. The Air Force Steering Group, chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff, reviews, monitors, and approves PAF annual research efforts. Each project is initiated, processed, and approved IAW PAF Sponsoring Agreement which requires General Officer (or SES equivalent) sponsorship and involvement on a continuing basis.  (U) PAF is organized in four primary research program areas: strategy and doctrine; force modernization employment; manpower, personnel and training; and resource management. Integrative research projects are also conducted at the division level with direct support provided through the most applicable program. Research programs address organizational crosscutting issues as defined by specific research themes approved by the Air Force Steering Group. These research themes encompass a wide spectrum of topics including external challenges to national security; terrorism and homeland defense; joint and coalition operations; integrated roadmap for ISR capabilities; enhancing, tailoring and reducing infrastructure to meet new force requirements; potential changes to the Active/Reserve/National Guard/Civilian/Contractor manpower mix; and improved weapon system costing.    (U) The research program will continue to build upon research foundations, examining the evolving security environment, emerging threats, national and military strategy, transformation approaches including investment strategies to provide capabilities within changing Defense budgets, operational concepts to meet evolving and increasingly joint missions, exploiting advanced technologies, increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of combat support, and developing the total force (Active/Reserve/National Guard/Civilian/Contractor).  These efforts will continue to inform and support the senior Air Force leadership regarding personnel management and training; improving logistical efficiencies and force sustainment; ongoing conflicts and joint operations; force structure capabilities, limitations, and operational concepts; and making force structure tradeoffs within resource constraints to meet future national security and Air Force needs.  (U) Looking ahead, future research will build upon earlier work to continue to help the Air Force to rapidly and appropriately adapt to the changing world environment and emerging threats; continue to modernize and employ its force structure to provide capabilities within changing DoD budgets; assess lessons learned from recent and ongoing conflicts; develop and utilize its total force; and enhance the support of our aerospace forces, ranging from sustainment of the force structure to agile combat support.  (U) PAF research spans functional and organizational boundaries and is managed in a manner to facilitate independence and freedom from organizational bias thereby providing perspectives and insights to senior Air Force leaders free from parochial influences not necessarily in the best interest of the Air Force at large.  (U) Benefits of independent non-Department of Defense analysis of complex present day and emerging issues are shared beyond the immediacy of the Air Force.  PAF study results are given wide dissemination within the DOD on a routine basis and are deposited with the Defense Technical Information Center available to a broad range of qualified government and commercial-sector individuals and activities.  (U) This program is in budget activity 6- Management and Support, because it funds RAND Project AIR FORCE (PAF), the only Air Force Federally Funded Research and Development Center for studies and analyses.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE funds Congressionally mandated Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) to support major weapon system acquisition decisions beyond Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP), Milestone C, full rate production, fielding, and declaration of Initial Operational Capability (IOC). For major systems designated for use in combat, the law requires IOT&amp;E be completed under realistic field conditions before proceeding beyond LRIP. IOT&amp;E will be planned to completely and unambiguously answer all critical operational issues (COI) as thoroughly as possible. IOT&amp;E is conducted to determine the operational effectiveness and suitability and resolve overall mission capability of systems undergoing research and development (R&amp;D) efforts. It is an evaluation of a system's performance when the complete system is tested and evaluated against operational criteria by personnel with the same qualifications as those who will operate, maintain and support the system when deployed. In general, IOT&amp;E is performed on new systems in development, major modifications, and other systems as directed.  This PE funds the OT participation in Integrated Test and Evaluation (IT&amp;E), the Air Force participation in Multiservice Operational Test and Evaluation (MOT&amp;E), and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E) when it is the continuation of IOT&amp;E activities past the full rate production decision.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides resources to operate the Air Force test activities which are included in the Department of Defense (DoD) Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Test facilities/capabilities operated through this program include wind tunnels, rocket and jet engine test cells, hypersonic and subsonic testing, modeling and simulation, technology, limited space environmental simulation chambers, armament test ranges, hardware-in-the-loop test facilities, climatic test facilities, avionics test facilities, aircraft testbeds, dry lakebed landing sites, instrumented test ranges, and test aircraft maintenance, as well as USAF Test Pilot School.  Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Support funds institutional test infrastructure activities including:  Command and supervisory staffs; supply stocks; maintenance, repair, and replacement of worn or obsolete test equipment and facilities; test infrastructure for data collection, transmission, reduction, and analysis; civilian salaries; temporary duty travel; range operations and material support contract costs for hardware and software engineering and maintenance; and minor improvement and modernization projects.  It also funds institutional test aircraft depot level maintenance such as:  Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM), the calendar-based cyclic scheduling of aircraft into depots for update/inspection; modifications and any other depot level repairs required by the aircraft System Program Directors (SPD); engine overhauls; depot-provided area assistance; and assorted ground support equipment overhauls.  Three major Air Force test centers are supported by this project:  (1) Arnold Engineering and Development Center (AEDC), located at Arnold Air Force Base (AFB), TN, whose institutional test infrastructure supports operations of the largest complex of ground test facilities in the world (includes transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic wind tunnels;rocket motor and turbine engine test cells; space environmental test chambers, hyperballistic ranges; and other specialized facilities). Included are operations at the National Full-Scale Aerodynamic Complex (NFAC) located at NASA's AMES Research Center, California as well as operations at Tunnel 9 located at White Oak, Maryland.(2) Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), located at Edwards AFB, CA, whose institutional test infrastructure supports weapons system development and operational test and evaluation for aircraft, aircraft subsystems and aircraft weapon systems, aerospace research vehicles, unmanned miniature vehicles, cruise missiles, parachute delivery/recovery systems, cargo handling systems, communications, information operations, and Electronic Warfare (EW) systems for DoD and allied forces.  The AFFTC mission includes the USAF Test Pilot School.  (3) Air Armament Center (AAC) 46th Test Wing (TW) located at Eglin AFB, FL, is a joint test and training complex of 724 square miles of land area, and approximately 123,000 square miles of water area.  AAC 46TW provides the institutional test infrastructure required to conduct developmental and operational test and evaluation of non-nuclear air armaments (including aircraft guns, ammunition, and air-to-surface and air-to-air guided munitions); Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence/Surveillance/Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems; target acquisition and weapon delivery systems; multi-service climatic simulation capability; and special operations aircraft systems.  AAC 46TW provides a scientific test process that supports the development, production, sustainment, and enhancement of munitions systems that support tri-service digital weapons development. T&amp;E support services contracts are awarded on the basis of full and open competition. 

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts, and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, and test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP) provides responsive space and Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) launch vehicle support to DoD and other government agencies using commercial launch systems and excess ballistic missile assets.  The RSLP mission was established by the Secretary of Defense in 1972.  It provides mission planning, payload integration, vehicle acquisition, processing, and launch operations, booster storage and disposition, aging surveillance, maintenance and logistics support for selected DoD responsive space and RDT&amp;E launches.  Costs directly attributable to a specific launch or program (e.g. reliability of flight testing, maintenance of launch vehicle processing infrastructure) are paid by the user (Air Force, Navy, Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), etc.).  RSLP maintains exclusive control of deactivated Minuteman and Peacekeeper assets used in testing to include refurbishment, transportation and handling, storage, and launch services.  RSLP also funds general research and development efforts for launch to enhance the reliability of the Minotaur fleet vehicles (e.g., Minotaur IV third stage gas generator diffuser modification). 

This program is in Budget Activity 06 - RDT&amp;E Management Support, since RSLP provides research and development effort and/or operations support for general research and development use.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP) provides responsive space and Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) launch vehicle support to DoD and other government agencies using commercial launch systems and excess ballistic missile assets.  The RSLP mission was established by the Secretary of Defense in 1972.  It provides mission planning, payload integration, vehicle acquisition, processing, and launch operations, booster storage and disposition, aging surveillance, maintenance and logistics support for selected DoD responsive space and RDT&amp;E launches.  Costs directly attributable to a specific launch or program (e.g. reliability of flight testing, maintenance of launch vehicle processing infrastructure) are paid by the user (Air Force, Navy, Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), etc.).  RSLP maintains exclusive control of deactivated Minuteman and Peacekeeper assets used in testing to include refurbishment, transportation and handling, storage, and launch services.  RSLP also funds general research and development efforts for launch to enhance the reliability of the Minotaur fleet vehicles (e.g., Minotaur IV third stage gas generator diffuser modification). 

This program is in Budget Activity 06 - RDT&amp;E Management Support, since RSLP provides research and development effort and/or operations support for general research and development use.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Space Test Program (STP) conducts space test missions for the purpose of accelerating DoD space technology transformation while lowering developmental risk. The program flies an optimally selected number of DoD sponsored experiments consistent with priority, opportunity, and funding.   STP missions are the most cost-effective way to flight test new space system technologies, concepts and designs, providing an inexpensive way to:   
- Support the space acquisition block development approach
- Demonstrate and develop responsive research and development (R&amp;D) space capabilities 
- Provide early operational capabilities to quickly react to new developments 
- Perform operational risk reduction through direct flight test of prototype components 
- Improve operational design by characterizing the space environment, event, or sensor physics proposed for an operational system/system upgrade 
- Develop, test, and acquire advanced payload support hardware for small and medium expendable launch vehicles (LV) and unmanned spaceflight vehicles  

The Deputy Secretary of Defense Space Test Program Management &amp; Funding Policy, issued in Jul 2002, reaffirmed STP as the primary provider of spaceflight for the DoD space research community.  The Jul 2002 policy statement also reaffirms STP's role as the single manager for all DoD payloads on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station.  In FY11, STP provided launch services to 24 SERB-approved experiments including seven long-duration experiments on the ISS.  FY11 also saw the launch of an additional 13 experiments on the Shuttle or other man-rated systems with additional integration to the ISS.  It also provided operations support for free-flyer experiments and long-duration external experiments on the ISS.  The DoD Space Experiments Review Board (SERB) approved and prioritized 63 experiments in 2011 as candidates for launch services.

Beginning in FY13, new STP efforts are terminated.  FY13 efforts support program closeout and termination.  STP-2 integration and mission will be continued in FY13-FY15 via existing funding in PE 0603401F Advanced Spacecraft Technology, RDT&amp;E AF.  STP-2 is a dedicated research and development launch mission that also supports the commercial new entrant launch strategy.

STP is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, because it supports RDT&amp;E satellite launches.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Restoration includes repair and replacement work to restore damaged facilities due to accident or failure attributable to inadequate sustainment, excessive age, or other causes. Modernization includes alteration of facilities to implement a new, higher standard (including regulatory changes), to accommodate new functions, or to replace building components that typically last more than 50 years (such as foundations and structural components).  Other tasks associated with facilities operations (such as custodial services, grass cutting, and the provision of central utilities) are not included.   These restoration/modernization funds support the following Air Force test facilities:  46th Test Group (TG) at Holloman AFB, NM, the 46th Test Wing (TW) at Eglin AFB, FL, the Arnold Engineering and Development Center (AEDC) at Arnold AFB, TN and the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) at Edwards AFB.

Budget Activity Justification:  This program element is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Restoration includes repair and replacement work to restore damaged facilities due to accident or failure attributable to inadequate sustainment, excessive age, or other causes. Modernization includes alteration of facilities to implement a new, higher standard (including regulatory changes), to accommodate new functions, or to replace building components that typically last more than 50 years (such as foundations and structural components).  Other tasks associated with facilities operations (such as custodial services, grass cutting, and the provision of central utilities) are not included.   These restoration/modernization funds support the following Air Force test facilities:  46th Test Group (TG) at Holloman AFB, NM, the 46th Test Wing (TW) at Eglin AFB, FL, the Arnold Engineering and Development Center (AEDC) at Arnold AFB, TN and the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) at Edwards AFB.

Budget Activity Justification:  This program element is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Provides resources for sustainment activities required for an inventory of Air Force Material Command (AFMC) T&amp;E facilities.  Facility sustainment includes regularly scheduled adjustments and inspections, preventative maintenance tasks, and emergency response and service calls for minor repairs.  It also includes major repairs of replacment of facility componenets that are expected to occur periodically throughout the life cycle of facilities.  This work includes roof replacement, refinishing of wall surfaces, repairing and replacement of hearing and cooling systems, replacing tile and carpeting, and similar work.  Other tasks associated with facilities operations (such as custodial services, grass cutting, and landscaping, waste disposal, and the provision of central utilities) are not included.  These sustainment funds support the following Air Force facilities:  46th Test Group (TG) at Holloman AFB, NM, the 46th Test Wing (TW) at Eglin AFB, FL, the Arnold Engineering and Development Center (AEDC) at Arnold AFB, TN, and the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) at Edwards AFB.

Budget Activity Justification:  This program element in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, because it funds the sustainment of the institutional test infrastructure at the Air force test activities which are included in the Department of Defense (DoD) Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provides resources for sustainment activities required for an inventory of Air Force Material Command (AFMC) T&amp;E facilities.  Facility sustainment includes regularly scheduled adjustments and inspections, preventative maintenance tasks, and emergency response and service calls for minor repairs.  It also includes major repairs of replacment of facility componenets that are expected to occur periodically throughout the life cycle of facilities.  This work includes roof replacement, refinishing of wall surfaces, repairing and replacement of hearing and cooling systems, replacing tile and carpeting, and similar work.  Other tasks associated with facilities operations (such as custodial services, grass cutting, and landscaping, waste disposal, and the provision of central utilities) are not included.  These sustainment funds support the following Air Force facilities:  46th Test Group (TG) at Holloman AFB, NM, the 46th Test Wing (TW) at Eglin AFB, FL, the Arnold Engineering and Development Center (AEDC) at Arnold AFB, TN, and the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) at Edwards AFB.

Budget Activity Justification:  This program element in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, because it funds the sustainment of the institutional test infrastructure at the Air force test activities which are included in the Department of Defense (DoD) Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Multi-Service System Engineering Team (MSSET) serves as a joint acquisition effort to build the framework for future work towards achieving near-term Joint Track Management Capability (JTMC) and long-term Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense (JIAMD) capabilities.  

The MSSET will perform systems engineering activities in collaboration with the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Services, Joint Staff, and OSD. The MSSET will review Service Program of Record (PoRs) and MDA systems based upon operationally validated JIAMD requirements and Prioritized Capabilities List (PCL) needs. It will then recommend engineering changes (e.g., Interface Control Documents (ICDs), common standards, and/or specifications) that can provide incremental improvements in Joint war fighting capability, as described in the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-validated Joint IAMD operational requirements, information exchange requirements, as well as other war fighter-approved requirements.  The MSSET scope will encompass the collaborative efforts to provide the war fighter the ability to effectively and efficiently utilize all available resources to counter the complete air, cruise missile, and ballistic missile threats. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

The objective of the MSSET is to recommend incremental improvements in fielded capabilities within the construct of Service and MDA PoRs.  The following list includes several, priority Family of Systems (FOS) engineering tasks. These tasks go beyond the expected scope of engineering efforts conducted by an individual Service and MDA in their POR for IAMD:

• Conduct the engineering activity to develop coordinated Joint IAMD Department of Defense (DoD) Architecture Framework (DODAF) products (e.g., System Views) while maintaining and deriving common standards.
• Develop, recommend, and document as necessary overarching JIAMD technical/performance requirements.
• Perform Joint IAMD FOS engineering and related analyses, and develop recommendations for incrementally implementing Joint IAMD capabilities. 
• Develop Joint IAMD FOS engineering and Capability Validation Plans and strategies.
• Recommend updates to the Joint Staff IAMD Operational Views as necessary.
• Ensure that Joint engineering tasks are conducted in a logical sequence and in a timely manner to provide the Services and MDA the most benefit and adequate time to consider engineering recommendations derived by the MSSET.
• JPEO act in the role of Secretariat for the AMD Integration Standing-Committee to Missile Defense Executive Board (MDEB).

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation. </r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Multi-Service System Engineering Team (MSSET) serves as a joint acquisition effort to build the framework for future work towards achieving near-term Joint Track Management Capability (JTMC) and long-term Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense (JIAMD) capabilities.  

The MSSET will perform systems engineering activities in collaboration with the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Services, Joint Staff, and OSD. The MSSET will review Service Program of Record (PoRs) and MDA systems based upon operationally validated JIAMD requirements and Prioritized Capabilities List (PCL) needs. It will then recommend engineering changes (e.g., Interface Control Documents (ICDs), common standards, and/or specifications) that can provide incremental improvements in Joint war fighting capability, as described in the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-validated Joint IAMD operational requirements, information exchange requirements, as well as other war fighter-approved requirements.  The MSSET scope will encompass the collaborative efforts to provide the war fighter the ability to effectively and efficiently utilize all available resources to counter the complete air, cruise missile, and ballistic missile threats. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

The objective of the MSSET is to recommend incremental improvements in fielded capabilities within the construct of Service and MDA PoRs.  The following list includes several, priority Family of Systems (FOS) engineering tasks. These tasks go beyond the expected scope of engineering efforts conducted by an individual Service and MDA in their POR for IAMD:

• Conduct the engineering activity to develop coordinated Joint IAMD Department of Defense (DoD) Architecture Framework (DODAF) products (e.g., System Views) while maintaining and deriving common standards.
• Develop, recommend, and document as necessary overarching JIAMD technical/performance requirements.
• Perform Joint IAMD FOS engineering and related analyses, and develop recommendations for incrementally implementing Joint IAMD capabilities. 
• Develop Joint IAMD FOS engineering and Capability Validation Plans and strategies.
• Recommend updates to the Joint Staff IAMD Operational Views as necessary.
• Ensure that Joint engineering tasks are conducted in a logical sequence and in a timely manner to provide the Services and MDA the most benefit and adequate time to consider engineering recommendations derived by the MSSET.
• JPEO act in the role of Secretariat for the AMD Integration Standing-Committee to Missile Defense Executive Board (MDEB).

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation. </r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementNote>FY12-17 funds from PE 0305173F, Space Test Center/Range Consolidation SMC Civilian Pay effort were transferred to this program element in order to isolate the acquisition civilian workforce civilian pay at Space and Missile Systems Center into its own project.  In the FY12 PB submission, the Air Force forecast this funding would move within Project 0305173F to a new project.  However, subsequent to the FY12 PB submission, the Air Force established the current Program Element, 0606392F, for more accurate tracking of the funds.

Funds requested for civilian pay within project 0305173F in FY12 PB totalled $194.596M.  Due to a Congressional Directed Reduction of $7.5M, the final FY12 amount transferred to this new project for execution in FY12 was $187.096M.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) equips US and allied forces with operational space and missile systems, launch systems, and command and control infrastructure in support of global military and national security operations.  SMC operates with over 6,300 people and an annual budget exceeding $8B providing joint warfighters navigation, communication, weather, warning, force application, and space control capabilities.  Through FY11, SMC acquisition workforce civilian personnel costs were funded in O&amp;M and Section 852 accounts.  Beginning in FY12--as an AF pilot initiative--SMC acquisition workforce civilian personnel funding was transferred to RDT&amp;E, AF, and managed within PE 0305173F. The FY13 program includes funding for approximately 1,800 SMC personnel including all existing acquisition workforce civilian personnel, continued contractor to civilian conversions and Acquisition Improvement Program hiring.  The funding does not include the costs for the base operating support civilian personnel supporting the Los Angeles AFB air base group. Funding SMC civilian payroll from the RDT&amp;E appropriation provides program managers the flexibility to hire additional civilian personnel with program dollars versus additional contractors in concert with Acquisition Workforce Improvement Initiatives.  Funds were requested for this effort in FY2012 under PE 0305173F.

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectNote>FY12-17 funds from PE 0305173F, Space Test Center/Range Consolidation SMC Civilian Pay effort were transferred to this program element in order to isolate the acquisition civilian workforce civilian pay at Space and Missile Systems Center into its own project.  In the FY12 PB submission, the Air Force forecast this funding would move within Project 0305173F to a new project.  However, subsequent to the FY12 PB submission, the Air Force established the current Program Element, 0606392F, for more accurate tracking of the funds.

Funds requested for civilian pay within project 0305173F in FY12 PB totalled $194.596M.  Due to a Congressional Directed Reduction of $7.5M, the final FY12 amount transferred to this new project for execution in FY12 was $187.096M.</r2:ProjectNote>
                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) equips US and allied forces with operational space and missile systems, launch systems, and command and control infrastructure in support of global military and national security operations.  SMC operates with over 6,300 people and an annual budget exceeding $8B providing joint warfighters navigation, communication, weather, warning, force application, and space control capabilities.  Through FY11, SMC acquisition workforce civilian personnel costs were funded in O&amp;M and Section 852 accounts.  Beginning in FY12--as an AF pilot initiative--SMC acquisition workforce civilian personnel funding was transferred to RDT&amp;E, AF, and managed within PE 0305173F. The FY13 program includes funding for approximately 1,800 SMC personnel including all existing acquisition workforce civilian personnel, continued contractor to civilian conversions and Acquisition Improvement Program hiring.  The funding does not include the costs for the base operating support civilian personnel supporting the Los Angeles AFB air base group. Funding SMC civilian payroll from the RDT&amp;E appropriation provides program managers the flexibility to hire additional civilian personnel with program dollars versus additional contractors in concert with Acquisition Workforce Improvement Initiatives.  Funds were requested for this effort in FY2012 under PE 0305173F.

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The program funds efforts to meet the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) (Public Law 101-510, Title XII), as well as Congressional and SECDEF mandates to provide acquisition and engineering process research and cost estimating, systems integration modeling and architectural analysis, information technology infrastructure development, and technical workforce.  Funding also provides the framework for Air Force business and acquisition transformation in developing capabilities-based architectures, re-engineering and enabling technologies, integrating robust systems engineering into early acquisition processes, and developing and managing a larger, more relevant technical workforce with the expertise to uniformly implement OSD and Air Force engineering guidance and policies. Leveraging the Defense Acquisition Performance Assessment, restores stability in Air Force acquisition systems by integrating major processes to reverse trends toward unpredictable program cost, schedule, and performance to facilitate quick response to urgent operational needs from across the entire spectrum of potential conflicts. Efforts include:
- Increasing technical and analytical support through training development; independent cost estimating and assessment to help analyze cost/risk growth and create defendable risk analyses for cost, schedule, and technical risks; information technology infrastructure development; and economic, statistical, and engineering analyses of acquisition programs
- Initiating performance measures for capability-based planning constructs, aligning relevant science and technology areas with operational requirements to include systems integration modeling and architecture analysis
- Increasing activities to recruit, develop, and manage the technical workforce, enhancing business and engineering processes to develop leaders to manage the acquisition and engineering transformation and interface with the academic community
- Transforming acquisition review processes to re-establish clean lines of responsibility, authority, and accountability at appropriate levels
- Exploring methods to operate a materiel solution development process that is responsive to COCOM capability needs, aligned with the OSD Joint Task Assignment Process 
- Develop and implement a services-oriented acquisition business systems environment to deliver capabilities for the acquisition professional that support acquisition transformation.  This effort consists of three components (1) establishing a foundational integrated environment, (2) leveraging the existing technologies and data to standardize access and use, and (3) investing in specific capabilities that enhance process transformation and are interoperable within the overall environment.
- The foundational integrated environment supports the portfolio of acquisition business systems hardware and software, and implements standards for data management and service-oriented design methodology to facilitate efficiency and interoperability by:
   -- Exposing core business services currently existing in multiple tools and subsequently retiring duplicative capabilities
   -- Reducing training on multiple acquisitions systems by providing all core functionality through a single common interface
   -- Consolidating infrastructure to reduce hosting and infrastructure sustainment costs.
- Existing technologies and data are leveraged to standardize on proven capabilities, and to make existing data stores more accessible and useful across the acquisition domain roles.
- Focused investments in specific capabilities address critical gaps supporting the efficient operation of the Acquisition Domain, in areas such as:
   -- Conducting program management and oversight
   -- Conducting program resources management
   -- Planning and executing on-time acquisition milestone readiness
   -- Preparing Purchase Requisitions and Contract Orders
   -- Managing contract writing 
   -- Adopting commercial enterprise concept of Product Lifecycle Management for the production of traceable requirements 
   -- Planning and execution of technology development and transition
   -- Standardizing risk management 
   -- Managing access to scientific and technical information
   -- Increasing industrial base decision-support information.
These integrated capabilities will provide OSD and AF acquisition leadership insights needed to effectively manage a complex portfolio of acquisition programs through more timely and reliable access to authoritative acquisition data.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The program funds efforts to meet the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) (Public Law 101-510, Title XII), as well as Congressional and SECDEF mandates to provide acquisition and engineering process research and cost estimating, systems integration modeling and architectural analysis, information technology infrastructure development, and technical workforce.  Funding also provides the framework for Air Force business and acquisition transformation in developing capabilities-based architectures, re-engineering and enabling technologies, integrating robust systems engineering into early acquisition processes, and developing and managing a larger, more relevant technical workforce with the expertise to uniformly implement OSD and Air Force engineering guidance and policies. Leveraging the Defense Acquisition Performance Assessment, restores stability in Air Force acquisition systems by integrating major processes to reverse trends toward unpredictable program cost, schedule, and performance to facilitate quick response to urgent operational needs from across the entire spectrum of potential conflicts. Efforts include:
- Increasing technical and analytical support through training development; independent cost estimating and assessment to help analyze cost/risk growth and create defendable risk analyses for cost, schedule, and technical risks; information technology infrastructure development; and economic, statistical, and engineering analyses of acquisition programs
- Initiating performance measures for capability-based planning constructs, aligning relevant science and technology areas with operational requirements to include systems integration modeling and architecture analysis
- Increasing activities to recruit, develop, and manage the technical workforce, enhancing business and engineering processes to develop leaders to manage the acquisition and engineering transformation and interface with the academic community
- Transforming acquisition review processes to re-establish clean lines of responsibility, authority, and accountability at appropriate levels
- Exploring methods to operate a materiel solution development process that is responsive to COCOM capability needs, aligned with the OSD Joint Task Assignment Process 
- Develop and implement a services-oriented acquisition business systems environment to deliver capabilities for the acquisition professional that support acquisition transformation.  This effort consists of three components (1) establishing a foundational integrated environment, (2) leveraging the existing technologies and data to standardize access and use, and (3) investing in specific capabilities that enhance process transformation and are interoperable within the overall environment.
- The foundational integrated environment supports the portfolio of acquisition business systems hardware and software, and implements standards for data management and service-oriented design methodology to facilitate efficiency and interoperability by:
   -- Exposing core business services currently existing in multiple tools and subsequently retiring duplicative capabilities
   -- Reducing training on multiple acquisitions systems by providing all core functionality through a single common interface
   -- Consolidating infrastructure to reduce hosting and infrastructure sustainment costs.
- Existing technologies and data are leveraged to standardize on proven capabilities, and to make existing data stores more accessible and useful across the acquisition domain roles.
- Focused investments in specific capabilities address critical gaps supporting the efficient operation of the Acquisition Domain, in areas such as:
   -- Conducting program management and oversight
   -- Conducting program resources management
   -- Planning and executing on-time acquisition milestone readiness
   -- Preparing Purchase Requisitions and Contract Orders
   -- Managing contract writing 
   -- Adopting commercial enterprise concept of Product Lifecycle Management for the production of traceable requirements 
   -- Planning and execution of technology development and transition
   -- Standardizing risk management 
   -- Managing access to scientific and technical information
   -- Increasing industrial base decision-support information.
These integrated capabilities will provide OSD and AF acquisition leadership insights needed to effectively manage a complex portfolio of acquisition programs through more timely and reliable access to authoritative acquisition data.

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The program funds efforts to meet the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) (Public Law 101-510, Title XII), as well as Congressional and SECDEF mandates to provide acquisition and engineering process research and cost estimating, systems integration modeling and architectural analysis, information technology infrastructure development, and technical workforce.  Funding also provides the framework for Air Force business and acquisition transformation in developing capabilities-based architectures, re-engineering and enabling technologies, integrating robust systems engineering into early acquisition processes, and developing and managing a larger, more relevant technical workforce with the expertise to uniformly implement OSD and Air Force engineering guidance and policies. Leveraging the Defense Acquisition Performance Assessment, restores stability in Air Force acquisition systems by integrating major processes to reverse trends toward unpredictable program cost, schedule, and performance to facilitate quick response to urgent operational needs from across the entire spectrum of potential conflicts. Efforts include:
- Increasing technical and analytical support through training development; independent cost estimating and assessment to help analyze cost/risk growth and create defendable risk analyses for cost, schedule, and technical risks; information technology infrastructure development; and economic, statistical, and engineering analyses of acquisition programs
- Initiating performance measures for capability-based planning constructs, aligning relevant science and technology areas with operational requirements to include systems integration modeling and architecture analysis
- Increasing activities to recruit, develop, and manage the technical workforce, enhancing business and engineering processes to develop leaders to manage the acquisition and engineering transformation and interface with the academic community
- Transforming acquisition review processes to re-establish clean lines of responsibility, authority, and accountability at appropriate levels
- Exploring methods to operate a materiel solution development process that is responsive to COCOM capability needs, aligned with the OSD Joint Task Assignment Process 
- Develop and implement a services-oriented acquisition business systems environment to deliver capabilities for the acquisition professional that support acquisition transformation.  This effort consists of three components (1) establishing a foundational integrated environment, (2) leveraging the existing technologies and data to standardize access and use, and (3) investing in specific capabilities that enhance process transformation and are interoperable within the overall environment.
- The foundational integrated environment supports the portfolio of acquisition business systems hardware and software, and implements standards for data management and service-oriented design methodology to facilitate efficiency and interoperability by:
   -- Exposing core business services currently existing in multiple tools and subsequently retiring duplicative capabilities
   -- Reducing training on multiple acquisitions systems by providing all core functionality through a single common interface
   -- Consolidating infrastructure to reduce hosting and infrastructure sustainment costs.
- Existing technologies and data are leveraged to standardize on proven capabilities, and to make existing data stores more accessible and useful across the acquisition domain roles.
- Focused investments in specific capabilities address critical gaps supporting the efficient operation of the Acquisition Domain, in areas such as:
   -- Conducting program management and oversight
   -- Conducting program resources management
   -- Planning and executing on-time acquisition milestone readiness
   -- Preparing Purchase Requisitions and Contract Orders
   -- Managing contract writing 
   -- Adopting commercial enterprise concept of Product Lifecycle Management for the production of traceable requirements 
   -- Planning and execution of technology development and transition
   -- Standardizing risk management 
   -- Managing access to scientific and technical information
   -- Increasing industrial base decision-support information.
These integrated capabilities will provide OSD and AF acquisition leadership insights needed to effectively manage a complex portfolio of acquisition programs through more timely and reliable access to authoritative acquisition data.

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.

                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) is a service organization that provides on demand state-of-the-art electronic forensic services and cyber investigative and operational support to the Department of Defense (DoD).  DC3 also provides leadership as a DoD center of excellence in processing an analyzing digital evidence.  It provides professional special investigative services for the protection of DoD people, investigations, operations, material and critical infrastructures worldwide.  The DC3's objective is to support and address the proliferation of cyber crimes within or directed at the DoD.  Within DC3, the DoD Cyber Crime Institute (DCCI) develops the foundation for accepted standards and practices based on valid research, science, and law with innovative ideas and methods.  It serves as a resource for sound research to produce unique tools and procedures for the DoD law enforcement, counter terrorism, counterintelligence, force protection, information assurance, information operations and war fighting communities.  It strives to develop national electronic forensics standards, cyber investigative tools and techniques, effective plans, policies and procedures and implement a knowledge management system.  It provides the DoD community with analytical services and produces relevant intelligence reports, criminal intelligence reports and cyber investigation trend analyses.  It focuses on new issues facing the DoD critical infrastructure protection efforts and those facing the cyber investigative discipline.  DC3 must continue to expand its capabilities and continue to develop effective plans, policies, and procedures for addressing cybercrime and electronic forensic needs in DoD both now and in the future.  The primary goal is to ensure the DoD has the ability to successfully perform its mission of electronic media processing and analysis in the future.  Without funding, critical projects will be terminated.  The DoD's ability to process digital evidence in a future environment of increasing case loads that have a large amount of data that is also hidden by sophisticated techniques will be greatly degraded.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) is a service organization that provides on demand state-of-the-art electronic forensic services and cyber investigative and operational support to the Department of Defense (DoD).  DC3 also provides leadership as a DoD center of excellence in processing an analyzing digital evidence.  It provides professional special investigative services for the protection of DoD people, investigations, operations, material and critical infrastructures worldwide.  The DC3's objective is to support and address the proliferation of cyber crimes within or directed at the DoD.  Within DC3, the DoD Cyber Crime Institute (DCCI) develops the foundation for accepted standards and practices based on valid research, science, and law with innovative ideas and methods.  It serves as a resource for sound research to produce unique tools and procedures for the DoD law enforcement, counter terrorism, counterintelligence, force protection, information assurance, information operations and war fighting communities.  It strives to develop national electronic forensics standards, cyber investigative tools and techniques, effective plans, policies and procedures and implement a knowledge management system.  It provides the DoD community with analytical services and produces relevant intelligence reports, criminal intelligence reports and cyber investigation trend analyses.  It focuses on new issues facing the DoD critical infrastructure protection efforts and those facing the cyber investigative discipline.  DC3 must continue to expand its capabilities and continue to develop effective plans, policies, and procedures for addressing cybercrime and electronic forensic needs in DoD both now and in the future.  The primary goal is to ensure the DoD has the ability to successfully perform its mission of electronic media processing and analysis in the future.  Without funding, critical projects will be terminated.  The DoD's ability to process digital evidence in a future environment of increasing case loads that have a large amount of data that is also hidden by sophisticated techniques will be greatly degraded.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>This program element is the only source of USAF funds to identify, develop, process, negotiate, implement, and manage IA opportunities for international armaments cooperation to (a) deploy and support common or interoperable equipment with our allies; (b) leverage USAF resources with our allies through cost sharing and economies of scale; and (c) exploit the best US and allied technologies for equipping coalition forces and supporting interoperability.  We obtain these benefits only after IAC opportunities are identified, explored, assessed, developed and IAs are negotiated and concluded. This PE provides funds to execute up-front IAC responsibilities, realize cooperative opportunities, assess allied technologies and generate sound, cost-effective cooperative programs between the USAF and our international partners.  Once these initiatives, programs, and projects are concluded IAs they are transferred to the appropriate technology or systems program office and are then funded by the program office.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
