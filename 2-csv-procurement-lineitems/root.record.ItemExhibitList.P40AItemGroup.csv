These integrated computers and networks provide CAPE analysts with the ability to support mission functions such as:  Program Review support, Program Objective Memorandum (POM) coordination, the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) coordination, and the collection, maintenance, and analysis of Defense Cost and Resource Center (DCARC) data.  In addition, these sophisticated computer tools allow CAPE analysts to conduct research, studies, technical analyses, and collaborative studies within CAPE and with other DoD agencies, and provide analysts with the flexibility of running simulation models to produce valid analyses.Explanation of FY 2016 to FY 2017:  In prior years, CAPE reduced its Long Range Planning Procurement program by as much as 50% throughout the FYDP.  In FY 2017 CAPE makes an additional program reduction in accordance with planned efficiency efforts.  Also, CAPE will consider additional program reductions throughout the FYDP.   Because of migration to an Enterprise solution as well as recent modernization activities, prudent planning, and effective requirements analysis in previous years, CAPE continues to align procurement expenditures for maximum efficiency in order to fund higher priority requirements in the Department.","","43abd7d2317a7e30efa9430d48c07e79cc1780e8-1-ab07f4373e2c2b0a3517106cd5a52777ae42a943","43abd7d2317a7e30efa9430d48c07e79cc1780e8","root","43abd7d2317a7e30efa9430d48c07e79cc1780e8-9c9248189d9b0b6523f5de345dfb518e069af44e"

Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras. Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states, The United States shall begin budgeting no later than Fiscal Year 2014 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors.(U) Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, frequently unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured. In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock.This camera replacement program will replace the wet film cameras with modern, digital cameras. This program will result in modern, digital cameras with higher reliability, maintainability and cost effectiveness.

These activities reduce emission of hazardous materials to air, land, and water, while reducing the cost to the Air Force as facility owner, as a customer for products manufactured in the plants, and through process improvements that can be transitioned to Air Force users.  The first category covers the demonstration, validation, and procurement of improved equipment and services provided by the Air Force as facility owner and direct manager of common areas and services at these facilities. These activities meet Air Force pollution prevention goals and reduce the AF ownership cost of the facilities and weapon systems (WS).  They include typical landlord initiatives such as recovery/recycling equipment, energy conservation initiatives, and pollution prevention opportunity assessments. The second category of expenditure invests in the demonstration and validation of improved manufacturing processes for plant contractors that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and WS life cycle costs. These are usually cost-sharing initiatives, undertaken with the contractor because the government has required the use of hazardous materials through specifications, standards, drawing, contracts, and technical orders. In addition, the process improvements innovated at the plants often can be transitioned to Air Force depots, resulting in reduced operation & maintenance costs, reduced depot flow time, and increases asset availability. This budget activity supports Air Force goals under the Pollution Prevention Act, Executive Orders 13423 and 13514, the AF/CV and SAF/IE Pollution Prevention Policy, the USD(AT&L) hexavalent chromium reduction policy, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

Residual FY13 funding will be held for the FY14 option of the follow-on contract to achieve EOQ.","This acquisition was initially competed under a full and open competition for priced production lots 1-5.  It also included a Production Price Commitment Curve (PPCC) for the remaining quantities (production lots 6-9).  Contractor notified the government that it cannot meet the PPCC for the remaining productions lots (6-9).  Upon receipt of this notification, the JPF Program Office (JPO) issued a sources sought synopsis to examine the market for alternate qualified sources of supply, but found that no other source was available without unacceptable delay and substantial duplicative cost; therefore the contract was continued with the incumbent. The contract buy authority of 81,607 was reached during Option 7 (FY2010 funding).  A Justification and Approval (J&A) document was signed increasing the contract buy authority, allowing continued procurement under the existing contract.A full and open competition was conducted in FY2010/FY2011; however, the only offer received was from the incumbent.  The follow-on contract with incumbent will be awarded in FY2013 for a Basic plus 2 options.  Two separate lines were used on the P-5A to represent FY2011 since part of the FY2011 funding was obligated on the current JPF contract and the recently received $20M in FY2011 OCO funding will be obligated on the JPF follow-on contract. FY2011 OCO funding is being paired with FY2012 and FY2013 funding in order to achieve a reasonable unit cost over a total buy of 14,758 fuzes.Any residual FY2013 funding will be held for the FY2014 option of the follow-on contract to achieve EOQ.","53a100c2d4afcc5b21a155b305ed6e1ea6629c69-1-f9c53b3e9411db36b268f35547e7495eb5bf4509","53a100c2d4afcc5b21a155b305ed6e1ea6629c69","root","53a100c2d4afcc5b21a155b305ed6e1ea6629c69-8a29fde408b615eb2a0cb29e1dc4eea60c90f1a8"

Our program team is requesting travel funds to allow USAF representation at TACOM led PMR discussions. In addition to attending the PMR, our team will have the opportunity to have face-to-face discussions with our TACOM counterparts to entertain items not on the PMR agenda. Our program manager will be able to discuss programmatic issues and way head for the M-Series program as TACOM redirects its focus toward acquisition of the JLTV. Our USAF engineer will be able to meet with the engineering community to pose technical questions and concerns as well as to stay in tune with the latest M-Series issues and technological advancements. Our USAF item manager will also be able to compare spreadsheets with TACOM budget analysts and map way head for HMMWV and OGPK production. Impact if PMA is not funded: TACOM has informed our team that the US ARMY is wrapping up their HMMWV production. The USAF still has multiple HMMWV productions orders on contract that will need USAF representation at PMRs as TACOM redirects its focus.In order to provide USAF programmatic/technical representation at subject PMRs, the WR-ALC M-Series program team has dialed in to several M-Series PMR teleconferences. Unfortunately, the poor telecommunication network setup prevents our team from clearly hearing the discussions held by all parties and seeing visual aids made only available to those in physical attendance. USAF directed questions that could have been answered at the PMR have to be entertained after the PMR via email or PMR minutes. At times, this causes delays in production and resolving issues such as integrating the USAF OGPK production and delivery schedule with the USAF HMMWV production schedule.","","24b1b5fa08478936310bae65759f66da3e290516-0-940d48c14c7b539de5f1261d88cc0371c225e256","24b1b5fa08478936310bae65759f66da3e290516","root","24b1b5fa08478936310bae65759f66da3e290516-d8f34b7add59005c91a580f22682839cf345b026"

It also included a Production Price Commitment Curve (PPCC) for the remaining quantities (production lots 6-9).  Contractor notified the government that it cannot meet the PPCC for the remaining productions lots (6-9).  Upon receipt of this notification, the JPF Program Office (JPO) issued a sources sought synopsis to examine the market for alternate qualified sources of supply, but found that no other source was available without unacceptable delay and substantial duplicative cost; therefore the contract was continued with the incumbent. The contract buy authority of 81,607 was reached during Option 7 (FY2010 funding).  A Justification and Approval (J&A) document was signed increasing the contract buy authority, allowing continued procurement under the existing contract.A full and open competition was conducted in FY2010/FY2011; however, the only offer received was from the incumbent.  The follow-on contract with incumbent will be awarded in FY2013 for a Basic plus 2 options.

"Air Expendable Countermeasures","(a) Unit costs for hardware in FY13 have been revised from PB-13 and reflect either escalated actual unit cost in FY12 or actual pricing in contract options.  The new quantities generated by these revised unit costs still result in inventory levels that are below those of the Non-nuclear Ordnance Requirement (NNOR).     (b) Deliveries funded by different fiscal year appropriations occasionally overlap (P21 Delevery Schedule) to ensure inventory goals are met without exceeding maximum production rates.","root.record.ItemExhibitList.P40AItemGroup.CategoryList-be94519ea383c94df6cd8dbf385cbe5fafa96747-0-f1ddbc73beee9257fb8a1f02e83f39856f78c75a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","be94519ea383c94df6cd8dbf385cbe5fafa96747-0-e8e0ea48f58b22294abbec492d34ea4663923deb","be94519ea383c94df6cd8dbf385cbe5fafa96747","root","be94519ea383c94df6cd8dbf385cbe5fafa96747-09fcf32ddd5178a97dae7d721bf8a79c21316fc5"

The M-Series program office representatives will also be afforded the opportunity to entertain questions and concerns posed by the users. Impact if PMA is not funded: The MAJCOMs and users will not gain complete, up-to-date M-Series program insight. Any concerns and questions that could potentially affect all USAF users will have to be communicated via email or phone. This may lead to a communication gap and stakeholders not gaining pertinent information.  Items of interest may be elevated by users and MAJCOMs that could have been resolved at the VTAC.Purpose: M-Series Program Management Reviews (PMRs) are held on a quarterly basis to discuss the future of the M-Series program, production schedules, as well as current programmatic/technical issues and impacts. Our program team is requesting travel funds to allow USAF representation at TACOM led PMR discussions. In addition to attending the PMR, our team will have the opportunity to have face-to-face discussions with our TACOM counterparts to entertain items not on the PMR agenda. Our program manager will be able to discuss programmatic issues. Our USAF engineer will be able to meet with the engineering community to pose technical questions and concerns as well as to stay in tune with the latest M-Series issues and technological advancements. Our USAF item manager will also be able to compare spreadsheets with TACOM budget analysts and map way head for future procurements.Impact if PMA is not funded: In order to provide USAF programmatic/technical representation at subject PMRs, the WR-ALC M-Series program team has dialed in to several M-Series PMR teleconferences. Unfortunately, the poor telecommunication network setup prevents our team from clearly hearing the discussions held by all parties and seeing visual aids made only available to those in physical attendance. USAF directed questions that could have been answered at the PMR have to be entertained after the PMR via email or PMR minutes. At times, this causes delays in production and resolving issues with the users in the field.Purpose: The Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Conference is hosted annually to enhance the security of the United States by promoting communications and interaction between the defense industry, government and military in the area of military specific automotive activities. Research, design, development, test and production of advanced automotive technology are presented at the conference. The presented information and open discussions are valuable to program managers and engineers. Due to the mass attendance of multi-services, it is critical that the USAF M-Series program office has programmatic/technical representatives at the conference to address issues and capability requirements, as well as deter users from committing the USAF to acquisition of unapproved products and/or services being offered by the defense industry.Impact if PMA is not funded: There will be zero USAF Tactical Wheeled Vehicle program office representation to address USAF specific issues and capability requirements. The program office will be unaware of the latest technological advancements and the potential future paths other military services may take. Of particular interest would be the US Army which maintains majority of the tactical wheeled vehicle program acquisition and engineering authority. USAF users may unintentionally commit the USAF to acquisition of unapproved products and/or services offered by the defense industry.","","e5cbc60c7fe64ef9b8c7b39858175873248ddd9f-0-68a0bcda75d1f72afa4d63f3cefeee1cb4a3f8c2","e5cbc60c7fe64ef9b8c7b39858175873248ddd9f","root","e5cbc60c7fe64ef9b8c7b39858175873248ddd9f-3f0afd37e32d44b10e7137455c27d4d5ad9ea6cc"

The Air Mobility Command (AMC) Airlift and Air Refueling Mission Area Plans identified a deficiency in the ability to protect MAF aircraft from hostilities during combat operations.  To enhance mission safety during these combat operations, it is critical to provide aircrews with timely and essential off-board information.  Enabling real-time information in the cockpit allows mission adjustments in response to rapidly changing combat conditions while in-flight.  The airborne broadcast intelligence (ABI) and combat track II (CTII) systems provide real-time intelligence, situational awareness (national/theater intelligence and displays air/land/blue water threats), beyond line-of-sight C2 data, and secure text messaging, which enable aircrews to receive updated threat and mission information.  To limit system implementation costs, ABI/CTII are roll-on/roll-off systems enabling immediate employment on all MAF aircraft.  Without real-time information and C2 communications in the cockpit, MAF aircraft will be forced to continue to operate without secure access to mission critical beyond line-of-sight C2 and situational/threat awareness leaving them vulnerable to enemy threats and hostile actions.  These systems are interchangeable between all MAF aircraft.","","f68c2f98af66f08845b4f32407c0e940823751a9-3-08a075d9e1ceb689342dfa4bc0c43689f080a2be","f68c2f98af66f08845b4f32407c0e940823751a9","root","f68c2f98af66f08845b4f32407c0e940823751a9-cd85f74269de8f402a1169a410b85156230d5cfc"

The RQ-4A is an imagery-intelligence (IMINT) RPA designed to employ 2000 pounds of payload. The RQ-4A has one configuration known as the Block 10. The Block 10 employs an IMINT system comprised of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor and an electro-optical (EO)/infrared (IR) sensor. These three sensors are called the integrated sensor suite (ISS). The RQ-4B RPA is designed to employ 3000 pounds of payload and enable multi-intelligence (multi-INT)collecting. The RQ-4B has three configurations: Block 20, Block 30, and Block 40. The Block 20 employs upgraded SAR and EO/IR sensors known as the enhanced ISS (EISS) in an IMINT only configuration. The Block 30 employs the same EISS sensors as the Block 20 and also integrates a wide spectrum signals intelligence (SIGINT) sensor suite simultaneously to be used as a multi-INT platform. The Block 40 will only integrate the multi-platform radar technology insertion program (MP-RTIP) radar sensor. The user will ultimately determine the optimal quantities and payloads for each aircraft configuration based on operational requirements. The ground station (GS) includes the mission control element (MCE) and the launch and recovery element (LRE). The support segment includes aerospace ground equipment, tech orders, spares, support equipment, and training to enable the Global Hawk System.This program has associated Research Development Test and Evaluation funding in PE 0305220F and PE 0304260F.No funding requested for FY14.","","f68c2f98af66f08845b4f32407c0e940823751a9-10-9406343538ad647881100ce08618e2d67ec5145d","f68c2f98af66f08845b4f32407c0e940823751a9","root","f68c2f98af66f08845b4f32407c0e940823751a9-cd85f74269de8f402a1169a410b85156230d5cfc"

Both categories not only reduce emission of hazardous materials to air, land, and water, they also reduce cost to the Air Force as facility owner, as buyer of products manufactured in the plants, and through process improvements that can be transitioned to Air Force users.  The first category covers the demonstration, validation, and procurement of improved equipment and services provided by the Air Force as facility owner and direct manager of common areas and services at these facilities.  These activities meet Air Force pollution prevention goals and reduce the AF ownership cost of the facilities.  They include typical landlord initiatives such as recovery/recycling equipment, energy conservation initiatives, and pollution prevention opportunity assessments.  The second category of expenditure invests in the demonstration and validation of improved manufacturing processes for plant contractors that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and costs.  These are usually cost-sharing initiatives, undertaken with the contractor because the government has required the use of hazardous materials through specifications, standards, drawing, contracts, and technical orders.  These investments over time can reduce the cost to the Air Force of the products produced in the plants.  In addition, the process improvements innovated at the plants often can be transitioned to Air Force depots, resulting in reduced maintenance costs, reduced depot flow time, and increases asset availability.  This budget activity supports Air Force goals under the Pollution Prevention Act, Executive Orders 13423 and 13514, the AF/CV and SAF/IE Pollution Prevention Policy, the USD(AT&L) hexavalent chromium reduction policy, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.","","f68c2f98af66f08845b4f32407c0e940823751a9-13-c0f1087330c99c9c3c7d692b0410858b28f57b60","f68c2f98af66f08845b4f32407c0e940823751a9","root","f68c2f98af66f08845b4f32407c0e940823751a9-cd85f74269de8f402a1169a410b85156230d5cfc"

"HIMARS","The FY12 GMLRS and RRPRs unit price is based on the Army pricing estimate, based on the planned buy to include the Marine Corps and FMS customers.  The Army is the lead procurement service.  Pricing for each subsequent FY is based on estimated Plot Point Pricing, which reflects a lower unit cost for a larger quantity buy.  Quantities for both services, and potential FMS customers are a best estimate.  In FY13, there is a large procurement of GMLRS to payback the Army for Army rockets expended by the Marine Corps in previous years.  Starting in FY17, the shelf life of some of the current GMLRS inventory begins to expire.  After deducting for AWP procurements which begin in FY15, FY14-FY18 procurements are required to replace some of these expired rockets, as well as the procurement of minimal quantities to maintain the production line.","root.record.ItemExhibitList.P40AItemGroup.CategoryList-ffa9b89f42e0e059df93cd3e79f328e1f11b359f-0-bc037cba0c9da260402c0727fbf37b4d1794b4e8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ffa9b89f42e0e059df93cd3e79f328e1f11b359f-0-58b23f7af2cba78654ee9ea4d21e0041ef0c717d","ffa9b89f42e0e059df93cd3e79f328e1f11b359f","root","ffa9b89f42e0e059df93cd3e79f328e1f11b359f-81d145959b17cf13a956769eb7d3cbf17df84d4b"

These computers and networks integrated together provide CAPE analysts with the ability to support mission functions, such as Program Review, Program Objective Memorandum (POM) coordination, the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP), and collecting, maintaining, and analyzing Defense Cost and Resource Center (DCARC) data.  In addition, these sophisticated computer tools allow CAPE analysts to conduct research, studies, technical analyses, and collaborative studies within CAPE and with other DoD agencies, and provide analysts with the flexibility of running simulation models to produce valid analyses.Explanation of FY14 to FY15:  Beginning in FY15 CAPE will reduce its Long Range Planning Procurement program by as much as 50% annually through the FYDP to realign funds for higher priorities, such as Combat Capabilities, through fiscal year 2019.  Because of migration to an Enterprise solution as well as recent modernization activities, prudent planning, and effective requirements analysis in previous years, CAPE has ensured maximum efficiency of procurement expenditures.  Through recent assessments, CAPE has determined that it can absorb a considerable reduction to its Procurement program through the FYDP to fund higher priority requirements in the Department.","","491affde4c84d8f8803b4aa76f00dfb775bf55d3-1-e66852c1203306756b798b08a7cfe65bd890479a","491affde4c84d8f8803b4aa76f00dfb775bf55d3","root","491affde4c84d8f8803b4aa76f00dfb775bf55d3-2a9491137ad5f0a0d917bdf1e9ff374ae8c1f417"

These activities reduce emission of hazardous materials to air, land, and water, while reducing the cost to the Air Force as facility owner, as a customer for products manufactured in the plants, and through process improvements that can be transitioned to Air Force users.  The first category covers the demonstration, validation, and procurement of improved equipment and services provided by the Air Force as facility owner and direct manager of common areas and services at these facilities. These activities meet Air Force pollution prevention goals and reduce the AF ownership cost of the facilities. They include typical landlord initiatives such as recovery/recycling equipment, energy conservation initiatives, and pollution prevention opportunity assessments. The second category of expenditure invests in the demonstration and validation of improved manufacturing processes for plant contractors that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and costs. These are usually cost-sharing initiatives, undertaken with the contractor because the government has required the use of hazardous materials through specifications, standards, drawing, contracts, and technical orders. These investments over time can reduce the cost to the Air Force of the products produced in the plants. In addition, the process improvements innovated at the plants often can be transitioned to Air Force depots, resulting in reduced maintenance costs, reduced depot flow time, and increases asset availability. This budget activity supports Air Force goals under the Pollution Prevention Act, Executive Orders 13423 and 13514, the AF/CV and SAF/IE Pollution Prevention Policy, the USD(AT&L) hexavalent chromium reduction policy, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

We are completing the system modification necessary for the Procurement Data Standardization (PDS).  DCMA will need to purchase and deploy a Contract Writing/Administration System (CWAS) that can collect and prepopulate Contract PDS data from the DoD system of records by the time PDS goes Department-wide.  The DCMA CWS Contract Writing System (CWAS) that will streamline the Contract Modification process and alert our DoD customers of the modification as well as automate the obligation of funds to that customer's financial recording system in accordance with the Procure-to-Pay Handshake guidance.   This effort will help to reduce system and data redundancy and aid in the consolidation of systems within DCMA's portfolio as well as alleviate the need for two different Contracting system procurements.DCMA's primary focus from FY16 through FY 20 is to invigorate efforts to adjust to the changing environment by creating an agile and flexible learning organization/culture to support future customer programs, initiating and strengthening acquisition processes and optimizing mission execution to support the acquisition enterprise through agile business practices.  We are centered on the reengineering of DCMA's Contract Administration and Line of Service business processes and the toolsets that provide the needed capabilities.  Our goal is to streamline the business processes and consolidate the toolsets that enable those capabilities to reduce operations and sustainment costs for the Department and where applicable for DCMA.  In order to accomplish this goal DCMA will need to invest in the research, purchase, development and deployment of the new capabilities in compliance with DoDI 8115.02.

Unit costs for FY16 are assumed and are subject to change. In FY12, a contract vehicle has been established to procure additional commercial air conditioners as warranted by analysis and need. The COTS large air conditioner will be bought through the GSA contract (Aero Specialties). PMA Justification: Purpose: As part of the contractual requirement, PMA will be used to support quarterly Program Management Reviews (PMRs) to discuss production schedules, as well as current programmatic/technical issues and impacts to the program. PMA will also be used to support all testing required to field a system. The program team is requesting travel funds to allow USAF representation to attend Preliminary Design Reviews, Critical Design Reviews, First Article Testing, Provisioning, Technical Order Verification and conduct technical/program interchange meetings. Impact if PMA not funded: The USAF will not be able to meet the governments contractual requirement that could potentially delay fielding or result in fielding a substandard piece of equipment. If travel is not funded, the Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness will not have government witness and inherent government responsibility to prevent fraud waste and abuse. Provisioning is critical in sustaining a system. If parts are not provisioned correctly and sources identified, failures of small normal replacement items will result in increased downtime. This will cause the warfighter to go directly to the manufacture, bypassing the defense supply system resulting in increased cost per item.","","d91a877abc1cc862b9a8d683a15489bc3fdc68fc-0-edfe9d5a78f30346e1692cf07eca1364216816bb","d91a877abc1cc862b9a8d683a15489bc3fdc68fc","root","d91a877abc1cc862b9a8d683a15489bc3fdc68fc-96d4fb76ac378f0ca39896b1731b1fed4606bd07"

The unit cost fluctuations are driven by varying system configuration requirements  (i.e. equipment type, cost, and quantity) and location of the particular sites. As a result of site-specific requirements, costs are not allocated evenly across all the sites per FY. The budget is scaled to provision the entire ground system with adequate replenishment equipment to mitigate parts obsolescence and availability issues .

Navy operations associated with radioactive materials include operation of nuclear reactors, maintenance on radioactive systems or components, testing of components, research, and medical diagnostic and treatment.  Additionally, radiation survey meters are used to search for, locate and intercept radioactive material, and in responding to casualties involving radioactive materials.  Where radiation survey meters are used to support operations involving radiactive material, they provide real-time information used to control personnel radiation exposure and to identify and control the spread of radioactivity.  When used to search for radioactive material, they provide an extremely reliable method of identifying radioactive material while minimizing the risk to personnel conducting these operations.[M2200 - Dosimetry] Dosimetry consists of radiation sensitive materials that are used for detecting and measuring an individual's exposure to ionizing radiation and to aid in minimizing this exposure.  Dosimetry is required to be worn by personnel who work with sources of radioactivity or by personnel responding to casualties involving radioactivity.  Most dosimeters are small devices that are worn on the belt, on a lanyard around the neck or attached to a shirt.  Some dosimeters provides direct readout enabling the wearer to monitor and control radiation exposure.  Other types of dosimeters must be removed from the wearer to be evaulated in special dosimeter readers that extract the recorded radiation exposure value from the dosimeter.  Radiation exposure measured by dosimetry is recorded in individual medical records when formal tracking of the radiation exposure is required.[M2400 - Other RADIAC] The RADIAC Program fields 70 different families of instruments, consisting of a total of almost 43,000 instruments and 400,000 dosimeters.  Those families that fall into similar functionality have been grouped here into the M2100, M2200, M2500 and M2600 Cost Codes.  This Cost Code consists of instruments that have specialized functions that only they perform, and therefore would require an unmanageable and meaningless number of additional Cost Codes if each were addressed individually.  In the context of the family metaphor used here, these instruments are no less important but are orphans in the sense there are not many of similar functionality that they could be grouped with.This Cost Code also supports replenishment of Ready for Issue (RFI) stocks when instruments in any Cost Code fall below stock levels sufficient to meet quarterly demand.  This Cost Element (Spares) is a Continuing element that varies year-to-year based on emergent requirements and the quantity and unit cost of the item(s) being replenished.[M2500 - Air Sampling Systems] Monitoring for airborne radioactivity is done to detect leaks from nuclear reactors or associated systems to ensure that radioactivity is not inadvertently released to the environment from these operations.  Additionlly, monitoring for airborne radioactivity is performed during maintenance on radioactive components or during events that might cause radioactivity to be released to the air.  Monitoring for airborne radioactivity is normally done by drawing air across filter paper to collect airborne radioactive particles.  This filter paper is then evaluated by radiation detectors and the concentration of airborne radioactivity calculated.  The types of airborne radioactivity monitoring systems include fixed systems and portable systems.Fixed systems sample air from pre-determined locations and normally include built in radiation detectors for determining the airborne radioactivity concentration.  Portable systems can be used to sample air at any desired location, but normally require the use of separate radiation detection instruments to measure the radioactive particles deposited on the filter paper to determine the airborne radioactivity concentration.[M2600 - Laboratory Test Equipment] This Cost Code supports specialized equipment usually found in laboratories, hospitals and test facilities.  This kind of equipment is distinct enough to warrant separating it for management purposes from the M2400 Cost Code.[M2830 - Production Engineering] Labor cost of the Engineers, Health Physicists, Scientists and others who prepare the acquisitions.","","2d4ecd2ff18dba99e69214bf09a7b1965ff36c72-0-f99dc5a0af766a4b93a28d16946bae29fc817a1b","2d4ecd2ff18dba99e69214bf09a7b1965ff36c72","root","2d4ecd2ff18dba99e69214bf09a7b1965ff36c72-cefbbc4fd945ce81088446d8d40ec77f8ca1cbb6"

The Air Mobility Command (AMC) Airlift and Air Refueling Mission Area Plans identified a deficiency in the ability to protect MAF aircraft from hostilities during combat operations.  To enhance mission safety during these combat operations, it is critical to provide aircrews with timely and essential off-board information.  Enabling real-time information in the cockpit allows mission adjustments in response to rapidly changing combat conditions while in-flight.  The airborne broadcast intelligence (ABI) and combat track II (CTII) systems provide real-time intelligence, situational awareness (national/theater intelligence and displays air/land/blue water threats), beyond line-of-sight C2 data, and secure text messaging, which enable aircrews to receive updated threat and mission information.  To limit system implementation costs, ABI/CTII are roll-on/roll-off systems enabling immediate employment on all MAF aircraft.  Without real-time information and C2 communications in the cockpit, MAF aircraft will be forced to continue to operate without secure access to mission critical beyond line-of-sight C2 and situational/threat awareness leaving them vulnerable to enemy threats and hostile actions.  These systems are interchangeable between all MAF aircraft.","","ae49b89ee6c3221ee0a2a78a96c055e193f24550-4-73d44706bdd19b3b45588c93a3e0de5e1fef891e","ae49b89ee6c3221ee0a2a78a96c055e193f24550","root","ae49b89ee6c3221ee0a2a78a96c055e193f24550-310f915bec0eada8130d3cd511aa1b2f885ca9a2"

ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces.   ATP capabilities, such as high resolution imagery, eye safe laser, high system reliability and smaller deployment footprint provide greater combat effectiveness across several mission areas, including suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD), precision air interdiction, close air support (CAS), non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NT-ISR), reconnaissance, and time-sensitive targeting.  This funding supports the production, qualification and integration of ATPs to include all activities necessary for fielding. It includes, but is not limited to, Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) procurements, verification/qualification testing and integration efforts, Interim Contractor Logistics (ICS) support, containers, site activations, technical data packages, depot standup and program management support. Laser Infrared Targeting and Navigating (LITENING) and Sniper are ATPs currently used by the active duty, Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).  Advanced Targeting Pod - Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) is the next increment in ATP capability.  Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) and Pave Penny systems will be phased out as new ATP and ATP-SE systems are acquired._____FY 2011 funding totals include $218.138M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.FY 2012 funding totals include $23.0M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations. _____Current Production scheduleLegacy Sniper:   - Lot 9 Buy 1, 20 Legacy Sniper Pods (FY09 funds) Awarded Sep 09, delivery Jul 11 - Jun 12. - Lot 9 Buy 2, 35 Legacy Sniper Pods (FY09 funds) Awarded Sep 09, delivery Jul 11 - June 12.Legacy LITENING:- Lot 2, 41 Legacy LITENING Pods (FY09 funds) Awarded Sep 10, delivery May 11 - April 12.ATP SE: - Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 1 Lot 1, 6 LITENING Pods, 6 Sniper Pods (FY10 funds) Awarded Sep 10, to be delivered Jan 12.
