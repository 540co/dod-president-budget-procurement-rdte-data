The FY 2014 $2.7M OCO funding request will complete the X-Net integration effort on the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT aircraft started with FY 2013 OCO funding. The USAF's Manned Reconnaissance Systems program includes seventeen RC-135 V/W RIVET JOINT three RC-135S COBRA BALL and two RC-135U COMBAT SENT mission aircraft.  The RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT is the variant with the majority of the aircraft in this program element and as a result drives the Baseline integration and modification upgrade strategy for the entire RC-135 fleet.  Therefore the majority of the modification budget is directly related to the RIVET JOINT weapon system baseline strategy which subsequently spills over in the baseline strategies for COBRA BALL and COMBAT SENT weapon systems.An RC-135 Viability Assessement was conducted in 2008 and the results reported that despite their fleet average airframe age (44 years) and accumulated flight hours (38000) as of the end of fiscal year 2007 the RC-135 should be able to continue to meet the user's needs by performing intended operations until at least through the year 2040.  Viability was assessed based on underlying analyses of reliability maintainability performance corrosion fatigue architectural stability safety and availability.  The Viability Assessment also summarized that the RC-135 fleet has experienced significant improvements in reliability maintainability and availability since FY 2001.  The Program Manager attributes these improvements directly to the BIG SAFARI Baseline integration and modification upgrade strategy and the synergies gained with long standing relationships with the RC-135 industry partners.     FY 2014 funding efforts will concentrate on Baseline 11 integration efforts which also indirectly reacts to the 2012 RC-135 Multi-Attribute Utility Assessment (MUA) which detailed operational effectivness cost and program analyses of the alternative weapons system configurations (e.g. C-37 KC-46 P-8 RQ-4).  The MUA determined that retaining and sustaining the RC-135V/W airframe offers the highest assessed weapons system utility (measured as a benefit of cost-to-risk ratio) over the 25 year assessment period.Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0305207F Manned Reconnaissance Systems.","Air Force","180.887","","177.641","","171.813","","162.211","","173.237","","174.256","","174.513","","Air Force Active","64","Millions","Millions","Where applicable justification for individual modifications is provided in the P-3A exhibits.","0305207F","Aircraft Procurement Air Force","AB","3010F","5","5","184.143","2.7","","A","","","","",

The core functions of DCGS-A are: the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED); operating in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and Joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information; distribution of relevant red (threat) gray (non-aligned) and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing warfighter's early warning and targeting capability. DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors and other information sources and impacts all warfighting functions. DCGS-A is a key component of the greater Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E). DCGS-A is fielded in fixed and mobile configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint. DCGS-A continues to support worldwide contingency operations (Afghanistan/Horn of Africa/Philippines) through ISR Modernization to address operational requirements and equipment fielding in accordance with (IAW) the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) model.The Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) designated the Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Intelligence Electronic Warfare and Sensors (IEW&S) as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead. PEO IEW&S is using DCGS-A to define the CPCE architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described within the Assistant Secretary of the Army (ASA) for Acquisition Logistics and Technology (ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This is in accordance with (IAW) the Army priority to align all Army networks procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.DCGS-A hardware and software is based on a combination of Government Off The Shelf (GOTS) Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) and Non-Developmental Items (NDI) that are integrated into scalable configurations tailored to Warfighting functions. These product line components include the software baseline server suite [Intelligence Fusion Server (IFS)] and individual analyst multi-function workstations such as Portable and Fixed-Multi-Function Workstations (P-MFWS) and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Workstation. These components are also used to upgrade existing fielded Intel Programs of Record to enable the establishment of the Army COE while simultaneously assuring system compatibility and interoperability within the DCGS enterprise.DCGS-A is a designated Major Automation Information System (MAIS) and is deployed on multiple hardware platforms and security levels across the Army.  DCGS-A achieved a successful Milestone C in 2Q12 and following the successful operational assessment and Full Deployment Decision (FDD) in 1Q13 DCGS-A Increment 1 Release 1 capabilities will be deployed across the Force in accordance with (IAW) ARFORGEN. New capabilities will be fielded incrementally through software releases integrated onto the fielded product line hardware configurations.  These range from portable laptops to large commodity server-based processing centers operating in a Cloud Architecture. DCGS-A deployed the first Tactical Cloud Computing Node in the DoD in 1Q11. Core Cloud nodes will be fielded strategically across the globe while tactical Cloud Edge Nodes such as the DCGS-A Intelligence Processing Center (IPC) (V)1 and (V)2 will form the basis for delivery of Cloud computing environment to the combat formation.  Within the Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) DCGS-A provides basic mobile ISR capability as well as software applications that can be embedded on future C3I and other systems. At the Corps Division and Echelons Above Corps (EAC) DCGS-software will be hosted on fixed mobile and portable configurations.
