SOF Tactical Communications (STC) procures the next generation SOF communication system and replaces most of the currently fielded SOF suite of radios. The capability will consist of five basic form factors: 1) Man-pack device will be a multi-band device capable of being carried by an individual or being mounted on various SOF platforms; 2) Fixed configuration will be a multi-band and/or High-Frequency (HF) device designed for implementation into air/ground/sea platforms or base stations; 3) HF device in a man-pack configuration will be capable of being mounted on various SOF platforms; 4) Handheld device will include both an urban and maritime variant; 5) Individual device will be a small handheld device to provide intra-team communications capability of voice data and video. This system will introduce additional capabilities to SOF to improve current situational awareness capabilities and performance on SOF platforms. Capabilities will include: real time hostile and friendly force information; Line of Sight (LOS) and Beyond LOS communications; and access to situational awareness in the form of intelligence inputs broadcasts and networks. This system will be a key component of an integrated network providing information connectivity among SOF the Services other government agencies and potentially indigenous and surrogate forces.  FY 2015 PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION: Procures 973 handheld radios 214 man-pack radios 13 man-pack fixed mount radios and 153 HF radios.2. Radio Integration System (RIS) formerly Joint Base Station (JBS) is an evolutionary acquisition program to procure the most current tactical C2 communications system for deployed and forward-based SOF and TSOCs supporting OCO and other SOF activities. The procured solution consists of a full-scaled deployable transit case variant a deployable downsized transit case variant and a fixed base station variant. All variants are capable of integrating existing and future radios and are compliant with the Joint Tactical Radio System. RIS interface enhance and combine multiple single-channel radios into one integrated C2 suite. The variants will enable the SOF operational commander to exercise reliable effective and efficient C2 functions regardless of area of operation. Moreover the system provides the SOF Commander and staff with the capability to send and receive voice data and messages between the inserted SOF war-fighter and higher headquarters liaison officers other government agencies and coalition partners. FY 2015 PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION: Procures 1 RIS Transit Case 7 RIS and 2 RIS-Lite systems.3. Blue Force Tracking (BFT) is a family of devices used to remotely track and monitor friendly forces. The capability enhances C2 threat warning force protection situational awareness combat search and rescue counter-fratricide battlefield visualization and combat identification. This capability is unique to SOF because it requires the devices to be lightweight portable secure and a Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection. SOF systems include the miniature transmitter and the handheld device that provides automated transmission of position location information and brevity codes supporting both ground and air assets. This information is collected by national assets relayed to select command units and displayed on the receiving unit’s common operational picture.FY 2015 PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION: Procures 483 BFT devices.","1160431BB","Procurement Defense-Wide","0300D","4","2","1418676966","2014-12-15T20:56:06+00:00","2015","http://comptroller.defense.gov/budgetmaterials.aspx","dodbudget","record","public","procurement-amended","PROCUREMENT_JustificationBook_United_States_Special_Operations_Command_PBAmended_2015.xml","2015","Each","","","","",

SOF Tactical Communications (STC) procures the next generation SOF communication system and replaces most of the currently fielded SOF suite of radios. The capability will consist of five basic form factors: 1) Man-pack device will be a multi-band device capable of being carried by an individual or being mounted on various SOF platforms; 2) Fixed configuration will be a multi-band and/or High-Frequency (HF) device designed for implementation into air/ground/sea platforms or base stations; 3) HF device in a man-pack configuration will be capable of being mounted on various SOF platforms; 4) Handheld device will include both an urban and maritime variant; 5) Individual device will be a small handheld device to provide intra-team communications capability of voice data and video. This system will introduce additional capabilities to SOF to improve current situational awareness capabilities and performance on SOF platforms. Capabilities will include: real time hostile and friendly force information; Line of Sight (LOS) and Beyond LOS communications; and access to situational awareness in the form of intelligence inputs broadcasts and networks. This system will be a key component of an integrated network providing information connectivity among SOF the Services other government agencies and potentially indigenous and surrogate forces.  FY 2015 PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION: Procures 973 handheld radios 214 man-pack radios 13 man-pack fixed mount radios and 153 HF radios.2. Radio Integration System (RIS) formerly Joint Base Station (JBS) is an evolutionary acquisition program to procure the most current tactical C2 communications system for deployed and forward-based SOF and TSOCs supporting OCO and other SOF activities. The procured solution consists of a full-scaled deployable transit case variant a deployable downsized transit case variant and a fixed base station variant. All variants are capable of integrating existing and future radios and are compliant with the Joint Tactical Radio System. RIS interface enhance and combine multiple single-channel radios into one integrated C2 suite. The variants will enable the SOF operational commander to exercise reliable effective and efficient C2 functions regardless of area of operation. Moreover the system provides the SOF Commander and staff with the capability to send and receive voice data and messages between the inserted SOF war-fighter and higher headquarters liaison officers other government agencies and coalition partners. FY 2015 PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION: Procures 1 RIS Transit Case 7 RIS and 2 RIS-Lite systems.3. Blue Force Tracking (BFT) is a family of devices used to remotely track and monitor friendly forces. The capability enhances C2 threat warning force protection situational awareness combat search and rescue counter-fratricide battlefield visualization and combat identification. This capability is unique to SOF because it requires the devices to be lightweight portable secure and a Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection. SOF systems include the miniature transmitter and the handheld device that provides automated transmission of position location information and brevity codes supporting both ground and air assets. This information is collected by national assets relayed to select command units and displayed on the receiving unit’s common operational picture.FY 2015 PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION: Procures 483 BFT devices.","1160431BB","Procurement Defense-Wide","0300D","4","2","1418676964","2014-12-15T20:56:04+00:00","2015","http://comptroller.defense.gov/budgetmaterials.aspx","dodbudget","record","public","procurement-amended","PROCUREMENT_MasterJustificationBook_Defense-Wide_PBAmended_2015.xml","2015","Each","","","","",
