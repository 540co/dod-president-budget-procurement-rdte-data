At ATC replaces vehicle data communication interfaces and advanced sensors for automotive performance and endurance testing; procures instrumentation for accurate and timely monitoring of divers for safety during underwater support missions such as swim course surveys and retrieving lost test items; procures high speed laser scanners to provide a complete 3-D models of sub-systems or parts for comparison to  physical dimension tolerances as stipulated in engineering drawings; upgrades mobile dynamometer control systems for programmable dynamometer control using vehicle speed drawbar force and drawbar power as input parameters used for power-train winch and fuel consumption testing and replaces aging high speed digital cameras used to document test events.  At WSMR provides badly needed upgrades to aged nuclear effects simulators used to test weapon system survivability and provides upgrades to the Semiconductor Test Laboratory used to characterize electronic piece-parts (complex integrated circuits such as microprocessors) to determine their vulnerability to and survivability in nuclear weapons and space radiation environments.  At YPG purchases on-board data acquisition and recording equipment for collecting vehicle performance data in harsh desert environments; purchases pyroshock accelerometers blast over pressure gages infrared flash detectors and triggers and various types of displacement transducers used to assess weapons ballistic performance; procures replacement power amplifiers in the vibration test facility supporting shock and vibration tests and also upgrades instrumentation and test fixtures in the vibration test facility used to simulate field shock and vibration environments; procures high speed digital cameras for capturing test events and procures low cost rapidly deployable earth filled walls/structures to protect personnel and equipment during weapon firing test activities. The majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life.  This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data is collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized.  Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers.","All WTCV Systems","2013-10","2013-12","2013-10","2012-10","2013-03","3.503","4.357","4.753","3.503","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",
