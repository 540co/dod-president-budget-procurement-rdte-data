The short minimum range of the M224 makes the 60mm mortar ammunition well suited for close protective fires against an assaulting enemy for block-to-block fighting in cities and combat over close terrain with restricted visibility.  E70400 - CTG MORTAR 60MM ILLUM VL M721 W/MTSQ FUZESYSTEM DESCRIPTION:The M721 cartridge is a fin stabilized mortar cartridge that consists of a M776 Mechanical Time Superquick (MTSQ) fuze a thin wall steel body tube and aluminum tail cone that contains the payload (parachute and canister) and a fin assembly that contains the ignition cartridge and propelling charges.  The payload is base ejected and upon ignition produces visible light illumination. This visible light illumination allows for monitoring of enemy activities and adjustment of fire at greater observation distances during night operations. It also provides a means for day/night signaling.  It is particularly useful in combined operations with allies who may not have night vision devices (NVDs). The M721/M767 Illumination Cartridges (Range 200 meter minimum to 3200 meter maximum) are ballistically similar to the M720A1 HE Cartridge allowing a gun to illuminate and fire on the same target without adjustments. These items are Code A approved for service use.E85700 - CTG MORTAR 60MM ILLUM IR M767 SERIES W/MTSQ FUZESYSTEM DESCRIPTION:The M767 cartridge is a fin stabilized mortar cartridge that consists of a M776 Mechanical Time Superquick (MTSQ) fuze a thin wall steel body tube and aluminum tail cone that contains the payload (parachute and canister) and a fin assembly that contains the ignition cartridge and propelling charges.  The payload is base ejected and upon ignition produces infrared (IR) illumination. The advantage of the infrared over conventional illumination is that there is minimal visible light. This reduces the possibility of exposing forward friendly troop positions while also allowing covert adjustment of fire at greater observation distances through use of passive Night Vision Devices (NVD). The M721/M767 Illumination Cartridges (Range 300 meter minimum to 3175 meter maximum) are ballistically similar to the M720A1 HE Cartridge allowing a gun to illuminate and fire on the same target without adjustments. This item is Code A approved for service use.E72199 - CTG MORTAR 60MM HE EnFrag XM1061 (IM) W/M734A1 MOFSYSTEM DESCRIPTION:The XM1061 60mm High Explosive Enhanced Fragmentation (EF) cartridge with multi-option fuze is used against personnel and a higher category of materiel target sets providing both fragmentation and blast effect.  This round uses the insensitive main charge explosive PBNX-110.  Lethality is maintained by an enhanced fragmentation warhead.  The XM1061 EF uses the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze.  When the fuze is set in the proximity mode it functions at a height over the target that is optimized for lethality.  The XM1061-E is Code B scheduled for Type Classification 2QFY13. E93900 - CTG MORTAR 60MM HE M720 SERIES W/MOFMSYSTEM DESCRIPTION:The M720A1 60mm High Explosive Cartridge with Multi-Option Fuze is used against personnel and materiel providing both fragmentation and blast effects. The 60mm High Explosive Cartridges (Range 70 meter minimum to 3400 meter maximum) are Insensitive Munitions (IM) enhanced HE rounds.  Lethality is maintained by using a high fragmentation steel (HF-1) shell body loaded with approximately 2lbs. of an IM explosive. The M720A1 also incorporates the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze. When the fuze is set in the proximity mode it functions at a height over the target that is optimized for lethality.This item is Code A approved for service use.E92900 - CTG MORTAR 60MM HE M768 W/PD FUZESYSTEM DESCRIPTION:The 60mm High Explosive Cartridges are Insensitive Munitions (IM) enhanced HE rounds. The M786 High Explosive cartridge (Range 70 meter minimum to 3400 meter maximum) is used with the new M783 dual safety point detonating/delay fuze tail fin assembly and high fragmentation steel (HF-1) shell body loaded with approximately 2lbs. of an IM explosive. This round is used primarily in training because it is significantly less expensive than the M720A1 the preferred war fighting round. However the M768 is lethal and can be used in combat.This item is Code A approved for service use.E92200 - CTG Mortar 60MM FRPC M769 SERIES W/PRACTICE FUZESYSTEM DESCRIPTION:The M769 is a low-cost full range practice round that will replace a percentage of the standard HE rounds used in 60mm mortar training. The M769 FRPC (Range 70 meter minimum to 3500 meter maximum) has been designed to provide the user with realistic training at a fraction of the cost. It is identical in shape size and weight to the M720/M720A1 HE cartridges. The flash bang and smoke signature provided by the M775 fuze is channeled to exhaust holes in the rear of the cartridge through the use of a center vent tube.This item is Code A approved for service use.E98600 - CTG Mortar 60MM WP SMOKE M722 SERIES W/PD FUZESYSTEM DESCRIPTION:The M722A1 60mm Smoke cartridge is designed as a spotting/marking round. The steel projectile is bulk loaded with white phosphorous. When the fuze functions it detonates the M85 burster which ruptures the projectile and disperses the white phosphorus. The M722A1 WP Smoke ((Range 200 meter minimum to 3200 meter maximum) replaced the M745 mechanical point-detonating fuze with the reliable safe and cost effective electronic M783 Point Detonating (PD) and Delay (DLY) fuze.This item is Code A approved for service use.","Army","2014","60MM Mortar All Types","43.925","40.127","49.415","38.029","53.166","58.375","31.287","43.029","939.426","5","43.925","40.127","49.415","38.029","53.166","58.375","31.287","43.029","939.426","5","43.925","40.127","49.415","38.029","53.166","58.375","31.287","43.029","939.426","5","9","E89600","Millions","Dollars","","Each","FY 2014 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $38.029 million supports approximately 94488 cartridges.FY 2014 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $5.00 million supports 11718 cartridges.FY 2014 Base Budget supports critical Army Title 10 war reserve/operational training and test requirements IAW DoD Instruction 3000.04 (Munitions Requirements Process) and AR 5-13 (Total Army Munitions Requirements Process and Prioritization System).

This smoke screen is produced by burning multiple wedge-shaped pieces of felt saturated with White Phosphorous (WP).  The system consists principally of a projectile carrier and Canister containing 116 WP felt wedges and a center core Burster. Projectile carrier is comprised of an Ogive Expulsion Charge modified all steel body and a one-piece steel dome shaped base.  Upon M762/M762A1 ET fuze function the Expulsion Charge is initiated which simultaneously dispenses the Canister and ignites a short delay. This delay provides ample time for Canister and projectile body separation prior to functioning of the center core Burster which ruptures the Canister and disperses 116 WP felt wedges. In less than 45 seconds a dense and uniform smoke screen is created by burning of the WP. This projectile is shipped with a fusible lifting plug which protects the item during shipping handling and storage.

The FY 2014 $2.7M OCO funding request will complete the X-Net integration effort on the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT aircraft started with FY 2013 OCO funding. The USAF's Manned Reconnaissance Systems program includes seventeen RC-135 V/W RIVET JOINT three RC-135S COBRA BALL and two RC-135U COMBAT SENT mission aircraft.  The RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT is the variant with the majority of the aircraft in this program element and as a result drives the Baseline integration and modification upgrade strategy for the entire RC-135 fleet.  Therefore the majority of the modification budget is directly related to the RIVET JOINT weapon system baseline strategy which subsequently spills over in the baseline strategies for COBRA BALL and COMBAT SENT weapon systems.An RC-135 Viability Assessement was conducted in 2008 and the results reported that despite their fleet average airframe age (44 years) and accumulated flight hours (38000) as of the end of fiscal year 2007 the RC-135 should be able to continue to meet the user's needs by performing intended operations until at least through the year 2040.  Viability was assessed based on underlying analyses of reliability maintainability performance corrosion fatigue architectural stability safety and availability.  The Viability Assessment also summarized that the RC-135 fleet has experienced significant improvements in reliability maintainability and availability since FY 2001.  The Program Manager attributes these improvements directly to the BIG SAFARI Baseline integration and modification upgrade strategy and the synergies gained with long standing relationships with the RC-135 industry partners.     FY 2014 funding efforts will concentrate on Baseline 11 integration efforts which also indirectly reacts to the 2012 RC-135 Multi-Attribute Utility Assessment (MUA) which detailed operational effectivness cost and program analyses of the alternative weapons system configurations (e.g. C-37 KC-46 P-8 RQ-4).  The MUA determined that retaining and sustaining the RC-135V/W airframe offers the highest assessed weapons system utility (measured as a benefit of cost-to-risk ratio) over the 25 year assessment period.Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0305207F Manned Reconnaissance Systems.","Air Force","2014","RC-135","180.887","177.641","184.143","171.813","174.256","173.237","162.211","174.513","1226.888","2.7","180.887","177.641","184.143","171.813","174.256","173.237","162.211","174.513","1226.888","2.7","180.887","177.641","184.143","171.813","174.256","173.237","162.211","174.513","1226.888","2.7","64","DARP01","Millions","Millions","A","Each","Where applicable justification for individual modifications is provided in the P-3A exhibits.","Aircraft Procurement Air Force","Each","Other Aircraft","AB","3010F","5","5","Modification of Inservice Aircraft","PBAmended","2013-05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","180.887","","177.641","","171.813","","162.211","","173.237","","174.256","","174.513","","Air Force Active","184.143","2.7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","58.033","44.124","39.385","","32.895","32.895","327.307","","","","","","","","","","48.869","54.252","49.749","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",

These items common (used on more than one weapon system) and peculiar (unique to one weapon system) directly support aircraft maintenance and servicing requirements.  These replacement requirements ensure continuation of serviceable supportable equipment over the life of a weapon system.  Items requiring replacement typically range in age from 10 to 35 years old.  As a result this equipment suffers frequent failures is uneconomical to repair and requires spare parts that are no longer available.  Many items have become technologically obsolete or must be replaced due to environmental operating constraints.  Items of equipment budgeted within this program include:  avionics test stations air conditioners munitions handling equipment electronic test sets maintenance platforms and automatic test systems.  These items support multiple Air Force weapon systems.  Failure to procure these items will negatively affect mission capable rates increase maintenance costs and increase sortie turn times.USM670 Core Test Set (CTS)The Joint Service Electronic Combat Systems Tester (JSECST) provides an organizational level (O-level) flight line capability for verifying the operational status of aircraft-installed electronic combat (EC) systems including their associated installed antennas transmission lines radomes cockpit displays controls and EC suite communication buses.  It also provides EC system malfunction diagnostics.  The JSECST provides end-to-end (ETE) functional testing to determine the status of EC system installed in or on operation aircraft.  It automatically determines the go/no-go status of the EC system with minimal technician interaction.  In cases where the EC system has a critical fault the JSECST detects the critical failure identifies the ETE test that failed and provides the diagnostics to isolate the failed aircraft transmission line path/component or line replaceable unit (LRU).  The JSECST can be operated in automatic or manual mode to provide identification and isolation of failed EC systems.  This equipment support Air Force weapon systems A-10 F-15 and F-16 aircraft.  Advanced Digital Test Station (ADTS)ADTS is fully automated programmable stimulus generating response measuring intermediate automatic test equipment that will checkout align and fault isolate 77 avionics Line Replaceable Units (LRUs).  ADTS interfaces to LRUs via Test Program Sets (TPS).  TPSs are required to perform the automated testing and fault isolation of the Unit Under Test (UUT).  This test station supports B-1 avionics LRUs and ultimately impacts B-1 mission capability for Global Attack missions.  The Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) presently supporting the B-1 LRU/Shop Replaceable Unit (SRU) troubleshooting and repair is no longer supportable due to diminished manufacturing sources and obsolescence caused by age of equipment.  The procurement of the TPS Rehost is associated with the initial program acquisition cost.  The test station (ADTS) and each unique B-1 LRU test program set (TPS) are dependent to each other and the Rehost is required for full avionics B-1 LRU test capability.  The new ADTS platform requires compatibility with the LRU Interface Test Adapters (ITA).Portable Automated Test Station (PATS)The PATS provides the user capability to trouble shoot the Avionics System Weapons bus and Armament system on the A-10A/C aircraft.  It also provides capabilities to load Operational Flight Programs to the various Avionics components on the A-10-A/C aircraft.  All A-10 aircraft are being upgraded to A-10C configuration.  The PATS model -30 (P/N 04852-0100-30) is facing obsolescence challenges and becoming quickly unsupportable.  The PATS model -70 (P/N 04852-0100-70) increases capability reduces equipment down time and enhances maintainer trouble shooting capability on the aircraft ensuring that A-10 mission capability is maintained. Versamodule Extensions for Instrumentation Improved Avionics Intermediate Shop (VXI-IAIS)The VXI-IAIS is a mobile test station which provides performance and diagnostic testing of F- 16 avionics Line Replaceable Units (LRUs). The VXI-IAIS test station is self-contained in two-man portable cases greatly improving mobility for deployment purposes. Its predecessor the IAIS is used throughout the United States Air Force.  The VXI-IAIS enhances and greatly improves the test capability previously maintained by the IAIS through the implementation of versatile modern technology in a modular standards-based Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) instruments design. Versatile Depot Automatic Test Station (VDATS)VDATS is a tester that is used for maintenance and testing of advanced avionics components that supports multiple aircraft platforms and systems.  Initially VDATS was developed to reduce Automatic Test Systems (ATS) proliferation by standardizing depot avionics test stations. VDATS has been named the first Air Force Family of testers. As a family of testers which standardized ATS support within the Air Force VDATS now supports intermediate level ATS requirements.   VDATS has flexible hardware and software architectures that are fully expandable and tailorable.  VDATS provides workload transportability and increased sustainability through common commercial components with latest technologies and open architecture design.  The system has a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) System of Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) with architecture and Virtual Modular Equipment (VME) Extensions for Instrumentation (VXI) technology.  Using standardized commercial components on VDATS reduces the number of diverse components which eases sustainability and obsolescence management allowing production units to run on any VDATS of the same configuration utilizing interface test adapters and test program sets. The equipment within the VDATS family of tester is the Digital Analog Radio Frequency and Calibration Equipment.  VDATS Digital Analog (DA-1) is the standard configuration. It includes the Cross Point Matrix (CPM) which provides a true hybrid test capability to the Test Program Set (TPS) developer and provides the switching technology required to connect any digital pin on VDATS to the appropriate analog instrumentation without additional ITA complexity.  VDATS Digital Analog (DA-2) is the standard DA-1 configuration with additional Hybrid/Digital pins.  VDATS Radio Frequency (RF-1) is used to test systems with RF requirements and will work with either DA configuration. The RF-1 is not stand-alone. Advanced Radar/Electronic Warfare Test Station (ARTS)The ARTS replaces 1970s vintage Radar/Electronic Warfare (REW) test stations and the Defensive Avionics Augmentation Equipment (DAAE).  ARTS is a fully automated programmable stimulus generating response measuring intermediate automatic test equipment that will checkout align and fault isolate 21 avionics Line Replaceable Units (LRUs).  ARTS interfaces to the LRU's via Test Program Sets (TPS).  TPS's are required to perform the automated testing and faults isolation of the Unit Under Test (UUT).  A TPS consists of test software an interface test adaptor (ITA) cables used to connect the ITA to UUT and supporting documentation.  This test station supports B-1 REW LRUs and ultimately impacts B-1 mission capability for Global Attack missions.  The ATE presently supporting B-1 LRU troubleshooting and repair is no longer supportable due to diminished manufacturing sources and obsolescence caused by the age of the equipment.  The average REW and DAAE mission capable rate is 67%.Stores System Tester - Intermediate (SSTI) (F-22 AME)The SSTI replaces the Stores Release Equipment tester and directly impacts the Air Force's ability to safely load carry and launch weapons on the combat aircraft.  The current tester accomplishes intermediate level testing of combat Alternate Mission Equipment (AME) which includes aircraft launchers pylons bomb racks gun pods and associated relays/adapters.  The tester performs AME functional and fault isolation tests.  Tester shortages are creating severe limitations on mission accomplishment.  Procurement of existing testers is not an option due to diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS).  Procurement of the SSTI fills the existing tester shortages and precludes further DMS complications. Stores Management Test Set Program (SMTSP)F-15 C/D/E aircraft weapons delivery systems are currently supported by a series of Armament Testers.  Various configurations of these testers (A/E24T-197/198/199) provide both on and off equipment operational checkout capability to support mission requirements.  In addition the flight line intermediate shops and depot levels utilize these testers to troubleshoot fault isolate and maintain aircraft weapons firing circuits.  They also provide operational checkout capability of Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) Pylons Adapters Air-to-Air Launchers and Aircraft Guns Systems on a periodic basis. Large Air ConditionerThe Large Flight-Line Air Conditioner replacement program will procure a trailer-mounted diesel powered deployable air conditioner. Its purpose is to provide conditioned air for supporting pre-flight activities and ground maintenance efforts for heavy electronics laden weapon systems including but not limited to:  B-1B C-32 E-3 E-8C and RC-135.  The Large Flight-Line Air Conditioner program will replace three legacy systems: ACE-802 PD-501 (in certain applications) and DAC-110. These legacy systems represent the majority of the Air Force inventory of large flight line air conditioners (400ea).  Operational assessments determined that legacy air conditioners were not performing to their specified operating temperatures. These air conditioners are approaching the eighteenth year of a twenty year life expectancy. The age of this equipment high temperatures and other environmental conditions in the Middle East have caused legacy air conditioners to fail affecting operational readiness and jeopardizing critical missions. Modifications to legacy equipment have been implemented; however these modifications introduced water into the system that caused premature corrosion resulting in unit failures. Lack of dependable air conditioning equipment continues to cause operational impacts such as rescheduling maintenance activities to nighttime operations or delaying sorties in order to avoid overheating of critical electronic warfare/avionics systems and personnel.  Consequently the warfighter has established a critical need for a Large Flight-Line Air Conditioner replacement program.Rackmount Improved Avionics Intermediate Shop (R-IAIS)R-IAIS is a test station which provides performance and diagnostic testing of F-16 avionics line replaceable units (LRUs).  The R-IAIS is used in environments without mobility requirements such as depots AETC locations as well as select ANG and AFRC locations.  The R-IAIS is an integrated test system which consists of several subsystems.  It utilizes a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) computer control system.  The R-IAIS replaces the F-16 full size Advanced Computer Avionics Intermediate Shop (AdC AIS) set which includes the Displays Indicator Computer Inertial Pneumatic Processor and Radio Frequency test stations.  The AdC AIS shop set requires over eight (8) pallet positions to move whereas the R-IAIS test station requires only one (1) pallet position to move.  The AdC AIS test station is 24 years old and is becoming obsolete and unsupportable as a result of outdated technology diminishing/obsolete parts and disappearing vendors.  The R-IAIS increases capability reduces equipment downtime and enhances maintainer trouble-shooting capabilities ensuring that F-16 aircraft mission capability is maintained.Legacy Test Program Set Re-Host (TPS)Legacy TPS Re-host is a structured program required to transfer workload from unsustainable automatic test systems to DoD approved families of tester such as the Air Force's Versatile Depot Automatic Test System (VDATS). Its specific purpose is to translate existing antiquated TPS software languages used in archaic legacy test systems to the sustainable commercial standard open architecture language used in VDATS American Standard Institute for C programming language. This is necessary as theaverage age of today's Automatic Test Systems (ATS) is 25 years and the weapon systems supported continue to extend service life in order to satisfy the Air Force mission in the face of diminishing resources.

Large Air ConditionerThe Large Flight-Line Air Conditioner replacement program will procure a trailer-mounted diesel powered deployable air conditioner. Its purpose is to provide conditioned air for supporting pre-flight activities and ground maintenance efforts for heavy electronics laden weapon systems including but not limited to:  B-1B C-32 E-3 E-8C and RC-135.  The Large Flight-Line Air Conditioner program will replace three legacy systems: ACE-802 PD-501 (in certain applications) and DAC-110. These legacy systems represent the majority of the Air Force inventory of large flight line air conditioners (400ea).  Operational assessments determined that legacy air conditioners were not performing to their specified operating temperatures. These air conditioners are approaching the eighteenth year of a twenty year life expectancy. The age of this equipment high temperatures and other environmental conditions in the Middle East have caused legacy air conditioners to fail affecting operational readiness and jeopardizing critical missions. Modifications to legacy equipment have been implemented; however these modifications introduced water into the system that caused premature corrosion resulting in unit failures. Lack of dependable air conditioning equipment continues to cause operational impacts such as rescheduling maintenance activities to nighttime operations or delaying sorties in order to avoid overheating of critical electronic warfare/avionics systems and personnel.  Consequently the warfighter has established a critical need for a Large Flight-Line Air Conditioner replacement program.Rackmount Improved Avionics Intermediate Shop (R-IAIS)R-IAIS is a test station which provides performance and diagnostic testing of F-16 avionics line replaceable units (LRUs).  The R-IAIS is used in environments without mobility requirements such as depots AETC locations as well as select ANG and AFRC locations.  The R-IAIS is an integrated test system which consists of several subsystems.  It utilizes a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) computer control system.  The R-IAIS replaces the F-16 full size Advanced Computer Avionics Intermediate Shop (AdC AIS) set which includes the Displays Indicator Computer Inertial Pneumatic Processor and Radio Frequency test stations.  The AdC AIS shop set requires over eight (8) pallet positions to move whereas the R-IAIS test station requires only one (1) pallet position to move.  The AdC AIS test station is 24 years old and is becoming obsolete and unsupportable as a result of outdated technology diminishing/obsolete parts and disappearing vendors.  The R-IAIS increases capability reduces equipment downtime and enhances maintainer trouble-shooting capabilities ensuring that F-16 aircraft mission capability is maintained.Legacy Test Program Set Re-Host (TPS)Legacy TPS Re-host is a structured program required to transfer workload from unsustainable automatic test systems to DoD approved families of tester such as the Air Force's Versatile Depot Automatic Test System (VDATS). Its specific purpose is to translate existing antiquated TPS software languages used in archaic legacy test systems to the sustainable commercial standard open architecture language used in VDATS American Standard Institute for C programming language. This is necessary as theaverage age of today's Automatic Test Systems (ATS) is 25 years and the weapon systems supported continue to extend service life in order to satisfy the Air Force mission in the face of diminishing resources. Test program sets are comprised of a test software package interface cable assemblies (including the interface test adapter) used to connect the Unit Under Test (UUT) to the ATS platform being used to conduct the diagnostic/repair activity. Legacy TPS is a cost of maintaining existing repair capabilities and is a cost that must be borne whether existing stations are modernized or replaced. TPS reprogramming is vitally important to maintaining mission essential repair capabilities in support of weapon system service life extension programs for the entire fleet of fighters bombers airlift and special mission aircraft missile systems and command control and communication systems used throughout the Air Force and the Department of Defense.F-15 Secondary Power Source Test Set (SPSTS)The SPSTS fault isolates the Landing Gear Secondary Power and Engine Starting System on every configuration of the F-15 aircraft. The SPSTS is used when landing gear extension/retraction problems or Engine Starting System problems are reported. The SPSTS will replace a legacy system that has been determined by the F-15 SPO as unsupportable. The current legacy Secondary Power Source Test Sets are obsolete and unsupportable. Legacy test systems require extensive use of technical orders to ensure the correct indicators are verified in the proper sequence. Fault information is limited to an indicator number or gauge reading. The tester requires periodic adjustments to ensure gauges and indicators read properly. The replacement Secondary Power Source Test Set provides clear concise menus on a Remote Control Unit (RCU) which is sunlight readable and backlit for use at night. This display method provides the operator with actual value measurement; identifies signal name high/low limits connector reference designation pin upon test sequence failure and remedy information to simplify troubleshooting and diagnostic steps. In addition to Fault Isolation upgrades the replacement Secondary Power Source Test Set provides improved capabilities in the areas of Landing Gear Test Secondary Power System Static Test Dynamic Test (Engine Runs) Jet Fuel Starter (JFS) Igniter Fault Isolation (FI) Test and Jet Fuel Starter (JFS) Fuel Flow Valve Fault Isolation (FI) Test. Procurement of the replacement Secondary Power Source Test Set is critical to maintaining F-15 mission capability. Current legacy systems are exhibiting increased failure due to age and inadequate repair sources. New testers are critical to replacing the legacy systems.Common Munitions Built-In Test Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE)The CMBRE system provides a common piece of portable support equipment designed to interface with MIL-STD-1760 compatible munitions currently in the inventory or under development.  It provides the capability to utilize the munitions MIL-STD-1760 interface to initiate the munitions BIT provide BIT status upload/download and verify applicable software which includes Operational Flight Programs (OFPs) mission planning and/or Global Positioning System (GPS) crypto keys.   CMBRE is also used to perform the preflight of smart munitions and perform periodic maintenance checks on the munitions.  CMBRE consists of a controller (computer) test adapter unit and an accessory kit.  CMBRE was developed to service multiple existing munitions. The using commands for the CMBRE system are ACC USAFE PACAF AFMC AETC AFRC ANG NAVY and various FMS countries.Aircraft Replacement Support Equipment ModsThe MHU-196 and MHU-204 are Munitions Lift Trailers (MLT) that are Nuclear Certified self-powered heavy duty U-type frame trailers with a 40000 pound lift capacity.

Department of Defense (DoD) Teleport system is a satellite communications (SATCOM) gateway that links the deployed warfighter to the Global Information Grid.   The Teleport program has fielded system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational approach with Generation 1 and 2 Full Deployment authorized by DoD Chief Information Officer on February 18 2011 and the DISA Component Acquisition Executive on June 7 2012.   Teleport Generation 3 consists of three phases; Phases 1 and 2 are in Production and Deployment while the Phase 3 is in Engineering & Manufacturing Development.  Each Teleport investment increases the warfighter’s ability to communicate with a world-wide net-centric set of information capabilities which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.Currently the Teleport system operates as an upgrade of satellite communication capabilities at selected DoD satellite communications gateways.   This system provides deployed warfighters with seamless worldwide multi-band SATCOM connectivity to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Service Delivery Nodes and legacy tactical command control communications computers and intelligence systems.  It also provides centralized integration capabilities contingency capacity and common interfaces to access the DISN.   Teleport's goal is to provide secure seamless interoperable and economical upgrades to DoD SATCOM Gateways and meet the growing throughput requirements of the deployed warfighter.The primary beneficiaries of the Teleport investment are the DoD Combatant Commanders Military Departments Defense Agencies and the warfighter.  Teleport Generation 3 is designed to meet the growing demands of the warfighter through the execution of the following phases:  Phase 1:  Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) [Extended Data Rate (XDR)] terminals provides tactical users with a 350% bandwidth increase in survivable anti-jam communications through all peacetime and combat operations by installing Navy Multiband Terminals (NMT) at select Teleport sites. In addition to enhanced throughput the NMT maintains compatibility with legacy waveforms and current tactical terminals.   Phase 2:  Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) X/Ka-band terminals provides enhanced WGS X/Ka capability to warfighters worldwide by installing terminals from the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal (MET) program at Teleport and other gateway sites. This gateway enhancement allows Teleport to replace end of life (EOL) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) terminals while remaining interoperable with tactical WGS X/Ka-band users.  The MET enhancement provides a 300% Ka-band capacity increase and an 1100% X-band capacity increase to current enterprise terminal X/Ka capabilities.  Additionally it enables the Teleport system to maintain operational availability consistent with Generation 2 requirements and reduce the overall life-cycle cost of X/Ka capabilities across the DoD. Phase 3:  Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy ultra high frequency (UHF) systems interoperability will provide interoperability between MUOS users and Legacy UHF users by installing MUOS-to-Legacy UHF SATCOM Gateway Component (MLGC) suites of equipment at Teleport sites.  MUOS is the next generation DoD UHF SATCOM system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services utilizing the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band.  MLGC suites will provide critical continuity and interoperability as DoD tactical satellite users transition from legacy waveforms and radios to the Joint Tactical Radio System.Standardized Tactical Entry Point (STEP)The STEP investment is driven by Combatant Command (COCOM) operational requirements validated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and is linked with Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) core strategic goals.  STEP capabilities directly support DoD’s transformational initiatives and goals by: (1) enabling effective communications for the warfighter through early implementation of Net-Centric capability; (2) enhancing the capability and survivability of space systems and supporting infrastructure; and (3) continuing to develop joint interoperable Networks and Information Integration (NII) architecture. The STEP program is integral for SATCOM Gateway evolution and sustainment activities in support to the deployed forces.  STEP sustains the network by replacing EOL Transmission Security (TRANSEC) Communication Security (COMSEC) switches routers and baseband equipment. Further DISA is able to leverage the network and equipment at these sites to support world-wide operations for Expeditionary Forces and Overseas Contingency Operations.  Additionally the STEP program supports the COCOMs Command and Control (C2) and Command Control Communications Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) SATCOM requirements.  Finally STEP resources support the converged Gateway Architecture to ensure the network is able to keep pace with the user community requirements and capabilities as they migrate and adopt emerging technology to accommodate their respective mission needs keeping synchronized and at pace with the evolving Teleport technology architecture.","Defense Information Systems Agency","2014","Teleport","29.277","33.56","23.13","66.075","53.466","46.992","63.95","70.835","","4.76","29.277","33.56","23.13","66.075","53.466","46.992","63.95","70.835","","4.76","29.277","33.56","23.13","66.075","53.466","46.992","63.95","70.835","","4.76","11","11","Millions","Millions","","Each","FY 2012:  ($59.060)  Teleport Technology Refresh ($13.216):  Continued technology refresh to extend service life by addressing Commercial Off the Shelf/Non-Developmental Item (COTS/NDI) logistics and information assurance (IA) compliance concerns. Funding replaced COTS components and software to assure continued supportability of the system through an indefinite service life.  This was required to stay ahead of the obsolescence curve with cost-effective planned technology upgrades refreshers and insertions based on market research and system performance requirements.  Technology refresh allowed Teleport to maintain system reliability and synchronization with warfighters and field capability upgrades requested by stakeholders through the Teleport Program Office (TPO) Engineering Change Request (ECR) process.   FY12 technology refresh activities included upgrading internet protocol IP modem hardware/software modernizing legacy cryptographic devices continuing to integrate and field the Joint Internet Protocol Modem (JIPM) enabling internet protocol version 6 (IPv6) and improving the Teleport management and control system. Generation 3 ($32.321): Activities at Teleport and other gateway sites focused on increasing the legacy system’s capacity to fully utilize the advanced Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) capabilities by procuring and fielding additional enhanced MET X/Ka-band satellite terminals.  Teleport procured five enhanced MET X/Ka satellite terminals in FY 2012 for delivery in FY 2014/2015. This will help avoid possible mission failure for the warfighter.  Activities also included continuation of the AEHF (NMT) terminal implementation to allow warfighters more robust access to the new AEHF constellation utilizing extended data rates (XDR).  Teleport began AEHF (NMT) terminal site preparation at several sites.MUOS Products ($7.608): Following a Key Decision Point (KDP) A in November 2011 MUOS Voice Gateway (MVG) system design and development commenced and funded MVG prototype development.  Design and prototype efforts focused on integrating MUOS voice users to place classified/secure and unclassified DSN calls and to interface with the Public Switched Telephone Network.  Following Delta Preliminary Design Review MUOS Legacy Gateway Component (MLGC) restarted system design and prototype development activities.Integrated Waveform (IW) ($5.915):   The FY 2012 OMNIBUS reporgramming funded the UHF SATCOM Integrated Waveform (IW) to acquire configure and deploy the IW radio capability.  IW is an improvement to the existing Demand-Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) system and provides three times the number of access to UHF channels with improved voice quality over UHF channels effectively doubling the data rates.  This capability is essential for maintaining mission critical UHF SATCOM voice and data networks in support to the warfighter.FY 2013:  ($45.383)   Teleport Technology Refresh ($12.248):  Teleport’s technology refresh program will continue to extend service life by addressing COTS/NDI logistics and IA compliance concerns. This funding periodically replaces COTS components and software to assure continued supportability of that system through an indefinite service life.  It is required to stay ahead of obsolescence curve with cost-effective planned technology upgrades refreshers and insertions based on market research and system performance requirements. It maintains system reliability and synchronization with tactical warfighters and fields capability upgrades requested by stakeholders through the TPO Engineering Change Request (ECR) process.   Generation 3 ($18.735):  Activities will continue to focus on increasing the legacy system’s capacity to fully utilize the advance WGS capabilities by continuing site preparation activities for the fielding of two initial enhanced MET X/Ka satellite terminals.  The current complement of enterprise terminals are approaching EOL.  Activities also include continuation of the AEHF (NMT) terminal implementation to allow warfighters more robust access to the new AEHF constellation utilizing extended data rates (XDR).  Generation 3 reallocation of funding (-$15.288) results from rescheduling procurement of two US Army Modernization of Enterprise Terminals (METs) in FY 2013 and executing one MET procurement in FY 2014 and FY 2015 respectively. This creates a year schedule lag in terminal purchases and implementation but does not affect overall acquisition program baseline in providing enhanced X/Ka access to support WGS.  In FY 2013 the TPO will now focus more on executing AEHF.The PACOM Satellite Gateway increase of $14.400 expands Teleport capabilities available in the Western Pacific region.  Funding will provide engineering acquisition testing and fielding of Wideband Global SATCOM enhanced X/Ka-band and AEHF satellite access capabilities in Guam to extend DISN services to the deployed warfighter.Explanation of change from FY 2012 to FY 2013:  The decrease of -$13.677 from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is attributed to a planned reduction in equipment purchases in accordance with the Teleport Acquisition Strategy.  This reduction results in Teleport's FY 2013 focus shifting to Phase 1 and Phase 2 fielding and implementation efforts rather than equipment purchases.  These fielding and implementation efforts are in preparation of the Generation 3 Operational Test Readiness Review which will authorize the Full Deployment Decision (FDD) in FY14 allowing for full procurement and fielding of remaining METs.FY 2014:  ($64.432)   Teleport Technology Refresh ($11.450):  Teleport’s technology refresh program will continue to address Generation One and Two service end-of-life concerns.  In FY 2014 Teleport’s technology refresh efforts include the Advanced Time Division Multiple Access Interface Processor (A-TIP) implementation IA firewall upgrades and completing JIPM implementation.  A decrease in Technology Refresh is the result of a realignment of funding to the Navy to procure spectrum analyzers for Teleport System intrusion detection. This realignment will transfer the equipment procurement authority to the Navy.Generation 3 ($41.482): Teleport will procure two additional METs in FY 2014 and continue to install two terminals procured in prior years for Generation 3 Phase 2.  Generation 3 Phase 2 activities will continue to focus on increasing the legacy system’s capacity to fully utilize the advance WGS capabilities by installing enhanced MET X/Ka satellite terminals.    Generation 3 Phase 1 activities include the continuation of the AEHF (NMT) terminal implementation with installations at four sites.  These terminals will expand warfighter access to the new AEHF constellation to more combatant commanders across the globe.  In addition Teleport will begin procurement of MUOS to Legacy Gateway Component (MLGC) for Teleport sites to facilitate developmental and operational testing.  PACOM Satellite Gateway ($11.500): PACOM Satellite Gateway will continue to expand Teleport capabilities available in the Western Pacific region.  In FY 2014 funding will facilitate the procurement of two (2) NMT’s for the WPAC site MET site preparation a net-centric baseband suite and all required management and control devices.Explanation of change from FY 2013 to FY 2014:  The net increase of +$19.049 from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is attributed to the increased efforts dedicated to fielding a Wideband Global SATCOM enhanced  X/Ka-band satellite terminal in support of Generation 3.   Increased funding in FY 2014 also supports the Generation 3 procurement of two Modernization of Enterprise Terminals (METs) and the beginning of implementation activities at three Teleport sites for terminals purchased during initial quantity buy.  This increase is partially offset by a decrease for Technology Refresh due to the realignment of funding to the Navy to procure spectrum analyzers for Teleport intrusion detection.Performance Metrics:       Generation 1/2 Metric                   FY12                                FY13                         FY14Number of Teleport sites       0 Complete/8 Total Sites            4 Complete/8 Total Sites    5 Complete/8 Total Siteswith operational JIPM CapabilityNumber of Teleport sites       6 Operational/6 Total Sites      6 Operational/6 Total Sites    6 Operational/6 Total Sites  with operational iDirect 2.3 capabilityNumber of Teleport sites        0 Operational/2 Total Sites     1 Operational/2 Total Sites     2 Operational/2 Total Sites with operational MUOS-DISN capabilityGeneration 3 Metric                     FY12                               FY13                         FY14Number of G3P1 operationally             -              1 Operational/17 Total Terminals       12 Operational/17 Total Terminalscapable NMT terminalsNumber of G3P2 operationally             -                            -                        2 Operational/14 Total Terminalscapable MET terminalsNumber of G3P3 Teleport sites            -                            -                        1 Operational/6 Total Terminalswith operationally capable MLGC systemsStandardized Tactical Entry Point (STEP):FY 2012: ($1.583)  Provided for upgrades to meet warfighter IP-based requirements through the procurement and installation of components for one DISN-Tactical Edge (DISN-TE) suites.  Utilized funding for technology refresh including COMSEC and TRANSEC upgrades.

Additional resources supported COMSEC and TRANSEC upgrades; and the procurement and installation of one JIPM.  Funding also supported the design and proposed integration of Gateway Converged Architecture through the procurement of routers (ASR-9000s ASR-1000s) and other IP devices for 4 SATCOM GatewaysFY 2013:  ($1.609) Continue upgrades to meet warfighter IP-based requirements and procures and install two JIPMs to compliment the DoD migration to the Net-Centric IP capability.  Other equipment areas are addressed for technology refresh to meet security requirements.  Continue to engineer acquire test install integrate and transition the equipment to IPv6 to match what the tactical community will be fielding.  FY 2013 OCO:  ($5.260) Continue DISN-TE implementation to support IP requirements and COMSEC/TRANSEC upgrade. These resources support JIPM implementation at selected STEP sites.  Explanation of change from FY 2012 to FY 2013:  The increase of +$1.979 from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to additional OCO requirements and adoption procurement and implementation of emerging technology to meet mission needs and prior year EOL equipment replacement.  FY 2014:  ($1.643) Funding will allow for the continuation of STEP upgrades to meet warfighter IP-based requirements and provide for system spares which supports the deployed tactical community and for technology refreshment to meet system security needs.FY 2014 OCO:  ($4.760) Funding will allow for the continuation of the Gateway Converged Architecture to support IP requirements and for JIPM upgrade implementation at 4 SATCOM Gateways.Explanation of change from FY 2013 to FY 2014:  The decrease of -$5.226 from FY 2013 to FY 2014 results from decreasing OCO Converged Architecture requirements due to a reduction in the number of JIPM upgrades planned at the SATCOM Gateways (-$0.500).  Part of the decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is attributable to the FY 2014 OCO request being reported at a later date. The decrease is partially offset by increased implementation effort of emerging technology to meet mission needs and EOL equipment replacement (+$0.034).       Performance Metrics:  Schedule performance and customer satisfaction measures are compiled as a real-time barometer to measure how well STEP is satisfying the needs of present customers and to predict success in meeting future STEP objectives.  The nature of this compiled data permits objective assessments and predictions on the quality and reliability of STEP support to its customers (e.g. availability and reliability of the STEP system).

CHARCS provides automation support for information collection reporting investigations source & interrogation operations and document exploitation. The CHARCS automation architecture extends from the individual HUMINT team soldier or CI agent to the Corps Analysis and Control Element (ACE). CHARCS reports digital data such as maps overlays images video biometrics scanned documents and audio files. These media are transmitted through secure networks and interfaces with the Distributed Common Ground Systems-Army (DCGS-A) for detailed analysis and creation of finished intelligence products. Collection and reporting teams at Military Intelligence (MI) battalions and their operational managers are equipped with one of two CHARCS systems. The first is the AN/PYQ-8 Individual Tactical Reporting Tool (ITRT) which provides collection and processing devices for individual HUMINT team member or CI agents. The second is the AN/PYQ-3 CI/HUMINT Automated Tool Set (CHATS) which provides the team leader (who normally directs 3-5 team members) tools to process and manage team-collected information and a robust set of devices such as printers scanners cameras and audio recorders to assist the collection mission.

CHARCS provides automation support for information collection reporting investigations source & interrogation operations and document exploitation. The CHARCS automation architecture extends from the individual HUMINT team soldier or CI agent to the Corps Analysis and Control Element (ACE). CHARCS reports digital data such as maps overlays images video biometrics scanned documents and audio files. These media are transmitted through secure networks and interfaces with the Distributed Common Ground Systems-Army (DCGS-A) for detailed analysis and creation of finished intelligence products. Collection and reporting teams at Military Intelligence (MI) battalions and their operational managers are equipped with one of two CHARCS systems. The first is the AN/PYQ-8 Individual Tactical Reporting Tool (ITRT) which provides collection and processing devices for individual HUMINT team member or CI agents. The second is the AN/PYQ-3 CI/HUMINT Automated Tool Set (CHATS) which provides the team leader (who normally directs 3-5 team members) tools to process and manage team-collected information and a robust set of devices such as printers scanners cameras and audio recorders to assist the collection mission.

The installation-level network infrastructure is comprised of the wiring electronics and security equipment required to provide voice video and data communications to traditional business users and Warfighters.  I3MP is at the very foundation of the Army's Enterprise information strategy to evolve a Net-Centric Everything over Internet Protocol (EoIP) network environment that meets the Department of Defense mandate to implement Unified Capabilities (UC).  I3MP engineers designs fields and tests a standardized converged UC ready secure Installation Campus Area Network (ICAN) infrastructure using State of the Art Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) solutions.  In Korea the program specifically resources all the Information Technology engineering required to ensure Army and Joint Forces can operate efficiently once they relocate south to Camp Humphries.  This infrastructure provides tactical and strategic end-users with connectivity from the desktop to the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN)/Global Information Grid (GIG).  The network I3MP modernizes ensures soldiers maintain their warfighting systems and their proficiency on the systems by using the installation network as a "Docking Station" while they are at home station instead of relying on costly satellite usage time.  I3MP further enables valuable training as it provides the critical high speed and high bandwidth connectivity required for facilities and organizations to conduct Live Virtual and Constructive exercises and operations.  I3MP derives its requirements through continuous collaboration with DISA Army CIO/G-6 Army NETCOM and the Warfighter community.  The program supports the Army/DoD strategic information dominance objectives of EoIP environment and UC and is aligned with the evolving Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative.  In addition to building and modernizing the installation network I3MP fields the Top Level Architecture (security boundary equipment) needed to protect the vital Army ICAN infrastructure and the business conducted on it.The World Wide Technical Control Improvement Program (WWTCIP) is a continuing program to initiate improve expand and automate the Army's Technical Control Facilities (TCF). The program provides power (alternating and direct current (AC/DC) uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and backup generator) timing and synchronization equipment line conditioning equipment real time alarm monitoring and control tri-service tactical interface and appropriate test equipment with associated hardware.  The upgrades provide the end user with greater bandwidth for real time response high quality voice data video and minimizes outages.  Many of the present configurations and equipment can no longer support the Soldier's requirements for voice data and video in an Internet Protocol (IP) centric environment for Everything Over IP (EoIP).  The program is essential to correct these problems and to support Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) Theater Combatant Commander's programs as well as the Continental United States (CONUS) power projection bases and Defense Satellite Communications Systems.  The emerging requirements of new base consolidation in both the Pacific and European Theaters will require robust TCF capability.  Provides initial configuration management and implements Information Assurance (IA) controls for TCFs.The Terrestrial Transmission (TT) program is a component of the Army's seamless Enterprise Network that provides long-haul communications compatibility across operational systems supporting the Department of Defense approved program to modernize and integrate digital operations within the Pacific and European Theaters. The goal architecture will be able to accommodate the rapidly changing deployment and realignment of forces within the Pacific and European Theaters. The objective is an integrated survivable network that provides voice data messaging video and transmission services to the Warfighter. It will also continue the upgrade of power timing and alarm systems for the European Transmission Systems. The Army Special Access Program Enterprise Portal (ASEP) is the Army's only Top Secret compartmented wide area network providing a secure communications capability (email video teleconferencing document storage/sharing voice over internet protocol and instant messaging) for the transmission of highly classified Special Access Required (SAR) information between the Army Operations Center (AOC) the Army staff Major Army Commands Army Special Access Programs (SAPs) and Army Sensitive Activities (SAs).

Dual GMLRS rockets provide 24/7 all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short medium and long ranges.  The U.S. Marine Corps also procures GMLRS rockets through the Army project office.  The GMLRS Program consists of three separate increments.  GMLRS Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) was the first increment.  It is a cluster munition that replaced the shorter range MLRS rockets to engage area or imprecisely located targets.  GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.  GMLRS Unitary is the second increment that utilizes a 200 lb high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage.
