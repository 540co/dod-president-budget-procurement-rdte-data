CANES is the technical and infrastructure consolidation of existing separately managed afloat networks including Integrated Shipboard Network Systems (ISNS) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System - Maritime Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Networks and Submarine Local Area Network. These legacy afloat network designs are currently End of Life and CANES will replace these unaffordable and obsolete networks.The fundamental goal of CANES is to bring Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) within which current and future iterations of Navy Tactical Network computing and storage capabilities will reside.  CANES will provide complete infrastructure inclusive of hardware software processing storage and end user devices for Unclassified Coalition Secret and SCI for all basic network services (email web chat collaboration) to a wide variety of Navy surface combatants submarines Maritime Operations Centers Regional Network Operations and Security Centers (RNOSCs) and Aircraft. In addition hosted applications and systems inclusive of Command and Control Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Information Operations Logistics and Business domains require the CANES infrastructure to operate in the tactical environment. Integrating these applications and systems is accomplished through Application Integration the engineering process used to evaluate and validate compatibility between the CANES IaaS / PaaS and the Navy-validated applications systems and services that will utilize the CANES infrastructure and services. Specific programs such as Distributed Common Ground System - Navy Global Command and Control System - Maritime Naval Tactical Command Support System and Undersea Warfare Decision Support System are dependent on the CANES Common Computing Environment to field host and sustain their capability because they no longer provide their own hardware. To reduce risks associated with End of Life Legacy Systems awaiting CANES replacement in the out-years LI 2915 will support required emergent modernization (Service Life Extension Program (SLEP)) to replace end of life components protect against new Information Assurance vulnerabilities increase Cyber Security and to remain compliant with DoD Information Assurance mandates. CANES requires that Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) field prior to or concurrently with CANES due to architectural reliance between the two programs.CANES will develop technical updates on a rolling four year hardware baseline and a two year software baseline. Fielding of rolling baselines will occur every eight years for major hardware and four years for minor hardware and software. CANES is based on the overarching concept of reducing the number of afloat networks and providing enhanced efficiency through a single engineering focus on integrated technical solutions. This will allow for streamlined acquisition contracting and test events and significant lifecycle efficiencies through consolidation of multiple current configuration management baselines logistics and training efforts into a unified support structure.Automated Digital Network System (ADNS): ADNS provides routing switching baseband configuration and monitoring capabilities for interconnecting naval and coalition enclaves worldwide. ADNS utilizes Commercial Off-the-Shelf/ Government Off-the-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) equipment and network protocols as specified by the joint technical architecture.  ADNS Increment I provides initial limited ship to shore IP connectivity separation of enclaves reuse of unused enclave bandwidth and ship to tactical shore IP connectivity.  ADNS Increment II provides capabilities of network to Satellite Communications Load Balancing Radio Frequency (RF) restoral and Quality of Service (QoS) to include application prioritization Traffic Management compression and enhancements designed to maximize use of "effective" available bandwidth for surface shore and airborne platforms.  ADNS Increment III combines all Navy Tactical Voice secure Communications Interoperability Protocol Inter-Working Function Video and data requirements into a converged IP data stream.  This includes Secure Communication Interoperability-Protocol Interworking Function (SCIP-IWF) for secure telephony over IP. In addition the Increment III architecture will incorporate an IPv4/IPv6 dual stack and a Cipher-Text security architecture to align to the Global Information Grid (GIG) in order to mesh Navy tactical surface subsurface and airborne platforms into a single IP environment with gateway functions to joint and coalition networks.

CANES is the technical and infrastructure consolidation of existing separately managed afloat networks including Integrated Shipboard Network Systems (ISNS) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System - Maritime Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Networks and Submarine Local Area Network. These legacy afloat network designs are currently End of Life and CANES will replace these unaffordable and obsolete networks.The fundamental goal of CANES is to bring Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) within which current and future iterations of Navy Tactical Network computing and storage capabilities will reside.  CANES will provide complete infrastructure inclusive of hardware software processing storage and end user devices for Unclassified Coalition Secret and SCI for all basic network services (email web chat collaboration) to a wide variety of Navy surface combatants submarines Maritime Operations Centers Regional Network Operations and Security Centers (RNOSCs) and Aircraft. In addition hosted applications and systems inclusive of Command and Control Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Information Operations Logistics and Business domains require the CANES infrastructure to operate in the tactical environment. Integrating these applications and systems is accomplished through Application Integration the engineering process used to evaluate and validate compatibility between the CANES IaaS / PaaS and the Navy-validated applications systems and services that will utilize the CANES infrastructure and services. Specific programs such as Distributed Common Ground System - Navy Global Command and Control System - Maritime Naval Tactical Command Support System and Undersea Warfare Decision Support System are dependent on the CANES Common Computing Environment to field host and sustain their capability because they no longer provide their own hardware.CANES will develop technical updates on a rolling four year hardware baseline and a two year software baseline. Fielding of rolling baselines will occur every eight years for major hardware and four years for minor hardware and software. CANES is based on the overarching concept of reducing the number of afloat networks and providing enhanced efficiency through a single engineering focus on integrated technical solutions. This will allow for streamlined acquisition contracting and test events and significant lifecycle efficiencies through consolidation of multiple current configuration management baselines logistics and training efforts into a unified support structure.","Navy","2016","CANES Intell","78","2925","Millions","Thousands","","0303138N","FY 2016 - CANES MIP funds are for the procurement of (9) Afloat production units (4) Afloat Technical Insertion units (1) Afloat First Article and (1) Ashore production unit with integration and associated costs for pre-installation design.

It is the MAGTF's only ground based long range sensor that provides the capability to detect and report Air Breathing Targets (ABT) and track Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBM).  The AN/TPS-59A(V)3 Radar System is connected to the AN/TYQ-23(V)4 Tactical Air Operations Module (TAOM) or the AN/TSQ-269 Mobile - TAOM (M-TAOM).  It provides the air defense controllers data and may be used autonomously to conduct Ground Control Intercept tactical en-route Air Traffic Control (ATC) or TBM alert operations via the Joint Integrated Air Missile Defense (IAMD) encrypted Link-16.  The AN/TPS-59 Program is currently managing recurring system activities on a twenty-nine year old radar system while simultaneously implementing a strategy of tech refresh to address Obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (ODMSMS) issues. The radar has been continuously deployed in support of Operation Freedom Sentinel (OFS) and contingencies.Family of Target Acquisition Systems (FTAS) - The FTAS provides the MAGTF the capability to locate identify and attack enemy indirect fire weapons systems and observe and direct friendly artillery fire. The FTAS consists of the AN/TPQ-46 Firefinder Radar the AN/TPQ-49 Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar and the AN/TSQ-267 Target Processing Set.  The FTAS is critical in the execution of counterfire and the integration of target acquisition information enabling attack by MAGTF assets.  The FTAS also provides artillery firing units the ability to conduct artillery registration and other friendly fire missions.  The FTAS encompasses the equipment required to support target acquisition within the target acquisition platoon and is resident in the headquarters battery of each artillery regiment.  The program will continue to address system issues that arise due to ODMSMS items within the FTAS.  Also as the US Army divests from the AN/TPQ-46 and AN/TPQ-49 the USMC will have to assume the responsibilities of the primary inventory control activity (PICA).Short/Medium Range Air Defense Radar (SHORAD or AN/TPS-63) - The AN/TPS-63 is a two-dimensional medium-range medium altitude transportable mobile radar system which is employed as a tactical gap-filler or as an early warning system for deployment into the operational area. It has a 360-degree air surveillance capability at a range of 160 miles and complements the co-employed AN/TPS-59 three dimensional long-range air surveillance radar system. The AN/TPS-63 is employed by the Marine Air Control Squadron (MACS) as its Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC) in support of air surveillance and air control mission objectives.  Fielded in 1980 this system supported OFS and is addressing numerous DMS and obsolescence issues.Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR AN/TPS-80) - The Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar is a multi-role ground-based expeditionary radar that replaces five legacy radar systems for the Marine Air Ground Task Force.  It satisfies the Marine Air Command and Control System and the Ground Counter Fire/Counter Battery capabilities.  The G/ATOR replaces the AN/TPS-63 and complements the AN/TPS-59 long range radar and will provide mobile multi-functional three-dimensional surveillance of air breathing targets detection of cruise missiles and UAS and the cueing of air defense weapons.  The G/ATOR contributes to the extension of Sea Shield/Sea Strike by surveillance and detection of enemy air threats not seen by Navy sensors in the littorals by participating in a cooperative engagement network of sensors and shooters; G/ATOR enables Integrated Fire Control (IFC) and provides engage/fire on remote capability. G/ATOR surveillance coverage with IFC will provide unprecedented reach volume and precision in the execution of Operational Maneuver From The Sea allowing Naval forces to project and sustain power deep inland. Funding for the G/ATOR program moves to BLI 4655 beginning in FY15.","Navy","2016","Radar Systems","21","4650","Millions","Millions","","0204460M","","","Each","Radar + Equipment (Non-Tel)","Yearly","","","","Communications and Electronics Equipment","PB","2015-02","A","","386","","","","","","","","","","","","",

The FTAS consists of the AN/TPQ-46 Firefinder Radar the AN/TPQ-49 Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar and the AN/TSQ-267 Target Processing Set.  The FTAS is critical in the execution of counterfire and the integration of target acquisition information enabling attack by MAGTF assets.  The FTAS also provides artillery firing units the ability to conduct artillery registration and other friendly fire missions.  The FTAS encompasses the equipment required to support target acquisition within the target acquisition platoon and is resident in the headquarters battery of each artillery regiment.  The program will continue to address system issues that arise due to ODMSMS items within the FTAS.  Also as the US Army divests from the AN/TPQ-46 and AN/TPQ-49 the USMC will have to assume the responsibilities of the primary inventory control activity (PICA).Short/Medium Range Air Defense Radar (SHORAD or AN/TPS-63) - The AN/TPS-63 is a two-dimensional medium-range medium altitude transportable mobile radar system which is employed as a tactical gap-filler or as an early warning system for deployment into the operational area. It has a 360-degree air surveillance capability at a range of 160 miles and complements the co-employed AN/TPS-59 three dimensional long-range air surveillance radar system. The AN/TPS-63 is employed by the Marine Air Control Squadron (MACS) as its Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC) in support of air surveillance and air control mission objectives.  Fielded in 1980 this system supported OFS and is addressing numerous DMS and obsolescence issues.Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR AN/TPS-80) - The Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar is a multi-role ground-based expeditionary radar that replaces five legacy radar systems for the Marine Air Ground Task Force.  It satisfies the Marine Air Command and Control System and the Ground Counter Fire/Counter Battery capabilities.  The G/ATOR replaces the AN/TPS-63 and complements the AN/TPS-59 long range radar and will provide mobile multi-functional three-dimensional surveillance of air breathing targets detection of cruise missiles and UAS and the cueing of air defense weapons.  The G/ATOR contributes to the extension of Sea Shield/Sea Strike by surveillance and detection of enemy air threats not seen by Navy sensors in the littorals by participating in a cooperative engagement network of sensors and shooters; G/ATOR enables Integrated Fire Control (IFC) and provides engage/fire on remote capability. G/ATOR surveillance coverage with IFC will provide unprecedented reach volume and precision in the execution of Operational Maneuver From The Sea allowing Naval forces to project and sustain power deep inland.

Systems include Ground Counter Fire System (GCFS) Improved Position and Azimuth Determing Systems (IPADS) Joint Terminal Attack Controller Laser Target Designator (JTAC LTD) Global Positioning System Survey Replacement (GPSSR) Portable Lightweight Designator Rangefinder (PLDR) Thermal Laser Spot Imager (TLSI) Marine Artillery Survey Set (MASS) and Meteorological Station Group (MSG). Common Laser Range Finder (CLRF):  The CLRF Integrated Capability (CLRF IC) - man portable - replaces the presently fielded suite of equipment.  CLRF IC facilitates target detection recognition and identification by providing optics similar in magnification and field of view to the M-22 binoculars.  It consists of an AN/PEQ-13 laser range finder AN/PVS-14 night vision device and AN/PSN-13 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR). CLRF IC interfaces with Long Range Thermal Imager (LRTI) and Thermal Laser Spot Imager (TLSI) for a 24 hour targeting capability. CLRF IC is the replacement of the current CLRF system and provides a single integrated device incorporating the capabilities of all the devices listed above.  CLRF IC reduces the weight of this capability by 65% over the presently fielded suite of equipment which equips the operating forces with the technological capability to reduce the target location error increasing target location accuracy.  This system represents a comprehensive approach to reducing weight while providing an eye safe laser range finder night-vision capability and a non-magnetic azimuth capability.  CLRF's principle function is to assist the operator in determining target location by measuring distance direction and vertical angle from the operator to the target.  CLRF IC program is consistent with Strategy & Vision 2025 and the Commandant's Planning Guidance.Modeled Meteorological Information Manager (MMIM):  Provides the ability to derive highly accurate meteorological data through the use of Numerical Weather Prediction (i.e. meteorological models).  MMIM will provide this meteorological information to correct artillery mortar and rocket firing data as well as corrections for target locating radars such as the AN/TPQ-46A. MMIM is the replacement system for the Meteorological Station Group (MSG) under Tactical Meteorological Manager (TM2).

Total MPAF/SPAF (3020/3021) Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle(Space) procurement funding is $27153.304M.The Air Force requests funding for the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program in 2 separate P-1 line items. Launch services will be executed from the Evolved Expendable Launch Veh (Space) P-1 line item. Launch capability will be executed from the Evolved Expendable Launch Veh (Infrastructure) P-1 line item. Both line items are necessary to achieve successful placement of National Security Space (NSS) space vehicles (SVs) on-orbit. Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0305953F. Related RDT&E AF funding is contained in PE 0604853F. This exhibit only provides funds for EELV (Space). This program does not require and does not include advance procurement or initial spares. Flyaway Unit Cost is not applicable and Weapon System Unit Cost are not representative due to the mix (medium through heavy) of vehicles in the program. EELV procures launch services and is not a weapon system. The program provides launch capacity for Government National Launch Forecast (NLF) requirements but does not take ownership of any specific launch hardware. The requirements for EELV launch services are derived from multiple spacecraft requirements. "To Complete" projections include only known requirements at this time. The EELV program is a Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) Acquisition Category (ACAT)1D program that acquires launch services to provide critical space support to satisfy Department of Defense (DoD) warfighter national security and other Government space lift missions while fostering inter-agency and commercial cooperation. The EELV program provides satellite delivery to specific orbits through certified Launch Vehicle (LV) providers. To maintain maximum flexibility to meet NSS requirements the Air Force acquires launch services through a white tail concept where designating configurations to specific missions is accomplished just-in-time to meet mission integration requirements. The Air Force structured the EELV program with a new cost saving acquisition strategy that includes a quantity and rate commitment with the current provider and enables competition if one or more New Entrants are certified. This strategy stabilized the industrial base provided predictability to maintain mission success and reduced costs. The Air Force National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) agreed to a coordinated strategy for certification of New Entrants to launch payloads in support of NSS and other USG requirements. The Air Force continues to actively evaluate the addition of New Entrants to reliably launch NSS requirements. Once a New Entrant demonstrates a successful launch the Air Force intends to award integration studies.  If competition is not viable at the time of need missions will be awarded to the incumbent. The Air Force plans to compete launch service procurements beginning in FY18 if there is more than one certified provider for some or all reference orbits. The implementation of this new strategy enables the DoD to reliably place NSS space vehicles into earth orbit. In 2013 the Air Force combined the Launch Services contract and Launch Capability contract into a single contract. The Launch Vehicle Production Services (LVPS) firm-fixed price contract line items include LV manufacturing as well as a Mission Success Incentive fee which incentivizes mission success and are fully funded. Launch propellants are acquired under EELV on a cost reimbursement contract line item.In 2015 Congress added an additional competitive "mission" that will be fully funded in the EELV P-1 line item (i.e. no Capability funds).","Air Force","2016","Evolved Expendable Launch Veh(Space)","23","MSEELV","Millions","Millions","","0604853F","Not applicable (see Appropriation 3021 Space Procurement Air Force documentation.)

This exhibit will display values in "Prior Years PY CY and Total (for 3020)" only; FY16 and beyond is displayed in the corresponding SPAF/3021 exhibits. Total 3020/3021 procurement funding is $7494.947M. Note 2: This P-40 describes SBIRS funding in PE0305915F. The associated RDT&E funding is in RDT&E AF PE 0604441F. Note 3: The flyaway unit cost is not included on the P-40 exhibit because there are multiple P-5 Cost Analysis exhibits. Description: SBIRSs primary mission is to provide initial warning of a ballistic missile attack on the US its deployed forces and its allies. SBIRS enhances detection and improves reporting of intercontinental ballistic missiles submarine launched ballistic missiles and tactical ballistic missiles. SBIRS provides increased detection and tracking performance in order to meet requirements in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD). SBIRS will consist of satellites in Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) and payloads in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) with an integrated centralized ground station serving all SBIRS space elements Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites and other program related support activities. The HEO payloads operate on a classified host. SBIRS GEO-3 and 4 satellites are derivatives of the first two GEO satellites which were delivered on the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract (RDT&E funded). The GEO-3 and 4 satellite production efforts are necessary to meet constellation requirements. In December 2008 the Department approved the procurement of GEO-3 and 4 satellites and the HEO-3 and 4 payloads using a Cost-Plus contract. In order to minimize the number of storage actions and costs and comply with the next assigned Initial Launch Capability (ILC) date of no earlier than April 2016 GEO-3 will be placed into storage.  GEO-4 is planned to launch next (GEO flight #3) with GEO-3 remaining in storage and launching GEO-4 directly out of production.  GEO-4 now flight #3 will launch upon production completion in 3rd quarter FY16.  GEO-3s (flight #4) projected launch window is now not earlier than 4rd quarter FY17.GEO-5 and 6 satellites are planned as derivatives of the GEO-3 and 4 satellites and will be replacements for GEOs 1 and 2. A three phased contract approach awarded non-recurring engineering and parts obsolescence using advanced procurement funds on 10 Sep 2012 followed by award of long lead items on 19 Feb 2013 and full production on 24 Jun 2014. The full production effort includes 2 satellites launch vehicle integration launch and early orbit test dual band modification (unified S-Band) contractor operations support through operational acceptance and Interim Contractor Support (ICS). GEO-5 and 6 are being procured through the Department of Defense Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) approach which seeks stable production and strategic sub-tier management through the block buy of space vehicles employing fixed-priced contracting. The SBIRS block buy of two satellites enables savings by reducing the effect of obsolescence and production breaks. Additionally ESP seeks cost efficiencies with the prime and subcontractor team through block buys and a healthy space industrial base. For the GEO 5-6 block buy the FY13 NDAA authorizes six years of incremental funding and limits the incrementally funded contract obligation to $3900M. The years of incremental funding are FY13-18. Advance procurement was appropriated in FY11 and FY12. GEO 5-6 advance procurement and incremental funding are attributed to FY13 for the purposes of identifying full funding for procurement end items. Each year of appropriation FY13-18 is in two parts the incrementally funded contract amount and annual program support costs. The incrementally funded amount complies with the NDAA cap. SBIRS HEO-3 and 4 payloads are replenishments for HEO-1 and 2 payloads which were delivered on the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract (RDT&E funded). The HEO-1 and 2 payloads are on-orbit and certified for Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) missile warning operations and certified for technical intelligence operations. HEO-3 payload has been delivered to the classified host. To-complete costs are zero for SBIRS GEO 3-4 per the SBIRS Service Cost Position (SCP) dated April 14 2011. To-complete costs for GEOs 5-6 are based on continuing Program Office support through satellite delivery. Total GEO 3-4 3020/3021 funds are $2846.667M. Total GEO 5-6 3020/3021 funds are $3499.011M.

Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS): TACP Fixed and Portable Simulators are JTC TRS.  This simulator project trains personnel controlling air support for combat operations by providing both a stand-alone and Distributed Mission Operations (DMO)-capable high-fidelity JTAC and Combat Control Team (CCT) simulation system.  The JTC TRS will be able to connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity close air support platforms JTACs and CCTs to train together in a risk-free environment. The Fixed simulator enables operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) training/mission rehearsal using tailored dynamic scenarios that are relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore the simulator will be capable of providing tactical air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application of austere airbase operations.  The JTAC simulators provide DMO capability to network with aircrew full mission trainers mission training centers and Air Support Operations Centers (ASOC).   Its primary focus is to provide an air-ground virtual training environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop both JTAC and CCT skills and train aircrew to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to friendly ground forces. JTAC simulators will be fully interoperable with joint/sister Service air ground simulation using industry standards.  Training with simulators has the potential to reduce civilian casualties collateral damage and fratricide by improving coordination skills between air and ground personnel and increasing JTAC and aircrew proficiency.  The acquisition strategy for production of the fixed configuration of the JTC TRS will be executed as an evolutionary acquisition approach using incremental development. Until the production system is ready for fielding interim simulators will be fielded to support JTAC qualification training and readiness for deployable JTACs.  TACP C2 Simulator:  The TACP C2 simulator is named the Joint Theater Air-Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS).  The simulator is for training ASOC and Special Operations Forces (SOF) personnel to perform command and control (C2) battlestaff operations.  The C2 simulator will operate in either a stand-alone mode or connected to other DMO-capable high-fidelity simulation facilities to allow geographically-separated Theater Air Control System C2 elements CAS platforms and JTAC and CCT personnel to train in an integrated virtual environment. The simulator will enable operators to conduct C2 training and mission rehearsal of JCAS assets using tailored dynamic scenarios that are relevant to current real-world mission taskings.  Scenarios will cover the full range of military operations.  Training with the simulator will improve mission effectiveness by reducing the risk of civilian casualties collateral damage and fratricide by improving C2 skills in rapidly changing and uncertain combat environments.  The JTAGSS program will enable procurement of an estimated three JTAGSS for air support operations training. The acquisition strategy for the TACP C2 simulator will be to field advance technology demonstration units in two increments.  Increment 1 will field initial capability to perform proof of concept and technology validation of mission simulations for all ASOC crew positions including detailed communications planning asset deconfliction integration of joint fires and other critical mission areas required for integrated TACP/ASOC C2 mission success.  At the completion of the technology validation a contract will be competitively awarded to complete simulator development deployment and integration.PE 0207422F Deployable C3 Systems THEATER-DEPLOYABLE COMMUNICATIONS (TDC) PROGRAM: TDC provides the Air Force with rapidly deployable communication infrastructure package which provides deployed users with secure and non-secure voice service internet access local area network network management information assurance e-mail services (NIPR/SIPRNet) and intra/interbase connectivity services similar to those established on a fixed base.

Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS): TACP Fixed and Portable Simulators are JTC TRS.  This simulator project trains personnel controlling air support for combat operations by providing both a stand-alone and Distributed Mission Operations (DMO)-capable high-fidelity JTAC and Combat Control Team (CCT) simulation system.  The JTC TRS will be able to connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity close air support platforms JTACs and CCTs to train together in a risk-free environment. The Fixed simulator enables operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) training/mission rehearsal using tailored dynamic scenarios that are relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore the simulator will be capable of providing tactical air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application of austere airbase operations.  The JTAC simulators provide DMO capability to network with aircrew full mission trainers mission training centers and Air Support Operations Centers (ASOC).   Its primary focus is to provide an air-ground virtual training environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop both JTAC and CCT skills and train aircrew to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to friendly ground forces. JTAC simulators will be fully interoperable with joint/sister Service air ground simulation using industry standards.  Training with simulators has the potential to reduce civilian casualties collateral damage and fratricide by improving coordination skills between air and ground personnel and increasing JTAC and aircrew proficiency.  The acquisition strategy for production of the fixed configuration of the JTC TRS will be executed as an evolutionary acquisition approach using incremental development. Until the production system is ready for fielding interim simulators will be fielded to support JTAC qualification training and readiness for deployable JTACs.  TACP C2 Simulator:  The TACP C2 simulator is named the Joint Theater Air-Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS).  The simulator is for training ASOC and Special Operations Forces (SOF) personnel to perform command and control (C2) battlestaff operations.  The C2 simulator will operate in either a stand-alone mode or connected to other DMO-capable high-fidelity simulation facilities to allow geographically-separated Theater Air Control System C2 elements CAS platforms and JTAC and CCT personnel to train in an integrated virtual environment. The simulator will enable operators to conduct C2 training and mission rehearsal of JCAS assets using tailored dynamic scenarios that are relevant to current real-world mission taskings.  Scenarios will cover the full range of military operations.  Training with the simulator will improve mission effectiveness by reducing the risk of civilian casualties collateral damage and fratricide by improving C2 skills in rapidly changing and uncertain combat environments.  The JTAGSS program will enable procurement of an estimated three JTAGSS for air support operations training. The acquisition strategy for the TACP C2 simulator will be to field advance technology demonstration units in two increments.  Increment 1 will field initial capability to perform proof of concept and technology validation of mission simulations for all ASOC crew positions including detailed communications planning asset deconfliction integration of joint fires and other critical mission areas required for integrated TACP/ASOC C2 mission success.  At the completion of the technology validation a contract will be competitively awarded to complete simulator development deployment and integration.PE 0207422F Deployable C3 Systems THEATER-DEPLOYABLE COMMUNICATIONS (TDC) PROGRAM: TDC provides the Air Force with rapidly deployable communication infrastructure package which provides deployed users with secure and non-secure voice service internet access local area network network management information assurance e-mail services (NIPR/SIPRNet) and intra/interbase connectivity services similar to those established on a fixed base.

It employs the Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cell already resident in the BCT Headquarters as the command and control (C2) element; uses the existing radars in the Target Acquisition Platoon of the Fires Battalion as the Sense element; and adds enhanced C2 warning devices controllers and dedicated communications devices between the existing radars ADAM Cell and warning devices.  Integration of this equipment provides a Warn capability to the BCTs for detection of threat IDF rounds and transmission of the detection data to the C2 element for correlation and determination of a predicted point of impact (POI).  Based on the POI the C2 then determines which warning nodes should send "Incoming" warning alarms and transmits this information to the appropriate warning nodes.  In addition to the representative RAM Warn capability fielded to each BCT Army Pre-positioned Stocks (APS) equipment sets are being procured to supplement the fielded capability based on mission needs.  Timely warning will enable those BCT personnel in the hazard area of an inbound IDF threat to seek cover or a prone position prior to impact thus reducing casualties.  The Capability Production Document (CPD) was approved in August 2010 and an update was approved in May 2012 to reflect the name change to RAM Warn.  An initial operational test (IOT) was conducted during November 2012 as part of Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) 13.1 and the RAM Warn Milestone C Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision occurred on 19 December 2012.  In April 2014 RAM Warn was approved for entry into the Full Rate Production (FRP) acquisition phase based on successful completion of LRIP exit criteria including Full Materiel Release.Near-term directed enhancements to the C-RAM system-of-systems (SoS) capability include use of Army tactical communications rather than commercial systems and integration of Warn functionality into the command and control (C2) workstation to reduce complexity and footprint.The Counter-Rocket Artillery Mortar (C-RAM) Intercept program provides a counter-RAM capability to the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC)/Avenger battalions 5-5 and 2-44 Air Defense Artillery(ADA) to defend against and defeat the enduring indirect fire threat.  This capability is provided by fielding existing Land-based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS) guns previously deployed as a part of the C-RAM quick reaction capability; the guns undergo reset prior to fielding.  C-RAM Intercept transitioned to an acquisition program with the approval of the C-RAM Intercept Capability Production Document (CPD) on 22 Aug 2013 and the Army Acquisition Executive's approval of an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 23 Aug 2013 authorizing the program's entry into the acquisition management system as a post-Milestone C Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program under the management of the Program Executive Officer Missiles and Space.

Launch services will be executed from the Evolved Expendable Launch Veh (Space) P-1 line item. Launch capability will be executed from the Evolved Expendable Launch Veh (Infrastructure) P-1 line item. Both these line items are necessary to achieve successful placement of National Security Space (NSS) space vehicles (SVs) on-orbit. Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0305953F. Related RDT&E AF funding is contained in PE 0604853F. This exhibit only provides funding for Evolved Expendable Launch Veh (Infrastructure). As of the FY16 PB submission space programs procurement funding has been re-categorized from appropriation 3020 Missile Procurement Air Force (MPAF) to appropriation 3021 Space Procurement Air Force (SPAF) in FY16 and beyond.  This exhibit will display values in Prior Years PY CY and Total (for MPAF/3020) only; FY16 and beyond is displayed in the corresponding SPAF/3021 exhibits.  Total Evolved Expendable Launch Veh (Infrastructure) procurement funding is $14529.370MThis program does not require and does not include advance procurement or initial spares. Flyaway Unit Cost is not applicable and Weapon System Unit Cost are not representative due to the mix (medium through heavy) of vehicles in the program. EELV procures launch services and is not a weapon system. The program provides launch capacity for Government National Launch Forecast (NLF) requirements but does not take ownership of any specific launch hardware. The requirements for EELV launch services are derived from multiple spacecraft requirements. "To Complete" projections include only known requirements at this time. The EELV program is a Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program that acquires launch services to provide critical space support required to satisfy Department of Defense (DoD) warfighter national security and other Government space lift missions while fostering interagency and commercial cooperation. The EELV program provides satellite delivery to specific orbits through certified launch vehicle providers. To maintain maximum flexibility to meet NSS requirements Air Force acquires launch services through a white tail concept where designating configurations to specific missions is accomplished just-in-time to meet mission integration requirements. The Air Force structured the EELV program with a new cost saving acquisition strategy that includes a quantity and rate commitment with the current provider and enables competition if one or more New Entrants are certified. This strategy stabilized the industrial base provided predictability to maintain mission success and reduced costs. The Air Force National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) agreed to a coordinated strategy for certification of New Entrants to launch payloads in support of NSS and other USG requirements. The Air Force continues to actively evaluate the addition of New Entrants to reliably launch NSS requirements. Once a New Entrant demonstrates a successful launch the Air Force intends to award integration studies. If competition is not viable at the time of need missions will be awarded to the incumbent. The Air Force plans to compete launch service procurements beginning in FY18 if there is more than one certified provider for some or all reference orbits. The implementation of this new strategy enables the DoD to reliably place NSS space vehicles into earth orbit. In 2013 the Air Force combined the Launch Services contract and Launch Capability contract into a single contract. The Launch Capability cost plus incentive fee contract line items are annual options and provide launch infrastructure support which includes but is not limited to systems and factory engineering program management standard integration/testing launch and range activities infrastructure parts obsolescence mitigation post mission analysis and studies and analysis. The contract features a Mission Success Incentive fee which incentivizes both mission success and cost control for cost plus contract line items.","Air Force","2016","EVOLVED EXPENDABLE LAUNCH CAPABILITY","22","MSEELC","Millions","Millions","","0604853F","As of the FY16 PB submission space programs procurement funding has be re-categorized from appropriation 3020 Missile Procurement Air Force (MPAF) to appropriation 3021 Space Procurement Air Force (SPAF) in FY16 and beyond.

Systems range in size from 9000 to 60000 British Thermal Units/hour (BTU/hr) and are powered by common electrical currents supplied by both mobile electric power systems and standard commercial facilities.  IECUs also provide dehumidification and filtering of air in support of environmentally sensitive electronic equipment in mobile shelters and vans.  IECUs support critical electronic equipment that would not support the Army mission without proper environmental control.  The majority of the supported weapon systems are command control and communication items. Other applications include medical facilities force provider systems support equipment satellite communications intelligence gathering systems petroleum and water logistics laboratories electronic shop sets Test Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) aviation shop sets and topographic support sets.The Improved Environmental Control Unit (IECU) program will provide a new generation of Environmental Control Units (ECUs) that use environmentally approved refrigerants with zero ozone-depleting chemicals (ODCs) to replace the current Military Standard (MIL-STD) Family of ECUs. IECUs are required to replace currently fielded environmental control units in order to comply with statutory and regulatory restrictions on the use of Class II Ozone Depleting Chemicals (ODCs) and to increase the performance of military ECUs. They are form fit and function replacements to the current MIL-STD ECUs. IECUs operate at wider operating temperatures are more ruggedized than commercial ECUs and employ embedded diagnostics and automatic safety controls. Technical improvements over existing military-standard ECUs will yield significant fuel and weight savings reduction in scheduled maintenance and increased reliability.The 60000 British Thermal Units per hour (BTU/H) Improved Environmental Control Unit (IECU) program replaces the heavy and inefficient fielded Environmental Control Units that utilize ozone depleting refrigerants.  The 60000 BTU/HR IECU will be a replacement for the existing Army 54000-BTU/HR Environmental Control Unit (ECU) and Air Force developed 66000-BTU/HR Field Deployable Environmental Control Unit. The 60000 BTU/H IECU will be lighter in weight than the existing military ECUs.   The Large Capacity Field Heater (LCFH) provides 400000 BTUH.  It is used to heat maintenance tents specifically the Lightweight Maintenance Enclosure (LME) in cold environments so that soldiers can safely repair a wide variety of equipment such as trucks tanks helicopters and air defense and field artillery systems.  It is thermostatically controlled and uses either diesel or JP-8 fuel to produce heat. This supports the single fuel on the battlefield concept.  The LCFH is mobile and delivers both heated and re-circulated fresh and vented air through sealed detachable flexible ducts.  It is suitable for use in temperate and arctic environments. It replaces the dangerous outdated gasoline powered 400000 BTUH Herman Nelson Heater.  The LCFH is safer for personnel operating equipment in enclosed areas because it eliminates carbon monoxide emissions within the shelters.

Within this vision Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) remains a Navy core competency in a dynamic and uncertain maritime environment.  U.S. adversaries continue to develop asymmetric capabilities and capacities to deter disrupt or delay the entry of U.S. and allied naval forces and pose a constant challenge as we implement the Maritime Strategy.  Evolving submarine technologies offer enhanced stealth speed endurance weapons and operational proficiency trends foretelling that the adversary submarine of the future will have a significantly larger sphere of influence while presenting less vulnerability to ASW forces.  The effective offensive engagement range of the adversary submarine of the future will continue to match or outrange individual U.S. and multinational platform sensors and weapons in many tactical environments.  Submarines are an increasing threat to all Naval and Allied ships particularly modern diesel subs and faster torpedoes.  Not only can the presence of potential hostile submarines delay naval combatant action until they are located and neutralized submarines can also disrupt all seaborne logistics supply for any ground campaign as well as maritime commerce.  ASW forces must be effective in all operating environments ranging from the deep open ocean to the littorals and are key to countering adversarial anti-access and area denial strategies.The AN/SQQ-89(V) Surface Ship ASW Combat System provides integrated Undersea Warfare (USW) combat management fire control command and control and on-board training to enable surface combatants to engage USW targets in both open ocean and littoral environments.  The AN/SQQ-89(V) is a system comprised of many subsystems which integrate the helo and its sensors the ship's own organic sensors weapons torpedo detection and a high fidelity Surface ASW Synthetic Trainer (SAST).  The AN/SQQ-89(V) was established as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) I acquisition program in 1983 and re-designated an ACAT IC program in 1990.  In 1998 the AN/SQQ-89(V) program was deemed to be 90% complete and removed from the Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) list.Variants of the AN/SQQ-89(V) are currently in operation on practically all in-service CG47 DDG51 and FFG7 Class Surface Combatants.  The AN/SQQ-89(V) is also programmed for all in-line new construction DDG51 Class ships under Shipbuilding and Conversion Navy (SCN) Budget Line Item (BLI) 2122 while a separate AN/SQQ-90 version is programmed for all in-line new construction DDG1000 Class ships under SCN BLI 2119.AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Surface Ship USW Combat System Upgrade - Detailed Description:A major upgrade to the AN/SQQ-89(V) legacy system the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade significantly decreases ship vulnerability to torpedo attack improves surface ship USW shallow water warfighting capability in the littoral and mitigates Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) obsolescence and supportability issues.  The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade was reported as a critical need for surface ASW operations by SECNAV.  A Fleet Forces Command (FFC) Urgent Operational Need (UON) report identified the Fleet need for AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrades.  The need for the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 is also articulated in the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) Integrated Priorities List (IPL); in an Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) funding priorities letter; in a 7th Fleet Bottom Up review report; and in the U.S. Fleet Forces ASW Integrated Priorities Capability List (IPCL).The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade is programmed for backfit on: Select CG47 Class Baseline 3 and 4 (CG59-73) ships via OPN BLI 0960 (Cruiser Modernization); DDG51 Class Flight I/II (DDG51-78) ships via OPN BLI 0900 (DDG Modernization) and OPN BLI 2136 (represented here); and DDG51 Class Flight IIA and follow (DDG79+) ships via OPN BLI 2136 (represented here).The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade developed under RDT&EN PE 0205620N capitalizes on previously fielded AN/SQQ-89(V)15 systems. The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 is comprised of a tactical towed array sensor the TB-37 Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA) and will replace standard militarized legacy components with Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware to provide an ASW combat system with the capability for mid-frequency bistatic and multi-static sonar operations.  The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 features a mid-frequency bistatic hull/towed Sonar Echo Tracker Classifier (ETC); hull/towed Sonar with Acoustic Intercept (ACI) fused data for significantly improved torpedo defense; Handling & Stowage Group (H&SG) for MFTA operation; Torpedo Setting Panel (TSP); passive towed array processing; common sub/surface sensor performance and prediction; common NAVAIR/Surface Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) processing; portable software; integrated supportability; and on-board training via the SAST.  The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 will be interoperable with AEGIS Weapons System (AWS) baselines; is Open Architecture (OA) compliant (meeting OA Level 3 requirements); provides significant reductions in weight space cooling and power requirements over legacy AN/SQQ-89(V) systems; is Grade A shock qualified; supports Digital Fire Control Integration (DFCI) capability; and is integrated with the Battle Force Tactical Trainer (BFTT).Additionally to be effective against increasingly stealthy threats in an often ambiguous undersea environment future sensors must be environmentally adaptive have very low false alarm rates and exploit the full range of current and future submarine detection vulnerabilities.  Via the Advanced Capability Build (ACB) process under RDT&EN PE 0205620N (ACB-13 ACB-15 ACB-17 etc.) these types of maturing/proven USW technologies will be folded into the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 production and future technology refresh programs.The majority of the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 system equipment is procured via the prime vendor (currently Lockheed Martin NY and VA with subcontract to Advanced Acoustic Concepts (AAC) NY and PA) while other Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) such as that for the TB-37 MFTA OK-410 H&SG SAST Static Automated Bus Transfer System (SABTS) TSP Calibrated Reference Hydrophone (CRH) Junction Box Portable Towed Array Test Set (PTATS) On Board Repair Parts (OBRPs) Maintenance Assist Modules (MAMS) Installation Checkout (INCO) Spares and Special Tools and Test Equipment (STTE) is procured via other separate contract/funding vehicles.An average aggregate AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 shipset unit cost is indicated on the applicable budget exhibits however it should be noted that this unit cost is comprised of multiple contract/funding vehicles as mentioned above.  Additionally the subdivision of these unit costs to a specific ship can vary substantially as they are dependent on the pre-existing configuration of each ship.AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 production shipset delivery time is 18 months after contract award.  Each subsequent system procured in an FY is delivered one month later than the previous system.  Delivery of equipment to the shipyard is required no later than 30-90 days prior to a CONUS (Continental U.S.) installation start date and no later than 120 days prior to a non-CONUS installation start date.  Installations are assigned to specific ships as per Fleet priorities/requirements and based on ship availabilities.

The MH-60S helicopter will be adapted for the AMCM mission in support of the development of an Organic Fleet AMCM program.  The equipment is divided into three categories -- minesweeping minehunting and  mine neutralization.  (1) Minesweeping is performed by mechanical or influence sweeps.  In mechanical sweeping the mine mooring is severed by the sweep gear allowing the mine to float to the surface where it is destroyed.  In influence sweeping a magnetic or acoustic field which simulates the magnetic/acoustic signature of a ship is introduced into the water.  This field causes the mine mechanism to actuate.  (2)  In minehunting the object is to actually locate and classify mine-like objects (usually by means of high resolution sonar). (3) Then neutralize mines using explosive devices.  AMCM squadrons currently have mechanical magnetic and acoustic sweeping capabilities and mine surveillance and marking capabilities.  Their mission is to locate classify identify and neutralize moored surface and bottom mines.Current world mining threats have resulted in increased operational demand of systems to perform AMCM missions. Fleet requires increased AMCM capability to address warfighting gaps and the reliability maintainability and availability of critical systems to perform world-wide operations. Program provides systems to address a global threat and serve to deter placement of mines to allow ships to transit freely.  Lack of AMCM capability will result in loss of the Fleet's ability to conduct freedom of maneuver increasing risk to ships while operating in mine threat areas.[P5 / S0020 MODIFICATIONS]: Funds are provided for the modification and product improvements of Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) systems to accommodate replacement of subsystems/components because of safety maintainability reliability and obsolescence issues.  Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) are analyzed prioritized and screened to accommodate replacement of subsystems/components. Funding for this effort is designated in all fiscal years.[P5 - 2 / S0024 AN/AQS-24 Sonar]: AN/AQS-24 sonar is an in-service mine detection system that detects classifies localizes and identifies sea mines.  The sonar sensor is deployed from the MH-53E helicopter and is used against moored and bottom mines. AN/AQS-24B provides High Speed Sythetic Aperature Sonar (SAS). AN/AQS-24C provides Volume Search Capability.[P5 - 3 / S0061 - MK-105 MOD 4]: Minesweeping Sled - The MK-105 MOD 4 magnetic mine-sweeping system is on a hydrofoil platform that carries a turbo-generator power pack and is towed by the MH-53E helicopter allowing for safe high speed sweeping of magnetic influence mines. The production line was shut down in FY2001. This funding re-starts the production line and manufactures new MK-105 MOD 4 systems.[P5 - 4 / S0065 - AMNS]: AN/ASQ-235 - AMNS is a mine neutralization system that provides a remotely controlled expendable neutralizer vehicle deployed from the MH-60S and MH-53E helicopter platform to reacquire identify and neutralize moored or proud bottom sea mines.Note: LCS Mission Modules are procured under BLI 1601.[P5 - 5 / S0075 - ALMDS]: AN/AES-1 is a mine detection system that provides a light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system for rapid detection classification and localization of near surface sea mines.

When the MCM mission package is embarked LCS is capable of conducting detect-to-engage operations (hunting sweeping and neutralization) against shallow and deep-water sea mine threats. The MCM mission package provides these capabilities through the use of sensors and weapons deployed from an embarked MH-60S multi-mission helicopter and unmanned off-board vehicles. The embarked MH-60S employs the Organic Airborne Mine Countermeasures Module to provide rapid minehunting and clearing using helicopter deployed systems.  Future  phases will add the Coastal Mine Reconnaissance Module (CMRM) to allow detection of minefield patterns and obstacles from an embarked Fire Scout Vertical Takeoff and Landing Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (VTUAV) a surface influence sweep capability for high-speed influence minesweeping and the Surface Mine Countermeasures Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (SMCM/UUV) to detect buried mines. When complete the MCM mission package will provide full capability against floating tethered bottom and buried mines. Two MCM mission packages (RDTE prior years) have been delivered and a third (OPN prior year) is in production.The MCM Mission Package is deployable and capable of meeting its focused mission requirements on an LCS only when it includes the full complement of Common Mission Modules Equipment (Line Item Number 1600) and the full complement of mission systems that comprise the LCS MCM Mission Module (Line Item Number 1601) and Remote Minehunting Systems (RMS) (Line Item Number 1605).  If mission systems are removed in any given Fiscal Year the MCM Mission Package will be non-deployable until the mission systems are replaced in a subsequent Fiscal Year.LCS deployments are based on a 3:2:1 rule.  This means 3 crews will man 2 ships/mission packages with 1 ship and mission package (with crew) deployed continuously. The three crews will rotate on a fixed interval between being deployed on the LCS training while CONUS based LCS and conducting basic training and certifications while off-hull  at the LCS Squadron and Littoral Training Facility.Mission Module crews will follow a similar rotation on the same interval: 1) Off-hull training at LCSRON and Littoral Training Facility (2) Training on hull aboard the CONUS based LCS preparing for the upcoming crew swap in theater (3) Man their deployed mission package in theater on the deployed LCS.  Therefore if the total number of LCS (including modified LCS) is 52 then 26 mission packages and their crews will be deployed continuously and an additional 26 mission packages will be embarked on the homeport LCS with their crews conducting work-ups for the upcoming interval on a forward deployed LCS.The number of LCS mission packages must not only keep pace with the number of ships (52) more are required to account for the mission packages that will be unavailable for training on the non-deployed LCSs.Other Related Budgets: BLIs: OPN 1600 OPN 1602 OPN 1603 OPN 1605 OPN 4248 OPN 2622 OPN 2624 WPN 4221 WPN 4225 RDT&E 0603596NMCM MP Quantities Procured:Prior Years: 2 full MCM MPs 1 training asset (non-deployable)FY 2014: MCM = part of 1FY 2015: MCM = part of 1*FY 2016: MCM = 2FY 2017: MCM = 2FY 2018: MCM = 2FY 2019: MCM = 2FY 2020: MCM = 1Total MCM MPs Delivered/Deployable:Prior Years: 0FY 2014: MCM = 1FY 2015: MCM = 2FY 2016: MCM = 2FY 2017: MCM = 3*FY 2018: MCM = 5FY 2019: MCM = 7FY 2020: MCM = 9*FY15 MCM MP (delivering in FY17) relies on RMMV mod kits to upgrade 4.0 versions to 6.0 which is funded in Line Item Number 1605.Prior to FY13 MCM mission module systems were funded under OPN BLI 1600.

The Distributed Common Ground System-Marine Corps (DCGS-MC) concept originated with the DCGS Mission Area Initial Capabilities Document (MA ICD) Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM 001-03) dated 6 January 2003 which established the overarching requirements for a collection of net-centric capable systems that will contribute to joint and combined Warfighter needs for ISR support.  The DCGS-MC requirements were further validated by the JROC approved DCGS-MC Enterprise Capabilities Development Document on 17 November 2010.  Each service is directed to pursue a coordinated developmental path based on a set of common enterprise services consistent with the DoD's net-centric vision.  Furthermore each service's DCGS solution is to evolve independently through the implementation of common enterprise architecture and standards.  DCGS-MC will develop and procure "Enterprise" services and optimize existing geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) capabilities using the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) as a basic building block for interoperability between the Service DCGS programs.  The Enterprise DIB Services (EDS) represent the procurement solution for DCGS-MC fulfilling the joint mandate.  The system design is comprised of integrated Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) software packages originally developed under the Air Force DCGS 10.2 baseline.  DCGS Community Governance and oversight is provided by OUSD (I).  In FY 2010 DCGS-MC integrated the legacy GEOINT capabilities of the Tactical Exploitation Group (TEG) family of Systems and Topographic Production Capability (TPC) family of systems.  Virtual Imagery Processing - MC is targeted to replace TEG Main during FY15.  As a result DCGS-MC is responsible for providing all lifecycle support for these systems. In FY 2015 DCGS-MC subsumes the capability of the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) program previously located in BLI 4747.","Navy","2016","Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS-MC)","28","4767","Millions","Dollars","","0505208M","FY 2014 Base Appropriation: $11.392MFY 2014 funding provided the Enterprise DIB Service (EDS) solution as well as initial contract support for DCGS-MC GEOINT capabilities.

Baseline funding is also required to procure containers for all rocket components to support USN/USMC expeditionary concept of operations from CVN and L-Class surface combatants.  Additionally FY16 baseline funding is required to address product improvements needed for components designed and first produced over 40 years ago as well as the production engineering and integrated logistics support needed for all 2.75-inch rocket components.OCO: FY16 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding is required to replenish 2.75-inch rocket motors warheads and APKWS guidance sections that were expended during combat operations in support of Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS).  FY16 OCO funding is also required for production engineering support of rocket components procured and produced to replenish OCO expenditures.  Failure to replenish OCO rocket component expenditures will require USMC H-1 aircraft to employ more expensive weapons (i.e. Hellfire) to neutralize low-cost soft/lightly armored targets and simultaneously challenge the ability of the USN H-60 fleet to effectively counter the FAC/FIAC threat.MK-66 rocket motors are needed for combat operations and OCO funding will aid in the replenishment of rocket motor inventory levels. The MK-66 motor is used as the component motor in all 2.75-inch rocket configurations.  With an increase in pre deployment training as well as combat operations additional procurement is required to meet the needs of the warfighter and to ensure inventory is maintained.The M282/APKWS fielding is needed to engage armored and hardened targets with low-cost low-CDE weapons limit weaponeering options available to battlefield commanders in close-air-support (CAS) missions. The MK-152 warhead with MK-435 fuze is needed to permit the warfighter to engage the enemy at closer ranges increasing accuracy with a safer more reliable warhead.  This will provide sufficient inventory to support the current OCO operational tempo with warheads providing greater lethality and reduced collateral damage.APKWS integration on MH-60S platforms is complete.  Integration on the MH-60R will complete in FY15.

It provides the foundation required for all future Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) enterprise modifications through a customized implementation of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware with a software intensive architecture. The Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) Block 40/45 Upgrade provides a single target/single track capability with an improved human-machine interface for time-critical targeting designed to increase combat effectiveness and reduce fratricide. The Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) Block 40/45 Upgrade includes an upgrade to Electronic Support Measures (ESM) sensor data processing; data fusion of both off-board and on-board sensor data through multi-source integration (MSI); a Data Link Infrastructure (DLI) upgrade with prioritized data link bandwidth management; new battle management tools; capability to parse allow user access to and integrate updates to Tactical Data Information Link (TADIL)-J message formats and protocols; enhanced mission and console recording capabilities while maintaining legacy chat communications and on-board training; modification of system software to accommodate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS).  The modification will be installed on multiple trainers and ground systems. The development of the training systems the Mission Crew Training Set (MCTS) and Mission Computing Maintenance Trainer (MCMT) began in FY11 and each type was delivered to the user in FY14. Under the Mission Computing Maintenance Trainer (MCMT) contract line item the program developed ground systems used for mission planning and post-mission processing consisting of stationary ground stations at Tinker Elmendorf and Kadena locations (up to 150) and Deployable Ground Systems (DGS) [up to ten (10)] for use when the aircraft deploys to locations other than Kadena and Elmendorf.  In FY13 the program office began Depot Activation activities to comply with Sources of Repair Assignment Program (SORAP) 09-063 that mandates organic hardware and software maintenance; Depot Activation activities will continue until FY18.  Hardware Depot Activation will procure the required resources (test equipment modules training repair documentation etc.) to support the E-3G.  Funding for organic software and hardware maintenance will support stand-up of the Depot facility at the Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex GA for repairs of selected units and the stand-up of the Avionics Integration Support Facility (AISF) at Tinker AFB to perform mission computing software maintenance activities.  FY16 Plan: Program continues to complete the block mod upgrade to the 40/45 configuration (E-3G). Five (5) aircraft will commence modification and three (3) of the jets that began mod in FY15 will be delivered to the Wing.  Due to end of life issues for a majority of the programmatic COTS equipment the program office will have to contract for engineering support to procure the last four (4) aircraft 40/45 kits as well as retrofit the six (6) LRIP jets into this DMS configuration. The program plans to award a contract inclusive of one last Life of Type (LoT) buy to procure ten (10) B kits six (6) to be used to retrofit the LRIP jets and the other B kits to modify the remaining Block 30/35 jets. Additionally in FY16 the program will continue to support the warfighter via ICS while at the same time executing various Depot Activation activities to comply with Sources of Repair Assignment Program (SORAP) 09-063.The FY15 President's Budget sought to divest seven (7) E-3 aircraft which would have reduced the fleet size from thirty one (31) to twenty four (24).  Congress rejected the Air Force's proposed FY15 AWACS divesture and in response the Air Force re-phased the E-3 force reduction of seven (7) aircraft from FY16 to FY19.  The Block 40/45 Upgrade is postured in accordance with the FY19 force reduction and as such will execute to a programmatic baseline of twenty four (24) aircraft.  Low Rate Initial Production was approved for six (6) aircraft in November 2008 [one (1) buy in FY09 two (2) buys in FY10 and three (3) buys in FY12]. The Block 40/45 Full Rate Production was approved in November 2012 for the remaining twenty five (25) aircraft and technology refresh of the six (6) LRIP aircraft; the corresponding production contract was awarded on 27 December 2012.  The divestiture of seven (7) aircraft will reduce the quantity of production aircraft from twenty five (25) to eighteen (18).Funding for this modification had previously been contained in Weapon System Code (WSC) E00300 but as part of the Major Programs Transparency Act and starting in FY15 the AWACS Block 40/45 Upgrade (MDAP) was moved to WSC E34045.

The U-2S model airframes were constructed in the late 1980s with the last aircraft rolling off the assembly line in 1989. The U-2S provides global reconnaissance signals intelligence (SIGINT) and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) 24 hours a day seven days a week in support of national and DoD worldwide missions. The U-2 is currently deployed to forward operating locations (FOL) around the world. Modifications to the aircraft are required to ensure continued operational effectiveness in support of Combatant Commander Requirements and in accordance with previous NDAA guidance.In the 2013 PB the Air Force decided to retain the U-2 weapon system instead of retiring it.  At that time sustainment efforts and capability upgrades to the platform and sensors were pursued to support National and Combatant Commander requirements. In the 2015 PB the Air Force decided to retire the U-2 in 2016.  In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2244a the U-2 weapon system is identified as Equipment Scheduled For Retirement Or Disposal: Limitation On Expenditures For Modifications stating that modification to any aircraft (i.e. a given tail number weapon or item of equipment that the SECAF plans to retire or otherwise dispose of within 5 years after the date on which the modification would be completed) are prohibited.  In the 2016 PB the Air Force re-phases U-2 divestiture to begin in FY2019 and to complete no later than FY2020.  In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2244a the Secretary of the Air Force may waive the prohibition on modifications if the Secretary determines that carrying out the modification is in the national security interest of the United States. Therefore modifications required to address sustainment issues (diminishing manufacturing sources vanishing vendor items) or operational utility may be submitted to the Secretary for approval to ensure operational effectiveness and to comply with guidance received in previous and current NDAAs for the timeframe of phased divestiture.  The U-2 Program will continue to address reliability maintainability sustainability and safety issues and support U-2 integration of payloads and capabilities by taking prudent acquisition actions to meet operational requirements comply with previous NDAA guidance and IAW 10 U.S.C.  Prudent acquisition activities also include trade studies analyses preliminary systems engineering system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution as well as studies supporting analysis and investment in future U-2 program planning.","Air Force","2016","U-2 Mods","38","11U200","Millions","Millions","","0305202F","Where applicable justification for individual modifications is provided in the P-3A exhibits.","Aircraft Procurement Air Force","Each","Other Aircraft","Yearly","3010F","5","5","Modification of Inservice Aircraft","PB","2015-02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",

AEHF satellites will replenish the existing EHF system (Milstar) providing much higher capacity and data rate (5x increase over Milstar II) capabilities. AEHF is a cooperative program that includes International Partners (Canada the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of the Netherlands). The AEHF procurement program element funds the Command and Control System - Consolidated (CCS-C) mission unique software and databases for AEHF 4-6 satellites. CCS-C provides launch and early orbit support and on-orbit anomaly resolution. AEHF Space Vehicle-3 (SV-3) and SV-4 are derivatives of the first two AEHF satellites which were delivered on the AEHF System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract (RDT&E funded). SV-3 was successfully launched on 18 Sep 2013. SV-4 has a projected launch availability of 3QFY17. SVs 5 and 6 are being procured under the Department of Defense's Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) approach which enables stable production and strategic sub-tier management through the block buy of space vehicles employing fixed-price contracting. The AEHF block buy of two satellites enables savings by reducing the effect of obsolescence and production breaks allowing for economic buying of components and optimizing production resources. Additionally ESP enables cost efficiencies with the prime and subcontractor team as well as predictability for the space industrial base. FY16 continues the incrementally funded procurement of the block buy of two satellites AEHF SV 5-6. The Resilient Basis for SATCOM (RBS) in Joint Operations study directed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to investigate how best to provision for protected MILSATCOM capabilities beyond SV-6. The Protected Satellite Communications Services (PSCS) AoA has begun and is expected to inform the FY17 budget formulation.

This exhibit will display values in FY16 and beyond.  Prior Years PY CY will be displayed in the corresponding MPAF/3020 exhibits.  Total 3020/3021 procurement funding is $7494.947M. Note 2: This P-40 describes SBIRS funding in PE0305915F. The associated RDT&E funding is in RDT&E AF PE 0604441F. Note 3: The flyaway unit cost is not included on the P-40 exhibit because there are multiple P-5 Cost Analysis exhibits. Description: SBIRSs primary mission is to provide initial warning of a ballistic missile attack on the US its deployed forces and its allies. SBIRS enhances detection and improves reporting of intercontinental ballistic missiles submarine launched ballistic missiles and tactical ballistic missiles. SBIRS provides increased detection and tracking performance in order to meet requirements in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD). SBIRS will consist of satellites in Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) and payloads in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) with an integrated centralized ground station serving all SBIRS space elements Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites and other program related support activities. The HEO payloads operate on a classified host. SBIRS GEO-3 and 4 satellites are derivatives of the first two GEO satellites which were delivered on the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract (RDT&E funded). The GEO-3 and 4 satellite production efforts are necessary to meet constellation requirements. In December 2008 the Department approved the procurement of GEO-3 and 4 satellites and the HEO-3 and 4 payloads using a Cost-Plus contract. In order to minimize the number of storage actions and costs and comply with the next assigned Initial Launch Capability (ILC) date of no earlier than April 2016 GEO-3 will be placed into storage.  GEO-4 is planned to launch next (GEO flight #3) with GEO-3 remaining in storage and launching GEO-4 directly out of production.  GEO-4 now flight #3 will launch upon production completion in 3rd quarter FY16.  GEO-3s (flight #4) projected launch window is now not earlier than 4rd quarter FY17.GEO-5 and 6 satellites are planned as derivatives of the GEO-3 and 4 satellites and will be replacements for GEOs 1 and 2. A three phased contract approach awarded non-recurring engineering and parts obsolescence using advanced procurement funds on 10 Sep 2012 followed by award of long lead items on 19 Feb 2013 and full production on 24 Jun 2014. The full production effort includes 2 satellites launch vehicle integration launch and early orbit test dual band modification (unified S-Band) contractor operations support through operational acceptance and Interim Contractor Support (ICS). GEO-5 and 6 are being procured through the Department of Defense Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) approach which seeks stable production and strategic sub-tier management through the block buy of space vehicles employing fixed-priced contracting. The SBIRS block buy of two satellites enables savings by reducing the effect of obsolescence and production breaks. Additionally ESP seeks cost efficiencies with the prime and subcontractor team through block buys and a healthy space industrial base. For the GEO 5-6 block buy the FY13 NDAA authorizes six years of incremental funding and limits the incrementally funded contract obligation to $3900M. The years of incremental funding are FY13-18. Advance procurement was appropriated in FY11 and FY12. GEO 5-6 advance procurement and incremental funding are attributed to FY13 for the purposes of identifying full funding for procurement end items. Each year of appropriation FY13-18 is in two parts the incrementally funded contract amount and annual program support costs. The incrementally funded amount complies with the NDAA cap. SBIRS HEO-3 and 4 payloads are replenishments for HEO-1 and 2 payloads which were delivered on the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract (RDT&E funded). The HEO-1 and 2 payloads are on-orbit and certified for Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) missile warning operations and certified for technical intelligence operations. HEO-3 payload has been delivered to the classified host. To-complete costs are zero for SBIRS GEO 3-4 per the SBIRS Service Cost Position (SCP) dated April 14 2011. To-complete costs for GEOs 5-6 are based on continuing Program Office support through satellite delivery. Total GEO 3-4 3020/3021 funds are $2846.667M. Total GEO 5-6 3020/3021 funds are $3499.011M.

The USNDS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) dated 21 Jan 2004 documents the requirements for space-based NUDET detection.  Space-based NUDET detection is also mandated by Public Law 110-181 dated 28 Jan 2008 which directs the Secretary of Defense to maintain the capability for space-based nuclear detection at or above 2008 capability levels.  USNDS supports NUDET detection requirements across five mission areas: Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) Nuclear Force Management (NFM) Space Control (SC) Treaty Monitoring (TM) and a classified mission.The USNDS 6 program is jointly sponsored and funded by the Department of Defense (DoD) through the US Air Force (AF) and the Department of Energy (DOE) through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its Nuclear Detonation Detection (NA-22) office respectively. NNSA/NA-22 supplies at no cost to DoD USNDS space sensors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the AF USNDS Program Office which is responsible for all acquisition and systems engineering integration and test (SEIT) activities on space vehicles (SVs) to include Global Positioning System (GPS) and additional hosts and their supporting ground control segments. The AF directly funds the procurement of the USNDS 6 ground segment (described below).DoD funds its contribution to the NDS program in PE 0305913F with RDT&E OPAF and O&M dollars. NDS payload integration onto GPS satellites is funded in the GPS Space & Control PE 0305165F for GPS IIF SVs and GPS III Space Segment PE 0305265F for GPS III SVs.  USNDS consists of space sensors and complex ground segments. The space segment sensors funded by DOE consists of three nuclear detection sensor payloads: the Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) payload for Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites the Global Burst Detection (GBD) payload for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) platforms (GPS satellites) and the Space Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) payload for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) platforms (classified GEO hosts). Together these sensors and associated communications capability provided by the host satellites comprise the global NUDET space segment detection capability for the USNDS. Space sensors communicate NUDET indications to the fixed ground segment (the RADEC Data Processor (RDP) and the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS)) and the deployable mobile ground segment (survivable Ground NDS Terminals (GNTs) and the survivable/endurable Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs) when fielded). These ground systems perform data analysis and provide a decision support tool to the Air Force controllers concerning probability of NUDET occurrence. The ground segment provides ground receiving analysis and reporting capabilities to national authorities commands and forward users as well as Department of State for Treaty Monitoring and Verification mission. The ground control segment is being modernized and continuously improved through an incremental evolution acquisition approach.The upgrade to the GNT is the survivable/endurable Universal Ground Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) Terminal (UGNT) which is funded with AF RDT&E in this PE. The UGNT provides NUDET Detection Reports to end users through survivable and endurable USNDS communications via Milstar/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) circuits.  The GNT supports Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) and Nuclear Force Management (NFM) missions.  The UGNT program modifies the baseline of the GNT program and deploys as an integral part of the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Survivable / Endurable Evolution (S2E2) Mobile Ground System (SMGS) units also in support of ITW/AA and NFM. The UGNT when integrated with the SMGS will perform NUDET event processing with fused NDS data from GPS and DSP. SMGS capability refers to the result of the S2E2 upgrade program for the MGS mission processing capability including the integration of UGNT. The intended end state of UGNT integration is delivery of enhanced missile warning and NUDET detection capabilities that meet survivable/endurable ITW/AA requirements directed by the President SECDEF Joint Staff and USSTRATCOM delivering long-term cost effective multi-role multi-mission space effects to the war fighter across the range of military operations.Funding for this effort is in PE 0305913F NUDET DETECTION SYS SPACE.","Air Force","2016","Nudet Detection Sys Space","46","836750","Millions","Millions","","0305913F","1.

Fire support is the effects of lethal and non-lethal weapons (fires) that directly support land maritime amphibious and special operation forces to engage enemy forces combat formations and facilities in pursuit of tactical and operational objectives. FSC2 family consists of Gun Display Unit -Replacement (GDU-R) Ruggedized Handheld Computer (RHC) Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) Light Weight Technical Fire Direction System (LWTFDS) and Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED).The Gun Display Unit-Replacement (GDU-R) system allows non-digitized howitzer firing sections to receive and display firing data and firing commands transmitted by the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) at the platoon Fire Direction Center and transmit the status of the gun to the AFATDS as the fire mission progresses. The GDU-R is fully fielded and will be retired when the last M119A2 towed howitzer is digitized.The Ruggedized Handheld Computer (RHC) is hardware used to host the Forward Observer System (FOS) software combined are known as the Lightweight Forward Entry Device (LFED). The LFED is a handheld device used by mounted forward observers and fire support teams to transmit and receive fire support messages over standard military radios. They provide a digitized connection between the fire support teams and the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) and provide a vital sensor-to-shooter link. LFED/RHC enables mounted forward observers and fire support officers to plan control and execute fire support operations at maneuver platoon company battalion and brigade levels. The Approved Acquisition Objective for RHC is 2587.AFATDS provides joint automated fire support command control and communications and functions as the land component's automated Fire Support Command and Control (FSC2) system.  AFATDS is used in the Fires Warfighting Function to plan execute and deliver lethal and non-lethal fires within the overall Mission Command and Control (MC2) enterprise. The system interoperates and integrates with: over 80 different battlefield systems from Army Marine Corps Navy and Air Force; and Coalition Forces fire support command and control systems.  AFATDS fuses the essential situational awareness data intelligence information and targeting data in near real time in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities and to safely execute against friendly situational picture.  AFATDS pairs targets to weapons to provide optimum use of fire support assets and timely execution of fire missions.

The Department of Defense (DoD) has defined a DCGS architecture that will be compatible and interoperable across all of the Services' Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems and operations. DCGS accesses and ingests data from space borne airborne subsurface and surface ISR collection assets intelligence databases and intelligence producers. This collected data is shared across a Joint enterprise using the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) and in time the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) to enhance access and sharing of ISR information across Joint forces through the use of common enterprise standards and services. DCGS FoS supports Joint Task Force (JTF)-level and below combat operations with critical intelligence for battle management and information dominance across the full spectrum of operations including peace conflict war and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). DCGS is a cooperative effort between the services agencies and DoD to provide systems capable of receiving processing exploiting and disseminating data from airborne and national reconnaissance platforms. DCGS-N core components include the Analyst Work Station from the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) - Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (I3) Generic Area Limitation Environment (GALE) Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Common Geo-positioning Services (CGS) Image Product Library (IPL) Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB) Joint Concentrator Architecture (JCA) and Track Management Services. The DCGS-N system represents the integration of 1) The processing and exploitation of tactical and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) and Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); 2) Precision target geopositioning mensuration and imagery dissemination capabilities; 3) Selected national IMINT requirements and processing capabilities from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA); and 4) Sharing of Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance and Targeting and Command and Control information via DIB DI2E and Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) standards with a wide range of customers (e.g. Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M)) Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) and many others. The DCGS-N Enterprise Node (DEN) which incorporates current DIB standards and DI2E policy facilitates interoperability and data sharing among the DCGS FoS. DCGS-N ensures compliance with the DoD DCGS network architecture.  The Navy is establishing an ISR Enterprise way ahead that will emphasize a reach back strategy to provide intelligence products to support deployed ship and shore operations. The Navy will also migrate to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that requires the development integration and testing of a Maritime ISR Enterprise capability development and migration of ISR SOA applications and development and integration to leverage a Common Computing Environment (CCE). Additionally DCGS-N will become the focal point for migration of Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) fusion and analysis (MFAS) tool applications for the Navy. DCGS-N Increment 2 addresses a critical shortfall in Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) capability and capacity to support operational tactical planning and execution across the full range of joint military operations. Existing TCPED shortfalls will be exacerbated by planned Navy Joint and Allied fielding of new Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms. Currently fielded systems provide localized processing capabilities that will be overwhelmed in future years without a significant change in the way the Navy processes exploits and disseminates intelligence data. DCGS-N Increment 2 will deliver all source fusion and analytical capabilities; provide Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) capabilities and integrate Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) capabilities to improve the use and analysis of sensor and platform data. Distributed Common Ground System- Navy (DCGS-N) Increment 2 will be based on an enterprise solution to share this information across commands services and agencies to promote shared situational awareness.

SSDS integrates a diverse set of fire control loop sensors and weapons and C4I systems for each ship class (CVN68/78 LHA6 LHD1 LPD17 and LSD41/49 ship classes).  SSDS MK2 provides the capabilities for integrated air and missile defense multi-warfare situational awareness combat direction and joint interoperability via the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) and Tactical Data Information Link (TADIL)-J. SSDS MK2 is being fielded with the new construction carriers (CVN78 class) and amphibious ships (LHA6 LPD17 classes). SSDS MK2 is replacing the Advanced Combat Direction System (ACDS) in the LHD1 class and SSDS MK1 in the LSD 41/49 class as fleet modernization initiatives.  SSDS MK2 integrates new combat system warfighting capabilities and improvements on phased basis via Advanced Capability Builds (ACB) Technology Insertion (TI) the Fire Control Loop Improvement Project (FCLIP) and Accelerated Mid-Term Interoperability Improvement Project (AMIIP). New hardware Technology Insertion baselines are required every four years to refresh the Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) assemblies to sustain system production and to support the incorporation of new ACB capabilities. Each individual ship is planned for a Technology Insertion upgrade on an eight year interval to replace obsolescent COTS hardware and support the fielding of the ACB capabilities.SHIP SELF DEFENSE SYSTEM (SSDS) MK 1Provides ship self defense capabilities against Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles (ASCM) for LSD 41/49 class ships.

The system includes one launcher two Re-Supply Systems (RSS) and the MFOM. HIMARS will provide the Fleet Marine Force with 24 hour ground-based responsive General Support/General Support Reinforcing (GS/GSR) indirect fires which accurately engage targets at long range (60+km) with high volumes of lethal fire under all weather conditions throughout all phases of combat operations ashore to include irregular warfare and distributed operations. HIMARS is a significant improvement over previously fielded ground fire support systems. During a 24 hour period the system is expected to conduct multiple moves and multiple fire missions. Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) is the primary munition for units fielded with the HIMARS and MLRS rocket and missile platforms. GMLRS provides close medium and long range precision and area fires to destroy suppress and shape threat forces and protect friendly forces against cannon mortar rocket and missile artillery light material and armor personnel command and control and air defense surface targets. GMLRS integrates guidance and control packages and an improved rocket motor achieving greater range and precision accuracy requiring fewer rockets to defeat targets thereby reducing the logistics burden. The two fielded variants are GMLRS with Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM/Increment 1) and GMLRS Unitary (U/Increment 2) a 200 pound class high explosive warhead. The GMLRS integrates a multi-mode fuse and high explosive warhead making it an all weather low collateral damage precision strike rocket. GMLRS U expands the MLRS target set into urban and complex environments by adding point proximity and delay fusing modes. GMLRS U are being fired in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and has demonstrated high effectiveness and low collateral damage while supporting Marines in combat. A third variant of GMLRS the alternative warhead (AW/Increment 3) is being developed to replace GMLRS-HA22 (DPICM variant) and meet the requirements outlined in a 25 June 2008 cluster munitions policy which requires all cluster munitions by 2019 to produce less than 1% Unexploded Ordinance (UXO) on the battlefield.    HIMARS satisfies the Marine Corps requirement for an indirect fire system that is responsive maneuverable and is capable of engaging targets at long range.

In two related Acquisition Decision Memorandums (ADM) signed by USD (AT&L) in January and June 2011 the RQ-4 program was directed to restructure into four major sub-programs: (1) RQ-4 baseline (2) Block 30 (3) Block 40 and (4) Ground Segment/Communications System. Additionally the Air Force created a RQ-4 Preplanned Product Improvement (P3I) for the Airborne Sense and Avoid line item (name has been changed to RQ-4 Common Airborne Sense & Avoid (C-ABSAA)) to accommodate inclusion of required capability to meet warfighter needs beyond those requirements satisfied in the directed sub-programs. The RQ-4B is the successor to the RQ-4A and is designed to employ 3000 pounds of payload and enable multi-intelligence (multi-INT) collecting. The RQ-4B has three configurations: Block 20 Block 30 and Block 40. The Block 20 employs upgraded Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors - Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS) - in an imagery intelligence only configuration. One SAR capable B20 remains in the fleet. Additionally 4 Block 20's have been converted to Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) of which 3 remain active. These aircraft are not SAR capable. The remaining Block 20 aircraft support test projects for all RQ-4 Blocks. The Block 30 employs the same EISS sensors as the Block 20 and integrates a wide spectrum signals intelligence (SIGINT) sensor the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP). EISS and ASIP are used simultaneously to create a multi-INT platform. The Block 40 integrates the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) radar that has GMTI capability. The ground segment includes the Mission Control Element (MCE) and the Launch Recovery Element (LRE). The support segment includes aerospace ground equipment tech orders spares support equipment and training to enable operation of the RQ-4 System. To protect production schedules from Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and material shortages issues the program will perform schedule protection buys when appropriate. The RQ-4 program will incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms including the U.S. Navy's Triton and other RPA weapon systems. Remaining efforts for RQ-4 procurement include support to complete delivery of the RQ-4s on contract and incorporation of any modifications required to bring the aircraft up to current operational configuration DMS support equipment change requests production line disposition acceptance testing logistics and program management support and related tasks to support the entire RQ-4 fleet.

These are centrally managed items.The first element is the sub-family of Department of Defense Standard Tactical Generators USMC (and all services) procures from the DOD Project Manager for Expeditionary Energy and Sustainment Systems (PM E2S2).  USMC procures and manages standard generator models in the power output range of 2 kilowatts (kW) to 100 kW. Included in this for medium size models (5 kW to 60 kW) is the new Advanced Medium Mobile Power Sources (AMMPS) that USMC first began procuring in 2012 and will continue procuring through 2015. The AMMPS provides improved fuel economy improved maintainability and reduced weight.The second element is the sub-family for Mobile Electric Power Distribution Systems - Replacement (MEPDIS-R) which provides a modernized standard suite of electric power distribution panels and cabling assemblies to meet Marine Corps power requirements to support a variety of command and control systems and expeditionary forces. MEPDIS-R as a highly tailorable system consists of 20 separate components that are configured into capability sets by all using units.The third element is the Floodlight Set (FLS) a self-contained external lighting system with a power plant and light tower assembly.  The FLS is capable of providing up to five acres of area illumination and is used extensively for security purposes. For flexibility the set is configured so it can be mounted on all trailer systems or ground mounted and plugged into grid power.The fourth element is the sub-family of support equipment to support elements of the Power Equipment Family.  This includes unique trailer mounting kits for all systems onto USMC standard trailers software planning tools for emplacement of power and power distribution unique training aids and general purpose electrician toolkits.FAMILY OF ALTERNATIVE POWER SOURCES FOR COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT (APSCE) - This family consists of multiple suites of devices grouped into sub-families that are used to provide highly expeditionary power (worn on the Marine hand-carried or vehicle mounted) to operate communications equipment computers and peripheral equipment in place of disposable batteries and for scenarios where fuel powered generators are too large too heavy unsuitable for use or provide undue logistics burden due to refueling needs.The first suite of devices encompasses renewable energy based systems and includes the man-portable Ground Renewable Expeditionary Energy Network System (GREENS) that supports a company level operations center and Forward Operating Base and the man-portable Solar Portable Alternative Communications Energy Systems (SPACES) that supports Combat Outposts and Observation Points.  Both of these exploit the use of solar energy technology to recharge batteries and directly power electronic equipment without the need for re-fueling generators.The second suite of devices is the Family of USMC Tactical Power Supplies.  This includes both shelter based (semi-rugged) and fully ruggedized power supplies (operate outdoors) that convert grid power (alternating current) to vehicle based power (direct current).  These power supplies support all elements across the USMC with standard models that provide variable electrical output to support a wide electrical range of operation.  The suite also includes vehicle mounted inverters that convert vehicle 24 Volt direct current to 120 Volt alternating current to allow on-the-move operation of equipment that previously was only able to be used while stationary.The third suite of devices is On-Board Vehicle Power (OBVP) systems that modify and implement power generation onboard multiple vehicles (High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle and Medium Tactical Vehicle).  The HMMWV based system provides engine drive electric AC power comparable to what a HMMWV towable trailer mounted generator could provide (25 kilowatts).  This saves embark space and weight for highly expeditionary applications.  The MTV based system provides engine drive electric AC power comparable to what a generator mounted to the bed of the truck could provide (100 kilowatts).  This frees up cargo space while saving space and weight also for highly expeditionary applications.The fourth suite of devices is the Family of Radio Power Adaptors (RPA) which provide an alternative power source for each radio in the Marine Corps (seven different models).  Instead of consuming batteries when in garrison/shelter operations RPAs allow the radios to be operated from central power sources (such as GREENS and SPACES) or grid power (120 volt AC generator).  This provides cost avoidance conservation of batteries and flexibility of operations.The fifth suite is the Battery Management and Sustainment Systems (BMASS) that support all lead-acid batteries used in vehicles and artillery systems and lithium ion rechargeable batteries used in command control and communications systems.  The suite consists of battery chargers battery analyzers and battery safety management systems for both chemistry of batteries and for both garrison (semi-rugged) and deployed operations (ruggedized).  As the USMC (and all services) move towards fully adopting rechargeable batteries for energy efficiency and logistics demand reduction BMASS is critical to support numerous weapons engineer vehicle and communication systems that are highly dependent on batteries for their operation.","Navy","2016","Power Equipment Assorted","49","6366","Millions","Dollars","","0206624M","FY14 Baseline Appropriation Request: ($71973)MOBILE POWER EQUIPMENT $46.017MFunded the procurement of MEPDIS-R 5KW 60HZ AMMPS 10KW 60 HZ AMMPS 15KW 60HZ AMMPS 30KW 60HZ AMMPS 60KW 60HZ AMMPS 2K 60 HZ Medium Tactical Generator (MTG) 3KW 60HZ TQG 100KW 60 HZ TQG Grounding Rods and Integrated Logistics Support (ILS).

The RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT is the majority variant that drives the Baseline integration and modification upgrade strategy for the entire RC-135 fleet.  Therefore the majority of the modification budget is directly related to the RIVET JOINT weapon system baseline strategy enhancements which subsequently transfers into the follow-on baseline strategy enhancements for COBRA BALL and COMBAT SENT weapon systems.A 2008 RC-135 Viability Assessment reported that despite the fleet average airframe age (44 years) and accumulated flight hours (38000) as of the end of FY 2007 the RC-135 should be able to continue to meet the user's needs by performing intended operations through at least 2040.  Viability was assessed based on underlying analyses of reliability maintainability performance corrosion fatigue architectural stability safety and availability.  The Viability Assessment also summarized that the RC-135 fleet has experienced significant improvements in reliability maintainability and availability since FY 2001.  The Program Manager attributes these improvements directly to the 645 AESG Baseline integration and modification upgrade strategy and synergies gained with long standing relationships with the RC-135 industry partners.     FY 2016 procurement funding efforts will concentrate on completing the conversion of the RIVET JOINT from a Baseline 9 to a Baseline 11 plus Baseline 10 to Baseline 12 integration efforts and the COBRA BALL and COMBAT SENT from a Baseline 4 to a Baseline 5 integration effort as per the programmed depot maintenance schedule (COBRA BALL and COMBAT SENT Baseline 5 configurations most closely aligns with the RIVET JOINT Baseline 11 configuration).  The RIVET JOINT Baseline 11 and 12 integration efforts address the 2012 RC-135 Multi-Attribute Utility Assessment (MUA) that detailed operational effectiveness cost and program analyses of the alternative weapon system configurations.

The Air Force planned for ECSS to subsume most of the Service's core logistics systems upon fielding and therefore placed them in barebones reduced maintenance status during the ECSS program. Due to the cancellation of ECSS the Air Force must sustain and modernize these systems through both FIAR Remediation to address the most immediate gaps in meeting FIAR by the 2017 statutory deadline and Software Upgrades to reduce high operating costs implement previously deferred statutory compliance requirements and improve near term system performance.Systems contained in these business areas include but are not limited to the Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS) Combat Ammunitions System (CAS) Enhanced Maintenance Operations Center (EMOC) Aircraft Structural Integrity Management Information System (ASIMIS) Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S) Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS) Stock Control System (SCS) Purchase Request Process System (PRPS) Automated Logistics Management Support System (ALMSS) Depot Maintenance Accounting and Production System (DMAPS) Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS) and Weapon System Management Information System (WSMIS).Transformation: The Air Force must transform its logistics business processes and transition away from using numerous stovepipe systems and process flows that execute the same tasks. Eliminating process redundancies across the logistics enterprise will enable the Air Force to execute more efficient cost-effective and integrated logistics in the long term. The objective of Transformation is to conduct business process reengineering (BPR) to identify and eliminate overlaps in our current processes and where appropriate implement the use of new information technology systems.  The Air Force Service Development and Delivery Process (SDDP) is being applied as part of this BPR effort to apply discipline and focus to the task of process reengineering and requirements development in order to reduce risk and successfully transform logistics IT systems. In the SDDP the requirements definition architecture and design for an IT capability is a government-owned process. The SDDP ensures the AF end user and Sponsor consider all possible doctrine organization training material leadership personnel and facility (DOTMLPF) solutions to the end user's need/problem before a materiel solution is sought. The SDDP is a six-step process each step with its own specific product outcomes that serve as the basis for downstream activities in the SDDP and facilitating enterprise level analysis to maximize reuse of existing capabilities. Maximizing reuse will eliminate duplicate implementation actions across the Air Force and assure individual user problems or needs are not solved at the cost of overall enterprise benefits. The outcome of using the SDDP is a well-described requirement which may includea materiel solution in which case the SDDP details the acquisition and implementation activities to support delivery of the capability. Alternatively success may be demonstrated by the resolution of the user's problem without a materiel solution.The Air Force logistics enterprise is comprised of multiple overarching functional areas to include maintenance repair and overhaul end-to-end supply chain support base supply inventories and predictive analysis and forecasting.

AEHF is a cooperative program that includes International Partners (Canada the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of the Netherlands).  The AEHF procurement program element funds the Command and Control System - Consolidated (CCS-C) mission unique software and databases for AEHF 4-6 satellites.  CCS-C provides launch and early orbit support and on-orbit anomaly resolution.  AEHF Space Vehicle-3 (SV-3) and SV-4 are derivatives of the first two AEHF satellites which were delivered on the AEHF System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract (RDT&E funded).  SV-3 was successfully launched on 18 Sep 2013.  SV-4 has a projected launch availability of 3QFY17.SVs 5 and 6 are being procured under the Department of Defense's Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) approach which enables stable production and strategic sub-tier management through the block buy of space vehicles employing fixed-price contracting.  The AEHF block buy of two satellites enables savings by reducing the effect of obsolescence and production breaks allowing for economic buying of components and optimizing production resources.  Additionally ESP enables cost efficiencies with the prime and subcontractor team as well as predictability for the space industrial base. The Resilient Basis for SATCOM (RBS) in Joint Operations study directed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to investigate how best to provision for protected MILSATCOM capabilities beyond SV-6. The Protected Satellite Communications Services (PSCS) AoA has begun and is expected to inform the FY17 budget formulation.

Launch services will be executed from the Evolved Expendable Launch Veh (Space) P-1 line item. Launch capability will be executed from the Evolved Expendable Launch Veh (Infrastructure) P-1 line item. Both line items are necessary to achieve successful placement of National Security Space (NSS) space vehicles (SVs) on-orbit. Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0305953F. Related RDT&E AF funding is contained in PE 0604853F. This exhibit only provides funding for Evolved Expendable Launch Veh (Infrastructure). This program does not require and does not include advance procurement or initial spares. Flyaway Unit Cost is not applicable and Weapon System Unit Cost are not representative due to the mix (medium through heavy) of vehicles in the program. EELV procures launch services and is not a weapon system. The program provides launch capacity for Government National Launch Forecast (NLF) requirements but does not take ownership of any specific launch hardware. The requirements for EELV launch services are derived from multiple spacecraft requirements. "To Complete" projections include only known requirements at this time. The EELV program is a Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program that acquires launch services to provide critical space support required to satisfy Department of Defense (DoD) warfighter national security and other Government space lift missions while fostering interagency and commercial cooperation. The EELV program provides satellite delivery to specific orbits through certified launch vehicle providers. To maintain maximum flexibility to meet NSS requirements Air Force acquires launch services through a white tail concept where designating configurations to specific missions is accomplished just-in-time to meet mission integration requirements. The Air Force structured the EELV program with a new cost saving acquisition strategy that includes a quantity and rate commitment with the current provider and enables competition if one or more New Entrants are certified. This strategy stabilized the industrial base provided predictability to maintain mission success and reduced costs. The Air Force National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) agreed to a coordinated strategy for certification of New Entrants to launch payloads in support of NSS and other USG requirements. The Air Force continues to actively evaluate the addition of New Entrants to reliably launch NSS requirements. Once a New Entrant demonstrates a successful launch the Air Force intends to award integration studies. If competition is not viable at the time of need missions will be awarded to the incumbent. The Air Force plans to compete launch service procurements beginning in FY18 if there is more than one certified provider for some or all reference orbits. The implementation of this new strategy enables the DoD to reliably place NSS space vehicles into earth orbit. In 2013 the Air Force combined the Launch Services contract and Launch Capability contract into a single contract. The Launch Capability cost plus incentive fee contract line items are annual options and provide launch infrastructure support which includes but is not limited to systems and factory engineering program management standard integration/testing launch and range activities infrastructure parts obsolescence mitigation post mission analysis and studies and analysis. The contract features a Mission Success Incentive fee which incentivizes both mission success and cost control for cost plus contract line items.The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $168 million to account for the availability of prior year funds to forward finance launch infrastructure services and range activities.","Air Force","2016","EVOLVED EXPENDABLE LAUNCH CAPABILITY","7","MSEELC","Millions","Millions","","0604853F","Fiscal Year 2016 Evolved Expendable Launch Veh (Infrastructure) procurement funding is required to support launch and acquisition of National Security Space (NSS) launch vehicles.

MQ-1 Payload Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) (A00020) budget line is shared between multiple Payload programs and two Program Managers (PM Terrestrial Sensors & PM Sensors - Aerial Intelligence).  These Payload programs support the Army's transformation by procuring Reconnaissance Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload systems for Brigade Combat Teams Divisions and Corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  This is in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) UAS priorities.  Small TActical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) CSP and Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) are principal payloads for the Gray Eagle UAS.  The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for STARLite and CSP is equivalent to aircraft/platform quantities one system per Gray Eagle UAS - AAO is commensurate with aircraft quantity (one STARLite and one CSP payload per aircraft). Small TActical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) SAR/MTI is a lightweight high performance all weather multi-functional radar system for the Gray Eagle Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). The STARLite system provides wide area near real time RSTA capabilities. It operates throughout the UAS flight mission profile in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants. The SAR mode generates quality images for the battlefield commander for detection classification and location of stationary commercial wheeled vehicle-size targets. The MTI mode detects moving ground targets to include man-sized detection and provides location information and performs cross-cue with the Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors.Common Sensor Payload (CSP) - Electro Optical / Infra Red / Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD) provides FMV in both the Electro Optical and Mid Wave IR spectrums with day/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery with the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons in Standard Definition (SD) as well as High Definition (HD) for select number of Gray Eagle platforms.  It is the EO/IR/LD sensor for Gray Eagle UAS which supports force applications battlespace awareness force protection and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area near real time RSTA capabilities.  Additional initiatives will continue to focus on the transition of technologies directly supporting emerging requirements and the Army's Current and Future Force.  CSP is being procured for the Gray Eagle UAS program and has potential application to other platforms.   The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor currently under development for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology and as the adversaries use of technology changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs).

The PDSS effort is an OPA requirement because of the new capabilities that are required to be implemented into key management products based on the evolution of the network and end cryptographic units.  The changes in capability do not allow the operational support to be transitioned to sustainment.  The PDSS contract for all key management products has been optimized and requirements continuously assessed to ensure that it is  fiscally sound.  The AKMS SoS supports the transition to AKMI the Army's implementation of NSA's KMI ACAT IAM program in accordance with the EKMS Tier 2 Sunset date of December 2017.  Continued support for the AKMS SoS is critical until KMI is fully operational and fielded. The current SKL fleet will require support through at least 2025.  Modernization of fill devices and emerging radio planning and configuration requirements are supported through the Army's KMI funding line (B96004).  It is the PdD's intent to incrementally migrate the AKMS funding line to the AKMI funding line beginning in FY2017 provided that the sunset date of December 2017 is met. Recent developments at the NSA Program Management Office (PMO) may cause additional schedule slippages to the complete standup of the KMI infrastructure. This presents a potential risk which may require the AKMS funding line to be maintained at steady state beyond 2017 if the planned sunset date is not met.IAW Section 1815 of the FY08 NDAA this item is necessary for use by the active components and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions domestic emergency responses and providing military support to civil authorities.","Other Procurement Army","Each","Information Security","Monthly","2035A","64","2","Communications and Electronics Equipment","PB","2015-02","A","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",

These instruments are used on all Navy Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command vessels and at every Navy shore installation in order to ensure the safety of personnel continuity of operations in radiological or nuclear contingencies and protection of the environment.[P40A / M2100 - Survey Meters]: M2100.  Radiation survey meters required by 10CFR20 and the Navy's mission are used to detect measure and monitor radiation levels in support of operations involving radioactive materials.  Navy operations associated with radioactive materials include operation of nuclear reactors maintenance on radioactive systems or components testing of components for structural integrity (X-ray) research and medical diagnostics and treatment.  Additionally radiation survey meters are used to search for locate and intercept radioactive material and in responding to casualties involving radioactive materials.  Where radiation survey meters are used to support operations involving radioactive material they provide real-time information used to control personnel radiation exposure and to identify and control the spread of radioactivity.  When used to search for radioactive material they provide an extremely reliable method of identifying radioactive material while minimizing the risk to personnel conducting these operations.[P40A / Ion Chamber Survey Meter]: M2100 Ion Chamber Survey Meter:  Portable radiation survey meter used to ensure compliance with 10CFR20 during operations involving radioactive material.  This survey meter uses an ion chamber detector to ensure adequate response to both X-ray and gamma ray radiation.[P40A / u-Rem Survey Meter]: M2100 u-Rem Survey Meter:  Sensitive portable radiation survey meter used to ensure compliance with 10CFR20 during operations involving radioactive material.  The "u" stands for "micro" in scientific notation and indicates that this meter records radiation at much lower levels than other survey meters.  This is required in applications that require micro level measurements.[P40A / M2100 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2100 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.[P40A / M2200 - Dosimetry]: M2200.  Dosimetry consists of radiation sensitive materials that are used for detecting and measuring an individual's exposure to ionizing radiation and to aid in minimizing this exposure.  Dosimetry is required to be worn by personnel who work with sources of radioactivity or by personnel responding to casualties involving radioactivity.  Most dosimeters are small devices that are worn on the belt on a lanyard around the neck or attached to a shirt.  Some dosimeters provide direct readout enabling the wearer to monitor and control radiation exposure.  Other types of dosimeters must be removed from the wearer to be evaluated in special dosimeter readers that extract the recorded radiation exposure value from the dosimeter.  Radiation exposure measured by dosimetry is recorded in individual medical records when formal tracking of the radiation exposure is required. In accordance with 10CFR20 dosimetry is required to be worn by personnel who work with sources of radioactivity.  In the Navy this includes personnel in the Nuclear Propulsion Nuclear Weapons and Medical and Radiological Affairs Support programs.  In these programs radiation exposure is measured by dosimetry and recorded in individual medical records for tracking purposes.  Dosimetry is also worn by personnel responding to casualties involving radioactivity to control their exposure within acceptable levels.[P40A / DT-702 Card]: M2200 DT-702 Card:  The DT-702 Thermoluminescent Dosimeter (TLD) is a small metal card a little smaller and thinner than a domino that contains four circular slots containing different elements that are sensitive to various types of radioactivity.  The card is placed in a plastic holder so it is protected and able to be worn by personnel on a lanyard or on their clothing.  It is issued to sailors and civilians who are occupationally exposed to radiation.  This includes Navy programs such as Nuclear Propulsion Explosive Ordnance Disposal Nuclear Weapons Industrial Radiography and Medical.  The DT-702 provides primary dosimetry whereby dosage accumulated on this card can be entered into the respective person's permanent medical files.  The processes associated with the DT-702 also are compliant with 10CFR20 by being approved by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) which is administered by the National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST).  The cards are issued to individuals and tracked by serial numbers.  The cards are periodically turned in (and another card is issued so there is no coverage gap) to have the dose extracted by an 8800 Reader.  The process by which the cards are read include several heating cycles that eventually make the receptor elements unusable so the life of a TLD is finite -- about 100 reads -- and then they have to be replaced.[P40A / DT-702 Card Holder]: M2200 DT-702 Card Holder:  The DT-702 Holder is used to hold and protect the DT-702 card during use. It consists of a hard plastic case with both belt and lanyard attachments. These attachments allow the DT-702 Holder (with DT-702 Card inserted) to be easily attached to the wearer during use.  The holder contains four filters corresponding to the four elements of the DT-702 Card.  Positions 1 2 3 and 4 have copper plastic mylar and tin filters respectively.  All positions have different density thickness to help discriminate different types of radiation and energies to provide an accurate dose of record when processed through the 8800 Reader.[P40A / DXTRAD Finger Ring]: M2200 DXTRAD Finger Ring:  Special dosimeter used to monitor radiation exposure to hands of workers.  The DXTRAD Finger Ring uses the same radiation sensitive material of the DT-702/PD Card putting the material in a ring that can be worn on the workers hand to allow specific monitoring of radiation exposure to workers' hands.[P40A / Battlefield Dosimeter]: M2200 Battlefield Dosimeter:  A dosimeter designed for use during nuclear events involving high energy gamma and neutron irradiation.  These dosimeters are worn by personnel who might be exposed to effects of a nuclear explosion or the associated fallout.The original concept was to replace the IM-270/PD with something similar i.e. an inexpensive ($22 each) wrist watch device with a digital display that records radioactive dose starting at the high level of 10 rem (Roentgen Equivalent in Man).  The concept of operations for such a dosimeter is that it is issued at MOP III to every sailor in order for recovery teams to perform triage on casualties after a nuclear detonation.  A rem is a large dose of radiation so the millirem (mrem) which is one thousandth of a rem is often used for the dosages commonly encountered such as the amount of radiation received from medical x-rays background sources and the lower levels of radiation normally associated with occupational radiological workers which they receive on a continual basis and why their exposures are monitored and recorded.  Dosimeters for these latter Navy programs use dosimeters that measure dose in the millirem range.[P40A / Electronic Personal Dosimeter]: M2200 Electronic Personal Dosimeter (EPD):  An electronic dosimeter that includes a real-time digital display of radiation dose being received.  These so-called secondary dosimeters are normally used in conjunction with the DT-702 primary dosimeter in order to provide the wearer with real-time radiation dose information and alarm features that aid workers in controlling their radiation exposure.  The DT-702 is the Navy's approved dosimeter to record dose of record in each individual's medical record but it must be turned in and read by a machine (the 8800 Reader) and does not indicate if the radiological environment poses an immediate danger.[P40A / M2200 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2200 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.[P40A / M2400 - Other RADIAC]: M2400.  Other RADIAC.  The RADIAC Program fields 70 different families of instruments consisting of a total of almost 43000 instruments and 400000 dosimeters.  Those families that fall into similar functionality have been grouped here into the M2100 M2200 M2500 and M2600 Cost Codes.  This Cost Code consists of instruments that have specialized functions that only they perform and therefore would require an unmanageable and meaningless number of additional Cost Codes if each were addressed individually.  In the context of the family metaphor used here these instruments are no less important but are orphans in the sense there are not many of similar functionality that they could be grouped with.This Cost Code also supports replenishment of Ready for Issue (RFI) stocks when instruments in any Cost Code fall below stock levels sufficient to meet quarterly demand.

This system is used in reactor construction and overhaul facilities to ensure compliance with 10CFR20.  Award date of FY14 funds has slipped due to technical delays.  In FY15 $65K is needed to pay for environmental and electromagnetic interference testing in additon to the cost of the equipment.[P40A / Criticality Monitor Technical Repair Standard]: M2400 Criticality Monitor Technical Repair Standard:  Technical Repair Standard data for the Criticality Monitor.[P40A / MCA Software]: M2400 webREMS: A dose management software system for the Mk2 Electronic Personal Dosimeter (EPD) that will be used to track radiation doses accumulated by workers.   The EPD is used primarily at nuclear maintenance facilities and aboard CVNs and submarines.  This automated system will automatically retrieve exposure data on the EPDs and replace the current method of manually recorded exposure logs saving significant man hours and eliminating transcription errors.[P40A / Tool Contamination Monitor Shore]: M2400 Tool Contamination Monitor:  Used to scan tools and other equipment prior to release from a radiological work area to a general work area in order to ensure the equipment did not become contaminated with radiation while being used in the radiological area.[P40A / Tool Contamination Monitor Ship]: M2400 Tool Contamination Monitor Ship:  This is the same instrument as the Tool Contamination Monitor Shore but the units have to be hardened and modified for shipboard use on the Navy's two AS class ships (submarine tenders).  These two units had been combined in the same Cost Element line with the eight shore units but because the award and delivery dates and the unit prices will be significantly different from the commercial off the shelf shore units these two units are being listed as a separate cost element.[P40A / Spares]: M2400 Spares:  Purchase of additional quantities of existing models of RADIACs to replenish or supplement stocks of spare items due to minor increases in program allowances minor inventory losses or due to items being beyond economical repair.[P40A / M2400 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2400 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.[P40A / M2500 - Air Sampling Systems]: M2500.  Monitoring for airborne radioactivity is done to detect leaks from nuclear reactors or associated systems to ensure that radioactivity is not inadvertently released to the environment from these operations.  Additionally monitoring for airborne radioactivity is performed during maintenance on radioactive components or during events that might cause radioactivity to be released to the air.  Monitoring for airborne radioactivity is normally done by drawing air across filter paper to collect airborne radioactive particles.  This filter paper is then evaluated by radiation detectors and the concentration of airborne radioactivity is calculated.  The types of airborne radioactivity monitoring systems include fixed systems and portable systems.Fixed systems sample air from pre-determined locations and normally include built-in radiation detectors for determining the airborne radioactivity concentration.  Portable systems can be used to sample air at any desired location but normally require the use of separate radiation detection instruments to measure the radioactive particles deposited on the filter paper to determine the airborne radioactivity concentration.[P40A / Air Particle Detector Ship Frames]: M2500 Air Particle Detector Ship Frames:  Government Furnished Material to be provided to the manufacturer of the APD Ship (IM-272/WDQ).

The housings and identified internal components from the IM-239/WDQ will be prepared in a RADIAC Program facility and provided to the manufacturer of the IM-272/WDQ. Use of these housings and components reduces the overall cost of the IM-272/WDQ and ensures it has the same footprint as the IM-239/WDQ.[P40A / Air Particle Detector Ship]: M2500 Air Particle Detector Ship:  Airborne radioactivity monitoring system for use on Navy nuclear ships.   This system (IM-272/WDQ) is a replacement for the existing IM-239/WDQ used on Navy nuclear ships.   The IM-272/WDQ incorporates significant technology enhancements that will reduce spurious false alarms and reduce operator maintenance.[P40A / Air Particle Detector Ship Data]: M2500 Air Particle Detector Ship Data:  Upon award of the contract in September 2014 the cost of Contract Data Requirements List and Contract Line Item Number data became known.  This data includes a one-time cost for Technical Manuals in FY15.  Subsequent years include the Technical Repair Standard drawings and production reports with every delivery order.[P40A / Air Particle Detector Shore]: M2500 Air Particle Detector Shore:  This system is a replacement for the existing IM-239/WDQ designed for ships that is also currently used in radiological maintenance facilities.   The APD Shore incorporates significant technology enhancements that will reduce spurious false alarms and reduce operator maintenance and since it does not need to be hardened for shipboard use it will be cheaper to procure and maintain than the new IM-272 units (see line item 4.2)being procured for ships.[P40A / Air Particle Sampler First Article]: M2500 Air Particle Sampler First Article:  Portable airborne radioactivity sampling system.

The current instrument is 30 years old and cannot be repaired due to obsolete components. At the current loss rate due to normal wear and tear there will be insufficient assets to meet operational requirements so a replacement must be found.In FY17 an additional $100K is needed to perform environmental and electromagnetic interference testing on the units.[P40A / M2500 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2500 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.

These instruments are used on all Navy Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command vessels and at every Navy shore installation in order to ensure the safety of personnel continuity of operations in radiological or nuclear contingencies and protection of the environment.[P40A / M2100 - Survey Meters]: M2100.  Radiation survey meters required by 10CFR20 and the Navy's mission are used to detect measure and monitor radiation levels in support of operations involving radioactive materials.  Navy operations associated with radioactive materials include operation of nuclear reactors maintenance on radioactive systems or components testing of components for structural integrity (X-ray) research and medical diagnostics and treatment.  Additionally radiation survey meters are used to search for locate and intercept radioactive material and in responding to casualties involving radioactive materials.  Where radiation survey meters are used to support operations involving radioactive material they provide real-time information used to control personnel radiation exposure and to identify and control the spread of radioactivity.  When used to search for radioactive material they provide an extremely reliable method of identifying radioactive material while minimizing the risk to personnel conducting these operations.[P40A / Ion Chamber Survey Meter]: M2100 Ion Chamber Survey Meter:  Portable radiation survey meter used to ensure compliance with 10CFR20 during operations involving radioactive material.  This survey meter uses an ion chamber detector to ensure adequate response to both X-ray and gamma ray radiation.[P40A / u-Rem Survey Meter]: M2100 u-Rem Survey Meter:  Sensitive portable radiation survey meter used to ensure compliance with 10CFR20 during operations involving radioactive material.  The "u" stands for "micro" in scientific notation and indicates that this meter records radiation at much lower levels than other survey meters.  This is required in applications that require micro level measurements.[P40A / M2100 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2100 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.[P40A / M2200 - Dosimetry]: M2200.  Dosimetry consists of radiation sensitive materials that are used for detecting and measuring an individual's exposure to ionizing radiation and to aid in minimizing this exposure.  Dosimetry is required to be worn by personnel who work with sources of radioactivity or by personnel responding to casualties involving radioactivity.  Most dosimeters are small devices that are worn on the belt on a lanyard around the neck or attached to a shirt.  Some dosimeters provide direct readout enabling the wearer to monitor and control radiation exposure.  Other types of dosimeters must be removed from the wearer to be evaluated in special dosimeter readers that extract the recorded radiation exposure value from the dosimeter.  Radiation exposure measured by dosimetry is recorded in individual medical records when formal tracking of the radiation exposure is required. In accordance with 10CFR20 dosimetry is required to be worn by personnel who work with sources of radioactivity.  In the Navy this includes personnel in the Nuclear Propulsion Nuclear Weapons and Medical and Radiological Affairs Support programs.  In these programs radiation exposure is measured by dosimetry and recorded in individual medical records for tracking purposes.  Dosimetry is also worn by personnel responding to casualties involving radioactivity to control their exposure within acceptable levels.[P40A / DT-702 Card]: M2200 DT-702 Card:  The DT-702 Thermoluminescent Dosimeter (TLD) is a small metal card a little smaller and thinner than a domino that contains four circular slots containing different elements that are sensitive to various types of radioactivity.  The card is placed in a plastic holder so it is protected and able to be worn by personnel on a lanyard or on their clothing.  It is issued to sailors and civilians who are occupationally exposed to radiation.  This includes Navy programs such as Nuclear Propulsion Explosive Ordnance Disposal Nuclear Weapons Industrial Radiography and Medical.  The DT-702 provides primary dosimetry whereby dosage accumulated on this card can be entered into the respective person's permanent medical files.  The processes associated with the DT-702 also are compliant with 10CFR20 by being approved by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) which is administered by the National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST).  The cards are issued to individuals and tracked by serial numbers.  The cards are periodically turned in (and another card is issued so there is no coverage gap) to have the dose extracted by an 8800 Reader.  The process by which the cards are read include several heating cycles that eventually make the receptor elements unusable so the life of a TLD is finite -- about 100 reads -- and then they have to be replaced.[P40A / DT-702 Card Holder]: M2200 DT-702 Card Holder:  The DT-702 Holder is used to hold and protect the DT-702 card during use. It consists of a hard plastic case with both belt and lanyard attachments. These attachments allow the DT-702 Holder (with DT-702 Card inserted) to be easily attached to the wearer during use.  The holder contains four filters corresponding to the four elements of the DT-702 Card.  Positions 1 2 3 and 4 have copper plastic mylar and tin filters respectively.  All positions have different density thickness to help discriminate different types of radiation and energies to provide an accurate dose of record when processed through the 8800 Reader.[P40A / DXTRAD Finger Ring]: M2200 DXTRAD Finger Ring:  Special dosimeter used to monitor radiation exposure to hands of workers.

The AN/TSR-9 receives and disseminates GBS broadcasts at up to 23 Mbps and is capable of processing both classified and unclassified information products such as: Imagery Intelligence Video (NTSC and Digital) Theater message traffic Joint and service-unique news Weather and MWR programming. Each AN/TSR-9 TGRS consists of a Receive Terminal (including a 1-meter parabolic dish antenna) Receive Broadcast Manager Server Power Controller Unit Crypto (KG-250) Integrated Receiver- Decoder (for NTSC video) Managed Ethernet Switch Unmanaged Ethernet Switch Video Converter and transit cases.  The new AN/TSR-11 TGRS upgrade will facilitate reception of new Transmission Security (TRANSEC) enabled Digital Video Broadcast - Satellite Second Generation Broadcast (DVB-S to DVB-S2) signal transition with a fully integrated Joint Internet Protocol Modem (JIPM) Receive Broadcast Manager (RBM).  The end state is to operate with TRANSEC enabled transmissionsVery Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT): VSAT provides beyond line-of-sight (BLOS) low-cost satellite communications to Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) commands at the Major Subordinate Commands to the Battalion levels.  VSAT enables critical voice video and data for Command and Control (C2) Fires Logistics and Intelligence.  VSAT fills a void of BLOS high bandwidth capability throughout the MAGTF.  VSAT systems already support operations on commercial SATCOM bandwidth. Additional military SATCOM frequencies (Ka-band) have already been incorporated into the large trailer mounted VSAT systems to alleviate reliance on commercial SATCOM bandwidth procurements. Additionally VSAT systems have been recently identified as the platform required to support operations on military X-band SATCOM frequencies as other systems reach obsolescence. In order to subsume the capabilities lost in the phase out of the obsolete systems VSAT systems require ECPs to incorporate X-band capability in addition to upgrade to ancillary subsystems.Secure Mobile Anti-Jam Reliable Tactical-Terminal (SMART-T):  SMART-T provides tactical users with protected data and voice via Extremely High Frequency (EHF) satellite communications. The SMART-T system is transported on High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) providing MAGTF Commanders a secure survivable long-haul low/medium data rate communications link not subject to terrain masking and horizon limitations. The SMART-T is also capable of operation when removed from the HMMWV.Defense Advanced Global Positioning System (GPS) Receiver (DAGR): The DAGR is a lightweight hand-held self-contained Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) based GPS receiver. It provides Position Velocity Navigation and Timing (PVNT) data using the GPS dual-frequency (L1/L2) Precise Positioning Service (PPS) for vehicular hand-held sensor and gun laying applications. Prices are based on quantities procured by all services during ordering.  Impact if funding is not received will result in an inability to replenish/replace equipment for units in Operation Freedom Sentinel (OFS).Tactical Communications Modernization (TCM): TCM was established to procure interim radio systems to bridge the gap between legacy systems and forecasted deliveries from the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) program.  The program schedule and budget profile for TCM procures leading edge radio systems to support the primary operational voice and data communications requirements for mounted and dismounted forces.  TCM procurements enable an initial joint networking capability and support National Security Agency (NSA) Communications Security (COMSEC) Modernization requirements.Terrestrial Wideband Transmission Systems (TWTS):  TWTS is a capabilities portfolio of terrestrial based wideband transmission systems (formerly known as TRC-170).  Portfolio includes Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) system (AN/TRC-170) and Line Of Sight (LOS) systems (AN/MRC-142 (FOS) Troposcatter Support Radio (TSSR) and Wireless Point- to-Point- Link version D (WPPL-D).- The AN/TRC-170 is a transportable BLOS terrestrial self-enclosed troposcatter terminal (multichannel) capable of transmitting and receiving digital data over varying distances up to 100 miles.- AN/MRC-142 FoS consists of the AN/MRC-142B (ship to shore) and C variants to provide LOS two-way secure voice and data communications up to 35 miles.- WPPL-D is an integrated communications system consisting of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) radios antennas and IP networking equipment that provides NIPR/SIPRNet data connectivity voice and video services.- TSSR is a multi-channel LOS wireless cable replacement communication system.

A Jun 2010 JFCOM-led AoA concluded and the USMC concurred that pursuit of a new material solution and introduction of a new system would not be cost effective.  This conclusion was based upon both cost and ability to address the four defined capability gaps in Combat Identification specific to reducing fratricide of U.S. and coalition forces.  The AoA evaluated the currently Fielded and Planned Capability Improvements (FPCI) resident within funded projects and existing programs of records across all Services and determined that the most affordable alternative would leverage the FPCI programs by allocating the CID-FFT requirements and funding capability improvements within these existing programs. The AoA further concluded that in addition to significant cost avoidance leveraging the FPCI to meet the CID-FFT requirements as opposed to establishing a new program of record material solution would have greater impact and achieve a higher percentage of CID-FFT JCD capability gap closure by 2016.  In support of a Jan 2010 Memorandum of Understanding between the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps (which documents the Army and Marine Corps agreement to support closure of the Fires on Dismounts fratricide mitigation gap) the USMC refocused the program in June 2011 to begin allocation of CID-FFT JCD requirements to the USMC FPCI programs to meet this valid Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) requirement.  Having no previous CID-FFT requirement these FPCI programs have neither planned for nor been resourced to support the additional requirements of the CID-FFT JCD.  As a result of these events this effort will ensure requirements allocation traceability and validation within 24 USMC FPCI programs in accordance with the CID-FFT JCD and JCIDS processes and provide resource funding and augment workforce to support the additional unanticipated requirements being levied on FPCI programs.  Additionally it will support aggregation of a time-phased schedule of USMC CID-FFT capabilities and future interoperability engineering/testing between FPCI systems and related modernization efforts necessary to minimize costs and measure attainment of CID-FFT JCD capability gap closure by 2016. The AoA recommendation accepted by the Services and OSD is to maintain and enhance the full range of FPCI programs to meet the requirements and mitigate CID-FFT capability gaps identified in the CID-FFT JCD.  The intent is to reduce fratricide uphold the DOD and USMC position on JCTI-G remain consistent with the AoA recommendations comply with the purpose of JCTI-G appropriations and support capability gap closure in accordance with the AoA and OSD led OIPT findings.

A Jun 2010 JFCOM-led AoA concluded and the USMC concurred that pursuit of a new material solution and introduction of a new system would not be cost effective.  This conclusion was based upon both cost and ability to address the four defined capability gaps in Combat Identification specific to reducing fratricide of U.S. and coalition forces.  The AoA evaluated the currently Fielded and Planned Capability Improvements (FPCI) resident within funded projects and existing programs of records across all Services and determined that the most affordable alternative would leverage the FPCI programs by allocating the CID-FFT requirements and funding capability improvements within these existing programs. The AoA further concluded that in addition to significant cost avoidance leveraging the FPCI to meet the CID-FFT requirements as opposed to establishing a new program of record material solution would have greater impact and achieve a higher percentage of CID-FFT JCD capability gap closure by 2016.  In support of a Jan 2010 Memorandum of Understanding between the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps (which documents the Army and Marine Corps agreement to support closure of the Fires on Dismounts fratricide mitigation gap) the USMC refocused the program in June 2011 to begin allocation of CID-FFT JCD requirements to the USMC FPCI programs to meet this valid Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) requirement.  Having no previous CID-FFT requirement these FPCI programs have neither planned for nor been resourced to support the additional requirements of the CID-FFT JCD.  As a result of these events this effort will ensure requirements allocation traceability and validation within 24 USMC FPCI programs in accordance with the CID-FFT JCD and JCIDS processes and provide resource funding and augment workforce to support the additional unanticipated requirements being levied on FPCI programs.  Additionally it will support aggregation of a time-phased schedule of USMC CID-FFT capabilities and future interoperability engineering/testing between FPCI systems and related modernization efforts necessary to minimize costs and measure attainment of CID-FFT JCD capability gap closure by 2016. The AoA recommendation accepted by the Services and OSD is to maintain and enhance the full range of FPCI programs to meet the requirements and mitigate CID-FFT capability gaps identified in the CID-FFT JCD.  The intent is to reduce fratricide uphold the DOD and USMC position on JCTI-G remain consistent with the AoA recommendations comply with the purpose of JCTI-G appropriations and support capability gap closure in accordance with the AoA and OSD led OIPT findings.

The initial KC-46 increment will replace roughly a third of the current capability. The Air Force completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in Apr 2006 to determine the most appropriate strategy to recapitalize the aging fleet of aerial refueling aircraft. Based on this analysis the Air Force concluded a strategy of full and open competition to select a commercial derivative replacement tanker aircraft would result in a best value tanker contract. To initiate the first phase of the tanker replacement the KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010 and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010. The KC-46 program held a Milestone B Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011 received approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) from OUSD (AT&L) on 24 Feb 2011 and awarded the KC-46 EMD contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft. The program plans to procure 4 RDT&E aircraft for integration and demonstration of capability that will ultimately be operationally fielded after a successful operational test phase. During production the program plans to procure 175 aircraft throughout 13 lots. Initial sustainment efforts will be provided via Interim Contractor Support (ICS). KC-46 funding will also support a follow-on sustainment planning Business Case Analysis (BCA) various studies/analyses and KC-Y/KC-Z planning activities. KC-46 funding will also support potential Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and obsolescence planning activities. The KC-46 will provide the capability to fuel joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will also augment the airlift fleet with cargo passenger and aeromedical evacuation capabilities. The KC-46 will operate in day/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment employment sustainment and redeployment of U.S. joint allied and coalition forces. The KC-46 will have communication navigation and surveillance equipment for world-wide operations; will have the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; will have the ability to operate in up to medium threat environments with self-defense/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and will have necessary battle space awareness to mitigate survivability threats. Aircrew and maintenance training systems will be developed and procured using KC-46 funding. The Aircrew Training System (ATS) entered source selection on 31 May 2012 and a contract was awarded on 1 May 2013 to FlightSafety Services Corp. The program will begin procuring ATS production devices in FY2015 by exercising Firm Fixed Price (FFP) options. The Maintenance Training System (MTS) is scheduled to enter source selection in FY2015. The program successfully completed Critical Design Review in Aug 2013; one month ahead of the contractual requirement. Live Fire Testing began in Apr 2011 and will continue through Sep 2016. Developmental Test and Evaluation is scheduled for 2014 through 2016. Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) is scheduled for 2016. The KC-46 program plans to use a combination of EMD and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) aircraft for IOT&E. Tech Orders delivery is scheduled for the third quarter of FY2017. The acquisition strategy requires sufficient aircraft to be designed tested and delivered to meet a Required Assets Available (RAA) date of 78 months after contract award. RAA is defined as 18 aircraft meeting final production configuration with all required training and support in place. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) will be attained when the Commander Air Mobility Command (AMC) determines the unit is operationally ready for war. AMC has not determined an IOC date. Full Operational Capability (FOC) is expected approximately 24 months after IOC. Note: Initial Spares are included in Exhibit P-5 because the KC-46 will initially employ Interim Contractor Support before transitioning to a 100% organically managed maintenance capability. Initial Spares will be procured with Aircraft Procurement Air Force (APAF) Aircraft Weapon System funding in 2015 and transition to APAF Aircraft Initial Spares and Repairs funding beginning in 2016. Spare engines are included within the Initial Spares line. In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181) the KC-46 is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions domestic emergency responses and providing military support to civil authorities.

These computing systems provide a flexible configurable and cost-effective range of increasing capability to meet the continuum of peacetime contingency and wartime planning requirements.  These electronic systems provide a mission data management system that efficiently interfaces with other planning systems as well as aircraft avionics.  These computing systems are procured on a four-year technical refreshment cycle to effectively address and/or alleviate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.  Once procured the systems are centrally managed for all applicable AF platforms and their operational users including Guard and Reserve Forces.The program continues the procurement of COTS computing hardware and other devices associated with the Mission Planning Systems Major Automated Information System (MAIS) program.  It also continues the procurement of all capital replacement hardware used in conjunction with MPS and other pre and post flight mission planning software.  Together this hardware and associated software enables air crews and other planners to plan the safest most effective operational missions in a timely manner.  The program procures COTS based Personal Computing (PC) Systems to include (but are not limited to) desktop computers laptops personal digital assistants (PDA) tablet PCs color printers storage devices displays other peripherals software and software licenses and other support services that together allow the user to produce the necessary charts and other mission-specific products required to effectively perform a variety of military missions. A variety of information technology navigation and communications hardware and software packages will also be procured each year to meet the varied needs of mission planning platforms and training units.  This PC-based capability when integrated with corresponding mission planning software releases provides a portable tailorable net-centric system for air crews to complete the mission planning function.  The procured items also enable air crews to effectively utilize software that has been modified to stay in sync with new capabilities incorporated into select platforms via their Operational Flight Program (OFP) update process.  They also provide a mission planning capability for precision/autonomous guided munitions and can also be networked with other Theater Battle Management (TBM) systems to further tailor a platform's mission planning environment. The MPS procurement strategy leverages the rapid increase in PC-based technology to enable high-end computing on increasingly smaller and more mission-oriented devices.  The programs procure UNIX and PC-based systems that provide flexible configurable and cost effective solutions that increase tactical and strategic capabilities to meet the continuum of operations ranging from peacetime contingencies to conventional and nuclear wartime mission planning requirements.  Each segment of the program has shifted its hardware emphasis from a limited number of large complex planning systems to more compact and personal planning devices that can be tailored to satisfy user needs.  This adjustment is a practical and efficient way to meet technology-driven challenges such as the evolutionary nature of mission planning (that necessitates recurrent hardware changes to meet overall system requirements) and advances in COTS technology that makes available new capabilities (which may lower component costs or address component obsolescence).  It is also a more effective way to address changes in the number type and deployment of aircraft/weapons that force changes in the number of UNIX and PC-based mission planning computers and their concept of operations.  1. MISSION PLANNING SYSTEMS (MPS) HARDWARE:  This acquisition is a continuation of procurement efforts to provide MPS-related hardware for Air Force platforms.  The program will provide a suite of COTS-based mission planning hardware and software systems that can be integrated with USAF Command Control Communications Computers and Intelligence (C4I) systems for the operation of USAF aircraft (e.g. A-10 F-22 B-1B F-16 F-15 RC/OC-135 E-3 E-4 E-8 RQ-4 C-130 HC-130 EC-130 HH-60 KC-135 KC-46 C-5 KC-10 C-17 U-2 B-52 B-2 MC-12 T-38) and the support of USAF training requirements.  MPS allows air crews to electronically receive tasking orders intelligence information target coordinates imagery and other information.  This information is then used to organize and prepare flight (including equipment and personnel airdrop) and weapons delivery planning data (e.g. maps charts imagery flight logs radar predications and navigation databases) that is electronically transferred to aircraft and/or precision-guided weapons.  MPS increases the combat effectiveness of Air Force aerial assets (including unmanned air vehicles conventional and low-observable aircraft and weapons) and Army guided delivery systems by supporting the use of sophisticated avionics and precision/autonomous guided munitions.  It helps to increase wartime sortie rates while improving aircrew and aircraft survivability and aircrew readiness.2. PRECISION AERIAL DELIVERY SYSTEM (PADS): PADS provides the capability for direct delivery of cargo and equipment through high altitude precision airdrops.  Currently it consists of the Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) acquisition effort.  JPADS is a collaborative effort with the Army USMC and other agencies to provide aviators the ability to accurately airdrop payloads (including supplies/equipment and technical refresh as well as personnel) to units in the field from altitudes beyond the reach of most surface-to-air weaponry.  This portion of the program procures COTS-based computing hardware support services and aerial delivery systems to enable completion of pre and in-flight mission planning functions as well as aerial delivery proficiency training in and with operational units.  Market surveys and analysis of COTS products will be used to support procurement decisions.

Both line items are necessary to achieve successful placement of National Security Space (NSS) space vehicles (SVs) on-orbit. Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0305953F. Related RDT&E AF funding is contained in PE 0604853F. This exhibit only provides funds for EELV. This program does not require and does not include advance procurement or initial spares. Flyaway Unit Cost is not applicable and Weapon System Unit Cost are not representative due to the mix (medium through heavy) of vehicles in the program. EELV procures launch services and is not a weapon system. The program provides launch capacity for the Government National Launch Forecast (NLF) requirements but does not take ownership of any specific launch hardware. The requirements for EELV launch services are derived from multiple spacecraft requirements. "To Complete" projections include only known requirements at this time. The EELV program is a Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program that acquires launch services to provide critical space support to satisfy Department of Defense (DoD) warfighter national security and other Government space lift missions while fostering inter-agency and commercial cooperation. The EELV program provides satellite delivery to specific orbits through certified Launch Vehicle (LV) providers. To maintain maximum flexibility to meet NSS requirements the Air Force acquires launch services through a white tail concept where designating configurations to specific missions is accomplished just-in-time to meet mission integration requirements. The Air Force structured the EELV program with a new cost saving acquisition strategy that includes a quantity and rate commitment with the current provider and enables competition if one or more New Entrants are certified. This strategy stabilized the industrial base provided predictability to maintain mission success and reduced costs. The Air Force National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) agreed to a coordinated strategy for certification of New Entrants to launch payloads in support of NSS and other USG requirements. The Air Force continues to actively evaluate the addition of New Entrants to reliably launch NSS requirements. Once a New Entrant demonstrates a successful launch the Air Force intends to award integration studies.  If competition is not viable at the time of need missions will be awarded to the incumbent. The Air Force plans to compete launch service procurements beginning in FY18 if there is more than one certified provider for some or all reference orbits. The implementation of this new strategy enables the DoD to reliably place NSS space vehicles into earth orbit.

SIIRCM is an integrated warning and countermeasure system to enhance aircraft survivability against IR-guided threat missile systems. The Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) is a core element of the SIIRCM concept. CMWS is an integrated ultraviolet (UV) missile warning system with an Improved Countermeasure Dispenser (ICMD) serving as a subsystem to a host aircraft. The CMWS program is a UV missile warning system that cues both flare and laser-based countermeasures to defeat incoming IR-seeking missiles and will alert aircrews to the presence of certain incoming unguided munitions. The B-Kit consists of the components which perform the missile detection and aircrew notification unguided munitions detection and aircrew notification false alarm rejection and countermeasure employment/cueing functions of the system. The CMWS Electronic Control Unit (ECU) receives UV missile detection data from Electro-Optic Missile Sensors (EOMS) and sends a missile alert signal to warn aircrews via on-board avionics. Tier 1 threat missiles detected and tracked by the CMWS are subsequently defeated by a combination of missile seeker countermeasures including decoy flares and IR Laser Jamming (currently ATIRCM equipped CH-47 platform only). In addition the CMWS ECU receives from the EOMS unguided munitions detection data which is also passed to the aircrew through aural and visual cues. The aircrew then applies the appropriate Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to break contact or engage the enemy with on-ship ordnance. The CMWS Generation 3 (Gen 3) ECU in conjunction with ongoing software development efforts will address outstanding material release conditions to achieve a Full Material Release (FMR) for CMWS and ensure protection against emerging IR-guided missile threats. The A-Kit for CMWS includes mounting hardware wiring harnesses cables and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft.

WIN-T employs a combination of terrestrial airborne and satellite-based transport options to provide robust redundant connectivity. Network modernization is the Army's top priority and WIN-T is its cornerstone program. It enables mission command on the move keeping highly mobile and dispersed forces connected to one another and to the Army's global information network. With essential voice video and data services commanders can make decisions faster than ever before and from anywhere on the battlefield. WIN-T's infrastructure provides commanders and other users the ability to communicate via voice data and video simultaneously at all levels of security.  WIN-T Increment 1: Networking At-the-HaltA state-of-the-art Beyond Line of Sight at-the-halt communications network that ensures operational relevancy and interoperability with future increments. It provides the current Warfighter with communications backbone that enables them to exchange information (voice data and video) at high speeds with high reliability throughout the tactical Division Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) and Battalion level elements.  Two sub-increments are noted as follows: (Increment 1a): Extended Networking at-the-Halt - with Ka military satellite communications capability; and (Increment 1b): Enhanced Networking at-the-Halt the Increment 1a capability adding the Net Centric Waveform (NCW) and Global Information Grid (GIG) Compliant Colorless Core Capability to enhance interoperability with subsequent WIN-T Increments.  WIN-T Inc 1 AAO is 216; reached in FY12.WIN-T Increment 2: Initial Networking On-the-MoveWarfighter Information Network (WIN-T) Increment 2 (Inc 2) provides the Army with On-The-Move (OTM) networking capability.  The Inc 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Inc 1 and by leveraging proven government and commercial technologies adds greater network throughput and automated Network Management to optimize planning (to include spectrum use) initialization monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Inc 2 employs Satellite Communications (SATCOM) OTM to extend the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) to Company level for the first time.  Using equipment mounted on combat platforms WIN-T Inc 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows key leaders to move on the battlefield while retaining Situational Awareness and Mission Command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio with the Highband Networking Waveform and high performance antennas the WIN-T Inc 2 Line-of-Sight network offers an adaptive 30 Megabit per second (Mbps) aggregate throughput to key leaders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Inc 2 network is self-forming which means that it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing meaning that the paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or loses connectivity.  This offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks.  WIN-T Inc 2 introduces the network management capability needed to keep the mobile and dispersed forces networked together through automated planning initialization monitoring and troubleshooting.

WIN-T employs a combination of terrestrial airborne and satellite-based transport options to provide robust redundant connectivity. Network modernization is the Army's top priority and WIN-T is its cornerstone program. It enables mission command on the move keeping highly mobile and dispersed forces connected to one another and to the Army's global information network. With essential voice video and data services commanders can make decisions faster than ever before and from anywhere on the battlefield. WIN-T's infrastructure provides commanders and other users the ability to communicate via voice data and video simultaneously at all levels of security.  WIN-T Increment 1: Networking At-the-HaltA state-of-the-art Beyond Line of Sight at-the-halt communications network that ensures operational relevancy and interoperability with future increments. It provides the current Warfighter with communications backbone that enables them to exchange information (voice data and video) at high speeds with high reliability throughout the tactical Division Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) and Battalion level elements.  Two sub-increments are noted as follows: (Increment 1a): Extended Networking at-the-Halt - with Ka military satellite communications capability; and (Increment 1b): Enhanced Networking at-the-Halt the Increment 1a capability adding the Net Centric Waveform (NCW) and Global Information Grid (GIG) Compliant Colorless Core Capability to enhance interoperability with subsequent WIN-T Increments.

The Inc 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Inc 1 and by leveraging proven government and commercial technologies adds greater network throughput and automated Network Management to optimize planning (to include spectrum use) initialization monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Inc 2 employs Satellite Communications (SATCOM) OTM to extend the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) to Company level for the first time.  Using equipment mounted on combat platforms WIN-T Inc 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows key leaders to move on the battlefield while retaining Situational Awareness and Mission Command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio with the Highband Networking Waveform and high performance antennas the WIN-T Inc 2 Line-of-Sight network offers an adaptive 30 Megabit per second (Mbps) aggregate throughput to key leaders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Inc 2 network is self-forming which means that it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing meaning that the paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or loses connectivity.  This offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks.

TROJAN exists to provide value added to the tactical commander with remote access to signal environments in order to maintain a high state of operational readiness and enhance the training and sustainment of highly perishable intelligence skills. Additionally the TROJAN architecture provides the infrastructure enabling split-based and force protection operations in direct support of the warfighter.TROJAN NexGEN formerly TROJAN Classic XXI (TCXXI) advances the tactical commanders' readiness in the areas of training (technical and operational signals intelligence (SIGINT)) operational intelligence production and dissemination and operational support to split-based intelligence operations supporting force protection operations. TROJAN NexGEN's principle use is to provide remote access to target environments enabling split-based operations from a sanctuary by being the gateway interface to environments of immediate relevance to every supported commander's priority intelligence requirements. In addition NexGEN will continue its role as an operational readiness system while also supporting commanders' intelligence requirements across the spectrum of conflict. TROJAN NexGEN is an intelligence and electronic warfare (IEW) system that supports the increased readiness of key mobilization personnel in preparation for actions in the mission areas of The Army Plan (TAP). NexGEN is capable of maintaining operational readiness status of unit personnel supporting the full spectrum of military operations as outlined in the Army Strategic Planning Guidance and Army Planning Guidance sections of the TAP.TROJAN NexGEN provides operational readiness capability to an Army commander employing a rapid global response capability to any level of military conflict throughout the seven mission areas. By employing reach technology relay capabilities between the forward deployed sensors and the sanctuary-based Remote Operational Facilities (ROFs) NexGEN can meet the operational deployment timelines through the use of readiness training venues to meet the requirements of units from Brigade Combat Teams through Corps and Echelon Above Corps (EAC). This operational concept provides the unique capability to remotely control the sensors and direction finding capabilities of the Deployable Collection Assets (DCAs) and process and analyze the collected information for timely reporting of time-sensitive information to the forward deployed Army Joint Service and Multi-National warfighters. TROJAN SPIRIT provides Army units with dedicated secure high capacity Sensitive Compartmented Information high intelligence data processing and communications.
