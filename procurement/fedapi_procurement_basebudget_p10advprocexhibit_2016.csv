FY16 Regular Aircraft Procurement funds to execute long lead requirements associated with the procurement of 16 aircraft in FY 2016.  The Advance Procurement (AP) funding will be used to procure long lead CFE items such as basic commerial aircraft long lead requirements (35 months); mission/weapons systems components and P-8A unique airframe components (24 months or greater production lead time). All of these long lead items are essential to maintaining the current schedule in support of the US Navy Fleet Martime Patrol and Reconaissance (MPRA) force transition from P-3C to P-8A.
