INCREMENT FIELDING: The AOC WS uses the product improvement approach for the introduction of major new system capabilities and for periodic capital equipment replacement to keep the AOC WS interoperable supportable and compliant (e.g. certification and accreditation).  Increment Fielding will provide significant Joint Command and Control (C2) interoperability; and respond to the highest priority Combatant Commander (COCOM) interoperability problems including incorporating fixes to shortfalls in interactions with COCOM targeting support systems enhancing the effectiveness and capacity of the operational picture to respond to the proliferation of sensors and resultant data as well as address serious shortfalls in performance being experienced with older third party program deliveries.  Major subsystems have enhanced their security profile and this fielding will serve as a reaccreditation of the overall AOC Weapon System baseline.  By taking advantage of the commercial progress in data center consolidation and by introducing large scale virtualization it greatly enhances the sustainment profile of the system and provides an excellent transition point for the AOC WS modernization baseline.  Primary efforts in increment fielding include Capital Equipment Replacement Recurring Events (REs) and Integrated Air & Missile Defense (IAMD).  	There are three distinct categories of AOCs:  Geographic Functional and assorted AOC Support Functions (Help Desk Formal Training Unit and Air Reserve Component sites).  While all sites start with the standardized 10.1 baseline each is specifically tailored to the needs of the associated COCOM or Functional Command.  Thus as no two AOCs are alike when a capital equipment replacement or RE is accomplished each site is unique and requires its own specifically designed site-engineered fielding plan and associated hardware which drives differences in site specific (i.e. unit) costs.Funding may be used to alleviate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.           a.  CAPITAL EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT: FY14 funds will be used to keep the AOCs and their associated support sites up-to-date by replacing end-of-life/end of support components with solutions that will bridge between 10.1 and 10.2 (e.g. selective deployment of virtualization technologies centralized data center support concepts for Guard and Reserve commands and core radio package).  Virtualization technologies will help maximize system utilization by reducing costs and providing a more resilient infrastructure through the combining of multiple work environments into a single-point.  FY14 capital equipment replacement will address numerous commercial end-of-life and DMS components that must be resolved.  Differences in site specific setup (due to variations between Combatant Commander or Functional Command needs) will drive differences in site specific requirements.  Therefore there is no meaningful way to measure quantities as the capital equipment replacement of each site is significantly different.            b.  RECURRING EVENTS (RE): REs are regularly scheduled spiral upgrades to keep the AOC interoperable supportable and compliant (e.g. certification and accreditation).  They are normally comprised of hardware/software changes/updates and security patches.  Each RE is based on new warfighter-validated needs and improvements to the AOC WS.  The spiral upgrades will vary in levels of complexity based on what system changes are required and therefore incorporated.  The level-of-complexity upgrades will impact the recurring costs of fielding the upgrades: each annual spiral upgrade is based on the number of systems affected what aging equipment needs to undergo capital equipment replacement and the length of time necessary to accomplish the modification at each site.  FY14 will fund REs periodic maintenance upgrades emergency fixes and other activities (e.g. security fixes testing activities) potentially affecting some or all AOCs (Geographical/Functional/Support/Air Reserve Component) and their associated support sites.  Additionally differences in site specific setup (due to variations between Combatant Commander or Functional Command needs) will drive differences in site specific requirements.  Therefore there is no meaningful way to measure quantities as the fielding of an RE to each site is significantly different.            c.  TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION: FY14 funds will procure and update the current baseline Descriptive List of Applicable Publications AOC unique systems (e.g. Boundary Security System) and technical documents for the AOC WS.  The funds will also be used to maintain the AOC WS technical documentation in a common location.            d.  TRAINING: FY14 funds will be used to provide initial cadre instruction for installation and difference training related to operating and supporting the fielded AOC WS.              e.  INTEGRATED AIR & MISSLE DEFENSE (IAMD): Operational C2 of IAMD is a project dedicated to increasing the operational capacity of the current AOC in counter air ballistic missile defense and intercontinental ballistic missile defense.  The purpose of the effort is to integrate existing systems and enhance dynamic planning re-planning capabilities.  No FY14 funding requested.   2.  PROGRAM MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION (PMA): The breakdown of this activity includes the following:            a.  PROGRAM SUPPORT: FY14 funding includes provisions for government contract oversight technical expertise and program management office support associated with 10.1 baseline standardization of the AOC weapon system.            b.  TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION: No FY14 funding requested; realigned to item 1.d.            c.  TRAINING: No FY14 funding requested; realigned to item 1.e.Items requested in FY14 are identified on the following P-5 and are representative of items to be procured.

IER rapidly mitigates intelligence infrastructure shortfalls through exploitation of COTS GOTS and Non-Developmental Item technology to the greatest extent practical. IER also centralizes support for Marine Corps intelligence infrastructure items and systems that are not separately identified within the program funding lines. IER provides the capability to address requirements that span across the entire Marine Corps Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance Enterprise (MCISR-E).Wide Field of View Persistent Surveillance (WFVPS) is a capability that supports Persistent Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (PISR) Improvised Explosive Device (IED) mitigation and actionable intelligence in urban and other operations (e.g. disaster relief security etc).  The WFVPS Ground Receive Station (GRS) will allow wide area near real time geo-registered imagery to be incorporated into tactical level intelligence products.  The WFVPS ground distribution network consists of the GRS servers storage viewer client stations and provides components to bring multi-intelligence data from programs of record into a Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) Integration Backbone for distribution and publishing to the Intelligence Enterprise.  The WFVPS GRS is being produced as a component for the Wide Focal Plane Array Camera (WFPAC) effort in response to Marine Corps UUNS (10335UA) and CENTCOM JUONS (CC-0424).  WFPAC represents a significant additive/new capability for the Counter IED (CIED) fight.Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) is a long-range air-to-ground surveillance system composed of a USAF E-8C aircraft JSTARS Common Ground Stations (CGS) and Joint Service Workstations (JSWS).MAGTF Secondary Imagery Dissemination System (MSIDS) is the only FoS that provides organic tactical digital imagery collection transmission and receiving capability to the MAGTF Commander. MSIDS is comprised of components necessary to enable Marines to capture manipulate annotate transmit or receive images in near real time (NRT) internally with subordinate commands that are widely separated throughout the area of operations and externally with higher adjacent commands. The MSIDS capability resides with the MAGTF G/S-2 sections and Ground Reconnaissance Battalions Infantry Battalion Scout Sniper Platoons and Marine Special Operations Command. The MSIDS FoS extends the digital imaging capability to all echelons within the MEF down to and including battalions and squadrons. Captured images are capable of being forwarded throughout the MAGTF through the use of Base Station Workstation/Communication Interface (BW/CI) Outstation Workstation/Communication Interface (OW/CI) or existing C4ISR architecture. Images can also be transmitted to the Tactical Exploitation Group (TEG) for more detailed processing and analysis. The MSIDS Video Exploitation Workstation (VEW) requirement within Infantry Battalions and Wing units down to the squadron level has grown from 18 to 140. The VEW is utilized to import manipulate annotate still and video imagery create intelligence products lift still frames from video view multi-format TV signals and provide a field briefing capability.

"3ff3d1e8aba8bef2e4cac152ecd904cc","The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced fire-and-forget short-range man-portable air defense weapon system.  It provides low-altitude defense for ground forces against attack or aerial observation by low-flying Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Cruise Missile (CM) Rotary Wing (RW) and high-performance Fixed-Wing (FW) threats.  Stinger employs an infrared (heat seeking)/ultraviolet seeker to guide to the target.  Stinger Block I has extensive infrared counter-countermeasure capabilities and can engage targets from any aspect to include head-on.  The missile utilizes a high-explosive hit-to-kill warhead.  Stinger can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles helicopters and UAS.  The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.

On 17 September 2009 the President announced an overarching policy to provide regional missile defense to U.S. deployed forces allies and partners in Europe called the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA). Within this policy a European PAA specifically addresses a timeline to deploy a mix of afloat and land-based Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities. Aegis Ashore represents one of these land-based capabilities. Phase III of EPAA (2018 timeframe): Deploys a land based Aegis Ashore in Poland and introduces an upgraded Standard Missile the SM-3 Block IIA. This missile brings improved coverage against medium and intermediate range ballistic threats and extends coverage to the bulk of the European continent. Aegis Ashore is a key component of Phases II and III in the European PAA and will provide Aegis Missile Defense capability against short and medium range ballistic missiles in an ashore configuration. It will be similar to the Aegis At-Sea BMD capability inherent in the DDG-113 series of the Arleigh Burke Class Destroyers to facilitate training and logistical support by the lead service Navy. Aegis Ashore essentially re-hosts the required BMD components of a Navy Destroyer in an ashore configuration to include a Deckhouse structure and weapon system comprised of a  SPY radar Vertical Launch System computing infrastructure Command Control Communications Computers and Intelligence (C4I) systems and operator consoles.

The flyaway unit cost is not included on the P-40 exhibit because there are multiple P-5 Cost Analysis exhibits.SBIRS's primary mission is to provide initial warning of a ballistic missile attack on the US its deployed forces and its allies.  SBIRS will enhance detection and improve reporting of intercontinental ballistic missiles submarine launched ballistic missiles and tactical ballistic missiles.  SBIRS provides increased detection and tracking performance in order to meet requirements in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD).  SBIRS will consist of satellites in Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) and payloads in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) with an integrated centralized ground station serving all SBIRS space elements Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites and other program related support activities. The HEO payloads operate on a classified host.SBIRS GEO-3 and 4 satellites are derivatives of the first two GEO satellites which were delivered on the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract (RDT&E funded).  The GEO-3 and 4 satellite production efforts are necessary to meet constellation requirements.  In December 2008 the Department approved the procurement of GEO-3 and 4 satellites and the HEO-3 and 4 payloads using a Cost-Plus contract. The Acquisition Strategy to procure GEO-5 and 6 was approved on 26 Feb 2012.  The subsequent Defense Acquisition Board resulted in a 24 Aug 12 Acquisition Decision Memorandum authorizing release of the production Request For Proposal.  A three phased contract approach first awarded non-recurring engineering for parts obsolescence using advanced procurement funds on 10 Sep 2012. This was followed by the award of long lead production items in Feb 2013.  Phase three will award full production of the two satellites.  GEO-5 and 6 satellites are planned as derivatives of the GEO-3 and 4 satellites.  GEO-5 and 6 will be procured through the Department of Defense Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) approach which seeks stable production and strategic sub-tier management through the block buy of space vehicles employing fixed-priced contracting.  The SBIRS block buy of two satellites enables savings by reducing the effect of obsolescence and production breaks.  Additionally ESP seeks cost efficiencies with the prime and subcontractor team through block buys and a healthy space industrial base.FY14 continues the incremental funding of the GEO 5-6 block buy.  The FY13 NDAA authorizes six years of incremental funding and limits the incrementally funded contract obligation to $3900M.  The years of incremental funding are FY13-18.  Advance procurement was appropriated in FY11 and FY12.  GEO 5-6 advance procurement and incremental funding are attributed to FY13 for the purposes of identifying full funding for procurement end items.  Each year of appropriation FY13-18 is in two parts the incrementally funded contract amount and annual program support costs.  The incrementally funded amount complies with the NDAA cap.  SBIRS HEO-3 and 4 payloads are replenishments for HEO-1 and 2 payloads which were delivered on the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract (RDT&E funded).  The HEO-1 and 2 payloads are accepted and certified for Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) missile warning operations and certified for technical intelligence operations.To-complete costs are zero for SBIRS GEO 3-4 per the SBIRS Service Cost Position (SCP) dated April 14 2011.

"1a09dbf9d80037e403c1d607d8f795c0","1.  The DDG Modernization Program is required to upgrade the 28 in-service Flight I and II DDG-51 Class ships in order to keep them relevant and affordable components of the Navy's Sea Power 21 Plan.  The DDG Modernization Program is composed of a series of improvements in both the HM&E and Combat Systems (CS) areas installed in two respective phases beginning with the oldest ships first.  The modernization installations are planned for each ship at approximately the midlife point for each hull.  The quantity line represents the total DDG Modernization availabilities (HM&E and Combat Systems) started in each fiscal year.  HM&E: 2-3-2-3-3-4-5 Combat System: 1-2-1-2-1-2-2The HM&E Phase I of the program will be comprised of the technologies transitioned from SCN funded DDG 111/112 and those additional improvements required to support the expected service life of the DDG 51 Class.  The upgrades will focus on Technologies that reduce workload and Total Ownership Costs (TOC) for the remaining hull life of each ship.The centerpiece of the CS Phase II of DDG Modernization will be the Aegis Weapon System (AWS) upgrade.  This upgrade will consist of the introduction of displays computing equipment and the computer program required to implement Aegis Open Architecture (AOA) and replacement of the existing SPY-1D Signal Processor (SIGPRO) with the Multi-Mission Signal Processor.  Selected warfighting improvements will also be installed in conjunction with the combat systems upgrade.   This modernization program will provide a core modernization of the  infrastructure "foundation" of each ship including the core engineering plan core computing plan and Combat Information Center (CIC).  This modernization program will also provide an infrastructure foundation that will function as a landing zone for future warfighting capabilities.Common equipment procurements made in prior years for Cruiser Modernization will be utilized for one Destroyer Modernization in FY14.[P40A / DM002 - LAND BASED ENGINEERING SITES]: Funds will be used to upgrade shore facilities for Combat Systems and HM&E alterations providing risk reduction testing.[P40A / DM013 - CONJUNCTIVE ALTERATION DEFINITION AND INTEGRATION]: Procures Conjunctive Alteration Definition and Integration that includes equipment procurement non-recurring and recurring engineering equipment integration and Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) products  for 28 in-service Flight I and II DDG 51 Class ships (DDG 51-DDG 78) as well as Flight IIA ships (DDG 79-DDG 112).[P40A / DMCA1 - DDG-51 MODERNIZATION PROGRAM CONGRESSIONAL ADD]: Description:  DDG Modernization Congressional AddProcures AN/SQQ-89 A(V)15 with Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA) and other equipment for DDG Modernization Program that consist of hardware software system engineering integrated logistics support system test & evaluation training data installation assistance teams spare and repair parts and program management for 28 in-service Flight I and II DDG 51 Class ships (DDG 51-DDG 78).[P40A / DMCA3 - COMMUNICATIONS UPGRADE FOR DDG MOD CONGRESSIONAL ADD]: Description:  Communications Upgrade for DDG Modernization Congressional AddProcures communications upgrades for DDG Modernization Program that consist of hardware software system engineering integrated logistics support system test & evaluation training data installation assistance teams spare and repair parts and program management for 28 in-service Flight I and II DDG 51 Class ships (DDG 51-DDG 78).[P40A / DMCA4 - SMART VALVE AUTOMATIC FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEM]: Description: Congressional Add for Smart Valve system.The Smart Valve is the enabling technology behind the Automatic Fire Suppression System (AFSS) which provides the sensing capability to detect ruptures in the fire main piping system that occur during a damage event; the ability to isolate damaged sections of the piping system; and the embedded "intelligence" to reconfigure the system to maintain firefighting capability where it is most needed without any operator intervention for in-service Flight I and II DDG 51 Class ships (DDG 51-DDG 78).[P40A / DDG-51 DSA FOR FY14 AVAILABILITY]: As a result of the Department's decision to decommission seven (7) Cruisers procurements made in prior years for these Cruisers will be installed on four (4) remaining Cruisers and one (1) Destroyer. Interchangeable Cruiser/Destroyer combat system equipment will be installed on DDG 51 during the FY 14 DDG combat system availability. This equipment will not require procurement funding in FY12; however DDG 51 will still require Design Services Allocation (DSA) and installation funding in FY12-14.[P40A / DM6IN - INSTALLATION]: Funds are for installation of DDG Modernization equipment in support of the Fleet Modernization Program.[P3A / DM001 - DDG MODERNIZATION HME (GEDMS)]: Gigabit Ethernet Data Multiplexing System (GEDMS) replaces the obsolete copper machinery control LAN infrastructure with a new system based on the widely used Ethernet industry standard.[P3A / DM001 - DDG MODERNIZATION HME (MCS/DCS)]: Machinery Control System (MCS) replaces the obsolete control consoles while also delivering enhanced capability to the fleet through improved situational awareness and reconfigurable user stations.

The DDG Modernization Program is required to upgrade the 28 in-service Flight I and II DDG-51 Class ships in order to keep them relevant and affordable components of the Navy's Sea Power 21 Plan.  The DDG Modernization Program is composed of a series of improvements in both the HM&E and Combat Systems (CS) areas installed in two respective phases beginning with the oldest ships first.  The modernization installations are planned for each ship at approximately the midlife point for each hull.  The quantity line represents the total DDG Modernization availabilities (HM&E and Combat Systems) started in each fiscal year.  HM&E: 2-3-2-3-3-4-5 Combat System: 1-2-1-2-1-2-2The HM&E Phase I of the program will be comprised of the technologies transitioned from SCN funded DDG 111/112 and those additional improvements required to support the expected service life of the DDG 51 Class.  The upgrades will focus on Technologies that reduce workload and Total Ownership Costs (TOC) for the remaining hull life of each ship.The centerpiece of the CS Phase II of DDG Modernization will be the Aegis Weapon System (AWS) upgrade.  This upgrade will consist of the introduction of displays computing equipment and the computer program required to implement Aegis Open Architecture (AOA) and replacement of the existing SPY-1D Signal Processor (SIGPRO) with the Multi-Mission Signal Processor.  Selected warfighting improvements will also be installed in conjunction with the combat systems upgrade.   This modernization program will provide a core modernization of the  infrastructure "foundation" of each ship including the core engineering plan core computing plan and Combat Information Center (CIC).  This modernization program will also provide an infrastructure foundation that will function as a landing zone for future warfighting capabilities.Common equipment procurements made in prior years for Cruiser Modernization will be utilized for one Destroyer Modernization in FY14.[P40A / DM002 - LAND BASED ENGINEERING SITES]: Funds will be used to upgrade shore facilities for Combat Systems and HM&E alterations providing risk reduction testing.[P40A / DM013 - CONJUNCTIVE ALTERATION DEFINITION AND INTEGRATION]: Procures Conjunctive Alteration Definition and Integration that includes equipment procurement non-recurring and recurring engineering equipment integration and Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) products  for 28 in-service Flight I and II DDG 51 Class ships (DDG 51-DDG 78) as well as Flight IIA ships (DDG 79-DDG 112).[P40A / DMCA1 - DDG-51 MODERNIZATION PROGRAM CONGRESSIONAL ADD]: Description:  DDG Modernization Congressional AddProcures AN/SQQ-89 A(V)15 with Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA) and other equipment for DDG Modernization Program that consist of hardware software system engineering integrated logistics support system test & evaluation training data installation assistance teams spare and repair parts and program management for 28 in-service Flight I and II DDG 51 Class ships (DDG 51-DDG 78).[P40A / DMCA3 - COMMUNICATIONS UPGRADE FOR DDG MOD CONGRESSIONAL ADD]: Description:  Communications Upgrade for DDG Modernization Congressional AddProcures communications upgrades for DDG Modernization Program that consist of hardware software system engineering integrated logistics support system test & evaluation training data installation assistance teams spare and repair parts and program management for 28 in-service Flight I and II DDG 51 Class ships (DDG 51-DDG 78).[P40A / DMCA4 - SMART VALVE AUTOMATIC FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEM]: Description: Congressional Add for Smart Valve system.The Smart Valve is the enabling technology behind the Automatic Fire Suppression System (AFSS) which provides the sensing capability to detect ruptures in the fire main piping system that occur during a damage event; the ability to isolate damaged sections of the piping system; and the embedded "intelligence" to reconfigure the system to maintain firefighting capability where it is most needed without any operator intervention for in-service Flight I and II DDG 51 Class ships (DDG 51-DDG 78).[P40A / DDG-51 DSA FOR FY14 AVAILABILITY]: As a result of the Department's decision to decommission seven (7) Cruisers procurements made in prior years for these Cruisers will be installed on four (4) remaining Cruisers and one (1) Destroyer.

"cb05263063d81ba0c1908ca4c20596b0","Cost-To-Complete (CTC) reflects current DCGS-N Increment 1 Program Life Cycle Cost Estimate (PLCCE) and does not include CTC for DCGS-N Increment 2 JSIPS-N or ICOP which are included in PE 0305208N 2914 OPN budget.The Distributed Common Ground System - Navy (DCGS-N) is the Navy's portion of the Under Secretary of Defense Intelligence (USD (I)) DCGS-N Family of Systems (FoS). The Department of Defense (DoD) has defined a DCGS architecture that will be verifiably compatible and interoperable across all of the Services' Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems and operations. DCGS accesses and ingests data from space borne airborne subsurface and surface ISR collection assets intelligence databases and intelligence producers. This collected data is shared across a Joint enterprise using the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) and in time the Joint Intelligence Enterprise (JIE) to enhance access and sharing of ISR information across Joint forces through the use of common enterprise standards and services. DCGS FoS supports Joint Task Force (JTF)-level and below combat operations with critical intelligence for battle management and information dominance across the full spectrum of operations including peace conflict war and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). DCGS is a cooperative effort between the services agencies and DoD to provide systems capable of receiving processing exploiting and disseminating data from airborne and national reconnaissance platforms. DCGS-N core components include the Analyst Work Station from the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) - Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (I3) Generic Area Limitation Environment (GALE) Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Common Geo-positioning Services (CGS) Image Product Library (IPL) Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB) Joint Concentrator Architecture (JCA) and Track Management Services. The DCGS-N system represents the integration of 1) The processing and exploitation of tactical and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) and Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); 2) Precision target geopositioning mensuration and imagery dissemination capabilities; 3) Selected national IMINT requirements and processing capabilities from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA); and 4) Sharing of Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance and Targeting and Command and Control information via DIB JIE and Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) standards with a wide range of customers (e.g. Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M)) Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) and many others. The DCGS-N Enterprise Node (DEN) which incorporates DIB and JIE standards facilitates interoperability and data sharing among the DCGS FoS. DCGS-N will stay abreast of evolving requirements and ensure compliance with the DoD DCGS network architecture. DCGS-N Increment 2 addresses a critical shortfall in Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) capability and capacity to support operational tactical planning and execution across the full range of joint military operations. Existing TCPED shortfalls will be exacerbated by planned Navy Joint and Allied fielding of new Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms. Currently fielded systems provide localized processing capabilities that will be overwhelmed in the out-years without a significant change in the way the Navy processes exploits and disseminates intelligence data. DCGS-N Increment 2 will deliver all source fusion and analytical capabilities; provide Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) capabilities; integrate Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) capabilities to improve the use and analysis of sensor and platform data; based on an enterprise solution to share this information across commands services and agencies to promote shared situational awareness. The Navy is focusing on establishing an ISR Enterprise way ahead that will emphasize a reach back strategy with a focus on providing intelligence products to support deployed ship and shore operations. The Navy will also initiate migration to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that requires the development integration and testing of a Maritime ISR Enterprise capability development and migration of ISR SOA applications and development and integration to leverage the Consolidated Afloat Network and Enterprise Services (CANES) strategy for a Common Computing Environment (CCE). Additionally DCGS-N will become the focal point for migration of Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) fusion and analysis (MFAS) tool applications for the Navy. Joint Service Imagery Processing System - Navy (JSIPS-N) tech refresh and JSIPS-N Service Life Extension Program (JSLEP) upgrades provide shipboard digital imagery capability to receive exploit store and disseminate imagery products based on national theater and tactical sensors. JSIPS-N service life extension is comprised of five subsystems: Joint Concentrator Architecture (JCA) Common Geo-positioning Service (CGS) Image Product Library (IPL) Imagery Exploitation Support System (IESS) and the Sharp Display System (SDS). JSIPS-N is the Navy's legacy imagery processing system. JSLEP will overcome JSIPS-N End-of-Life hardware challenges software obsolescence and improve systems reliability until DCGS-N fully replaces JSIPS-N ashore and afloat.Intelligence Carry-On Program (ICOP) is a suite of multi-source intelligence and analytical capabilities which includes an integrated Three-Dimensional (3-D) operational picture displaying intelligence and other data sources to provide a richer and more complete picture of the battle space on Unit Level platforms. The system supports a full motion video capability that receives processes exploits and disseminates organic and non-organic data as well as the ability to process and correlate Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) and external Communications Intelligence (COMINT Externals). It integrates a menu of mature Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) applications with shared storage and communication paths to reach back to the DCGS-N Enterprise Node (DEN) and to provide data sharing to the Maritime Operations Centers (MOCS) and national ISR systems making tactical users a part of the larger ISR enterprise. Product Improvement includes DCGS-N training equipment DCGS-N hardware and software technical refresh ancillary equipment and upgrades to extend service life and provide the fleet imagery intelligence capability.

"91ff9cbf8c81e2bbd8eed1454ff1d58b","Night Vision Equipment (NVE) - Consists of multiple optical Electro-Optical (EO) and laser systems which allow the dismounted Marine the ability to acquire locate identify and engage targets during daylight and limited visibility conditions and perform navigation and manual tasks during limited visibility conditions utilizing ambient or covert illumination. Current systems typically are comprised of a single operating modality such as direct viewing of visible wavelengths low light image intensification (I2) or thermal imaging.  Complementary systems such as near-infrared laser pointers viewable only through I2 devices provide enhancement of threat identification capabilities. This line also supports a Marine Corps organic approach to NVE total life-cycle sustainment through the acquisition and procurement of expeditionary maintenance systems.FAMILY OF OPTICAL SYSTEMS and MODIFICATIONS (FOSAM) - Previously named Family of Optical Systems (FOS).  This program encompasses all optical systems providing handheld helmet mounted and weapons optics systems including various thermal image intensifier magnified optical laser range-finding illuminating and pointer functionalities.  Replaces multiple single-purpose NVE fielded to the Marine Corps.  NIGHT VISION MODIFICATION (NVM) - Procures and installs modification kits and provides essential services to maintain and improve quality of performance safety and life-cycle support in excess of 620000 legacy Principle End Items (PEIs).  The NVM program provides a means of maintaining and upgrading the Marine Corps NVE through technological advances and to develop Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) for legacy PEIs.

Thermal imagers operate by discerning the temperature variation between targets and their background and are completely passive devices.  Thermal imagers can be used not only for target detection and engagement with Marine Corps individual and crew-served weapons; they can be used for all-weather surveillance as well.SQUAD THERMAL SYSTEM (STS) - The STS is a lightweight thermal imager that can be used in the handheld mode or in the weapon-mounted clip-on mode that is compatible with the AN/PVQ-31 Rifle Combat Optic (RCO).  The STS will have an integrated Class 3B infrared (IR) laser pointer with two modes of operation: training (eye-safe) and tactical (non-eye safe).  The IR pointer will assist in target designation when used with image intensification (I2) night vision devices.FAMILY OF INFANTRY WEAPONS SYSTEMS (FIWS) - Procures Night Vision Equipment (NVE) Principle End Item (PEI) systems lost or damaged beyond economical repair.

"83b70777c3c40edea876f5f015a00495","The US Army operational requirements concept for Infrared (IR) countermeasure systems is known as the Suite of Integrated Infrared Countermeasures (SIIRCM).  SIIRCM is an integrated warning and countermeasure system to enhance aircraft survivability against IR guided threat missile systems. The Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) is a core element of the SIIRCM concept. CMWS is an integrated ultraviolet (UV) missile warning system and Improved Countermeasure Dispenser (ICMD) serving as a subsystem to a host aircraft.  The CMWS program is a UV missile warning system that cues both flare and laser countermeasures to defeat incoming IR missiles and will provide a limited ability to warn aircrews of incoming unguided munitions.  The B-Kit consists of the components which perform the missile detection and aircrew notification unguided munitions detection and aircrew notification false alarm rejection hostile missile declaration and countermeasure employment functions of the system. The CMWS Electronic Control Unit (ECU) receives UV missile detection data from Electro-optic Missile Sensors (EOMS) and sends a missile alert signal to alert crewmen via on-board avionics. Tier 1 threat missiles detected and tracked by the CMWS are subsequently defeated by a combination of missile seeker countermeasures including decoy flares and IR Laser Jamming (CH-47 platform only). In addition the CMWS ECU receives detections of unguided munitions which it then passes to the aircrew through aural and visual cues.  The aircrew then applies the appropriate Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to break contact or engage the enemy with on ship ordnance. The CMWS Generation 3 (Gen 3) ECU will meet Tier 1 requirements while retaining a low false alarm rate. The Gen 3 ECU is required to obtain a Full Material Release (FMR) for CMWS and ensure protection against emerging IR guided missile threats. The A-Kit for CMWS includes mounting hardware wiring harnesses cables and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft. The A-Kit ensures the mission kit is functionally and physically operational with a specific host aircraft type.CMWS will continue to spend RDT&E funds on the next generation sensor studies new algorithm updates (Tier 2/3 upgrades) to counter new variants missiles and program security initiatives.  The sensor studies will evaluate current CMWS technology as compared to the Navy Joint Allied Threat Awareness System (JATAS) program and other service missile warning systems and look at the pros and cons of UV missile warning sensors compared to infrared missile warning sensors for Army aircraft.  The study will also examine other technologies to possibly enhance the CMWS UV sensor with either an IR or acoustic adjunct to determine possible cost savings to the United States Government (USG).","2014","Army","CMWS","Millions","AZ3517","29","Thousands","Each","Fiscal Year (FY)14 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $126.869 million supports CMWS recurring production of Gen 3 ECUs A-Kit procurement and installation software upgrade efforts required to achieve full material release associated system test and evaluation efforts training simulator upgrades and integration with other ASE systems.All COMPO 1 ActiveIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181) this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions domestic emergency responses and providing military support to civil authorities.","0604274A","Each","Aircraft Procurement Army","Ground Support Avionics","2031A","AB","4","10","2013-04","PB","Support Equipment and Facilities","1418710093","2014-12-16T06:08:13+00:00","2014","http://comptroller.defense.gov/budgetmaterials.aspx","dodbudget","record","public","procurement-base","PROCUREMENT_JustificationBook_Army_PB_2014.xml","2014","","Army Active","127.751","104.251","","155.324","192.472","50.107","126.869","149.073","126.869","","","","","","","","","","",

"c8a04dbdd71f4aaa87efe420be4f08c8","FY 2013 funding totals includes $8.0M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  The FY 2014 $2.7M OCO funding request will complete the X-Net integration effort on the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT aircraft started with FY 2013 OCO funding. The USAF's Manned Reconnaissance Systems program includes seventeen RC-135 V/W RIVET JOINT three RC-135S COBRA BALL and two RC-135U COMBAT SENT mission aircraft.  The RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT is the variant with the majority of the aircraft in this program element and as a result drives the Baseline integration and modification upgrade strategy for the entire RC-135 fleet.  Therefore the majority of the modification budget is directly related to the RIVET JOINT weapon system baseline strategy which subsequently spills over in the baseline strategies for COBRA BALL and COMBAT SENT weapon systems.An RC-135 Viability Assessement was conducted in 2008 and the results reported that despite their fleet average airframe age (44 years) and accumulated flight hours (38000) as of the end of fiscal year 2007 the RC-135 should be able to continue to meet the user's needs by performing intended operations until at least through the year 2040.  Viability was assessed based on underlying analyses of reliability maintainability performance corrosion fatigue architectural stability safety and availability.  The Viability Assessment also summarized that the RC-135 fleet has experienced significant improvements in reliability maintainability and availability since FY 2001.  The Program Manager attributes these improvements directly to the BIG SAFARI Baseline integration and modification upgrade strategy and the synergies gained with long standing relationships with the RC-135 industry partners.     FY 2014 funding efforts will concentrate on Baseline 11 integration efforts which also indirectly reacts to the 2012 RC-135 Multi-Attribute Utility Assessment (MUA) which detailed operational effectivness cost and program analyses of the alternative weapons system configurations (e.g. C-37 KC-46 P-8 RQ-4).  The MUA determined that retaining and sustaining the RC-135V/W airframe offers the highest assessed weapons system utility (measured as a benefit of cost-to-risk ratio) over the 25 year assessment period.Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0305207F Manned Reconnaissance Systems.","2014","Air Force","RC-135","Millions","DARP01","64","Millions","Each","Where applicable justification for individual modifications is provided in the P-3A exhibits.","0305207F","Each","Aircraft Procurement Air Force","Other Aircraft","3010F","AB","5","5","2013-04","PB","Modification of Inservice Aircraft","1418709963","2014-12-16T06:06:03+00:00","2014","http://comptroller.defense.gov/budgetmaterials.aspx","dodbudget","record","public","procurement-base","PROCUREMENT_JustificationBook_Air_Force_PB_2014.xml","2014","A","Air Force Active","173.237","162.211","","180.887","177.641","184.143","171.813","174.256","171.813","","","","","","","","","","",

"495b322933ac3fb971dc96dde61886b4","The WAR CONSUMABLES P-1 line item has two subcategories:  Common Aircraft Ancillary Equipment (AAE) and Aerial Refueling Stores (ARS). The Common AAE program procures modifies and upgrades common bomb racks peculiar bomb racks missile launchers and related support for USN/USMC platforms. The ARS portion procures modifies and upgrades aerial refueling stores External Fuel Tanks (EFT) and related support.COMMON AIRCRAFT ANCILLARY EQUIPMENT (AAE)As directed by OPNAVINST 8000.16B (Naval Ordnance Maintenance Management Program (NOMMP) the appropriation provides for procurement of new AAE to replace attrition losses provides for production engineering support and satisfies commonality policy goals set forth by the Navy's Strike Warfare Master Plan.  Specifically the following equipment is procured in AAE:- Upgrades modifications and reliability improvements to common and peculiar bomb rack.- Upgrades modifications and reliability improvements to various missile launchers and associated equipment.- Upgrades modifications and reliability improvements to Pure Air Generating Systems (PAGS).  There are two variants of PAGS Marotta Pure Air Compression Technology (MPACT)/High Pressure Pure Air Generators (HiPPAG) currently in use as on-board coolant generator for missile launchers carrying infrared (IR) seeking missiles.- Common PAGS Interface Assembly provides electrical connectivity and a conduit for nitrogen flow between the PAGS unit and the missile launcher.- Funding for BRU-55s (Bomb Rack Unit) in FY13-15 transferred from Dual Carriage Smart (1760) Bomb Rack due to 4.2 determination that the Dual Carriage Smart Bomb Rack will not be cost-effective.- Digital Improved Triple Ejector Rack (DITER) increases the capability of the existing BRU-42 for the AV-8B by adding a smart carriage capability for weapons such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM).  Development Testing 3Q09 thru 3Q10 Integrated Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) 1Q10 thru 4Q11.- Joint Miniature Munitions Bomb Rack Unit (JMM BRU) (BRU-61A/A) is required for operation and carriage of the Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) weapon.  The BRU-61/A  is currently in production for the USAF but has not been qualified to DoN environments.  BRU-61A/A will be carried on F-35B and F-35C.  FY18 is the first year of Navy procurement of BRU-61A/A  to support the SDB II FY20 IOC.  FY18 includes 40 units for IOC First Article Acceptance Test (FAAT) and schoolhouse requirements.  As a result of the change in acquisition strategy from sole source to competition the unit cost for the LRIP units have increased.- Dual Carriage Smart (1760) Bomb Rack - BRU-33 upgrade to allow for dual carriage of 1760 class weapons while retaining legacy weapons carriage. The intent for the BRU-33 upgrade was to generate a government owned technical data package (TDP) for a bomb rack that would replicate the BRU-55 capability and to procure Smart Canted Verticals (CVERS) via a full and open competitive process.  A AIR 4.2 Business Case Analysis (BCA) determined that the generation of the TDP subsequent qualification testing and the planned procurement of the Smart CVER vice the BRU-55 would result in a negative return on investment.  Therefore the Dual Carriage Smart Bomb Rack funding has been moved to the BRU-55 line to procure the BRU-55 across the FYDP to achieve the needed inventory objective.AERIAL REFUELING STORES (ARS)The ARS program finances Aerial Refueling Systems EFT and related support.  Requirements are determined by an inventory objective which supports peacetime/wartime needs.  Aircraft equipped with the A/A42R-1 Aerial Refueling Stores (ARS) are required for all carrier based tanking missions (overhead tanking (primarily recovery focused) strike and yo-yo tanking).  Total reliance on the ARS and integration in the F/A-18E/F requires substantial improvements to the existing stores to ensure their viability through 2040. Investigation of major subsystems in pursuit of life cycle cost savings mitigation of flight safety risk and reliability enhancements have identified a large dollar value return on investment for service life extension reduction in flight safety risk and areas where reliability improvements can be realized.- ARS upgrade to the avionics/electrical system- Replacement of External Fuel Tanks for F/A-18 (A-D variants) required to meet the Fleet Response plan and replace original equipment due to fatigue issues.- External Fuel Tank Support Equipment- Provides production support modification and modernization of ARS and EFT products.FY14 provides funding to procure modify and/or upgrade bomb racks and missle launchers BRU-55 ARS EFT's and associated support.","2014","Navy","War Consumables","Millions","0720","68","Dollars","Each","The BRU-55 was developed by PMA-201 as part of the Mk-82 JDAM program.

"5c0287fffab5cd5e356e2d072b87afc6","The Navy's Strategy is to remain the preeminent maritime power providing the U.S. a global expeditionary force committed to security and prosperity while defending the Nation's interests.  Within this vision Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) remains a Navy core competency in a dynamic and uncertain maritime environment.  U.S. adversaries continue to develop asymmetric capabilities and capacities to deter disrupt or delay the entry of U.S. and allied naval forces and pose a constant challenge as we implement the Maritime Strategy.  Evolving submarine technologies offer enhanced stealth speed endurance weapons and operational proficiency trends foretelling that the adversary submarine of the future will have a significantly larger sphere of influence while presenting less vulnerability to ASW forces.  The effective offensive engagement range of the adversary submarine of the future will continue to match or outrange individual U.S. and multinational platform sensors and weapons in many tactical environments.  Submarines are an increasing threat to all Naval and Allied ships particularly modern diesel subs and faster torpedoes.  Not only can the presence of potential hostile submarines delay naval combatant action until they are located and neutralized submarines can also disrupt all seaborne logistics supply for any ground campaign as well as maritime commerce.  ASW forces must be effective in all operating environments ranging from the deep open ocean to the littorals and are key to countering adversarial anti-access and area denial strategies.The AN/SQQ-89(V) Surface Ship ASW Combat System provides integrated Undersea Warfare (USW) combat management fire control command and control and on-board training to enable surface combatants to engage USW targets in both open ocean and littoral environments.  The AN/SQQ-89(V) is a system comprised of many subsystems which integrate the helo and its sensors the ship's own organic sensors weapons torpedo detection and a high fidelity Surface ASW Synthetic Trainer (SAST).  The AN/SQQ-89(V) was established as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) I acquisition program in 1983 and re-designated an ACAT IC program in 1990.  In 1998 the AN/SQQ-89(V) program was deemed to be 90% complete and removed from the Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) list.Variants of the AN/SQQ-89(V) are currently in operation on practically all in-service CG47 DDG51 and FFG7 Class Surface Combatants.  The AN/SQQ-89(V) is also programmed for all in-line new construction DDG51 Class ships under Shipbuilding and Conversion Navy (SCN) Budget Line Item (BLI) 2122 while a separate AN/SQQ-90 version is programmed for all in-line new construction DDG1000 Class ships under SCN BLI 2119.AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Surface Ship USW Combat System Upgrade - Detailed Description:A major upgrade to the AN/SQQ-89(V) legacy system the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade significantly decreases ship vulnerability to torpedo attack improves surface ship USW shallow water warfighting capability in the littoral and mitigates Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) obsolescence and supportability issues.  The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade was reported as a critical need for surface ASW operations by SECNAV.  A Fleet Forces Command (FFC) Urgent Operational Need (UON) report identified the Fleet need for AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrades.  The need for the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 is also articulated in the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) Integrated Priorities List (IPL); in an Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) funding priorities letter; in a 7th Fleet Bottom Up review report; and in the U.S. Fleet Forces ASW Integrated Priorities Capability List (IPCL).The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade is programmed for backfit on: Select CG47 Class Baseline 3 and 4 (CG59-73) ships (those not planned for early decommissioning) via OPN BLI 0960 (Cruiser Modernization) and OPN BLI 2136 (represented here); DDG51 Class Flight I/II (DDG51-78) ships via OPN BLI 0900 (DDG Modernization) and OPN BLI 2136 (represented here); and DDG51 Class Flight IIA (DDG79-118) ships via OPN BLI 2136 (represented here).The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade developed under RDT&EN PE 0205620N capitalizes on previously fielded AN/SQQ-89(V)15 systems. The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 is comprised of a tactical towed array sensor the Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA) and will replace standard militarized legacy components with Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware to provide an ASW combat system with the capability for mid-frequency bistatic and multi-static sonar operations.

LAV-C2 upgrade provided a hardware and software module for the LAV-C2 to support complex radio configurations. The upgrade sought to integrate in the vehicle those non-developmental hardware and software components that ensured that the vehicles and the appropriate LAR unit command element have the capability to send and receive required voice and data communications to higher adjacent and subordinate units. The module provided isolation of critical communications functions in a self-contained module to support a mix of legacy radios. The modification was needed to maintain the LAV-C2 as a viable weapon system through the service life of the LAV Family of Vehicles.The Survivability Upgrade Program consists of two projects to keep the LAV Family of Vehicles operational and effective through the year 2035. Project one is a system survivability upgrade and will replace the obsolete Power Pack that currently exists in the LAV fleet. The OEM has recommended a replacement power pack unit for the LAV that will need to be integrated and tested. Any future new production vehicles will be built with the new power pack and this program will replace the legacy fleet with the same power pack. Project two is a Crew Survivability Upgrade by adding the Advanced Suspension System. The Advanced Suspension System will allow for greater standoff distance between the floor of the LAV and an IED providing better crew protection and survivability. It will also improve the mobility and automotive performance over all terrains.The LAV-25 program is for the procurement of LAV's to replace projected reset as a result of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). Replacing these vehicles will ensure the USMC Light Armored Reconnaissance (LAR) battalions have adequate numbers of LAVs for continued combat operations.The LAV-AT System Program will modernize the legacy turret and TOW system in order to sustain the capability improve readiness ensure a high degree of commonality with USMC and U.S. Army systems and enable the LAR Battalion to employ the full range of current and emerging TOW munitions. The program will counter two converging obsolescence issues on the LAV-AT platform: (1) the M901 Emerson turret is no longer in production and has been retired from the US Army inventory and (2) the M2203A3 TOW system is being replaced by the M41 SABER system in the USMC infantry and tank battalions leaving the LAR Battalion as the only unit using the legacy TOW system.Projects funded under the LAV Modification Program include numerous low-dollar yet extremely important minor vehicle and weapon modifications such as focusing on safety and obsolescence issues support equipment and tools and other projects that increase LAV reliability and readiness while reducing operations and support costs.

Javelin has a high kill rate against a variety of targets at extended ranges under day/night battlefield obscurants adverse weather and multiple counter-measure conditions.  The system's soft launch feature permits firing from a fighting position or an enclosure.  Javelin uses a modular design to allow the system to evolve to meet changing threats and requirements via both software and hardware upgrades.  The system consists of a reusable Command Launch Unit (CLU) with a built-in-test (BIT) and a modular missile encased in a disposable launch tube assembly.  The system also includes training devices for tactical training and classroom training.  Javelin's fire-and-forget technology allows the gunner to fire and immediately take cover to move to another fighting position or to reload.   The Javelin provides enhanced lethality through the use of a tandem warhead which will defeat all known armor threats.  It is effective against both stationary and moving targets.  This system also provides defensive capability against attacking/hovering helicopters.  The performance improvements in current production Javelin Block I CLUs are: increased target identification range increased surveillance time with new battery and software management and external RS-170 interface for video output.  The performance improvements in current production Javelin Block I missiles are: increased probability of hit/kill at 2500m improved warhead lethality and reduced time of flight.

The core functions of DCGS-A are: the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED); operating in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and Joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information; distribution of relevant red (threat) gray (non-aligned) and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing warfighter's early warning and targeting capability. DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors and other information sources and impacts all warfighting functions. DCGS-A is a key component of the greater Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E). DCGS-A is fielded in fixed and mobile configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint. DCGS-A continues to support worldwide contingency operations (Afghanistan/Horn of Africa/Philippines) through ISR Modernization to address operational requirements and equipment fielding in accordance with (IAW) the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) model.The Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) designated the Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Intelligence Electronic Warfare and Sensors (IEW&S) as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead. PEO IEW&S is using DCGS-A to define the CPCE architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described within the Assistant Secretary of the Army (ASA) for Acquisition Logistics and Technology (ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This is in accordance with (IAW) the Army priority to align all Army networks procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.DCGS-A hardware and software is based on a combination of Government Off The Shelf (GOTS) Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) and Non-Developmental Items (NDI) that are integrated into scalable configurations tailored to Warfighting functions. These product line components include the software baseline server suite [Intelligence Fusion Server (IFS)] and individual analyst multi-function workstations such as Portable and Fixed-Multi-Function Workstations (P-MFWS) and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Workstation. These components are also used to upgrade existing fielded Intel Programs of Record to enable the establishment of the Army COE while simultaneously assuring system compatibility and interoperability within the DCGS enterprise.DCGS-A is a designated Major Automation Information System (MAIS) and is deployed on multiple hardware platforms and security levels across the Army.  DCGS-A achieved a successful Milestone C in 2Q12 and following the successful operational assessment and Full Deployment Decision (FDD) in 1Q13 DCGS-A Increment 1 Release 1 capabilities will be deployed across the Force in accordance with (IAW) ARFORGEN. New capabilities will be fielded incrementally through software releases integrated onto the fielded product line hardware configurations.  These range from portable laptops to large commodity server-based processing centers operating in a Cloud Architecture. DCGS-A deployed the first Tactical Cloud Computing Node in the DoD in 1Q11. Core Cloud nodes will be fielded strategically across the globe while tactical Cloud Edge Nodes such as the DCGS-A Intelligence Processing Center (IPC) (V)1 and (V)2 will form the basis for delivery of Cloud computing environment to the combat formation.  Within the Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) DCGS-A provides basic mobile ISR capability as well as software applications that can be embedded on future C3I and other systems. At the Corps Division and Echelons Above Corps (EAC) DCGS-software will be hosted on fixed mobile and portable configurations.

SOF units require tactical radio systems that improve their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility. This line item will procure lightweight efficient and interoperable SOF radios. Tactical radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed Command and Control (C2) communications between operational elements and higher echelon headquarters allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments. They also provide interoperability with all Services various agencies of the U.S. Government Air Traffic Control commercial agencies and allied coalition forces.","2014","United States Special Operations Command","TACTICAL RADIO SYSTEMS","Millions","0607TR","84","Millions","Each","1. SOF Tactical Communications (STC) will procure the next generation SOF communication system and replace most of the currently fielded SOF suite of radios. The capability will consist of five basic form factors: 1) Manpack device will be a multi-band device capable of being carried by an individual or being mounted on various SOF platforms; 2) Fixed configuration will be a multi-band and/or High-frequency (HF) device designed for implementation into air/ground/sea platforms or base stations; 3) HF device in a manpack configuration will be capable of being mounted on various SOF platforms; 4) Handheld device will include both an urban and maritime variant; 5) Individual device will be a small handheld device to provide intra-team communications capability of voice data and video. This system will introduce additional capabilities to SOF to improve current situational awareness capabilities and performance on SOF platforms. Capabilities will include: real time hostile and friendly force information; Line of Sight (LOS) and Beyond LOS communications; and access to situational awareness in the form of intelligence inputs broadcasts and networks. This system will be a key component of an integrated network providing information connectivity among SOF the Services other government agencies and potentially indigenous and surrogate forces.  Program increased by FY 201 congressional add.2.  Joint Base Station (JBS)/Radio Integration System (RIS) is an evolutionary acquisition program to procure the most current tactical C2 communications system for deployed and forward-based SOF and Theater Special Operations Commanders supporting OCO and other SOF activities. The procured solution consists of a full-scaled deployable transit case variant a deployable downsized transit case variant and a fixed base station variant. All variants are capable of integrating existing and future radios and are compliant with the Joint Tactical Radio System. JBS/RIS interfaces enhance and combine multiple single-channel radios into one integrated C2 suite. The variants will enable the SOF operational commander to exercise reliable effective and efficient C2 functions regardless of area of operation. Moreover the system provides the SOF Commander and staff with the capability to send and receive voice data and messages between the inserted SOF warfighter and higher headquarters liaison officers other government agencies and coalition partners.3.  Blue Force Tracking (BFT) is a family of devices used to remotely track and monitor friendly forces. The capability enhances C2 threat warning force protection situational awareness combat search and rescue counter-fratricide battlefield visualization and combat identification. This capability is unique to SOF because it requires the devices to be lightweight portable secure and a Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection. SOF systems include the miniature transmitter and the handheld device that provides automated transmission of position location information and brevity codes supporting both ground and air assets. This information is collected by national assets relayed to select command units and displayed on the receiving unit’s common operational picture.","1160476BB","Each","Procurement Defense-Wide","Other Procurement Programs","0300D","AB","2","4","2013-04","PB","Special Operations Command","1418710176","2014-12-16T06:09:36+00:00","2014","http://comptroller.defense.gov/budgetmaterials.aspx","dodbudget","record","public","procurement-base","PROCUREMENT_MasterJustificationBook_Defense-Wide_PB_2014.xml","2014","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",

"19f5b6ff292e74cbd16b4b5457e77fc7","The Air Force will execute the EELV program funding in accordance with the direction in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act 2013 to separate into two separate P-1 line items.  However this is not reflected in this budget document for FY13 - FY18.  During FY13 and FY14 Launch Services and Launch Capability will be executed separately; Launch Services will be executed from the P-1 line item submitted with the PB (MSEELV) while Launch Capability will be executed from a newly established P-1 line item.  Beginning with the FY15 PB submission Launch Services and Launch Capability will be submitted as separate P-1 line items.This program does not require and does not include advance procurement or initial spares. Flyaway Unit Cost is not applicable and Weapon System Unit Cost are not representative due to the mix (medium through heavy) of vehicles in the program. Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) procures launch services and is not a weapon system. The program provides launch capacity for the Government's National Launch Forecast (NLF) requirements but does not take ownership of any specific launch hardware. The requirements for EELV launch services are derived from multiple spacecraft requirements. "To Complete" projections include only known requirements at this time.The EELV program is a space launch system that provides satellite delivery to specific orbits currently using two families of launch vehicles Delta IV & Atlas V and intends to include New Entrants when certified.  The Air Force is actively engaged in evaluating the addition of other New Entrants.  In October 2011 the Air Force National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) agreed to a coordinated strategy for certification of New Entrants to reliably launch EELV-class payloads in support of National Security Space (NSS) requirements.  The Department designated 14 cores across Fiscal Year(FY)15-FY17 procurement years as open to competition based on the projected performance of the designs described by potential New Entrants in their Statements of Intent (SOI) as well as providing 36 cores to United Launch Alliance in FY13-17. These cores include cores for launch services being procured for the Navy and NRO as well as the Air Force. If competition is not viable at time of need missions will be awarded to the incumbent under a Variation In Quantity and Configuration (VIQ&C) contract clause.The EELV system includes launch vehicles launch capability a standard payload interface support systems mission integration (includes mission unique requirements) flight instrumentation and range interfaces special studies (alternative upper and lower stage rocket propulsion solution analysis mission feasibility analysis secondary payloads dual manifesting dual integration special flight instrumentation space launch flight termination system loads analysis early integration studies etc.) post-flight data evaluation and analysis mission assurance assured access (infrastructure critical component engineering etc.)Government Mission Directorsystem/process and reliability improvements training upper and lower engine sustainment activities and technical support. The system also includes launch site/operations activities activities in support of assured access systems integration and tests and other related support activities.  The Air Force is responsible for funding its own missions. All non-Air Force EELV launch services are funded within their respective entities (e.g. NRO Navy etc.). Funding for this exhibit is contained in Program Element (PE) 0305953F.  Related RDT&E AF funding is contained in PE 0604853F. The EELV Acquisition Strategy restructures the approach of the EELV Program to address many challenges the program has experienced throughout the EELV system lifecycle.  In cooperation with the NRO the Air Force committed to an annual production rate of launch vehicle booster cores establishing better predictability to maintain mission success stabilize the industrial base reduce costs and allow for competition. This strategy will continue to allow the Department of Defense to reliably place medium- intermediate- and heavy-class NSS space vehicles into earth orbit and directly addresses the FY13-FY19 (Phase 1) timeframe. Once a New Entrant demonstrates a successful launch of an EELV-class launch system the Air Force will award integration studies to the new entrant. Launch Services deemed as having higher risk tolerance by the Department may be awarded to service providers other than ULA as part of the certification process. The Air Force intends to compete all launch service procurements starting in FY18 if one or more new entrants are certified. The EELV Acquisition Strategy addressed inefficiencies associated with administration of two separate EELV contracts by combining the EELV Launch Services (ELS) and EELV Launch Capability (ELC) contracts into one consolidated contract starting in FY2013.  The launch services component of the new contract provides all of the necessary vehicle hardware related touch labor and software on a fixed price contract line item.  EELV launch services are usually ordered No-Later-Than 24 months prior to the planned mission launch.  EELV launch services may be ordered earlier than the standard 24 months to allow a longer integration period for first-time or complex integrations.  The contract takes advantage of setting a minimum quantity at a steady production rate.  The contract balances price operational requirements budget realities and potential for competition.  The launch capability component of the new contract is funded annually and includes facility and facility support costs launch and range operations mission integration mission unique development and integration subcontract support engineering factory engineering etc.  Phase 1 of the EELV acquisition strategy includes launch services through FY17 and launch capability funding through FY19 required to fly-out all Phase 1 launches as well as on-ramps for New Entrants.  Non-recurring integration is the responsibility of the particular Air Force or other agency payload program office.On 26 March 2012 the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Technology and Logistics [USD(AT&L)] redesignated the EELV Program as a Major Defense Acquisition Program not in the sustainment phase.  In addition the EELV program was designated as an Acquisition Category ID (ACAT ID) program.

"f0dadd03774676f82e2a118b41575b19","Consolidated Afloat Networks & Enterprise Services (CANES) is the Navy's only Program of Record to replace existing afloat networks and provide the necessary infrastructure for applications systems and services to dominate the cyber warfare domain. CANES is the technical and infrastructure consolidation of existing separately managed afloat networks currently under PE 0204163N (LI 3050) Ship Communications Automation including Integrated Shipboard Network Systems (ISNS) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System - Maritime Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Networks and Submarine Local Area Network. These legacy afloat network designs are currently End of Life and CANES will replace these existing unaffordable and obsolete networks.The fundamental goal of CANES is to bring Infrastructure and Platform as a Service (IaaS / PaaS) within which current and future iterations of Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination computing and storage capabilities will reside. CANES will provide complete infrastructure inclusive of hardware software processing storage and end user devices for Unclassified Coalition Secret and SCI for all basic network services (email web chat collaboration) to a wide variety of Navy surface combatants submarines Maritime Operations Centers Regional Network Operations and Security Centers (RNOSCs) and Aircraft. In addition ~36 hosted applications and systems inclusive of Command and Control Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Information Operations Logistics and Business domains require the CANES infrastructure to operate in the tactical environment. Integrating these applications and systems is accomplished through Application Integration the engineering process used to evaluate and validate compatibility between the CANES IaaS / PaaS and the Navy-validated applications systems and services that will utilize the CANES infrastructure and services. Specific programs such as Distributed Common Ground System - Navy Global Command and Control System - Maritime Naval Tactical Command Support System and Undersea Warfare Decision Support System are dependent on the CANES Common Computing Environment to field host and sustain their capability because they no longer provide their own hardware. To reduce risks associated with End of Life Legacy Systems awaiting CANES replacement in the out-years LI 2915 will support required emergent modernization to replace end of life components protect against new Information Assurance vulnerabilities and to remain compliant with DoD mandates.  CANES requires that Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) field prior to or concurrently with CANES due to architectural reliance between the two programs.CANES will develop updates on a rolling four year hardware baseline and a two year software baseline. Fielding of rolling baselines will occur every eight years for hardware and four years for software. CANES is based on the overarching concept of reducing the number of afloat networks and providing enhanced efficiency through a single engineering focus on integrated technical solutions. This will allow for streamlined acquisition contracting and test events and significant lifecycle efficiencies through consolidation of multiple current configuration management baselines logistics and training efforts into a unified support structure.Automated Digital Network System (ADNS): ADNS provides routing switching baseband configuration and monitoring capabilities for interconnecting naval and coalition enclaves worldwide. ADNS utilizes Commercial Off-the-Shelf/ Government Off-the-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) equipment and network protocols as specified by the joint technical architecture.  ADNS Increment I provides initial limited ship to shore IP connectivity separation of enclaves reuse of unused enclave bandwidth and ship to tactical shore IP connectivity.  ADNS Increment II provides additional capabilities of load balancing Radio Frequency (RF) restoral initial Quality of Service (QoS) to include application prioritization initial traffic management and enhancements designed to maximize use of "effective" available bandwidth for surface shore and airborne platforms.  ADNS Increment III will converge all Navy tactical voice video and data requirements into a converged IP data stream.  This includes SCIP-IWF for secure telephony over IP as well as Video Information Exchange System for secure video over IP. In addition the Increment III architecture will incorporate an IPv4/IPv6 dual stack and a cipher text security architecture to align to the Global Information Grid (GIG) in order to mesh Navy tactical surface subsurface and airborne platforms into a single IP environment with gateway functions to joint and coalition networks.

"e66af9d77e112e3b74bedaae99a4acf3","GLOBAL COMBAT SUPPORT SYSTEM - MARINE CORPS (GCSS-MC) Global Combat Support System-Marine Corps (GCSS-MC) is the physical implementation of the enterprise Information Technology (IT) architecture designed to support both improved and enhanced Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Combat Support Services (CSS) functions and MAGTF Commander and Combatant Commanders/Joint Task Force (CC/JTF) combat support information requirements.  The initial program includes all transactional CSS systems related to Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) functionality enabled with Service Management functions.  When combined these capabilities are referred to as Logistics Chain Management (LCM) or GCSS-MC/LCM.  The primary goal of GCSS-MC/LCM is to provide the capabilities specified in the Logistics Operational Architecture (Log OA).  The result of enabling the Log OA is the retirement of legacy applications.The GCSS-MC/LCM exposes timely mission information to Marine Corps operational and CSS commanders CC/JTF commanders and their staffs and other authorized users.  It exposes information interoperability common logistics information applications and services across functional areas.  GCSS-MC/LCM allows operating forces commanders to base decisions on complete logistics information and make decisions in concert with specific operational tasks.  The GCSS-MC/LCM program is procuring capabilities by increments.  GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 is a subset of the total requirement that focuses on Logistics Management and Execution with Logistics Command and Control requirements necessary to perform those functions in a deployed environment.  GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 is global in scope and it can be deployed under any circumstances during peace or war independent of geographical location.  The GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 Capability Development Document (CDD) dated 25 May 2005 and approved in December 2005 establishes the requirements for the entire GCSS-MC portfolio.Key objectives of the CDD include the following:  (1) Deliver integrated functionality across supply maintenance transportation finance engineering health acquisition and manpower systems in accordance with Marine Corps Logistics Operational Architecture; (2) Provide timely information to Marine Corps operational and CSS commanders CCs Joint JTF commanders and their staffs and other authorized users; (3) Allow Operating Forces (OPFORS) commanders to base decisions on complete logistics information and make decisions in concert with specific operational tasks; and (4) Provide users and operators of logistics processes access to information and applications across the spectrum of conflict regardless of location.The GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 program received Milestone A approval on 23 July 2004 from the Milestone Decision Authority Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Networks and Information Integration).  The GCSS-MC program was formally designated an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IAM program in March 2004.  The current Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) is the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Technology and Logistics (USD AT&L).  GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 successfully completed a Milestone B Review on 8 June 2007.  In September 2008 the program identified the likelihood of a critical change in the Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS) MAIS Quarterly Report (MQR) as a result of the program breaching in the areas of cost schedule and time to achieve Initial Operating Capability (IOC) within five years of MS A.  A Critical Change Team (CCT) was formed to conduct an evaluation of the program.  Based on CCT recommendations in December 2008 GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 updated the lifecycle cost estimate and the schedule to reflect the revised acquisition program baseline.  GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 successfully completed a Milestone C Review on 28 May 2010 and achieved IOC on 3 June 2010.  Increment 1 completes Total Force Implementation to Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) and garrison units in Dec 2012.  In December 2012 GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 reported a critical change based on schedule as defined by 10 U.S.C. Chapter 144A.  The Full Deployment Decision event has slipped more than a year past the Program Manager's estimate based on the 31 December 2011 MAR (Dec 2012).  The Increment 1 program schedule critical change was caused by significant technical challenges surrounding Release 1.2 Deployed capability requirements.  While the Release 1.2 hardware/software baseline continued to mature throughout FY12 additional Development and Operational Test (D&OT) events required to validate the automated Task Organization and Data Synchronization functionalities of the deployed capability were not successful.  The critical change team kickoff meeting occurred on 29 Jan 2013 and the evaluation is ongoing.SHARED DATA ENVIRONMENT (SDE) is a component of the GCSS-MC.  It supports data warehousing technologies and products to provide one-stop shopping for data supporting Combat Service Support Element SDE  (CSSE/SDE) decision-making processes.  It stages CSSE/SDE data and integrate Decision Support Tools to enable Command and Control situational awareness and total asset visibility at all levels of command from the Combatant Commander to the Company Commander.  The establishment of the CSSE/SDE eliminates the need for individual applications to perform these tasks for themselves and contributes to a more cost-effective efficient application development environment.

"e66af9d77e112e3b74bedaae99a4acf3","GLOBAL COMBAT SUPPORT SYSTEM - MARINE CORPS (GCSS-MC) Global Combat Support System-Marine Corps (GCSS-MC) is the physical implementation of the enterprise Information Technology (IT) architecture designed to support both improved and enhanced Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Combat Support Services (CSS) functions and MAGTF Commander and Combatant Commanders/Joint Task Force (CC/JTF) combat support information requirements.  The initial program includes all transactional CSS systems related to Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) functionality enabled with Service Management functions.  When combined these capabilities are referred to as Logistics Chain Management (LCM) or GCSS-MC/LCM.  The primary goal of GCSS-MC/LCM is to provide the capabilities specified in the Logistics Operational Architecture (Log OA).  The result of enabling the Log OA is the retirement of legacy applications.The GCSS-MC/LCM exposes timely mission information to Marine Corps operational and CSS commanders CC/JTF commanders and their staffs and other authorized users.  It exposes information interoperability common logistics information applications and services across functional areas.  GCSS-MC/LCM allows operating forces commanders to base decisions on complete logistics information and make decisions in concert with specific operational tasks.  The GCSS-MC/LCM program is procuring capabilities by increments.  GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 is a subset of the total requirement that focuses on Logistics Management and Execution with Logistics Command and Control requirements necessary to perform those functions in a deployed environment.  GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 is global in scope and it can be deployed under any circumstances during peace or war independent of geographical location.  The GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 Capability Development Document (CDD) dated 25 May 2005 and approved in December 2005 establishes the requirements for the entire GCSS-MC portfolio.Key objectives of the CDD include the following:  (1) Deliver integrated functionality across supply maintenance transportation finance engineering health acquisition and manpower systems in accordance with Marine Corps Logistics Operational Architecture; (2) Provide timely information to Marine Corps operational and CSS commanders CCs Joint JTF commanders and their staffs and other authorized users; (3) Allow Operating Forces (OPFORS) commanders to base decisions on complete logistics information and make decisions in concert with specific operational tasks; and (4) Provide users and operators of logistics processes access to information and applications across the spectrum of conflict regardless of location.The GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 program received Milestone A approval on 23 July 2004 from the Milestone Decision Authority Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Networks and Information Integration).  The GCSS-MC program was formally designated an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IAM program in March 2004.  The current Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) is the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Technology and Logistics (USD AT&L).  GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 successfully completed a Milestone B Review on 8 June 2007.  In September 2008 the program identified the likelihood of a critical change in the Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS) MAIS Quarterly Report (MQR) as a result of the program breaching in the areas of cost schedule and time to achieve Initial Operating Capability (IOC) within five years of MS A.  A Critical Change Team (CCT) was formed to conduct an evaluation of the program.  Based on CCT recommendations in December 2008 GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 updated the lifecycle cost estimate and the schedule to reflect the revised acquisition program baseline.  GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 successfully completed a Milestone C Review on 28 May 2010 and achieved IOC on 3 June 2010.  Increment 1 completes Total Force Implementation to Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) and garrison units in Dec 2012.  In December 2012 GCSS-MC/LCM Increment 1 reported a critical change based on schedule as defined by 10 U.S.C. Chapter 144A.  The Full Deployment Decision event has slipped more than a year past the Program Manager's estimate based on the 31 December 2011 MAR (Dec 2012).  The Increment 1 program schedule critical change was caused by significant technical challenges surrounding Release 1.2 Deployed capability requirements.  While the Release 1.2 hardware/software baseline continued to mature throughout FY12 additional Development and Operational Test (D&OT) events required to validate the automated Task Organization and Data Synchronization functionalities of the deployed capability were not successful.  The critical change team kickoff meeting occurred on 29 Jan 2013 and the evaluation is ongoing.SHARED DATA ENVIRONMENT (SDE) is a component of the GCSS-MC.  It supports data warehousing technologies and products to provide one-stop shopping for data supporting Combat Service Support Element SDE  (CSSE/SDE) decision-making processes.  It stages CSSE/SDE data and integrate Decision Support Tools to enable Command and Control situational awareness and total asset visibility at all levels of command from the Combatant Commander to the Company Commander.  The establishment of the CSSE/SDE eliminates the need for individual applications to perform these tasks for themselves and contributes to a more cost-effective efficient application development environment.  Supports hardware infrastructure to refresh hardware purchased in FY09 in support of deployed MAGTF users of GCSS-MC capabilities.THEATER MEDICAL INFORMATION PROGRAM (TMIP) - USMC is responsible for deploying medical information systems to support the Health Services Commands.

"71f466c8782e60b202ae9b74fa05bfa1","Joint Cooperative Target Identification-Ground (JCTI-G) The Joint Cooperative Target ID - Ground (JCTI-G) program will address four of the 26 capability gaps identified in the validated Combat ID - Friendly Force Tracker (CID-FFT) Joint Capabilities Document (JCD).  A Jun 2010 JFCOM-led AoA concluded and the USMC concurred that pursuit of a new material solution and introduction of a new system would not be cost effective.  This conclusion was based upon both cost and ability to address the four defined capability gaps in Combat Identification specific to reducing fratricide of U.S. and coalition forces.  The AoA evaluated the currently Fielded and Planned Capability Improvements (FPCI) resident within funded projects and existing programs of records across all Services and determined that the most affordable alternative would leverage the FPCI programs by allocating the CID-FFT requirements and funding capability improvements within these existing programs. The AoA further concluded that in addition to significant cost avoidance leveraging the FPCI to meet the CID-FFT requirements as opposed to establishing a new program of record material solution would have greater impact and achieve a higher percentage of CID-FFT JCD capability gap closure by 2016.  In support of a Jan 2010 Memorandum of Understanding between the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps (which documents the Army and Marine Corps agreement to support closure of the Fires on Dismounts fratricide mitigation gap) the USMC refocused the program in June 2011 to begin allocation of CID-FFT JCD requirements to the USMC FPCI programs to meet this valid JCIDS requirement.  Having no previous CID-FFT requirement these FPCI programs have neither planned for nor been resourced to support the additional requirements of the CID-FFT JCD.  As a result of these recent events this effort will ensure requirements allocation traceability and validation within 24 USMC FPCI programs in accordance with the CID-FFT JCD and JCIDS processes and provide resource funding and augment workforce to support the additional unanticipated requirements being levied on FPCI programs.  Additionally it will support aggregation of a time-phased schedule of USMC CID-FFT capabilities and future interoperability engineering/testing between FPCI systems and related modernization efforts necessary to minimize costs and measure attainment of CID-FFT JCD capability gap closure by 2016. The AoA recommendation accepted by the Services and OSD is to maintain and enhance the full range of FPCI programs to meet the requirements and mitigate CID-FFT capability gaps identified in the CID-FFT JCD.  This is consistent with the anticipated direction contained in a pending ADM.  The intent is to reduce fratricide uphold the DOD and USMC position on JCTI-G remain consistent with the AoA recommendations comply with the purpose of JCTI-G appropriations and support capability gap closure in accordance with the AoA and OSD led OIPT findings.Composite Tracking Network (CTN) - Composite Tracking Network (CTN) - The Composite Tracking Network (CTN) system will distribute composite tracking data to C2 and weapon systems participating in a CEC network.  The system will significantly contribute to real-time situational awareness.  The program recieved ACAT III designation in Nov 01. The program is USMC led with US Navy and US Army cooperation. The CTN program is executing a single-step to full capability acquisition strategy by integrating Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Non-Development Item (NDI) subsystems. AAO: 25 systems.

"4c25e43851f67c0f95c756767b6d7c0b","FAMILY OF POWER EQUIPMENT - This family is comprised for five major elements (sub-families) that provide power generation power distribution and tactical external lighting to all user communities across the active Marine Corps and Reserves.  These are centrally managed items.The first element is the sub-family of Department of Defense Standard Tactical Generators USMC (and all services) procures from the DOD Project Manager for Mobile Electric Power (PM MEP).  USMC procures and manages 15 standard generator models in the power output range of 2 kilowatts (kW) to 100 kW in both 60HZ (ground equipment) and 400HZ (aviation equipment) configurations.  Included in this for medium size models (5 kW to 60 kW) is the new Advanced Medium Mobile Power Sources (AMMPS) that USMC first began procuring in 2013 and will continue procuring for at least ten years. The AMMPS will provide improved fuel economy improved maintainability and reduced weight.The second element is the sub-family for non-Standard Tactical Generators.  These address USMC unique requirements that the DOD PM MEP does not support. This includes the USMC unique Integrated Trailer - Environmental Control Unit - Generator (ITEG) capability that is towable by all vehicle platforms. The ITEG integrates both power generation equipment and environmental control equipment onto a single trailer chassis for highly mobile units units that have tailored power and cooling requirements units that predominantly have HMMWVs for transportation resources or units operating forward that may not have Material Handling Equipment to support larger generators and environmental control units.The third element is the sub-family for Mobile Electric Power Distribution Systems - Replacement (MEPDIS-R) which provides a modernized standard suite of electric power distribution panels and cabling assemblies to meet Marine Corps power requirements to support a variety of command and control systems and expeditionary forces. MEPDIS-R as a highly tailorable system consists of 20 separate components that are configured into capability sets by all using units.The fourth element is the Floodlight Set (FLS) a self contained external lighting system with a power plant and light tower assembly.  The FLS is capable of providing up to five acres of area illumination and is used extensively for security purposes. For flexibility the set is configured so it can be mounted on all trailer systems or ground mounted and plugged into grid power.The fifth element is the sub-family of support equipment to support elements of the Power Equipment Family.  This includes unique trailer mounting kits for all systems onto USMC standard trailers software planning tools for emplacement of power and power distribution unique training aids and general purpose electrician toolkits.FAMILY OF ALTERNATIVE POWER SOURCES FOR COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT (APSCE) - This family consists of multiple suites of devices grouped into sub-families that are used to provide highly expeditionary power (worn on the Marine hand-carried or vehicle mounted) to operate communications equipment computers and peripheral equipment in place of disposable batteries and for scenarios where fuel powered generators are too large too heavy unsuitable for use or provide undue logistics burden due to refueling needs.The first suite of devices encompasses renewable energy based systems and includes the man-portable Ground Renewable Expeditionary Energy Network System (GREENS) that supports a company level operations center and Forward Operating Base and the man-portable Solar Portable Alternative Communications Energy Systems (SPACES) that supports Combat Outposts and Observation Points.  Both of these exploit the use of solar energy technology to recharge batteries and directly power electronic equipment without the need for re-fueling generators.The second suite of devices is the Family of USMC Tactical Power Supplies.  This includes both shelter based (semi-rugged) and fully ruggedized power supplies (operate outdoors) that convert grid power (alternating current) to vehicle based power (direct current).  These power supplies support all elements across the USMC with standard models that provide variable electrical output to support a wide electrical range of operation.  The suite also includes vehicle mounted inverters that convert vehicle 24 Volt direct current to 120 Volt alternating current to allow on-the-move operation of equipment that previously was only able to be used while stationary.The third suite of devices is On-Board Vehicle Power (OBVP) systems that modify and implement power generation onboard multiple vehicles (High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle and Medium Tactical Vehicle).  The HMMWV based system provides engine drive electric AC power comparable to what a HMMWV towable trailer mounted generator could provide (25 kilowatts).  This saves embark space and weight for highly expeditionary applications.  The MTV based system provides engine drive electric AC power comparable to what a generator mounted to the bed of the truck could provide (100 kilowatts).  This frees up cargo space while saving space and weight also for highly expeditionary applications.The fourth suite of devices is the Family of Radio Power Adaptors (RPA) which provide an alternative power source for each radio in the Marine Corps (seven different models).  Instead of consuming batteries when in garrison/shelter operations RPAs allow the radios to be operated from central power sources (such as GREENS and SPACES) or grid power (120 volt AC generator).  This provides cost avoidance conservation of batteries and flexibility of operations.The fifth suite is the Battery Management and Sustainment Systems (BMASS) that support all lead-acid batteries used in vehicles and artillery systems and lithium ion rechargeable batteries used in command control and communications systems.  The suite consists of battery chargers battery analyzers and battery safety management systems for both chemistry of batteries and for both garrison (semi-rugged) and deployed operations (ruggedized).  As the USMC (and all services) move towards fully adopting rechargeable batteries for energy efficiency and logistics demand reduction BMASS is critical to support numerous weapons engineer vehicle and communication systems that are highly dependent on batteries for their operation.","2014","Navy","Power Equipment Assorted","","6366","","","Each","","","Each","","Engineer And Other Equipment","","","","","2013-04","PB","Engineer and Other Equipment","","","","","","","","","","","A","Navy Active","76.5","134.494","","41.689","44.645","47.784","56.96","45.343","56.96","","","","","","","","Yearly","","",

Current training takes place on operational cargo missions which requires TDY funding and results in marginal training opportunities due to the inability to predict types and availability of cargo loads.  The CLT will shorten a cargo loader?s qualification timeline by several months.  The CLT will be used for initial and continuation training events annual checkrides and egress (slide and door) training.  In addition the KC-10 maintenance community requires a stand-alone Maintenance Training Systems (MTS) to train and certify aircraft maintainers while minimizing operational aircraft downtime caused by on-board training.   The MTS will include an Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI) and a variety of hardware maintenance training devices.  The MTS stand-alone hardware devices allow for hands-on training on aircraft systems (ie engines breaks electrical wiring and landing gear) without taking operational aircraft away from the warfighter.  The IMI system is an interactive training program that familiarizes KC-135 maintainers with aircraft systems and greatly reduces the amount of time required for hands-on training.

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AND LANDING SYSTEMS (ATCALS):  ATCALS is a combination of United States Air Force (USAF) ground facilities and equipment both fixed and tactical with associated avionics personnel and procedures that provide air traffic control worldwide to USAF/Department of Defense flying missions.  The ATCALS line includes basic air navigation equipment that provides enroute and terminal navigation control and separation approach departure and landing guidance.  ATCALS provides equipment required to ensure interoperability with systems operated by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization the US National Airspace System and the International Civil Aviation Organization.  Activities also include acquisition planning and document preparation to support both current program execution definition of future program implementation strategies and low cost modifications.  Funding for this exhibit is contained in Program Element (PE) 0305114F.  The modification roll-up is shown on the P-5.       2.  WEATHER OBSERVATION AND FORECAST SYSTEM:  This system consists of meteorological and space sensing equipment providing environmental situational awareness to support the worldwide missions of the USAF Army Special Operations Forces (SOF) combatant commands and other government agencies.  Fixed and transportable equipment provides warfighters at in-garrison contingency and deployed locations with accurate relevant and timely terrestrial and space weather observations and forecasts.  This effort is funded in PE 0305111F Weather Service.  3.  SHARED EARLY WARNING SYSTEM (SEWS):  Funds procure equipment upgrades for the SEW-specific equipment at Theater Combatant Commander locations and the Centralized Distribution Facility (CDF) at Peterson AFB CO where data is initially received and filtered and at the inject points where data is transmitted to SEWS customers and other foreign partner nations.  Upgrades are prioritized based on the adjudicated OSD/Joint Staff-coordinated Integrated Priority List (IPL) for SEWS.  This effort is funded in PE 0308699F Shared Early Warning System.4.  BALLISTIC MISSILE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM (BMEWS): BMEWS is a ground-based radar system whose primary mission missile warning (MW) provides United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) with credible Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) data on all Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) penetrating the coverage area. This data includes an estimation of launch and predicted impact (L&PI) locations and times. BMEWS also provides USSTRATCOM and other users with ITW/AA data on Sea-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) penetrating the coverage area.  The upgraded BMEWS co-primary mission is Missile Defense (MD) supporting the Missile Defense Agency.  The tertiary mission of BMEWS supports the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) mission by providing near-earth satellite surveillance tracking and identification as required by the Joint Space Operations Center Alternate Space Operations Center and the National Air and Space Intelligence Center. The BMEWS consists of three sites: Thule Air Base (AB) Greenland; Clear Air Force Station (AFS) AK; and Royal Air Force (RAF) Fylingdales UK. Each site provides unique coverage to a different geographic area. This effort is funded in PE 0305909F.UPGRADED EARLY WARNING RADAR (UEWR) MODIFICATIONS:  At RAF Fylingdales United KingdomThule AB Greenland and Beale Air Force Base CA radars have completed Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR) modifications changing the AN/FPS-123 radar to an AN/FPS-132 configuration. This modification adds a new co-primary mission Missile Defense (MD). The MD mission is to detect track and count the individual objects in a ballistic missile attack early in their trajectory. This data is used by the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Fire Control Communications (GFC/C) Component for interceptor commitment and for directing ground-based radar operational responses. The GFC component uses the information to support intercepts from initial commit through final data uplinks to the defensive action vehicles.  Modifications for the Clear AB Alaska and Cape Cod radars from the AN/FPS-123 to an AN/FPS-132 configuration are currently scheduled to occur in FY15/16 timeframe.BMEWS EVOLUTIONARY MODIFICATION PROGRAM consists of modifications that replace obsolete or unsupportable system components and subsystems and address evolving missile and space and threats. The BMEWS mission equipment and associated sustainment suites consist of a mix of unique custom-built components that are increasingly more difficult to maintain due to availability of replacement parts and obsolete COTS based subsystems that are no longer supported by the original equipment manufacturers. In addition Sub-Array Power Supplies (SAPS) Solid State Modules (SSMs)  Beam Steering Unit (BSU) and other radar front-end equipment  are 30+ years old highly inefficient and require replacement. Without these modifications there is a high risk that equipment failures will cause unacceptable mission downtime in order to troubleshoot and repair.  FY14 will fund replacement of unsupportable EWR and UEWR mission and sustainment equipment to include but not limited to SAPS upgraded SSMs maintenance tool sets Frequency Time Standard (FTS) Radar Controller (RCL) and analysis & display hardware. 5.  AN/FPS-117 ESSENTIAL PARTS REPLACEMENT PROGRAM:  The AN/FPS-117 radar supports the NORAD USNORTHCOM and PACOM missions. The radars are part of the Atmospheric Early Warning System (AEWS) providing radar data to both USAF and Federal Aviation Administration control systems in Alaska. The radars also provide air surveillance capability as part of a bi-national defense program with Canada. This effort is funded in PE 0102325F. FY13 funds provide for hardware installations Program Management Administration (PMA) and Direct Mission SupportThe USAF FPS-117s (versions 1 & 4) are no longer in production; however the latest FPS-117 (version 7 aka Block 3) is in production. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) has continued to advance this radar system's technology and perform service life upgrades for other developing nations however sixty-five percent of line replaceable units (LRUs) installed in the North American system are no longer manufactured by the OEM and many subcomponents are obsolete rendering the AEWS unsupportable. These solutions improve supportability and reduce sustainment costs by drastically reducing the LRU count. There is low technical risk and minimal developmental activity required to procure this replacement hardware and software for installation. Air surveillance is NORAD's number #1 issue as stated by the NORAD Commander to Congress in March 2008. Without the immediate replacement of this equipment NORAD will lose air surveillance capability by 2013 due to failing radars. This Essential Parts Replacement Program is needed to restore the radar system capability before projected catastrophic failures by 2013 compromising persistent surveillance of the homeland. The AN/FPS-117 Essential Parts Replacement Program restores the radar system capability to its original availability rates by eliminating parts obsolescence and replacing high failure rate components. The goal is to ensure the FPS-117 radar can support the war fighters' air surveillance mission beyond 2025.","2014","Air Force","Comm Elect Mods","","838010","","","Each","","","Each","","Modifications","","","","","2013-04","PB","Electronics and Telecommunications Equip","","","","","","","","","","","A","Air Force Active","50.076","66.41","","22.547","22.148","22.953","52.699","75.063","52.699","","","","","","","","","","",

Its primary operations consist of acquiring targets manually using radar search or Electro Optic/Infrared capability or automatically from external or internal designations generation of fire-control quality track data for engage ability determination launcher control and missile initialization messages.  Queuing of other weapons such as the Rolling Airframe Missile System via the Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) or AN/SWY 3/5 Combat System RIM-7H/M/P SeaSparrow Missile and RIM-162D Evolved SeaSparrow Missile (ESSM) firing Target Illumination for Missile Guidance and Visual Kill/Survive and Battle Damage Assessments provides manual or fully automatic operation with provisions for Operator Intervention or Override from the time of Target Designation to Missile Away.  The NSSMS consists of Fire Control and Launcher Systems comprised of 2-4 Directors a distributed computing network Transmitter Group 3-5 Operating Consoles and 1-2 Eight-Cell Launchers which employ the surface launch variant of the Sparrow Missile.  The RIM-7 and RIM-162 Missiles use semi-active guidance with target illumination provided by the shipboard Mk 9/95 fire control systems. NSSMS MK 57 Mods 12 and higher (ESSM capable) are integrated with the SSDS and become part of the SSDS MK 2 Combat System on CVN 68 LHA 6 and LHD 7-8 class ships. Starting with the Ford Class (CVN 78) the Guided Missile Launching System (GMLS) is segmented from the MK 57 and interfaces directly to the SSDS Combat System.The NSSMS is a NATO Cooperative Project with 12 participating Governments; Australia Belgium Canada Denmark Germany Greece Norway The Netherlands Portugal Spain Turkey and the United States.

Each TacMobile unit is a system-of-systems which includes a C2I (command control and intelligence) component and communications networks computers mobility and facilities components.  The command and control services are currently provided by Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M) and include core GCCS-M capabilities analysis correlation and fusion of diverse sensor information; data management support command decision aids; access to rapid data communication mission planning and evaluation; dissemination of ocean surveillance positional data and threat alerts to operational users ashore and afloat.  The communications and mobility component provides communications interconnectivity between various joint and naval commands as well as the equipment necessary to make the systems mobile and self-sustaining in operational environments.  The networks and computers component provides the computing infrastructure net-centricity and data processing environment for the operational units.The Tactical/Mobile System includes the fixed site Tactical Operations Centers (TOC) and the Mobile Tactical Operations Centers (MTOC) which is a mobile version of the TOC for contingency operations and the scalable and highly portable Joint Mobile Ashore Support Terminal (JMAST).  TacMobile systems TOC and MTOC are undergoing a transformation from forward deployed fixed sites to a more mobile expeditionary force to better support the Navy's surge requirements.10 TOCs:  7 operational systems (located at Jacksonville Florida Sigonella Italy Kaneohe Bay Hawaii Whidbey Island Washington Kadena Japan Misawa Japan and Bahrain) 1 training site(relocated from Center for Surface Combat Systems Unit (CSCSU) Dam Neck Virginia to Center for Naval Air Technical Training (CNATT) Jacksonville Florida) 2 laboratory sites (a communications integration lab located at Space & Naval Warfare Systems Command Systems Center (SSC) Atlantic and an aircraft integration lab at SSC Atlantic detachment Patuxent River Maryland).

"26113c1e5769ce5d6afea5baa2444021","Physical Security Systems provide systematic uniform technological solutions to manpower intensive security requirements.  Systems are used at bases and stations and expeditionary environments protecting our most important assets vital to operations - people flight lines classified information arms ammunition and explosives (AA&E) shore lines critical assets and infrastructure and providing constant vigilant capabilities that control and restrict access. Mass Notification System (MNS) provides immediate notice and warning to people living and working aboard our bases and stations in the event of security breaches via interior and exterior speaker systems telephones and computers in the event of natural disasters terrorist situations weather emergencies or other events requiring immediate guidance to ensure the safety and security of personnel. Physical Security supports capital plant equipment specifically designed for physical security/electronic security systems (ESS) in military construction (MILCON) projects.  Funding procures investment items devices and systems necessary for the United States Marine Corps installation and facility structure to comply with Congressional White House Military Office Department of Defense Department of Navy and Marine Corps Physical Security and antiterrorism directives pertaining to security equipment and ESS as technological solutions to manpower intensive security requirements and to provide a systematic uniform capability throughout Marine Corps installations to deter delay and defeat espionage sabotage damage theft and terrorist attacks against Marine Corps personnel resources installations and facilities.   These systems upgrade and replace antiquated systems that are costly to maintain and upgrade.  The Marine Corps Electronic Security System (MCESS) Program provides a comprehensive electronic security system suite that supports collateral equipment that includes intrusion detection surveillance perimeter and facility automated access control and tracking capabilities.  These systems increase efficiency/effectiveness of available security manpower and improve security and safety at installation perimeter flight line restricted area and facility entry points.  The systems further reduce vulnerabilities and maintain mission readiness and enhance aviation mission capabilities in support of flight line security.  Support to the war fighter with technology and equipment increases assessment capability outside the established perimeter at Forward Operating Bases/enduring bases.  Ground based radars support Expeditionary Missions (improved assessment at long distances) allowing for greater defensive posture and response capabilities.  Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (G-BOSS) The Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (G-BOSS) is an incremental development program currently providing persistent multispectral surveillance sensor packages in Afghanistan. Three variants of G-BOSS exist; 80' tower mounted system (heavy) 20' trailer mounted system (medium/GBL) and man-portable tripod mounted system (lite/CBL).   Each tower employs multiple self-contained detection and assessment technologies on a single trailer-mounted elevation platform with a multi-spectral sensor suite consisting of: daylight color & infrared imagery (StarSafire III and T-3000) Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS) Manportable Surveillance and Target Acquisition Radar (MSTAR) Communication suite for wireless point to point link and unmanned aerial vehicle interface (VideoScout). The medium and lite systems provide a subset of the G-BOSS heavy capabilities.  G-BOSS is a material solution in response to an Urgent Universal Needs Statement in support of OIF and OEF.  In FY12 - 13 the program will transition to the G-BOSS enduring requirement and be intergrated as a core capability for the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF).  In FY13 G-BOSS 3.1 will update the existing G-BOSS systems with a common operating system and equipment interface to increase operational availability while reducing sustainment cost. Identity Dominance System-MC (IDS-MC) is a multi-modal (fingerprint iris and face) biometric collection system that provides the USMC a reliable and effective capability to collect share match access verify and store identity information. IDS-MC will enable the Marine to collect appropriate biometric biographical and reference information on an individual and match this locally developed information with pre-existing information available to the expeditionary force. The system will display match results with linkage to the respective individual's biographical and reference information as well as help analyze the response update records as appropriate create reports and disseminate updated information in accordance with current MAGTF policy. The primary mission of IDS-MC is to provide the MAGTF with the means to identify persons encountered in the battlespace. While IDS-MC is not an intelligence analysis system it does provide identification information in support of military intelligence and law enforcement operations by providing positive identification of persons of interest. IDS-MC is an enabler in the areas of detainee management and questioning base access counterintelligence screening border control law enforcement displaced persons' management and aiding in humanitarian assistance missions. IDS-MC supports the tactical application of identity dominance and fully supports a forward presence crisis response and contingency response capability. IDS will subsume the Biometrics Automated Toolset (BAT).  The total AAO of 821 fielded systems to training facilities and eleven battalion-sized elements.

"3036530d5e1cbcf2cde980d5493a6c4c","The Network and Mission Plan budget line includes the Aviation Mission Planning System (AMPS) the Improved Data Modem (IDM) the Aviation Data Exploitation Capability (ADEC) the Aircraft Notebook (ACN) the Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) System previously referred to as the Helicopter Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (HTAWS) and the Aviation Logistics Enterprise-Platform (ALE-P). The AMPS is a mission planning/battle synchronization tool that automates aviation mission planning tasks including tactical command and control mission planning and flight planning.  It interfaces with Army Mission Command Systems (AMCS) and associated networks which furnish the aviation commander with continuous situational awareness allowing the commander to rapidly adjust mission plans.  AMPS generates mission data in either hard copy or electronic formats. The electronic formats are loaded onto the aircraft platforms initializing the communication navigation situational awareness and weapons systems on the aircraft including the AH-64D/F CH-47D/F OH-58D/F Kiowa Warrior UH-60A/L/M/Q HH-60L/M and Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  The AMPS program includes management of the Commander's Aviation Risk Tool and the Centralized Aviation Flight Records System (CAFRS).  To accommodate rapid commercial technology changes the overall system hardware is replaced after five years of use.  The IDM is the common solution for digitizing Army Aviation. It performs as an internet controller and gateway to Tactical Internet (TI) and Fire Support (FS) internet for Army aircraft. With interfaces supporting a transmit/receive terminal the IDM provides radio connectivity to the ARC-201D/231 ARC-186 ARC-164 and the Blue Force Tracker transceiver as well as providing 1553 and Ethernet portals for rapid data transfer.  This hardware/software solution also provides a flexible software-driven digital messaging system that is interoperable with existing Army and Joint forces battlefield operating systems.  The IDM provides Situational Awareness and Joint Variable Message Format messages capability to the cockpit.  The IDM is currently utilized by the AH-64D OH-58D CH-47F and UH/HH-60M. The ADEC is an Army Aviation program to develop integrate test and field specific capabilities needed at the Aviation unit level to implement and support improvements within aviation maintenance operations safety and training.  ADEC will standardize data and information formats consolidate disconnected and disparate systems containing redundant data and requiring duplicate data entry and provide a comprehensive and fully integrated automated information system.  ADEC provides a common and interoperable capability required to implement Condition Based Maintenance Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance and Platform Maintenance Environment processes.   The ACN is the hardware and software which provides the digital logbook functionality technical manuals and aircraft ground station software that will reside on the laptop computer to support maintenance activity within aviation units. Procurement is to support training and fielding efforts.  The DVE system previously referred to as the Helicopter Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (HTAWS) is required to reduce personnel and rotocraft losses while conducting both tactical and training missions in environments that restrict or severely reduce the aircrews visibility due to atmospheric obscurants. The DVE system will improve safety reduce risk and add flexibility to aviation units by enhancing situational awareness through real-time detection and warning of terrain obstacles and hazards.  The DVE System will consist of integrated rotorcraft pilotage augmentation systems; sensor(s); software; software related hardware; and pilot to system interfaces and cueing devices.  The DVE system will fuse a synthetic vision avionics backbone with aircraft state data and obscurant penetrating sensor(s) to provide a single rotorcraft capability for ground taxi hover takeoff and landing modes of flight. The DVE system will be integrated on CH-47F AH-64D OH-58D/F and HH/UH-60 L/M rotorcraft.ALE-P will replace the Unit Level Logistics System-Aviation (Enhanced) (ULLS-A[E]) which has transitioned into sustainment and the Unmanned Aviation Systems-Initiative (UAS-I) which currently only provides automated logistics capabilities for the UAS community. ALE-P will provide an Aviation enterprise capability interface to the Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army). ALE-P will be a combination of software and hardware that forms a Logistics Management and Decision Support System (DSS).  ALE-P will interface with the ACN and the ADEC as an integrated Family of Systems.

"8fccd92465db2788daf1895b58abd70c","Counter-Rocket Artillery Mortar (C-RAM) is an evolutionary non-developmental program initiated by the Army Chief of Staff in response to the indirect fire (IDF) threat and a validated Operational Needs Statement (ONS).  The primary mission of the C-RAM program is to develop procure field and maintain a system-of-systems (SoS) that can detect RAM launches; provide localized warning to the defended area with sufficient time for personnel to take appropriate action; intercept rounds in flight thus preventing damage to ground forces or facilities; and enhance response to and defeat of enemy forces.  The C-RAM capability is comprised of a combination of multi-service fielded and non-developmental item (NDI) sensors command and control (C2) systems warning systems and a modified U.S. Navy intercept system (Land-based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS)) with a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) wireless local area network.  The C-RAM SoS capability is currently deployed at multiple sites in two theaters of operation providing correlated air and ground pictures linking units to the Army Mission Command and the Joint Defense Network and using various forms of communications to provide situational awareness and exchange of timely and accurate information in order to synchronize and optimize automated Shape Sense Warn Intercept Respond and Protect decisions.The deployment of the C-RAM SoS was accomplished through an incremental acquisition process driven by urgent operational needs theater priorities and emerging capability requirements to provide a counter-RAM capability to combat forces.  The C-RAM SoS approach was initially validated by a Proof of Principle demonstration in December 2004 and has undergone more than 25 Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC)-supported operational assessments to incorporate multiple improvements in response to changes in threat tactics and lessons learned.  The C-RAM Sense and Warn (S&W) capability is currently deployed to locations in Iraq in support of Department of State (DoS) and Office of Security Cooperation-Iraq (OSC-I) operations and in Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  In response to a theater requirement tasked to the Rapid Equipping Force (REF) C-RAM installed Mass Notification Systems (MNS) at multiple OEF sites to support base-wide alerts and announcements.  Continuing C-RAM SoS improvement efforts required to meet emerging theater requirements  include C2 software upgrades as well as integration and deployment of Ka and Ku band Multi-Function Radio Frequency System (MFRFS) radars for an enhanced detection capability against stressing threats.  Support of the existing C-RAM SoS capability deployed in theater has been through the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) process.The C-RAM Program Directorate is also the Materiel Developer for the Accelerated Improved Intercept Initiative (AI3) a rapid development effort to provide an Intercept capability to defeat stressing threats.  The AI3 production decision is pending completion of live fire testing in 4QFY13.
