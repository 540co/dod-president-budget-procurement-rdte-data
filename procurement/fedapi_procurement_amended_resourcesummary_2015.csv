The short minimum range of the M224 makes the 60mm mortar ammunition well suited for close protective fires against an assaulting enemy for block-to-block fighting in cities and combat over close terrain with restricted visibility.  (E70400)CTG MORTAR 60MM ILLUM VL M721 W/MTSQ FUZEThe M721 cartridge is a fin stabilized mortar cartridge that consists of a M776 Mechanical Time Superquick (MTSQ) fuze a thin wall steel body tube and aluminum tail cone that contains the payload (parachute and canister) and a fin assembly that contains the ignition cartridge and propelling charges.  The payload is base ejected and upon ignition produces visible light illumination. This visible light illumination allows for monitoring of enemy activities and adjustment of fire at greater observation distances during night operations. It also provides a means for day/night signaling.  It is particularly useful in combined operations with allies who may not have night vision devices (NVDs). The M721/M767 Illumination Cartridges (Range 200 meter minimum to 3200 meter maximum) are ballistically similar to the M720A1 HE Cartridge allowing a gun to illuminate and fire on the same target without adjustments. These items are Code A approved for service use.(E85700)CTG MORTAR 60MM ILLUM IR M767 SERIES W/MTSQ FUZEThe M767 cartridge is a fin stabilized mortar cartridge that consists of a M776 Mechanical Time Superquick (MTSQ) fuze a thin wall steel body tube and aluminum tail cone that contains the payload (parachute and canister) and a fin assembly that contains the ignition cartridge and propelling charges.  The payload is base ejected and upon ignition produces infrared (IR) illumination. The advantage of the infrared over conventional illumination is that there is minimal visible light. This reduces the possibility of exposing forward friendly troop positions while also allowing covert adjustment of fire at greater observation distances through use of passive Night Vision Devices (NVD). The M721/M767 Illumination Cartridges (Range 300 meter minimum to 3175 meter maximum) are ballistically similar to the M720A1 HE Cartridge allowing a gun to illuminate and fire on the same target without adjustments. This item is Code A approved for service use.(E72199)CTG MORTAR 60MM HE EnFrag M1061 (IM) W/M734A1 MOFThe M1061 60mm High Explosive Enhanced Fragmentation (EF) cartridge with multi-option fuze is used against personnel and a higher category of materiel target sets providing both fragmentation and blast effect.  This round uses the insensitive main charge explosive PBNX-110.  Lethality is maintained by an enhanced fragmentation warhead.  The M1061 EF uses the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze.  When the fuze is set in the proximity mode it functions at a height over the target that is optimized for lethality.  The M1061 is Code A approved for service use.(E93900)CTG MORTAR 60MM HE M720 SERIES W/MOFMThe M720A1 60mm High Explosive Cartridge with Multi-Option Fuze is used against personnel and materiel providing both fragmentation and blast effects. The 60mm High Explosive Cartridges (Range 70 meter minimum to 3400 meter maximum) are Insensitive Munitions (IM) enhanced HE rounds.  Lethality is maintained by using a high fragmentation steel (HF-1) shell body loaded with approximately 2lbs. of an IM explosive. The M720A1 also incorporates the highly reliable and countermeasure resistant M734A1 multi-option fuze. When the fuze is set in the proximity mode it functions at a height over the target that is optimized for lethality.This item is Code A approved for service use.(E92900)CTG MORTAR 60MM HE M768 W/PD FUZEThe 60mm High Explosive Cartridges are Insensitive Munitions (IM) enhanced HE rounds. The M786 High Explosive cartridge (Range 70 meter minimum to 3400 meter maximum) is used with the new M783 dual safety point detonating/delay fuze tail fin assembly and high fragmentation steel (HF-1) shell body loaded with approximately 2lbs. of an IM explosive. This round is used primarily in training because it is significantly less expensive than the M720A1 the preferred war fighting round. However the M768 is lethal and can be used in combat.This item is Code A approved for service use.(E92200)CTG Mortar 60MM FRPC M769 SERIES W/PRACTICE FUZEThe M769 is a low-cost full range practice round that will replace a percentage of the standard HE rounds used in 60mm mortar training. The M769 FRPC (Range 70 meter minimum to 3500 meter maximum) has been designed to provide the user with realistic training at a fraction of the cost. It is identical in shape size and weight to the M720/M720A1 HE cartridges. The flash bang and smoke signature provided by the M775 fuze is channeled to exhaust holes in the rear of the cartridge through the use of a center vent tube.This item is Code A approved for service use.(E98600)CTG Mortar 60MM WP SMOKE M722 SERIES W/PD FUZEThe M722A1 60mm Smoke cartridge is designed as a spotting/marking round. The steel projectile is bulk loaded with white phosphorous. When the fuze functions it detonates the M85 burster which ruptures the projectile and disperses the white phosphorus. The M722A1 WP Smoke ((Range 200 meter minimum to 3200 meter maximum) replaced the M745 mechanical point-detonating fuze with the reliable safe and cost effective electronic M783 Point Detonating (PD) and Delay (DLY) fuze.This item is Code A approved for service use.","Army","2015","60MM Mortar All Types","95.102","90.163","59.102","41.742","65.435","43.029","66.078","46.742","869.421","5","95.102","90.163","59.102","41.742","65.435","43.029","66.078","46.742","869.421","5","95.102","90.163","59.102","41.742","65.435","43.029","66.078","46.742","869.421","5","9","E89600","Millions","Dollars","","FY 2015 Base Budget supports critical Army Title 10 war reserve/operational training and test requirements IAW DoD Instruction 3000.04 (Munitions Requirements Process) and AR 5-13 (Total Army Munitions Requirements Process and Prioritization System).

Night missions include ground operations preparation of the aircraft for take-off and landings in complete darkness lights-off air refueling and visual identification of enemy targets hidden under the night sky. Consequently ground personnel and aircrew require the capability to see in very low visibility conditions at night and high ambient light conditions such as full moon or heavily lighted residential areas. The use of Night Vision Goggles (NVG) is critical for combat rescue special operations and homeland security missions. A lack of night vision capability would significantly decrease combat effectiveness in night operations risk flight safety and increase the probability of fratricide. Aircraft such as HH-60 helicopters HC-130s F-16s and special mission C-130s primarily operate in low altitude environments during covert night operations. Hence NVGs are vital to the success of these missions providing a dramatic increase in safety situational awareness and survivability during the execution of near daytime tactics including visual formation criteria. Furthermore the proliferation of NVG-equipped adversaries underscores the urgent need to supply ground and air forces with night vision equipment.Funding for this exhibit contained in Program Elements (PEs) 0702833F 0207227F and 0202834F.Ground crew Goggles:AN/PVS-14 Ground crew Goggle: This monocular night vision device is a hand-held head-mounted helmet-mounted or weapon-mounted night vision system which enables walking weapon firing short-range surveillance map reading vehicle maintenance and first-aid administration during moonlight and starlight conditions. The AN/PVS-14 supports a vast spectrum of ground and air operations to include aircraft maintenance civil engineering emergency response security and other missions.   AN/PVS-15 Ground crew Goggle: This binocular NVG is a helmet-mounted or hand-held night vision system which is primarily used by Special Forces during night drop operations. The AN/PVS-15 can be used for all nighttime ground operations. An added benefit of this particular binocular goggle is the back-up capability in the event one of the two tubes fails.   Fusion Goggle - Enhanced (FGE):  The FGE is a helmet mounted dual waveband goggle which will increase identification and discrimination of combatants in most battlefield conditions and light levels through the use of image intensification fused with thermal imagery.     Aircrew Goggles:     AN/AVS-9 (F4949G-TG) Aircrew Goggle: This night vision goggle provides aircraft and ground personnel with the capability to see the horizon terrain features and enemy ground fire thereby reducing the potential for air-to-ground fratricide and mid-air collisions during night operations. The AN/AVS-9 (F4949-TG) is a light-weight helmet-mounted goggle equipped with pinnacle tube technology that mitigates effects of sudden bright light exposure. Test Sets: ANV-20/20 Test Set Infinity Focus: The ANV-20/20 is a portable instrument which allows quick and accurate evaluation and adjustment of all goggle parameters. All NVGs require operational checkout.  ANV-126A Test Set Infrared Viewer: The ANV-126A is a commercial upgrade to the ANV-126 which is suitable for field operational checks and depot level NVG maintenance. This test set provides accurate checks for NVG resolution gain power drain binocular goggle collimation image quality and image distortion.

The REF adds value for the Army by rapidly providing urgent capabilities to U.S. Army Forces employed globally by harnessing technologies in order to improve operational effectiveness.  The REF canvasses the military industry academia and science communities for readily available commercial and government solutions that do not currently exist in the Army inventory and then transitions successes to Army Materiel Command (AMC) for sustainment and in appropriate cases back to the Army Acquisition community as a Program of Record for future life-cycle management. Additionally the REF facilitates the early deployment of Army-managed solutions to meet emerging requirements.The REF harnesses current and emerging technologies to provide rapid solutions to the urgently required capabilities of US Army forces employed globally. The REF combines and integrates functions that cross several Army staff elements and Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) to accelerate material solutions and technology insertion to forces on a global scale. The REF provides the Army's rapid response capability to develop prototype acquire integrate and sustain Commercial-Off-The-Shelf and Government-Off-The-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) solutions to meet urgent combat requirements for deployed forces.  It develops and inserts selected future force technologies capabilities and surrogate material solutions into committed deploying and transformational forces for operational evaluation assessment and spiral development. It plans and executes assessments and studies of Army practices and issues concerning operational needs desired future force capabilities and relevant Army business practices to provide feedback to Senior Army Leaders.    The REF bridges the gap between the lengthy acquisition process and immediate equipping needs. We pursue tangible solutions that can be equipped within a goal of 90 days. The REF focuses on finding effective game-changing capabilities to increase Soldier effectiveness protection and lethality in any operational environment. The REF process provides the mechanism to respond rapidly to an adaptive enemy who changes in days and months not years. The REF Headquarters Operations team will coordinate in theater work with Army Service Component Commands of the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) to understand their urgent needs for which the REF acquisition capability may identify procure deliver and sustain solutions to the deployed units. A key element of this process is fiscal flexibility permitting the REF to allocate funds against emerging threats and requirements in the year of fiscal execution.  As the REF procures the COTS and GOTS solutions in the future that are not Type Classified or an Army Program of Record (POR) there will be a substantial logistics/sustainment tail that accompanies these capabilities particularly as these solutions are being employed in immature or austere theaters where the logistics infrastructure is not already established.","Army","2015","Rapid Equipping Soldier Support Equipment","4.323","4.32","3.396","2.38","4.245","25","128.235","27.38","","25","4.323","4.32","3.396","2.38","4.245","25","128.235","27.38","","25","4.323","4.32","3.396","2.38","4.245","25","128.235","27.38","","25","169","M80101","Millions","Thousands","","FY15 procurement dollars in the amount of $2.380 million (Base) and $25.0 million (OCO) meets urgently needed state of the art technology for immediate warfighter needs to deployed and pre-deploying forces across all Army Service Component Commands of the Combatant Commands (COCOMs).
