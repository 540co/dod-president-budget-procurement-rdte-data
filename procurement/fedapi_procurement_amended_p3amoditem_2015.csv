These configuration standardization efforts will also consolidate variant types reduce MRAP fleet sustainment costs and facilitate Type Classification and Full Materiel Release for MRAP enduring vehicles.  This request complies with the Department's funding guidance for the MRAP OCO funding request to include costs to retrograde and repair vehicles to its original or standardized configurations.

These efforts will baseline the MATV fleet to the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 22 configuration and baseline the MaxxPro Dash fleet to the LRIP 21 configuration plus MaxxPro survivability enhancements.  Configuration standardization activities will include but are not limited to:  1) Safety 2) Survivability 3) Capability set network communication equipment/integration 4) MRAP Associated Items of Support Equipment (ASIOE)/Components of End Items (COEI) (i.e. Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station/CROWS Vehicle Intercom System - 3/VIC-3 Driver Vision Enhancement/DVE Blue Force Tracker/BFT Counter-Radio controlled improvised explosive device Electronic Warfare/CREW etc) and 5) Produce/procure materiel solutions to evolving threats in response to urgent warfighter requests. These configuration standardization efforts will also consolidate variant types reduce MRAP fleet sustainment costs and facilitate Type Classification and Full Materiel Release for MRAP enduring vehicles.  This request complies with the Department's funding guidance for the MRAP OCO funding request to include costs to retrograde and repair vehicles to its original or standardized configurations. MATV and MaxxPro configuration standardization activities will be conducted at Red River Army Depot (RRAD) Leghorn Army Depot (LAD) Ft. Bliss TX and OEMs (Oshkosh for MATV; Navistar Defense/West Point MS for MaxxPro).

The EC-130H COMPASS CALL aircraft is the USAF's wide-area airborne Command and Control Warfare /Information Operations (C2W /IO) weapon system. The mission equipment must continue to evolve to keep pace with emerging adversary developments in new communications and sensor technology as well as use of rapidly advancing commercial technology. The EC-130H COMPASS CALL program employs an incremental baseline upgrade acquisition strategy that puts capability into the warfighter's hands as soon as practical and ensures each iteration of the weapon system is effective against the highest priority threats. A new baseline of capability is fielded approximately every three years. Capabilities inserted into each baseline are planned in advance based on warfighter inputs. Executive Management Reviews are utilized to review and "lock" baseline content as production nears. Kits contracted for purchase and integration in a given baseline upgrade are bought in the first year of the procurement funding cycle and are installed in the next year. Production funds are required for modification kit production (both hardware and software) and installation on each aircraft based on a baseline upgrade cyclic schedule. Baseline 1 configured aircraft are fielded and operational. Baseline 0 configurations are returned for their Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) and upgraded to Baseline 2 configuration. Baseline 2 configured aircraft efforts focus on reliability and sustainability improvements significant obsolete parts replacement weight reduction operator/maintenance simplification of PME operations and capability increases. Some examples are procurement of digital narrow band subsystem counter radar subsystem and 3rd Generation Special Purpose Emitter Array (SPEAR). Production funds are also used for avionics modifications to meet Communications Navigation Surveillance /Air Traffic Management (CNS /ATM) requirements and address avionics obsolescence issues. Initial delivery of Baseline 2 configured aircraft began in February 2014. Baseline 3 aircraft modifications will continue to address reliability and sustainability improvements weight reduction as well as capability increases. Baseline 3 will include but is not limited to new receiver suite digital intercom and improved external communications. Modifications for Large Aircraft Infrared Counter Measures (LAIRCM) and Avionics are also included with the fielded aircraft. Similarly new baselines will include necessary support equipment and simulator modifications. The simulators replicate the current aircraft configurations and address training obsolescence issues. Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging Combatant Commander requirements through Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) kits. Equipment includes aircraft and mission equipment retrofits based on the PDM and modification cyclic schedule. Program of record at the end of FY 2013 includes the following resources: 14 EC-130H operational /mission capable aircraft (primary mission aircraft inventory or PMAI) one (1) TC-130H flight deck trainer aircraft (basic aircraft inventory or BAI) and one (1) COMPASS CALL Mission Crew Simulator (CCMCS). FY 2015 funding will procure Group A and Group B kits as well as installation of such hardware during the aircraft PDM /modification cycle. The initial spares procurement funding in FY15 will be used to support the EC-130H mission in its theater of operations. Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207253F.Milestone/Development StatusThe EC-130H COMPASS CALL weapon system is continuously improved using a rapid development and acquisition process supporting a baseline upgrade strategy.

The EC-130H COMPASS CALL aircraft is the USAF's wide-area airborne Command and Control Warfare /Information Operations (C2W /IO) weapon system. The mission equipment must continue to evolve to keep pace with emerging adversary developments in new communications and sensor technology as well as use of rapidly advancing commercial technology. The EC-130H COMPASS CALL program employs an incremental baseline upgrade acquisition strategy that puts capability into the warfighter's hands as soon as practical and ensures each iteration of the weapon system is effective against the highest priority threats. A new baseline of capability is fielded approximately every three years. Capabilities inserted into each baseline are planned in advance based on warfighter inputs. Executive Management Reviews are utilized to review and "lock" baseline content as production nears. Kits contracted for purchase and integration in a given baseline upgrade are bought in the first year of the procurement funding cycle and are installed in the next year. Production funds are required for modification kit production (both hardware and software) and installation on each aircraft based on a baseline upgrade cyclic schedule. Baseline 1 configured aircraft are fielded and operational. Baseline 0 configurations are returned for their Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) and upgraded to Baseline 2 configuration. Baseline 2 configured aircraft efforts focus on reliability and sustainability improvements significant obsolete parts replacement weight reduction operator/maintenance simplification of PME operations and capability increases. Some examples are procurement of digital narrow band subsystem counter radar subsystem and 3rd Generation Special Purpose Emitter Array (SPEAR). Production funds are also used for avionics modifications to meet Communications Navigation Surveillance /Air Traffic Management (CNS /ATM) requirements and address avionics obsolescence issues. Initial delivery of Baseline 2 configured aircraft began in February 2014. Baseline 3 aircraft modifications will continue to address reliability and sustainability improvements weight reduction as well as capability increases. Baseline 3 will include but is not limited to new receiver suite digital intercom and improved external communications. Modifications for Large Aircraft Infrared Counter Measures (LAIRCM) and Avionics are also included with the fielded aircraft. Similarly new baselines will include necessary support equipment and simulator modifications. The simulators replicate the current aircraft configurations and address training obsolescence issues. Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging Combatant Commander requirements through Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) kits. Equipment includes aircraft and mission equipment retrofits based on the PDM and modification cyclic schedule. Program of record at the end of FY 2013 includes the following resources: 14 EC-130H operational /mission capable aircraft (primary mission aircraft inventory or PMAI) one (1) TC-130H flight deck trainer aircraft (basic aircraft inventory or BAI) and one (1) COMPASS CALL Mission Crew Simulator (CCMCS). FY 2015 funding will procure Group A and Group B kits as well as installation of such hardware during the aircraft PDM /modification cycle. The initial spares procurement funding in FY15 will be used to support the EC-130H mission in its theater of operations. Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207253F.Milestone/Development StatusThe EC-130H COMPASS CALL weapon system is continuously improved using a rapid development and acquisition process supporting a baseline upgrade strategy. User needs and technology opportunities are continuously reviewed and a new mission equipment baseline is defined approximately every 36 months. The COMPASS CALL Baseline 2 configuration began initial fielding in February 2014. Eight (8) EC-130H COMPASS CALL mission aircraft are projected to receive the Baseline 2 upgrade. The Air Force Corporate Structure is exploring options to restructure the size of the EC-130H fleet in light of higher Air Force priorities.  ACC currently plans to sustain the full EC-130H fleet and COMPASS CALL program through FY 2015 at a minimum.  No divestiture activities or inventory reduction schedules have been approved or published to date. The COMPASS CALL Baseline 3 configuration is projected to begin fielding in the fourth quarter of FY 2018.

FIDL adds line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight command and control (C2) connectivity through the addition of Link 16 and Joint Range Extension (JRE) data link.  Modification funds will procure and install Group A and B kits for the FIDL upgrade to the B-1B. This modification provides two tactical data processors and five multi-function displays for the B-1B aft crew stations.  This modification also adds an Ethernet infrastructure enabling rapid airborne re-targeting by high-speed transfer of aircraft information to all four crew stations and on-board weapons.  FIDL installations are scheduled concurrently with Central Integrated Test System (CITS) and Vertical Situation Display Upgrade (VSDU) to reduce installation costs aircraft downtime and to keep fielded aircraft configurations to a minimum for aircrew training maintenance and operational deployment efficiencies.  Modification funding is being used to alleviate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues.  DMSMS activities can include but are not limited to life of type buy or minor redesign.  Procurement modification funding will be used to establish depot repair capability and for Interim Contractor Support (ICS).  Activities comprised in the equipment non-recurring line include but are not limited to production test equipment and tooling.

The current CITS suffers from Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMS) issues with the potential to ground aircraft.  Current CITS processor is also at maximum memory/throughput inhibiting fault detection and isolation for current systems and future B-1B upgrades.  Modification funds will procure and install Group A and Group B kits for the CITS upgrade to the B-1B.  This modification provides a new CITS Dedicated Processor (CDP) upgraded Multi-Functional Display (MFD) and re-hosted CITS software resulting in enhanced diagnostic capabilities improved turnaround time and reduced maintenance costs.  CITS installations are scheduled concurrently with the Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL) and the Vertical Situation Display Upgrade (VSDU) to reduce installation costs aircraft downtime and to keep fielded aircraft configurations to a minimum for aircrew training maintenance and operational deployment efficiencies.  Modification funding is being used to alleviate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS).  DMSMS activities can include but are not limited to life of type buy or minor redesign.  Procurement modification funding will be used to establish depot repair capability and for Interim Contractor Support (ICS).  Activities comprised in the equipment non-recurring line include but are not limited to production test equipment and tooling.
