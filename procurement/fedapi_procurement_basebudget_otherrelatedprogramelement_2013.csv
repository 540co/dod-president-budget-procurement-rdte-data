Flyaway Unit Cost and Weapon System Unit Cost are not applicable due to the mix (medium through heavy) of vehicles in the program. Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) procures launch services and is not a weapon system. The 'To Complete' cost value is TBD because of the different launch vehicle configurations possible due to changing payload weights and volumes by mission mission-unique services and other variables.The EELV program is a space launch system currently providing two families of launch vehicles Delta IV & Atlas V but intends to include new entrants when certified.  In October 2011 the Air Force National Reconnaisance Office (NRO) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) agreed to a coordinated strategy for certification of new entrants to reliably launch EELV-class payloads. The program provides launch capability for the Government's National Launch Forecast (NLF) requirements.The EELV system includes launch vehicles launch capability a standard payload interface support systems mission integration (includes mission unique requirements) flight instrumentation and range interfaces special studies (alternative upper and lower stage rocket propulsion solution analysis mission feasibility analysis secondary payloads dual manifesting dual integration special flight instrumentation loads analysis etc.) post-flight data evaluation and analysis mission assurance assured access (infrastructure critical component engineering etc.) Government Mission Director system/process and reliability improvements training and technical support. The system also includes launch site/operations activities activities in support of assured access systems integration and tests and other related support activities.The Air Force is responsible for funding its own missions. All non-Air Force EELV launch services are funded within their respective entities (e.g. NRO Navy etc.).  The EELV Acquisition Strategy approved 24 Nov 2011 restructures the approach of the EELV Program to address many challenges the program has experienced throughout the EELV system lifecycle. In cooperation with the NRO the Air Force will commit to an annual production rate of launch vehicle booster cores establishing better predictability to maintain mission success stabilize the industrial base reduce costs allow competition prevent or mitigate any cost or redesign impacts to space vehicles and sustain the program to assure access to space. This strategy will continue to allow the Department of Defense to reliably place medium- intermediate- and heavy-class National Security Space (NSS) space vehicles into earth orbit. This acquisition strategy directly addresses the Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 -2019 (Phase 1) timeframe.EELV Launch Services (ELS) include all of the necessary vehicle hardware related touch labor and software on a fixed price contract. EELV launch services are usually ordered No-Later-Than 24 calendar months prior to the planned mission.  EELV launch services may be ordered earlier than the standard 24 calendar months to allow a longer integration period for first-time or complex integrations. The Department is planning a requirements contract taking advantage of setting a minimum quantity at a steady production rate.  The contract will balance price operational requirements budget realities and potential for competition. EELV Launch Capability (ELC) costs including facility and facility support costs launch and range operations mission integration mission unique development and integration subcontract support engineering factory engineering etc. are funded on an annual basis. The Air Force is evaluating the addition of other potential suppliers. Non-recurring integration is the responsibility of the particular Air Force or other agency payload program office.As of 21 Aug 2007 the EELV Program has formally entered the sustainment phase.

The procurement strategy has been revised to exclusively procure AH-1Z Build New aircraft beginning in FY 2013.  The revised UH-1Y/AH-1Z procurement strategy is to convert 37 AH-1W helicopters into AH-1Zs build 152 new AH-1Zs remanufacture ten (10) H-1N helicopters into UH-1Ys and build 150 new UH-1Y models.Major modifications include: a new 4-bladed rotor system with semiautomatic blade fold of the new composite rotor blades new performance matched transmissions a new 4-bladed tail rotor and drive system upgraded landing gear and pylon structural modifications.  Both aircraft will also incorporate common modernized and fully integrated cockpits/avionics that will reduce operator work load and improve situational awareness and safety.  The UH-1Y/AH-1Z aircraft will have increased maneuverability speed and payload capability.  Additionally the AH-1Z will upgrade the current Night Targeting Forward Looking InfraRed (FLIR) system to a 3rd generation staring focal plane array FLIR that will significantly extend autonomous weapons engagement ranges.Basis for FY 2013  Budget Request:  Advanced Procurement funds are requested in FY 2013 to procure 26 AH-1Z/UH-1Y helicopters in FY 2014.","Navy","Millions","Thousands","0206120M","The Advance Procurement (AP) funding will be used to procure long lead CFE items (24 months or greater production lead time) such as raw materials (inclusive of  steel titanium aluminum composites) castings forgings bearings actuators mission computers tube assemblies panel assemblies gearboxes and airframe structural components.Any reduction or delay in approval of AP funding for CFE Airframe would result in a significant cost increase and schedule delay to the H-1 program.","Aircraft Procurement Navy","1506N","C","1","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",

Fully aligned with 'A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower' it is intended to establish a consistent sense of urgency and guide the development of a comprehensive long-term strategy and attendant execution plans to achieve and sustain a strategic and operational advantage and maximize the potential for tactical advantage in future operationally-relevant environments.  Our nation and maritime forces face an evolving submarine threat of increasing lethality.  Evolving submarine technologies offer enhanced stealth speed endurance weapons and operational proficiency trends foretelling that the adversary submarine of the future will have a significantly larger sphere of influence while presenting less vulnerability to ASW forces.  The effective offensive engagement range of the adversary submarine of the future will continue to match or outrange individual U.S. and multinational platform sensors and weapons in many tactical environments.  Submarines are an increasing threat to all Naval and Allied ships particularly modern diesel subs and faster torpedoes.  Not only can the presence of potential hostile submarines delay naval combatant action until they are located and neutralized submarines can also disrupt all seaborne logistics supply for any ground campaign as well as maritime commerce.  ASW forces must be effective in all operating environments ranging from the deep open ocean to the littorals.The AN/SQQ-89(V) Surface Ship ASW Combat System provides integrated Undersea Warfare (USW) combat management fire control command and control and on-board training to enable surface combatants to engage USW targets in both open ocean and littoral environments.  The AN/SQQ-89(V) is a system comprised of many subsystems which integrate the helo and its sensors the ship's own organic sensors weapons torpedo detection and a high fidelity Surface ASW Synthetic Trainer (SAST).  The AN/SQQ-89(V) was established as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) I acquisition program in 1983 and re-designated an ACAT IC program in 1990.  In 1998 the AN/SQQ-89(V) program was deemed to be 90% complete and removed from the Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) list.Variants of the AN/SQQ-89(V) are currently in operation on practically all in-service CG47 DDG51 and FFG7 Class Surface Combatants.  The AN/SQQ-89(V) is also programmed for all in-line new construction DDG51 Class ships under Shipbuilding and Conversion Navy (SCN) Budget Line Item (BLI) 2122 while a separate AN/SQQ-90 version is programmed for all in-line new construction DDG1000 Class ships under SCN BLI 2119.AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Surface Ship USW Combat System Upgrade - Detailed Description:A major upgrade to the AN/SQQ-89(V) legacy system the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade significantly decreases ship vulnerability to torpedo attack improves surface ship USW shallow water warfighting capability in the littoral and mitigates Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) obsolescence and supportability issues.  The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade was reported as a critical need for surface ASW operations by SECNAV.  A Fleet Forces Command (FFC) Urgent Operational Need (UON) report identified the Fleet need for AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrades.  The need for the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 is also articulated in the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) Integrated Priorities List (IPL); in an Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) funding priorities letter; in a 7th Fleet Bottom Up review report; and in the U.S. Fleet Forces ASW Integrated Priorities Capability List (IPCL).The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade is programmed for backfit on: Select remaining CG47 Class Baseline 3 and 4 (CG59-73) ships via OPN BLI 0960 (Cruiser Modernization) DDG51 Class Flight I/II (DDG51-78) ships via OPN BLI 0900 (DDG Modernization) and DDG51 Class Flight IIA (DDG79-118) ships via OPN BLI 2136 (represented here).The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade developed under RDT&EN PE 0205620N capitalizes on previously fielded AN/SQQ-89(V)15 systems. The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 will reconstitute onto DDG51 Class Flight IIA ships (Initial Operational Capability (IOC) 4Q2009) a tactical towed array sensor the Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA) and will replace standard militarized legacy components with Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware to provide an ASW combat system with the capability for mid-frequency bistatic and multi-static sonar operations.  The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 features a mid-frequency bistatic hull/towed Sonar Echo Tracker Classifier (ETC); hull/towed Sonar with Acoustic Intercept (ACI) fused data for significantly improved torpedo defense; Handling & Stowage Group (H&SG) for MFTA operation; Torpedo Setting Panel (TSP); passive towed array processing; common sub/surface sensor performance and prediction; common NAVAIR/Surface Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) processing; portable software; integrated supportability; and on-board training via the SAST.  The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 will be interoperable with AEGIS Weapons System (AWS) baselines; is Open Architecture (OA) compliant (meeting OA Level 3 requirements); provides significant reductions in weight space cooling and power requirements over legacy AN/SQQ-89(V) systems; is Grade A shock qualified; supports Digital Fire Control Integration (DFCI) capability; and is integrated with the Battle Force Tactical Trainer (BFTT).  To be effective against increasingly stealthy threats in an often ambiguous undersea environment future sensors must be environmentally adaptive have very low false alarm rates and exploit the full range of current and future submarine detection vulnerabilities.  Via the Advanced Capability Build (ACB) spiral development process under RDT&EN PE 0205620N (ACB-09 ACB-11 ACB-13 etc.) these types of maturing/proven USW technologies will be folded into the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 production and future technology refresh programs.The majority of the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 system equipment is procured via the prime vendor (currently Lockheed Martin NY with subcontract to Advanced Acoustic Concepts (AAC) NY and PA) while other Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) such as that for the Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA) OK-410 Handling & Stowage Group (H&SG) Static Automated Bus Transfer System (SABTS) Torpedo Setting Panel (TSP) Calibrated Reference Hydrophone (CRH) Junction Box On Board Repair Parts (OBRP) Maintenance Assist Modules (MAMS) Installation Checkout (INCO) Spares and Special Tools and Test Equipment (STTE) is procured via other separate contract/funding vehicles.An average aggregate AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 shipset unit cost is indicated on the applicable budget exhibits however it should be noted that this unit cost is comprised of multiple contract/funding vehicles as mentioned above.  Additionally the subdivision of these unit costs to a specific ship can vary substantially as they are dependent on the pre-existing configuration of each ship.AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 production shipset delivery time is 18 months after contract award.  Each subsequent system procured in an FY is delivered one month later than the previous system.  Delivery of equipment to the shipyard is required no later than 30-90 days prior to a CONUS (Continental U.S.) installation start date and no later than 120 days prior to a non-CONUS installation start date.  Installations are assigned to specific ships as per Fleet priorities/requirements and based on ship availabilities as identified in the Fleet availability periods to support a major upgrade such as the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 normally occur only once every two years in a ship's schedule.[P40A / DB400 - DDG51 CLASS SYSTEM COMPONENTS - SQQ-89A(V)15]: DB400 Cost Elements/Descriptions as Follows:[P40A / SYSTEM UPDATES (NON RECURRING ENGINEERING)]: Consists of the NRE efforts associated with the technology refresh/replacement of legacy AN/SQQ-89(V) equipment with updated Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) processors including material procurement fabrication and integration of Government Furnished Property (GFP) as performed by the prime contractor.

Dedicated ASW T-AGOS ships tow long acoustic arrays that collect acoustic data and relay that data to shore facilities via SHF satellites for processing and fusion of the resulting contact data with other sensors. Currently there are five T-AGOS ships operating in the Pacific area. Ship configurations are: (1) Two T-AGOS Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull (SWATH) ships supporting passive operations. This ship class utilizes the Integrated Common Processor (ICP) or the Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (ARCI) signal processing and display systems that are common with the SSN Sonar Processing System. The TB-29A Twinline (TL-29A) arrays provide improved detection and classification capability; (2) One Low Frequency Active (LFA) equipped ship T-AGOS 23 USNS IMPECCABLE the first "large" SWATH configured with the ICP Processing and Display system and the Low Frequency Active (LFA) transmit capability. The active capability provides greatly improved detection against diesel submarines as well as the quiet nuclear submarine threat; (3) Two T-AGOS SWATH-P platforms T-AGOS 20 USNS ABLE and T-AGOS 21 USNS EFFECTIVE supporting passive/active operations. USNS ABLE utilizes the ICP processing and display system and is outfitted with the RDT&EN Compact Low Frequency Active (CLFA) Engineering Development Model (EDM) capability installed as part of her reactivation. USNS EFFECTIVE utilizes the Integrated Common Processor (ICP) and is outfitted with the first production CLFA capability installed in FY11. The CLFA capability will be provided to USNS VICTORIOUS another SWATH-P in FY12 completing the planned production effort.  The initial RDT&E EDM system began its testing in FY08 and will continue into FY12. Two production systems were procured under this line item - one in FY09 and one in FY10. CLFA installation is complex and occurs over a time period that includes a minimum 90-day interval between award of a contract and start of work a minimum of six months for ship modification and four months for array installation and testing. In addition to the five platforms described above two shore sites are configured with the ICP and ARCI processing and display suites to receive the T-AGOS acoustic data via SHF satellite communication links. Major upgrades to the ship platforms include TB-29A Twinline Arrays the ICP signal processing and display upgrade that provides improved ship and shore processing in support of the TB-29A twinline arrays and active processing and Communication C4I upgrades.  A cost sharing agreement with Japan also provides a shore site and two Japanese SWATH ships with similar capability to the T-AGOS SWATH ships for the Western Pacific region. Under the cost sharing agreement the Japanese Auxiliary Ocean Surveillance (JAOS) ships were upgraded with Twinline A180R passive receive arrays in FY04 and were updated with the ICP in FY09.

The BFIST consists of three variants; M7 M7 BFIST SA and A3 BFIST with FS3.  A3 BFIST: The A3 BFIST integrates a fire support Mission Equipment Package (MEP) with the technology and capability advancements of the baseline A3 Bradley digital architecture.  The A3 BFIST requires the integration of four complex and constantly changing major software packages; Forward Observer System (FOS) Force 21 Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) FIST MEP and the baseline A3 Bradley vehicle which are managed by four different primary contractor and government organizations. With the addition of the FS3 the FIST mission will now be able to detect recognize and identify targets at a greater range meeting the Operational Requirements Document (ORD). In addition the BFIST with FS3 will now be able to designate the selected target while under armor and with the greater distance both capabilities increase crew survivability.

At the conclusion of this review the Army decided to significantly reduce the Excalibur program's procurement objective quantity resulting in a Nunn-McCurdy breach for both the Average Procurement Unit Cost and Program Acquisition Unit Cost.  The restructured program was certified by the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) on January 10 2011.  The DAE's Acquisition Decision Memorandum directed the program to fund the program to the Director Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (DCAPE) approved acquisition cost estimate and funding profile.  The profile procured directed procurement of 1000 Increment Ia-2 Excalibur projectiles in fiscal year 2011 (a combined procurement with FY10 and FY11 funding) and Increment Ib projectiles in FY12-14 with the following quantity profile:  881; 2001; and 573.

The core functions of DCGS-A are: the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED); operating in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and Joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information; distribution of relevant red (threat) gray (non-aligned) and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing Warfighter's early warning and targeting capability. DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors and other information sources and impacts all Warfighting functions. DCGS-A is a key component of the greater Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E). DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed and Mobile configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint. DCGS-A continues to support Worldwide Contingency Operations (OEF/HOA/Philippines) through ISR Modernization to address operational requirements and equipment fielding in accordance with (IAW) the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) model.The Army Acquisition Executive designated PEO IEW&S and DCGS-A as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead. As such DCGS-A is currently aligning its architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This alignment is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision.DCGS-A hardware and software is based on a combination of Government Off The Shelf (GOTS) Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) and Non-Developmental Items (NDI) that are integrated into scalable configurations tailored to Warfighting functions. These product line components include the software baseline server suite (ISR Fusion Server (IFS)) and individual analyst workstations called Portable Multi-Function Workstations (P-MFWS). These components are also used to upgrade existing fielded Intel Programs of Record to enable the Army's establishment of a Common Operating Environment (COE) while simultaneously assuring system compatibility and interoperability within the DCGS enterprise.DCGS-A is a designated Major Automation Information System (MAIS) and is deployed on multiple hardware platforms and security levels across the DI2E. Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2Q12 and Full Deployment Decision (FDD) in 4Q12 DCGS-A advanced capabilities will be deployed across the Force in accordance with (IAW) ARFORGEN. New capabilities will be fielded incrementally through annual software releases integrated onto the fielded product line hardware configurations.  These range from portable laptops to large commodity server-based processing centers operating in a Cloud Architecture. DCGS-A deployed the first Tactical Cloud Computing Node in the DoD in 1Q11. Main Cloud nodes will be fielded strategically across the globe while tactical Cloud Edge Nodes such as the DE ACT-E and DE ACE will form the basis for delivery of Cloud computing environment to the combat formation.

The core functions of DCGS-A are: the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED); operating in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and Joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information; distribution of relevant red (threat) gray (non-aligned) and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing Warfighter's early warning and targeting capability. DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors and other information sources and impacts all Warfighting functions. DCGS-A is a key component of the greater Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E). DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed and Mobile configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint. DCGS-A continues to support Worldwide Contingency Operations (OEF/HOA/Philippines) through ISR Modernization to address operational requirements and equipment fielding in accordance with (IAW) the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) model.The Army Acquisition Executive designated PEO IEW&S and DCGS-A as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead. As such DCGS-A is currently aligning its architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This alignment is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision.DCGS-A hardware and software is based on a combination of Government Off The Shelf (GOTS) Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) and Non-Developmental Items (NDI) that are integrated into scalable configurations tailored to Warfighting functions. These product line components include the software baseline server suite (ISR Fusion Server (IFS)) and individual analyst workstations called Portable Multi-Function Workstations (P-MFWS). These components are also used to upgrade existing fielded Intel Programs of Record to enable the Army's establishment of a Common Operating Environment (COE) while simultaneously assuring system compatibility and interoperability within the DCGS enterprise.DCGS-A is a designated Major Automation Information System (MAIS) and is deployed on multiple hardware platforms and security levels across the DI2E. Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2Q12 and Full Deployment Decision (FDD) in 4Q12 DCGS-A advanced capabilities will be deployed across the Force in accordance with (IAW) ARFORGEN. New capabilities will be fielded incrementally through annual software releases integrated onto the fielded product line hardware configurations.  These range from portable laptops to large commodity server-based processing centers operating in a Cloud Architecture. DCGS-A deployed the first Tactical Cloud Computing Node in the DoD in 1Q11.

The primary mission of the C-RAM program is to develop procure field and maintain a system-of-systems (SoS) that can detect RAM launches; locally warn the defended area with sufficient time for personnel to take appropriate action; intercept rounds in flight thus preventing damage to ground forces or facilities; and enhance response to and defeat of enemy forces.  The C-RAM capability is comprised of a combination of multi-service fielded and non-developmental item (NDI) sensors command and control (C2) systems and a modified U.S. Navy intercept system (Land-based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS)) with a low cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) warning system and wireless local area network.  The C-RAM SoS capability is currently deployed at multiple sites in two theaters of operation providing them correlated air and ground pictures and linking them to the Army Mission Command and the Joint Defense Network with various forms of communications to provide situational awareness and exchange of timely and accurate information to synchronize and optimize automated Shape Sense Warn Intercept Respond and Protect decisions.The deployment of the C-RAM SoS was accomplished through an incremental acquisition process driven by urgent operational needs theater priorities and emerging capability requirements to provide a counter-RAM capability to combat forces.  The C-RAM SoS approach was initially validated by a Proof of Principle demonstration in December 2004 and has undergone more than 25 Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC)-supported operational assessments to incorporate multiple improvements in response to changes in threat tactics and lessons learned.  The C-RAM Sense and Warn (S&W) capability is currently deployed to Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) in support of of Department of State/Office of Security Cooperation-Iraq (DoS/OSC-I) operations.

The associated RDT&E funding is in RDT&E AF PE 0604441F.SBIRS's primary mission is to provide initial warning of a ballistic missile attack on the US its deployed forces and its allies.  SBIRS will incorporate new technologies to enhance detection and improve reporting of intercontinental ballistic missiles submarine launched ballistic missiles and tactical ballistic missiles.  SBIRS provides increased detection and tracking performance in order to meet requirements in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD).  SBIRS will consist of satellites in Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) and payloads in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) with an integrated centralized ground station serving all SBIRS space elements Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites and other program related support activities. The HEO payloads operate on a classified host.SBIRS GEO-3 and 4 satellites are derivatives of the first two GEO satellites which were delivered on the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract (RDT&E funded).  The GEO-3 and 4 satellite production efforts are necessary to meet constellation requirements.  In December 2008 the Department approved the procurement of GEO-3 and 4 satellites and the HEO-3 and 4 payloads using a Cost-Plus contract. The program is pursuing an Acquisition Strategy Approval in 2nd Qtr FY2012 for authority to procure GEO-5 and 6.  A two phased contract approach will first award non-recurring engineering and parts obsolescence using advanced procurement funds followed by the award of production of the two satellites.  GEO-5 and 6 satellites are planned as derivatives of the GEO-3 and 4 satellites.  GEO-5 and 6 will be procured through the Department of Defense Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) approach formerly known as Evolutionary Acquisition for Space Efficiency (EASE) which seeks stable production and strategic sub-tier management through the block buy of two space vehicles employing fixed-priced contracting.  The block buy of satellites enables savings by reducing the effect of obsolescence and production breaks.  Additionally ESP seeks cost efficiencies with the prime and subcontractor team through block buys and a healthy space industrial base.ESP Implementation:FY13 is the year of full funding for GEO-5 and GEO-6.

The Department of Defense (DoD) has defined a DCGS architecture that will be verifiably compatible and interoperable across all of the Services' Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems and operations. DCGS accesses and ingests data from space borne airborne subsurface and surface ISR collection assets intelligence databases and intelligence producers. This collected data is shared across a Joint enterprise using the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) and in time the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) to enhance access and sharing of ISR information across Joint forces through the use of common enterprise standards and services. DCGS FoS supports Joint Task Force (JTF)-level and below combat operations with critical intelligence for battle management and information dominance across the full spectrum of operations including peace conflict war and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). DCGS is a cooperative effort between the services agencies and DoD to provide systems capable of receiving processing exploiting and disseminating data from airborne and national reconnaissance platforms. DCGS-N core components include the Analyst Work Station from the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) - Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (I3) Generic Area Limitation Environment (GALE) Lite Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Common Geo-positioning Services (CGS) Image Product Library (IPL) Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB) Joint Concentrator Architecture (JCA) and Track Management Services.The DCGS-N system represents the integration of: 1) The processing and exploitation of tactical and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) and Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); 2) Precision target geopositioning mensuration and imagery dissemination capabilities; 3) Selected national IMINT requirements and processing capabilities from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA); and 4) Sharing of Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance and Targeting and Command and Control information via DIB DI2E and Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) standards with a wide range of customers (e.g. Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M)) Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) and many others).The DCGS-N Enterprise Node (DEN) which incorporates DCGS DIB and DI2E standards facilitates interoperability and data sharing among the DCGS FoS. DCGS-N will stay abreast of evolving requirements and ensure compliance with the DOD DCGS network architecture.The Navy is focusing on establishing an ISR Enterprise way ahead that will emphasize a reach back strategy with a focus on providing intelligence products to support deployed ship and shore operations. The Navy will also initiate migration to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that requires the development integration and testing of ISR Enterprise capability (between Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) to MOC to afloat) development and migration of ISR SOA applications and development and integration to leverage the Consolidated Afloat Network and Enterprise Services (CANES) strategy for a Common Computing Environment (CCE). Additionally DCGS-N will become the focal point for migration of Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) fusion and analysis (MFAS) tool applications for the Navy.The Navy's Integrated Imagery and Intelligence Applications (I3 Apps) are an integrated set of applications designed to support analyst workflows and tactical intelligence processing providing a useful integration framework to ensure joint intelligence interoperability across the GCCS and  DCGS enterprise. Development of I3 Apps includes end to end intelligence analysis applications that leverage the MIDB and integration with NGA-provided digital map and imagery systems. I3 imagery applications provide for archiving viewing and measurement of still and video images.  The Navy's I3 effort is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) managed by the Secretary of Defense through the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)).Joint Service Imagery Processing System - Navy (JSIPS-N) tech refresh and JSIPS-N Service Life Extension Program (JSLEP) upgrades provide shipboard digital imagery capability to receive exploit store and disseminate imagery products based on national theater and tactical sensors.  JSIPS-N service life extension is comprised of five subsystems: Joint Concentrator Architecture (JCA) Common Geo-positioning Service (CGS) Image Product Library (IPL) Imagery Exploitation Support System (IESS) and the Sharp Display System (SDS). JSIPS-N is the Navy's legacy imagery processing system. JSLEP will overcome JSIPS-N End-of-Life hardware challenges software obsolescence and improve systems reliability until DCGS-N fully replaces JSIPS-N ashore and afloat.DCGS-N Increment 2 will improve DCGS-N Increment 1 through the integration of multi-INT fusion and analytical capabilities; provide Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) capabilites; integrate Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) capabilities to improve the use and analysis of sensor and platform data; and share this information across commands services and agencies to promote shared situational awareness. DCGS-N Increment 2 consists of two releases. The first release provides an enhanced Navy ISR enterprise that converges and builds on the DCGS-N Increment 1 and Maritime Domain Awareness Enterprise Nodes; leverages the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) framework; federates ISR and Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) workflow and production improving throughput through automation; exploits new and evolving sensors; provides Multi-INT cross-queuing and provides modular tools accessible via a web browser. The second release enhances afloat ISR capabilities by providing a set of software centric tools hosted on the Consolidated Afloat Network and Enterprise Services (CANES) providing Multi-INT fusion and analysis behavior prediction and intelligent knowledge management designed to operate in disconnected or denied comms environment.Product Improvement includes DCGS-N training equipment DCGS-N hardware and software technical refresh ancillary equipment and upgrades to extend service life and provide the fleet imagery intelligence capability.

Javelin has a high kill rate against a variety of targets at extended ranges under day/night battlefield obscurants adverse weather and multiple counter-measure conditions.  The system's soft launch feature permits firing from a fighting position or an enclosure.  Javelin uses a modular design to allow the system to evolve to meet changing threats and requirements via both software and hardware upgrades.  The system consists of a reusable Command Launch Unit (CLU) with a built-in-test (BIT) and a modular missile encased in a disposable launch tube assembly.  The system also includes training devices for tactical training and classroom training.  Javelin's fire-and-forget technology allows the gunner to fire and immediately take cover to move to another fighting position or to reload.   The Javelin provides enhanced lethality through the use of a tandem warhead which will defeat all known armor threats.  It is effective against both stationary and moving targets.  This system also provides defensive capability against attacking/hovering helicopters.  The performance improvements in current production Javelin Block I CLUs are: increased target identification range increased surveillance time with new battery and software management and external RS-170 interface for video output.  The performance improvements in current production Javelin Block I missiles are: increased probability of hit/kill at 2500m improved warhead lethality and reduced time of flight.

TROJAN exists to provide value added to the tactical commander with remote access to signal environments in order to maintain a high state of operational readiness and enhance the training and sustainment of highly perishable intelligence skills. Additionally the TROJAN architecture provides the infrastructure enabling split-based and force protection operations in direct support of the warfighter.Trojan Classic XXI (TCXXI) advances the tactical commanders' readiness in the areas of training (technical and operational signals intelligence (SIGINT)) operational intelligence production and dissemination and operational support to split-based intelligence operations supporting force projection operations. TCXXI's principle use is to provide remote access to target environments enabling split-based operations from a sanctuary by being the gateway interface to environments of immediate relevance to every supported commander's priority intelligence requirements. In addition TCXII will continue its role as an operational readiness system while also supporting commanders' intelligence requirements across the spectrum of conflict. TCXXI is an intelligence and electronic warfare (IEW) system that supports the increased readiness of key mobilization personnel in preparation for actions in the mission areas of The Army Plan (TAP). TCXXI is capable of maintaining operational readiness status of unit personnel supporting the full spectrum of military operations as outlined in the Army Strategic Planning Guidance and Army Planning Guidance sections of the TAP.TCXXI provides operational readiness capability to an Army commander employing a rapid global response capability to any level of military conflict throughout the seven mission areas. By employing reach technology relay capabilities between the forward deployed sensors and the sanctuary-based Remote Operational Facilities (ROFs) TCXXI can meet the operational deployment timelines through the use of readiness training venues to meet the requirements of units from Brigade Combat Teams through Corps and Echelon Above Corps (EAC).

Permanent modifications are configuration changes to in-service systems and equipment that correct materiel or other deficiencies or that add or delete capability.  Safety modifications correct deficiencies that produce hazards to personnel systems or equipment.  This budget line covers both new and on-going modification efforts for space equipment and systems.  Modification installation funding is budgeted in the year the installation occurs.               1.  NAVSTAR GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS): The NAVSTAR GPS provides highly accurate time and three-dimensional position and velocity information to an unlimited number of users anywhere on or above the surface of the earth in any weather. This system supplies highly accurate position velocity timing and Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) information to properly equipped air land sea and space-based users worldwide. The GPS system consists of three segments: Space Segment Control Segment and the User Segment. The Operational Control System (OCS) is part of the control segment and requires modifications to replace high failure rate parts and preclude system operational degradation. Without these mods aging and obsolete equipment will excessively degrade ultimately resulting in system failure. System failure or even partial system failure will cause a loss of operational availability and the transmission of inaccurate navigation data to worldwide users resulting in potential loss of life and/or operational equipment including multi-million dollar satellites.  Funding is in Program Element (PE) 0305165F NAVSTAR GPS (Space). 2.  474N SEA-LAUNCHED BALLISTIC MISSILE (SLBM) DETECTION AND WARNING SYSTEM: The primary mission of the 474N SLBM Detection and Warning System is to provide United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) with credible integrated tactical warning/attack assessment (ITW/AA) data on all SLBMs penetrating the coverage area. This data includes an estimation of launch and predicted impact (L&PI) locations and times. The secondary mission is to provide the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station CO (CMAFS) and other users with ITW/AA data on Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) penetrating the coverage area. Additionally Perimeter Acquisition Radar Attack Characterization System (PARCS) and PAVE Phased Array Warning Systems (PAVE PAWS) support the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) mission by providing near earth satellite surveillance tracking and identification as required by the Space Control Center Alternate Space Control Center and the Joint Intelligence Center. The sensors have an operational availability requirement of 98 percent. The 474N SLBM Detection and Warning System currently consists of: a) the AN/FPQ-16 PARCS and b) the AN/FPS-123 PAVE PAWS System (Phased Array Radars for SLBM Detection and Warning System).  Procurement funding for both PAVE PAWS and PARCS is in PE 0305912F.At Beale AFB CA the radar has completed Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR) modifications changing the AN/FPS-123 PAVE PAWS radar to a AN/FPS-132 configuration and adding a new co-primary mission of Missile Defense (MD) to support Ground-Base Midcourse Defense (GMD).  The MD mission is to detect track and count the individual objects in a ballistic missile attack early in their trajectory. This data is used by the GMD Fire Control Communications (GFC/C) Component for interceptor commitment and for directing ground-based radar operational responses. The GFC Component uses the information to support intercepts from initial commit through final data uplinks to the defensive action vehicles. UEWR went operational in September 2007 began transition of hardware responsibility to the Air Force in FY09 and will be completed in FY12.     a. PERIMETER ACQUISITION RADAR ATTACK CHARACTERIZATION SYSTEM (PARCS): PARCS is a ground-based radar system located at Cavalier Air Force Station (AFS) ND. It is a single faced long-range phased array radar whose primary mission is to provide USSTRATCOM with credible ITW/AA data on all SLBM and ICBMs penetrating the coverage area. The secondary mission is to support the SSA mission by providing the Space Surveillance Network (SSN) with metric observations and Space Object Identification (SOI) data on tasked satellites and objects.

CANES is the technical and infrastructure consolidation of existing separately managed afloat networks currently under PE 0204163N (LI 3050) Ship Communications Automation including Integrated Shipboard Network Systems (ISNS) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System - Maritime Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Networks and Submarine Local Area Network. These legacy afloat network designs are End of Life starting in FY 2012 and CANES will replace these existing unaffordable and obsolete networks.The fundamental goal of CANES is to bring Infrastructure and Platform as a Service (IaaS / PaaS) within which current and future iterations of Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination computing and storage capabilities will reside. CANES will provide complete infrastructure inclusive of hardware software processing storage and end user devices for Unclassified Coalition Secret and SCI for all basic network services (email web chat collaboration) to a wide variety of Navy surface combatants submarines Maritime Operations Centers and Aircraft.  In addition ~36 hosted applications and systems inclusive of Command and Control Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Information Operations Logistics and Business domains require the CANES infrastructure to operate in the tactical environment. Integrating these applications and systems is accomplished through Application Integration the engineering process used to evaluate and validate compatibility between the CANES IaaS / PaaS and the Navy-validated applications systems and services that will utilize the CANES infrastructure and services.  Specific programs such as Distributed Common Ground System - Navy Global Command and Control System - Maritime Naval Tactical Command Support System and Undersea Warfare Decision Support System are dependent on the CANES Common Computing Environment to field host and sustain their capability because they no longer provide their own hardware. CANES requires that ADNS field prior to or concurrently with CANES due to architectural reliance between the two programs.CANES will field on a rolling four year hardware baseline and a two year software baseline. CANES is based on the overarching concept of reducing the number of afloat networks and providing enhanced efficiency through a single engineering focus on integrated technical solutions. This will allow for streamlined acquisition contracting and test events and significant lifecycle efficiencies through consolidation of multiple current configuration management baselines logistics and training efforts into a unified support structure.Automated Digital Network System (ADNS): ADNS provides routing switching baseband configuration and monitoring capabilities for interconnecting naval coalition and joint enclaves worldwide. ADNS utilizes Commercial Off-the-Shelf/ Government Off-the-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) equipment and network protocols as specified by the joint technical architecture.  ADNS Increment I provides initial limited ship to shore IP connectivity separation of enclaves reuse of unused enclave bandwidth and ship to tactical shore IP connectivity.  ADNS Increment II provides additional capabilities of load balancing Radio Frequency (RF) restoral initial Quality of Service (QoS) to include application prioritization initial traffic management and enhancements designed to maximize use of "effective" available bandwidth for surface shore and airborne platforms.  ADNS Increment III will converge all Navy tactical voice video and data requirements into a converged IP data stream.  This includes SCIP-IWF for secure telephony over IP as well as Video Information Exchange System for secure video over IP. In addition the Increment III architecture will incorporate an IPv4/IPv6 dual stack and a cipher text security architecture to align to the Global Information Grid (GIG) in order to mesh Navy tactical surface subsurface and airborne platforms into a single IP environment with gateway functions to joint and coalition networks. ADNS Increment III will serve as the Navy tactical interface (Gateway) for IP networking with transformational satellite Joint Tactical Radio System High Assurance Internet Protocol Encrypter and Advanced Extremely High Frequency.ADNS provides a secure VTC capability that provides multipoint secure VTC between afloat commanders CNO fleet commanders combatant commanders and JTF components.  It also supports NATO and Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System VTC. It supports global tactical command and control requirements to conduct distributed collaborative planning by senior commanders and decision makers. Secure VTC is the preferred method for commanders in the field and afloat to meet collaborate and plan all aspects of strike warfare. It provides the only means for afloat commanders to meet face-to-face without traveling which reduces tactical decision cycle time and eliminates the cost and risk of flying between ships.Cost to Complete (CTC) values are exclusive to CANES.  ADNS CTC is continuing.","Navy","Millions","Thousands","0303138N","In order to facilitate fielding synchronization of CANES and ADNS due to the architectural interdependencies between the programs the ADNS program transferred from Ship Communications Automation LI 3050 to CANES LI 2915 beginning in FY13.FY 2013 - CANES funds are for procurement of (27) units (1) Technical Training Equipment (TTE) integration and associated costs for pre-installation design.

GMLRS are the primary munitions for units fielded with the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) and Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) M270A1 rocket and missile launcher platforms.  GMLRS provides close medium and long range precision and area fires to destroy suppress and shape threat forces and protect friendly forces against:  cannon mortar rocket and missile artillery light material and armor personnel command and control and air defense surface targets.  GMLRS integrates guidance and control packages and an improved rocket motor achieving greater range and precision accuracy requiring fewer rockets to defeat targets thereby reducing the logistics burden.  The two fielded variants are GMLRS with Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM/Increment 1) and GMLS Unitary (U/Increment 2) a 200-pound class high explosive warhead.  The GMLRS Unitary (U/Increment 2) is the only variant of MLRS Family of Munitions (MFOM) currently in production. This rocket integrates a 200-pound class high explosive warhead with multi-mode fuzing options (proximity point detonate and delay) expanding the MLRS target set into urban complex pre-planned and Troops in Contact (TIC) scenarios by delivering a low collateral damage precision strike rocket.  GMLRS Unitary is relevant to current operations with over 2121 rockets fired in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) by the Army Marine Corps and United Kingdom.  A third variant of GMLRS the Alternative Warhead (AW/Increment 3) is being developed to replace GMLRS DPICM and meet requirements outlined in a 25 JUN 2008 Cluster Munitions Policy which requires all cluster munitions by 2019 to produce less than 1% Unexploded Ordinance (UXO) on the battlefield. All variants of GMLRS share at least 80% commonality and are procured under this funding line.  GMLRS is manufactured in Camden Arkansas.GMLRS Foreign Partners have indicated that they intend to procure significantly less GMLRS rockets through FY17 which negates the advantage of economies of scale.","Army","Millions","Thousands","0603778A","FY 2013 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $218.679 million supports the acquisition of 1608 GMLRS Unitary rockets for the United States Army and procures the support and equipment for maintenance and obsolescence issues with the fielded Multiple Launch Rocket System Common Test Device (MCTD) Trainers hardware and software.

The column for OCO dollars on the Tactical GMLRS line only includes the cost to procure additional rockets to replace rockets expended in theater.  The OCO-funded rockets do not share in the cost of other production contract CLINs such as ILS and Obsolescence.  Note that the additional OCO buys do not add quantity to the GMLRS total APO of 43560 since they are a direct replacement for OCO rocket expenditures.
