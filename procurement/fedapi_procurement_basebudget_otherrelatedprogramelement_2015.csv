The initial KC-46 increment will replace roughly a third of the current capability.  The Air Force completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in Apr 2006 to determine the most appropriate strategy to recapitalize the aging fleet of KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft.  Based on this analysis the Air Force concluded that a strategy of full and open competition to select a commercial derivative replacement tanker aircraft would result in a best value tanker contract.  To initiate the first phase of the KC-135 replacement the KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010 and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010.  The KC-46 program held a Milestone B Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011 received approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) from OSD AT&L on 24 Feb 2011 and awarded the KC-46 EMD contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft. The program plans to procure 4 RDT&E aircraft for integration and demonstration of capability that will ultimately be operationally fielded after a successful operational test phase.  During production the program plans to procure 175 aircraft throughout 13 lots.   The KC-46 will provide the capability to fuel joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will also augment the airlift fleet with cargo passenger and aeromedical evacuation capabilities.  The KC-46 will be able to operate in day/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment employment sustainment and redeployment of U.S. joint allied and coalition forces.  The KC-46 will have communication navigation and surveillance equipment for world-wide operations; will have the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; will have the ability to operate in up to medium threat environments with self-defense/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and will have necessary battle space awareness to mitigate survivability threats.Aircrew and maintenance training systems will be developed and procured using KC-46 funding.  The Aircrew Training System (ATS) entered source selection on 31 May 2012 and a contract was awarded on 1 May 2013 to FlightSafety Services Corp.  The Maintenance Training System (MTS) is scheduled to enter source selection in FY2014.  Initial training and sustainment efforts will be provided via Interim Contractor Support (ICS).  KC-46 funding will also support a follow-on sustainment planning Business Case Analysis (BCA) various studies/analyses and KC-Y/KC-Z planning activities.  KC-46 funding will also support potential Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and obsolescence planning activities.   The acquisition strategy requires sufficient aircraft to be designed tested and delivered to meet a Required Assets Available (RAA) date of 78 months after contract award.  RAA is defined as 18 aircraft meeting final production configuration with all required training and support in place.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) will be attained when the Air Mobility Command (AMC) Commander determines the unit is operationally ready for war.  AMC has not determined an IOC date.  Full Operational Capability (FOC) is expected approximately 24 months after IOC.Note:  Initial Spares are included in Exhibit P-5 because the KC-46 will initially employ Interim Contractor Support before transitioning to a 100% organically managed maintenance and supply support capability.  Initial Spares will be procured with 3010 Aircraft funding until this transition occurs.  Spare engines are included within the Initial Spares line.In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181) the KC-46 is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions domestic emergency responses and providing military support to civil authorities.Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 040122F.","Air Force","2015","KC-46A Tanker","3","KC046A","Millions","Millions","","0605221F","This is a FY15 new start.Production will begin in FY 2015 with two Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) lots followed by 11 Full-Rate Production (FRP) options [currently with Not to Exceed (NTE) values + Economic Price Adjustment (EPA)].The program successfully completed Critical Design Review in Aug 2013; one month ahead of the contractual requirement.

Within this vision Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) remains a Navy core competency in a dynamic and uncertain maritime environment.  U.S. adversaries continue to develop asymmetric capabilities and capacities to deter disrupt or delay the entry of U.S. and allied naval forces and pose a constant challenge as we implement the Maritime Strategy.  Evolving submarine technologies offer enhanced stealth speed endurance weapons and operational proficiency trends foretelling that the adversary submarine of the future will have a significantly larger sphere of influence while presenting less vulnerability to ASW forces.  The effective offensive engagement range of the adversary submarine of the future will continue to match or outrange individual U.S. and multinational platform sensors and weapons in many tactical environments.  Submarines are an increasing threat to all Naval and Allied ships particularly modern diesel subs and faster torpedoes.  Not only can the presence of potential hostile submarines delay naval combatant action until they are located and neutralized submarines can also disrupt all seaborne logistics supply for any ground campaign as well as maritime commerce.  ASW forces must be effective in all operating environments ranging from the deep open ocean to the littorals and are key to countering adversarial anti-access and area denial strategies.The AN/SQQ-89(V) Surface Ship ASW Combat System provides integrated Undersea Warfare (USW) combat management fire control command and control and on-board training to enable surface combatants to engage USW targets in both open ocean and littoral environments.  The AN/SQQ-89(V) is a system comprised of many subsystems which integrate the helo and its sensors the ship's own organic sensors weapons torpedo detection and a high fidelity Surface ASW Synthetic Trainer (SAST).  The AN/SQQ-89(V) was established as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) I acquisition program in 1983 and re-designated an ACAT IC program in 1990.  In 1998 the AN/SQQ-89(V) program was deemed to be 90% complete and removed from the Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) list.Variants of the AN/SQQ-89(V) are currently in operation on practically all in-service CG47 DDG51 and FFG7 Class Surface Combatants.  The AN/SQQ-89(V) is also programmed for all in-line new construction DDG51 Class ships under Shipbuilding and Conversion Navy (SCN) Budget Line Item (BLI) 2122 while a separate AN/SQQ-90 version is programmed for all in-line new construction DDG1000 Class ships under SCN BLI 2119.AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Surface Ship USW Combat System Upgrade - Detailed Description:A major upgrade to the AN/SQQ-89(V) legacy system the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade significantly decreases ship vulnerability to torpedo attack improves surface ship USW shallow water warfighting capability in the littoral and mitigates Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) obsolescence and supportability issues.  The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade was reported as a critical need for surface ASW operations by SECNAV.  A Fleet Forces Command (FFC) Urgent Operational Need (UON) report identified the Fleet need for AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrades.  The need for the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 is also articulated in the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) Integrated Priorities List (IPL); in an Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) funding priorities letter; in a 7th Fleet Bottom Up review report; and in the U.S. Fleet Forces ASW Integrated Priorities Capability List (IPCL).The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade is programmed for backfit on: Select CG47 Class Baseline 3 and 4 (CG59-73) ships via OPN BLI 0960 (Cruiser Modernization) and via OPN BLI 2136 (represented here); DDG51 Class Flight I/II (DDG51-78) ships via OPN BLI 0900 (DDG Modernization) and OPN BLI 2136 (represented here); and DDG51 Class Flight IIA and follow (DDG79+) ships via OPN BLI 2136 (represented here).The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade developed under RDT&EN PE 0205620N capitalizes on previously fielded AN/SQQ-89(V)15 systems. The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 is comprised of a tactical towed array sensor the TB-37 Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA) and will replace standard militarized legacy components with Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware to provide an ASW combat system with the capability for mid-frequency bistatic and multi-static sonar operations.  The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 features a mid-frequency bistatic hull/towed Sonar Echo Tracker Classifier (ETC); hull/towed Sonar with Acoustic Intercept (ACI) fused data for significantly improved torpedo defense; Handling & Stowage Group (H&SG) for MFTA operation; Torpedo Setting Panel (TSP); passive towed array processing; common sub/surface sensor performance and prediction; common NAVAIR/Surface Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) processing; portable software; integrated supportability; and on-board training via the SAST.  The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 will be interoperable with AEGIS Weapons System (AWS) baselines; is Open Architecture (OA) compliant (meeting OA Level 3 requirements); provides significant reductions in weight space cooling and power requirements over legacy AN/SQQ-89(V) systems; is Grade A shock qualified; supports Digital Fire Control Integration (DFCI) capability; and is integrated with the Battle Force Tactical Trainer (BFTT).Additionally to be effective against increasingly stealthy threats in an often ambiguous undersea environment future sensors must be environmentally adaptive have very low false alarm rates and exploit the full range of current and future submarine detection vulnerabilities.  Via the Advanced Capability Build (ACB) process under RDT&EN PE 0205620N (ACB-13 ACB-15 ACB-17 etc.) these types of maturing/proven USW technologies will be folded into the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 production and future technology refresh programs.The majority of the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 system equipment is procured via the prime vendor (currently Lockheed Martin NY and VA with subcontract to Advanced Acoustic Concepts (AAC) NY and PA) while other Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) such as that for the TB-37 MFTA OK-410 H&SG SAST Static Automated Bus Transfer System (SABTS) TSP Calibrated Reference Hydrophone (CRH) Junction Box Portable Towed Array Test Set (PTATS) On Board Repair Parts (OBRPs) Maintenance Assist Modules (MAMS) Installation Checkout (INCO) Spares and Special Tools and Test Equipment (STTE) is procured via other separate contract/funding vehicles.An average aggregate AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 shipset unit cost is indicated on the applicable budget exhibits however it should be noted that this unit cost is comprised of multiple contract/funding vehicles as mentioned above.  Additionally the subdivision of these unit costs to a specific ship can vary substantially as they are dependent on the pre-existing configuration of each ship.AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 production shipset delivery time is 18 months after contract award.  Each subsequent system procured in an FY is delivered one month later than the previous system.  Delivery of equipment to the shipyard is required no later than 30-90 days prior to a CONUS (Continental U.S.) installation start date and no later than 120 days prior to a non-CONUS installation start date.  Installations are assigned to specific ships as per Fleet priorities/requirements and based on ship availabilities.  Fleet availability periods to support a major upgrade such as the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 normally occur only once every two years in a ship's schedule.[P40A / DB400 - DDG51 CLASS SYSTEM COMPONENTS - SQQ-89A(V)15]: DB400 Cost Elements/Descriptions as Follows:[P40A / SYSTEM UPDATES (NON RECURRING ENGINEERING)]: Consists of the NRE efforts associated with the technology refresh/replacement of legacy AN/SQQ-89(V) equipment with updated Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) processors including material procurement fabrication and integration of Government Furnished Property (GFP) as performed by the prime contractor.  Hardware reviews will be conducted on an annual basis to determine if hardware changes are warranted based on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) obsolescence and to identify applicable state-of-the-practice hardware components.  This line also includes start-up/transition funding required for the AN/SQQ-89(V) prime in the first year of a new production/design agent contract.[P40A / MFTA (MULTI-FUNCTION TOWED ARRAY) MAJOR EQUIPMENT]: Procurement of TB-37 MFTA equipment in support of the following: full retrofit on DDG51 Class ships that currently employ pre-production shipset versions; and full module sets required for expeditious replacement in the event of major damage (the TB-37 MFTA component is considered a principle item).  The TB-37 MFTA is a key component of the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade on Surface Combatants and enables ships to have active bi-statics Continuous Active Sonar (CAS) adaptive beamforming passive bellringers and the use of new sensors for advanced torpedo detection.  NOTE: FY13 and follow version of the TB-37 MFTA (via new contract award) includes additional equipment needed to accommodate system performance improvements over previous versions (adds Acoustic Intercept end caps reels slip ring encoders etc.).[P40A / SAST (SURFACE ASW SYNTHETIC TRAINER) BACKFIT]: Upgrade of DDG51 Class ships that employ the pre-SAST AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Advanced Capability Build ACB-09 baseline.

The MSIDS capability resides with the MAGTF G/S-2 sections and Ground Reconnaissance Battalions Infantry Battalion Scout Sniper Platoons and Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command. The MSIDS FoS extends the digital imaging capability to all echelons within the MEF down to and including battalions and squadrons. Captured images are capable of being forwarded throughout the MAGTF through the use of Base Station Workstation/Communication Interface (BW/CI) Outstation Workstation/Communication Interface (OW/CI) or existing C4ISR architecture. Images can also be transmitted to the Tactical Exploitation Group (TEG) for more detailed processing and analysis. The Video Exploitation Workstation (VEW) is used to import manipulate annotate still and video imagery create intelligence products lift still frames from video view multi-format TV signals and provide a field briefing capability. Tactical Remote Sensor System (TRSS) provides all-weather direction location determination targeting and tactical indications and warning of enemy activity in the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Commander's Area of Interest. Upgrades to the system provide imagers with a remotely changeable field of view; more reliable networked communications that provide higher-quality imagery; and smaller power-efficient magnetic detectors with improved target-detection range. The cumulative impact of these changes enable the system to provide higher discrimination of threats in a more reliable and timely manner.

GMLRS integrates guided and control packages and an improved rocket motor achieving greater range and precision accuracy requiring fewer rockets to defeat targets thereby reducing the logistics burden. The two fielded variants are GMLRS with Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM/Increment 1) and GMLRS Unitary (U/Increment 2) a 200 pound class high explosive warhead. The GMLRS U is the only variant currently in production integrating a multi-mode fuse and high explosive warhead making it an all weather low collateral damage precision strike rocket. GMLRS U expands the MLRS target set into urban and complex environments by adding point proximity and delay fusing modes. GMLRS U are being fired in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and has demonstrated high effectiveness and low collateral damage while supporting Marines in combat. A third variant of GMLRS the alternative warhead (AW/Increment 3) is being developed to replace DPICM and meet the requirements outlined in a 25 June 2008 cluster munitions policy which requires all cluster munitions by 2019 to produce less than 1% Unexploded Ordinance (UXO) on the battlefield.  HIMARS satisfies the Marine Corps requirement for an indirect fire system that is responsive maneuverable and is capable of engaging targets at long range. The Reduced Range Practice Rocket (RRPR) includes training devicesfor tactical training classroom training and handling exercises.","Navy","2015","High Mobility Artillery Rocket System","5","2212","Millions","Dollars","","0206623M","FY 2013 Baseline Appropriation: $7.098MFunding procured GMLRS RRPRs Sapphire Glass RSS upgrades Army program management and engineering support for HIMARS GMLRS and RRPRs.FY 2014 Baseline Appropriation: $5.467MFunding procures RSS upgrades Army program management and engineering support for HIMARS GMLRS and RRPRs.

The AMPS is a mission planning/battle synchronization tool that automates aviation mission planning tasks including tactical command and control mission planning and flight planning.  It interfaces with Army Mission Command Systems (AMCS) and associated networks which furnish the aviation commander with continuous situational awareness allowing the commander to rapidly adjust mission plans.  AMPS generates mission data in either hard copy or electronic formats. The electronic formats are loaded onto the aircraft platforms initializing the communication navigation situational awareness and weapons systems on the aircraft including the AH-64D/E CH-47D/F OH-58D UH-60A/L/M/Q HH-60L and Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  The AMPS program includes management of the Commander's Aviation Risk Tool and the Centralized Aviation Flight Records System (CAFRS).  To accommodate rapid commercial technology changes the overall system hardware is replaced after five years of use.  The IDM is the common solution for digitizing Army Aviation. It performs as an internet controller and gateway to Tactical Internet (TI) and Fire Support (FS) internet for Army aircraft. With interfaces supporting a transmit/receive terminal the IDM provides radio connectivity to the ARC-201D/231 ARC-186 ARC-164 and the Blue Force Tracker transceiver as well as providing 1553 and Ethernet portals for rapid data transfer.  This hardware/software solution also provides a flexible software-driven digital messaging system that is interoperable with existing Army and Joint forces battlefield operating systems.  The IDM provides Situational Awareness and Joint Variable Message Format messages capability to the cockpit.  The IDM is currently utilized by the AH-64D OH-58D CH-47F and UH/HH-60M. The ADEC is an Army Aviation program to develop integrate test and field specific capabilities needed at the Aviation unit level to implement and support improvements within aviation maintenance operations safety and training.  ADEC will standardize data and information formats consolidate disconnected and disparate systems containing redundant data and requiring duplicate data entry and provide a comprehensive and fully integrated automated information system.  ADEC provides a common and interoperable capability required to implement Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance processes.   The ACN will provide users with an aviation centric suite of software used to streamline the completion of aviation maintenance activities and its documentation. ACN will include The Army Maintenance Management System - Aviation (TAMMS-A) digital logbook functionality and integration with platform software applications. ACN will reduce the Information Technology footprint within an aviation unit by integrating multiple software tools onto one hardware platform.

Thus the unit flyaway cost will fluctuate from year to year as different quantities of GCSs GDTs and PPSLs are procured. MQ-9 Reaper procurement includes all components of the MQ-9 weapon system. The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft sensors a GCS communications equipment weapon kits support equipment simulator and training devices Readiness Spares Packages (RSP) technical data/training and personnel required to operate maintain and sustain the system. The system is designed to be modular and open-ended.  Mission-specific equipment is employed in a 'plug-and-play' mission kit concept allowing specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.The MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is a single-engine turbo-prop Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) designed to operate over-the-horizon at medium-to-high altitude for long endurance sorties.  The aircraft is being designed primarily to prosecute critical emerging Time-Sensitive-Targets (TSTs) as a radar Electro-Optical/Infra-Red (EO/IR) and laser desginator-based attack asset with on-board hard-kill capability (hunter-killer) while performing Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance and Target Acquisition (ISR TA).  In the hunter-killer role the aircraft will employ fused multi-spectral sensors to find fix and track ground targets using Automatic Target Cueing (ATC) Target Location Accuracy (TLA) Metric Sensor and other capabilities and assess post-strike results.  The GCS functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft from either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communication architectures.  The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support Remote Split Operations (RSO). The GCS has the capability to perform mission planning functions; provides a means for manual and/or autonomous command and control; allows personnel to launch recover and monitor aircraft payloads and system communications status; secure data links to receive payload sensor data and command links; monitor threats to the aircraft; display common operational picture information; and provide support functions.  Additionally a Launch and Recovery GCS (LRGCS) allows for servicing systems checks maintaining launching and recovering aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed GCS.  The GCS will continue to evolve and upgrade its capabilities to keep pace with MQ-9 system capabilities CONOPS and the missions they perform. Near-term upgrades include new LINUX processors high definition monitors and ergonomic improvements.  Future planned upgrades include integrating improved human-machine interfaces open systems architecture improved crew habitability and multiple aircraft control.  Future GCS configurations will leverage the Unmanned Aerospace System (UAS) Command and Control (C2) Initiative (UCI) government-owned open system standard to enable improved capabilities for situational awareness and multi-mission management monitoring and oversight.  MQ-9s are procured sole-source with General Atomics-Aeronautical Systems Inc. (GA-ASI) Raytheon and L3 Comm as the prime contractors (development production and sustainment).

Launch services will be executed from the Evolved Expendable Launch Veh (Space) P-1 line item.  Launch capability will be executed from the Space Expendable Launch Capability (SELC) P-1 line item. Both the EELV and SELC line items are necessary to achieve successful placement of National Security Space (NSS) space vehicles (SVs) on-orbit. Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0305953F.  Related RDT&E AF funding is contained in PE 0604853F. This exhibit only provides funds for EELV.  This program does not require and does not include advance procurement or initial spares.  Flyaway Unit Cost is not applicable and Weapon System Unit Cost are not representative due to the mix (medium through heavy) of vehicles in the program.  EELV procures launch services and is not a weapon system.  The program provides launch capacity for the Government's National Launch Forecast (NLF) requirements but does not take ownership of any specific launch hardware.  The requirements for EELV launch services are derived from multiple spacecraft requirements.  "To Complete" projections include only known requirements at this time.The EELV program (EELV and SELC) is a Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program that acquires launch services to provide critical space support to satisfy Department of Defense (DoD) warfighter national security and other Government space lift missions while fostering interagency and commercial cooperation. The EELV program provides satellite delivery to specific orbits through certified Launch Vehicle (LV) providers. To maintain maximum flexibility to meet NSS requirements the Air Force acquires launch services through a white tail concept where designating LVs to specific missions is accomplished just-in-time to meet mission integration requirements.The Air Force structured the EELV program with a new cost saving acquisition strategy that includes a quantity and rate commitment with the current provider and enables competition if one or more New Entrants are certified. This strategy stabilizes the industrial base provides predictability to maintain mission success and reduces costs. The Air Force National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) agreed to a coordinated strategy for certification of New Entrants to launch payloads in support of NSS and other USG requirements. The Air Force continues to actively evaluate the addition of New Entrants to reliably launch NSS requirements. Once a New Entrant demonstrates a successful launch the Air Force intends to award integration studies. The number of competitive launch opportunities from FY15-17 changed from 14 to 7 due to launch manifest changes. If competition is not viable at the time of need missions will be awarded to the incumbent. The Air Force plans to compete all launch service procurements beginning in FY18 if there is more than one certified provider. The implementation of this new strategy enables the DoD to reliably place NSS space vehicles into earth orbit.

Note 2: The flyaway unit cost is not included on the P-40 exhibit because there are multiple P-5 Cost Analysis exhibits.Description:SBIRS's primary mission is to provide initial warning of a ballistic missile attack on the US its deployed forces and its allies.  SBIRS will enhance detection and improve reporting of intercontinental ballistic missiles submarine launched ballistic missiles and tactical ballistic missiles.  SBIRS provides increased detection and tracking performance in order to meet requirements in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD).  SBIRS will consist of satellites in Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) and payloads in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) with an integrated centralized ground station serving all SBIRS space elements Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites and other program related support activities. The HEO payloads operate on a classified host.SBIRS GEO-3 and 4 satellites are derivatives of the first two GEO satellites which were delivered on the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract (RDT&E funded).  The GEO-3 and 4 satellite production efforts are necessary to meet constellation requirements.  In December 2008 the Department approved the procurement of GEO-3 and 4 satellites and the HEO-3 and 4 payloads using a Cost-Plus contract. GEO-5 and 6 satellites are planned as derivatives of the GEO-3 and 4 satellites and will be replacements for GEOs 1 and 2.  The Acquisition Strategy to procure GEO 5 and 6 was approved on 26 Feb 2012.  The subsequent Defense Acquisition Board resulted in a 24 Aug 12 Acquisition Decision Memorandum authorizing release of the production Request For Proposal.  A three phased contract approach first awarded non-recurring engineering and parts obsolescence using advanced procurement funds on 10 Sep 2012. This was followed by the award of long lead items on 19 Feb 2013.  Phase three will award full production of the two satellites; award is anticipated in March 2014.  Advance Procurement for GEO 5 and 6 was programmed in FY11 and FY12.GEO-5 and 6 will be procured through the Department of Defense Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) approach which seeks stable production and strategic sub-tier management through the block buy of space vehicles employing fixed-priced contracting.  The SBIRS block buy of two satellites enables savings by reducing the effect of obsolescence and production breaks.  Additionally ESP seeks cost efficiencies with the prime and subcontractor team through block buys and a healthy space industrial base.FY15 continues the incremental funding of the GEO 5-6 block buy.  The FY13 NDAA authorizes six years of incremental funding and limits the incrementally funded contract obligation to $3900M.  The years of incremental funding are FY13-18.  Advance procurement was appropriated in FY11 and FY12.  GEO 5-6 advance procurement and incremental funding are attributed to FY13 for the purposes of identifying full funding for procurement end items.  Each year of appropriation FY13-18 is in two parts the incrementally funded contract amount and annual program support costs.  The incrementally funded amount complies with the NDAA cap.  SBIRS HEO-3 and 4 payloads are replenishments for HEO-1 and 2 payloads which were delivered on the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract (RDT&E funded).  The HEO-1 and 2 payloads are on-orbit and certified for Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) missile warning operations and certified for technical intelligence operations.  HEO-3 has been delivered to the classified host.To-complete costs are zero for SBIRS GEO 3-4 per the SBIRS Service Cost Position (SCP) dated April 14 2011.

The Department of Defense (DoD) has defined a DCGS architecture that will be compatible and interoperable across all of the Services' Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems and operations. DCGS accesses and ingests data from space borne airborne subsurface and surface ISR collection assets intelligence databases and intelligence producers. This collected data is shared across a Joint enterprise using the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) and in time the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) to enhance access and sharing of ISR information across Joint forces through the use of common enterprise standards and services. DCGS FoS supports Joint Task Force (JTF)-level and below combat operations with critical intelligence for battle management and information dominance across the full spectrum of operations including peace conflict war and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). DCGS is a cooperative effort between the services agencies and DoD to provide systems capable of receiving processing exploiting and disseminating data from airborne and national reconnaissance platforms. DCGS-N core components include the Analyst Work Station from the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) - Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (I3) Generic Area Limitation Environment (GALE) Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Common Geo-positioning Services (CGS) Image Product Library (IPL) Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB) Joint Concentrator Architecture (JCA) and Track Management Services. The DCGS-N system represents the integration of 1) The processing and exploitation of tactical and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) and Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); 2) Precision target geopositioning mensuration and imagery dissemination capabilities; 3) Selected national IMINT requirements and processing capabilities from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA); and 4) Sharing of Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance and Targeting and Command and Control information via DIB DI2E and Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) standards with a wide range of customers (e.g. Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M)) Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) and many others. The DCGS-N Enterprise Node (DEN) which incorporates current DIB standards and DI2E policy facilitating interoperability and data sharing among the DCGS FoS. DCGS-N ensures compliance with the DoD DCGS network architecture.  The Navy is focusing on establishing an ISR Enterprise way ahead that will emphasize a reach back strategy to provide intelligence products to support deployed ship and shore operations. The Navy will also migrate to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that requires the development integration and testing of a Maritime ISR Enterprise capability development and migration of ISR SOA applications and development and integration to leverage a Common Computing Environment (CCE). Additionally DCGS-N will become the focal point for migration of Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) fusion and analysis (MFAS) tool applications for the Navy. DCGS-N Increment 2 addresses a critical shortfall in Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) capability and capacity to support operational tactical planning and execution across the full range of joint military operations. Existing TCPED shortfalls will be exacerbated by planned Navy Joint and Allied fielding of new Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms. Currently fielded systems provide localized processing capabilities that will be overwhelmed in future years without a significant change in the way the Navy processes exploits and disseminates intelligence data. DCGS-N Increment 2 will deliver all source fusion and analytical capabilities; provide Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) capabilities and integrate Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) capabilities to improve the use and analysis of sensor and platform data. DCGS-N Increment 2 will be based on an enterprise solution to share this information across commands services and agencies to promote shared situational awareness. DCGS-N Increment 2 consists of multiple releases. The first release provides an enhanced Navy Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) enterprise that converges and builds on the DCGS-N Increment 1 and Maritime Domain Awareness Enterprise Nodes; leverages the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E); is compliant with the Common Computing Environment (CCE); federates ISR and TCPED workflow and production improving throughput through automation; exploits new and evolving unmanned systems sensor data; provides Multi-Intelligence (Multi-INT) cross-queuing and modular tools. The second release enhances afloat ISR capabilities by providing a set of software centric tools providing Multi-INT fusion and analysis behavior prediction and intelligent knowledge management designed to operate in disconnected or denied communications environment. Follow-on releases will be developed based on Fleet requirements.Intelligence Carry-On Program (ICOP) is a suite of multi-source intelligence and analytical capabilities which includes an integrated Three-Dimensional (3-D) operational picture displaying intelligence and other data sources to provide a richer and more complete picture of the battle space on Unit Level platforms. The system supports a full motion video capability that receives processes exploits and disseminates organic and non-organic data as well as the ability to process and correlate Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) and external Communications Intelligence (COMINT Externals). It integrates mature Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) applications with shared storage and communication paths to reach back to the DCGS-N Enterprise Node (DEN) and to provide data sharing to the Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) and national ISR systems making tactical users a part of the larger ISR enterprise.ICOP is subset to DCGS-N capabilities for Unit Level platforms. DCGS-N only fields on Force Level platforms. There are (91) Unit Level platforms identified to receive permanent ICOP Foundation Kit installations. ICOP Foundation Kits include all cabling and mounting plate foundations for antennas and ICOP box. The (91) Unit Level platforms will pull from a (72) ICOP System rotatable pool based on deployment. DCGS-N Increment 1 Product Improvement includes DCGS-N training equipment DCGS-N hardware and software technical refresh ancillary equipment and upgrades to extend service life and provide the fleet imagery intelligence capability.

In addition to the standard mission of Anti-Air and Anti-Surface Defense (AAW ASUW) NSSMS is designed to protect ship and crew from a variety of inbound threats including Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles (ASCM) Fast Attack Craft/Fast Inshore Attack (FAC/FIAC) Low Velocity Air Threats (LVAT) and a wide range of asymmetrical threats (e.g. Unmanned Aerial and Surface vehicles small Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats etc.).Primary operations consist of acquiring targets either manually using radar search or Electro Optic/Infrared capability or automatically via external or internal designations generation of fire-control quality track data for engage ability determination launcher control and missile initialization queuing of other weapons (e.g. Rolling Airframe Missile) via the Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) or AN/SWY 3/5 Combat System Rim-7H/M/P SEASPARROW missile and RIM-162D Evolved SEASPARROW Missile (ESSM) firing target illumination for Missile Guidance and Visual Kill/Survive and Battle Damage Assessments. LHD Upgrade consists of upgrading the MK 29 Launcher to modernize the system on the LHD 8 from a NSSMS MK 57 Mod 10 to a Mod 12.STALKER Long Range Electro-Optic Sensor System is a modular portable and form/fit replacement for the MK 6 Low Light Level Television (LLLTV) mounted on NSSMS radar director (stabilized platform) providing 360 degree coverage satisfying ROE.  It is able to detect classify ID & assist in intent determination supporting "24/7" NAV INTEL & AT/FP in addition to SUW AAW and ASMD.  NSSMS Objective Configuration Phase 2 (OCP2) program consists of segmenting the MK 9 Track Illuminator System (TIS) to interface directly with the SSDS Combat System as well eliminating all MK 57 watch stations.  This watch station elimination dramatically reduces system life cycle costs for hardware software manning training and maintenance and obsolescence requirements also allowing the Navy to divest of RIM-7 and associated infrastructure.Equipment procurements that support both the NSSMS MK57 Mod 12 and OCP2 consists of the Transmitter Upgrade (SSTX) and ESSM ORDALT.  Included in the procurements are the Integrated Radar Processor (IRP) and System Launcher Controller (SLC). Mk57 NSSMS has been updated over time to keep pace with the evolving Fleet threats.  The NSSMS Mk57 Mod (14) replaces the legacy NSSMS Mk57 Mod 2 aboard LHDs 1-6 which includes replacing RIM 7 with ESSM.

These are centrally managed items.The first element is the sub-family of Department of Defense Standard Tactical Generators USMC (and all services) procures from the DOD Project Manager for Mobile Electric Power (PM MEP).  USMC procures and manages 15 standard generator models in the power output range of 2 kilowatts (kW) to 100 kW in both 60HZ (ground equipment) and 400HZ (aviation equipment) configurations.  Included in this for medium size models (5 kW to 60 kW) is the new Advanced Medium Mobile Power Sources (AMMPS) that USMC first began procuring in 2013 and will continue procuring for at least ten years. The AMMPS will provide improved fuel economy improved maintainability and reduced weight.The second element is the sub-family for non-Standard Tactical Generators.  These address USMC unique requirements that the DOD PM MEP does not support. This includes the USMC unique Integrated Trailer - Environmental Control Unit - Generator (ITEG) capability that is towable by all vehicle platforms. The ITEG integrates both power generation equipment and environmental control equipment onto a single trailer chassis for highly mobile units units that have tailored power and cooling requirements units that predominantly have HMMWVs for transportation resources or units operating forward that may not have Material Handling Equipment to support larger generators and environmental control units.The third element is the sub-family for Mobile Electric Power Distribution Systems - Replacement (MEPDIS-R) which provides a modernized standard suite of electric power distribution panels and cabling assemblies to meet Marine Corps power requirements to support a variety of command and control systems and expeditionary forces. MEPDIS-R as a highly tailorable system consists of 20 separate components that are configured into capability sets by all using units.The fourth element is the Floodlight Set (FLS) a self contained external lighting system with a power plant and light tower assembly.  The FLS is capable of providing up to five acres of area illumination and is used extensively for security purposes. For flexibility the set is configured so it can be mounted on all trailer systems or ground mounted and plugged into grid power.The fifth element is the sub-family of support equipment to support elements of the Power Equipment Family.  This includes unique trailer mounting kits for all systems onto USMC standard trailers software planning tools for emplacement of power and power distribution unique training aids and general purpose electrician toolkits.FAMILY OF ALTERNATIVE POWER SOURCES FOR COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT (APSCE) - This family consists of multiple suites of devices grouped into sub-families that are used to provide highly expeditionary power (worn on the Marine hand-carried or vehicle mounted) to operate communications equipment computers and peripheral equipment in place of disposable batteries and for scenarios where fuel powered generators are too large too heavy unsuitable for use or provide undue logistics burden due to refueling needs.The first suite of devices encompasses renewable energy based systems and includes the man-portable Ground Renewable Expeditionary Energy Network System (GREENS) that supports a company level operations center and Forward Operating Base and the man-portable Solar Portable Alternative Communications Energy Systems (SPACES) that supports Combat Outposts and Observation Points.  Both of these exploit the use of solar energy technology to recharge batteries and directly power electronic equipment without the need for re-fueling generators.The second suite of devices is the Family of USMC Tactical Power Supplies.  This includes both shelter based (semi-rugged) and fully ruggedized power supplies (operate outdoors) that convert grid power (alternating current) to vehicle based power (direct current).  These power supplies support all elements across the USMC with standard models that provide variable electrical output to support a wide electrical range of operation.  The suite also includes vehicle mounted inverters that convert vehicle 24 Volt direct current to 120 Volt alternating current to allow on-the-move operation of equipment that previously was only able to be used while stationary.The third suite of devices is On-Board Vehicle Power (OBVP) systems that modify and implement power generation onboard multiple vehicles (High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle and Medium Tactical Vehicle).  The HMMWV based system provides engine drive electric AC power comparable to what a HMMWV towable trailer mounted generator could provide (25 kilowatts).  This saves embark space and weight for highly expeditionary applications.  The MTV based system provides engine drive electric AC power comparable to what a generator mounted to the bed of the truck could provide (100 kilowatts).  This frees up cargo space while saving space and weight also for highly expeditionary applications.The fourth suite of devices is the Family of Radio Power Adaptors (RPA) which provide an alternative power source for each radio in the Marine Corps (seven different models).  Instead of consuming batteries when in garrison/shelter operations RPAs allow the radios to be operated from central power sources (such as GREENS and SPACES) or grid power (120 volt AC generator).  This provides cost avoidance conservation of batteries and flexibility of operations.The fifth suite is the Battery Management and Sustainment Systems (BMASS) that support all lead-acid batteries used in vehicles and artillery systems and lithium ion rechargeable batteries used in command control and communications systems.  The suite consists of battery chargers battery analyzers and battery safety management systems for both chemistry of batteries and for both garrison (semi-rugged) and deployed operations (ruggedized).  As the USMC (and all services) move towards fully adopting rechargeable batteries for energy efficiency and logistics demand reduction BMASS is critical to support numerous weapons engineer vehicle and communication systems that are highly dependent on batteries for their operation.","Navy","2015","Power Equipment Assorted","50","6366","Millions","Dollars","","0206624M","MOBILE POWER EQUIPMENT:  FY2013 Base Appropriation: $31.420M Funded the procurement of Mobile Electric Power Distribution Systems (MEPDIS-R) 5KW 60HZ AMMPS 10KW 60 HZ AMMPS 15KW 60HZ AMMPS 30KW 60HQ AMMPS 60KW 60HZ AMMPS ITEG II support equipment Floodlight Sets AMMPS Initial Issue provisioning.

A Jun 2010 JFCOM-led AoA concluded and the USMC concurred that pursuit of a new material solution and introduction of a new system would not be cost effective.  This conclusion was based upon both cost and ability to address the four defined capability gaps in Combat Identification specific to reducing fratricide of U.S. and coalition forces.  The AoA evaluated the currently Fielded and Planned Capability Improvements (FPCI) resident within funded projects and existing programs of records across all Services and determined that the most affordable alternative would leverage the FPCI programs by allocating the CID-FFT requirements and funding capability improvements within these existing programs. The AoA further concluded that in addition to significant cost avoidance leveraging the FPCI to meet the CID-FFT requirements as opposed to establishing a new program of record material solution would have greater impact and achieve a higher percentage of CID-FFT JCD capability gap closure by 2016.  In support of a Jan 2010 Memorandum of Understanding between the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps (which documents the Army and Marine Corps agreement to support closure of the Fires on Dismounts fratricide mitigation gap) the USMC refocused the program in June 2011 to begin allocation of CID-FFT JCD requirements to the USMC FPCI programs to meet this valid Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) requirement.  Having no previous CID-FFT requirement these FPCI programs have neither planned for nor been resourced to support the additional requirements of the CID-FFT JCD.  As a result of these events this effort will ensure requirements allocation traceability and validation within 24 USMC FPCI programs in accordance with the CID-FFT JCD and JCIDS processes and provide resource funding and augment workforce to support the additional unanticipated requirements being levied on FPCI programs.  Additionally it will support aggregation of a time-phased schedule of USMC CID-FFT capabilities and future interoperability engineering/testing between FPCI systems and related modernization efforts necessary to minimize costs and measure attainment of CID-FFT JCD capability gap closure by 2016. The AoA recommendation accepted by the Services and OSD is to maintain and enhance the full range of FPCI programs to meet the requirements and mitigate CID-FFT capability gaps identified in the CID-FFT JCD.

A Jun 2010 JFCOM-led AoA concluded and the USMC concurred that pursuit of a new material solution and introduction of a new system would not be cost effective.  This conclusion was based upon both cost and ability to address the four defined capability gaps in Combat Identification specific to reducing fratricide of U.S. and coalition forces.  The AoA evaluated the currently Fielded and Planned Capability Improvements (FPCI) resident within funded projects and existing programs of records across all Services and determined that the most affordable alternative would leverage the FPCI programs by allocating the CID-FFT requirements and funding capability improvements within these existing programs. The AoA further concluded that in addition to significant cost avoidance leveraging the FPCI to meet the CID-FFT requirements as opposed to establishing a new program of record material solution would have greater impact and achieve a higher percentage of CID-FFT JCD capability gap closure by 2016.  In support of a Jan 2010 Memorandum of Understanding between the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps (which documents the Army and Marine Corps agreement to support closure of the Fires on Dismounts fratricide mitigation gap) the USMC refocused the program in June 2011 to begin allocation of CID-FFT JCD requirements to the USMC FPCI programs to meet this valid Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) requirement.  Having no previous CID-FFT requirement these FPCI programs have neither planned for nor been resourced to support the additional requirements of the CID-FFT JCD.  As a result of these events this effort will ensure requirements allocation traceability and validation within 24 USMC FPCI programs in accordance with the CID-FFT JCD and JCIDS processes and provide resource funding and augment workforce to support the additional unanticipated requirements being levied on FPCI programs.  Additionally it will support aggregation of a time-phased schedule of USMC CID-FFT capabilities and future interoperability engineering/testing between FPCI systems and related modernization efforts necessary to minimize costs and measure attainment of CID-FFT JCD capability gap closure by 2016. The AoA recommendation accepted by the Services and OSD is to maintain and enhance the full range of FPCI programs to meet the requirements and mitigate CID-FFT capability gaps identified in the CID-FFT JCD.

SIIRCM is an integrated warning and countermeasure system to enhance aircraft survivability against IR-guided threat missile systems. The Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) is a core element of the SIIRCM concept. CMWS is an integrated ultraviolet (UV) missile warning system with an Improved Countermeasure Dispenser (ICMD) serving as a subsystem to a host aircraft. The CMWS program is a UV missile warning system that cues both flare and laser-based countermeasures to defeat incoming IR-seeking missiles and will alert aircrews to the presence of certain incoming unguided munitions. The B-Kit consists of the components which perform the missile detection and aircrew notification unguided munitions detection and aircrew notification false alarm rejection and countermeasure employment/cueing functions of the system. The CMWS Electronic Control Unit (ECU) receives UV missile detection data from Electro-Optic Missile Sensors (EOMS) and sends a missile alert signal to warn aircrews via on-board avionics. Tier 1 threat missiles detected and tracked by the CMWS are subsequently defeated by a combination of missile seeker countermeasures including decoy flares and IR Laser Jamming (currently ATIRCM equipped CH-47 platform only). In addition the CMWS ECU receives from the EOMS unguided munitions detection data which is also passed to the aircrew through aural and visual cues. The aircrew then applies the appropriate Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to break contact or engage the enemy with on-ship ordnance. The CMWS Generation 3 (Gen 3) ECU in conjunction with ongoing software development efforts will address outstanding material release conditions to achieve a Full Material Release (FMR) for CMWS and ensure protection against emerging IR-guided missile threats. The A-Kit for CMWS includes mounting hardware wiring harnesses cables and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft.

The FIST contributes to success on the battlefield by accurately locating and designating targets and then combining this information to develop and execute fire support plans.  The BFIST allows fire support operations to be performed on the battlefield in vehicles with the same signature survivability and mobility as the other Bradleys in the maneuver units it supports.  The BFIST consists of three variants; M7 M7 BFIST Situational Awareness (SA) and A3 BFIST.A3 BFIST: The A3 BFIST integrates a fire support Mission Equipment Package (MEP) with the technology and capability advancements of the baseline A3 Bradley digital architecture.  The A3 BFIST requires the integration of four complex software packages; Forward Observer System (FOS) Force 21 Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) FIST MEP and the baseline A3 Bradley vehicle which are managed by four different primary contractor and government organizations. With the addition of the FS3 the FIST mission will now be able to detect recognize and identify targets at a greater range meeting the Operational Requirements Document (ORD). In addition the BFIST with Fire Support Sensor System (FS3) will now be able to designate the selected target while under armor and with the greater distance both capabilities increase crew survivability. M7 BFIST: The M7 BFIST integrates a fire support Mission Equipment Package (MEP) onto the baseline Operation Desert Storm (ODS) Bradley vehicle.  The M7 BFIST requires the integration of four complex software packages; Forward Observer System (FOS) Force 21 Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) FIST MEP and the baseline ODS Bradley vehicle which are managed by four different primary contractors and government organizations.  Any modifications needed to the baseline vehicle to integrate the MEP are added as an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP).  The M7 BFIST is currently being transitioned to the M7 BFIST Situational Awareness (SA) Variant. In order to maintain commonality with the baseline Bradley Operation Desert Storm (ODS) SA vehicle the M7 BFIST is transitioning to the M7 BFIST SA vehicle.

Systems range in size from 9000 to 60000 British Thermal Units/hour (BTU/hr) and are powered by common electrical currents supplied by both mobile electric power systems and standard commercial facilities.  IECUs also provide dehumidification and filtering of air in support of environmentally sensitive electronic equipment in mobile shelters and vans.  IECUs support critical electronic equipment that would not support the Army mission without proper environmental control.  The majority of the supported weapon systems are command control and communication items. Other applications include medical facilities force provider systems support equipment satellite communications intelligence gathering systems petroleum and water logistics laboratories electronic shop sets Test Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) aviation shop sets and topographic support sets.The Improved Environmental Control Unit (IECU) program will provide a new generation of Environmental Control Units (ECUs) that use environmentally approved refrigerants with zero ozone-depleting chemicals (ODCs) to replace the current Military Standard (MIL-STD) Family of ECUs. IECUs are required to replace currently fielded environmental control units in order to comply with statutory and regulatory restrictions on the use of Class II Ozone Depleting Chemicals (ODCs) and to increase the performance of military ECUs. They are form fit and function replacements to the current MIL-STD ECUs. IECUs operate at wider operating temperatures are more ruggedized than commercial ECUs and employ embedded diagnostics and automatic safety controls. Technical improvements over existing military-standard ECUs will yield significant fuel and weight savings reduction in scheduled maintenance and increased reliability.The 60000 British Thermal Units per hour (BTU/H) Improved Environmental Control Unit (IECU) program is a joint Army and Air Force effort to replace the heavy and inefficient fielded Environmental Control Units that utilize ozone depleting refrigerants.  The 60000 BTU/HR IECU will be a replacement for the existing Army 54000-BTU/HR Environmental Control Unit (ECU) and Air Force developed 66000-BTU/HR Field Deployable Environmental Control Unit. The 60000 BTU/H IECU will be lighter in weight than the existing military ECUs.   The Large Capacity Field Heater (LCFH) provides 400000 BTUH.  It is used to heat maintenance tents specifically the Lightweight Maintenance Enclosure (LME) in cold environments so that soldiers can safely repair a wide variety of equipment such as trucks tanks helicopters and air defense and field artillery systems.  It is thermostatically controlled and uses either diesel or JP-8 fuel to produce heat. This supports the single fuel on the battlefield concept.  The LCFH is mobile and delivers both heated and re-circulated fresh and vented air through sealed detachable flexible ducts.  It is suitable for use in temperate and arctic environments. It replaces the dangerous outdated gasoline powered 400000 BTUH Herman Nelson Heater.  The LCFH is safer for personnel operating equipment in enclosed areas because it eliminates carbon monoxide emissions within the shelters.  The LCFH has many proven advantages over its Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) heater alternatives which include lower procurement/life cycle costs higher operating efficiency and significantly reduced fuel costs.  The rugged LCFH also meets military's stringent transportation health safety and environmental requirements and provides the soldier in the field a safe maintainable and reliable heating system with built-in diagnostics to aid in simplified repairs and reduced down time to increase mission readiness.","Army","2015","Heaters and ECU's","128","MF9000","Millions","Thousands","","0608804A","FY15 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $9.235 million supports the family of Improved Environmental Control Units 9000 BTU/hr (British Thermal Units) 18000 BTU/hr and 36000 BTU/hr IECUs that are required as a component or separately authorized in support of fielded tactical weapon systems.

Improved Night/Day Observation/Fire Control (INOD).   This program provided the SOF sniper with a lightweight low signature fire control and observation device that allows the sniper to detect acquire and engage targets out to the weapon's maximum effective range under day/night conditions.  The device allowed the sniper to go from day to night operations without re-zeroing.  The INOD Program consists of a family (four blocks) of sniper sights using Image Intensification (I2) Thermal and fusion or multi-spectral technology.  This program was reduced in FY 2013 by -$0.134 millin due to sequestration.  Impact:  Reduction in INOD of 8 systems.2.  Laser Acquisition Markers (LAM).  Two variants:  LAM and Hand-Held Laser Markers (HLM).  LAM provided a laser target designator with range finding capability. The marker allowed operators to conduct close air support and air interdiction missions through the terminal guidance of laser-guided munitions.    Capability in this system included target location markers designators and integrated alignment lasers used to align the front and rear sights.  The HLM is a lightweight marking device required by SOF operators to reduce collateral damage and increase precise target engagements with fighter aircraft and attack helicopters.  It reduced the weight carried by the operator and has the ability to mark for laser spot tracking sensors in the aircraft.  Separately procured thermal devices provide a night vision capability and verify that the energy from the device is on the target.  This system is specifically gated and tuned to view the invisible laser spot of the marker for use in designating laser guided bombs onto targets.  This program was reduced in FY 2013 by -$.463 million due to sequestration.  Impact:  Reduction in Sight Thermal Spot on Target by 7 systems and HLM by 7 systems. 3.  Hand Held Imager (HHI).  This program provided the SOF operator with a lightweight man-portable thermal imager that allows the operator to detect acquire and observe targets during day/night operations and in the presence of obscurants.  Program consisted of three variants: long-range medium range and pocket.   This program was reduced in FY 2013 by -$1.174 million due to sequestration.  Impact:  Reduction in HHI-Long Range by 21 systems.4.  Visual Augmentation System-Binocular/Monocular (VAS-B/M).  This program procured head/helmet mounted night vision goggle systems.  These goggles provided the SOF operator the capability to see in all lighting conditions day or night and in the presence of certain obscurants with improvements in overall capability situational awareness interoperability and logistics commonality.  The clip-on thermal imager (COTI)/(AN/PAS-29) clips on the AN/PVS-15A to provide an image fusion capability.  This overlaid fused image of the two systems increases the situational awareness of the SOF operator in a variety of lighting and environmental conditions thereby increasing both the lethality and survivability of the SOF operator.

SOF Deployable Node (SDN).  SDN is a family of deployable super high frequency multi-band and satellite communications (SATCOM) systems providing the transport path for high-capacity voice data video teleconferencing (VTC) and video at all levels of classification.  It consists of SDN subprograms transport for intelligence variants technology insertions and capital equipment replacement.  The SDN-Heavy (SDN-H) is a deployable multi-channel/multi-band SATCOM terminal and associated switching equipment that provides wide-area connectivity through SOCOM Mobile SOF Strategic Entry Points (MSSEPs) and commercial teleports for SOF task forces.  The SDN-Medium (SDN-M) is a lightweight multi-channel SATCOM system that provides C4 for SOF mid-level tactical headquarters and operational elements.  The SDN-Light (SDN-L) is a rugged portable SATCOM package that supports small SOF liaison teams and small operational elements.  Wide band SATCOM-On-The-Move (WB SOTM) consists of SDN afloat ground mobile and airborne packages for SOF elements.  The MSSEP is a deployable SOF strategic entry point that augments the SOF Info Environment (SIE) global architecture in support of regional requirements.  The airborne intelligence surveillance reconnaissance (ISR) transport communications architecture equipment supports the delivery of near real time sensor data to the strategic operational and tactical edge users.  This program was reduced in FY 2013 by $9.823 million due to sequestration.  This reduction delays the 3rd generation/4th generation (3G/4G) cellular site development by 1 year and eliminates MARSOC and WARCOM SDN-heavy capital equipment replacement program (CERP) from 2 to 0 systems for each component in FY13.  ABOVE OPERATIONAL ELEMENT (GARRISON)2. SCAMPI is the telecommunications system that disseminates information between Headquarters (HQ) USSOCOM SOF deployed forces component commands and major subordinate units the Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs) and selected government agencies and activities directly associated with the special operations community. SCAMPI is not an acronym--it is the term identified with this enterprise telecommunications capability. SCAMPI provides secure voice data and VTC on various classification levels to world-wide deployed and garrison SOF locations. SCAMPI also extends connectivity to global C KU and X-Band satellite services to deployed SOF units; provides rapid secure communications to SOF Forces and enables access to other government agencies and SOF-specific information services.  This program was reduced in FY 2013 by $1.377 million due to sequestration.  This delayed the CERP of two SCAMPI nodes and one SCAMPI SOF Strategic Entry Point (SSEP).3. The Joint Tactical C4I Information Transceiver System (JTCITS). JTCITS provides portable video receive terminals for receipt of tactical full motion video from unmanned aerial systems. JTCITS increment II will be a next-generation replacement for the increment I (ROVER III/IV) systems that were fielded in FY 2006-2009. The increment II systems will consist of a fixed- mount form factor designed for integration into ground/airborne/seaborne platforms and a dismounted form factor designed for handheld or manpack use.  This program was reduced in FY 2013 by $0.226 million due to sequestration.

The E-8C is a modified Boeing 707-300 airframe that provides a unique blend of Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) and Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR). Air Battle Managers onboard the JSTARS use its wide area ground surveillance radar to build situational awareness and identify targets which are passed to strike assets or crossed cued with ISR platforms. The capability to perform this dual mission at the tactical edge both reduces the time to execute the kill chain and improves ISR collections across the range of military options.

The SLRS provides the capability to track and destroy an errant rocket in flight to protect the public which enables national security civil and commercial spacelift operations to be conducted safely. SLRS is also a test range supporting intercontinental and sea-launched ballistic missile test launches national missile defense tests and aeronautical tests.SLRS is comprised of twelve subsystems that together provide this capability to the ranges. The Range Safety and Command Destruct subsystems provide the capability to destroy an errant rocket if necessary. These subsystems rely on the telemetry radar and optics subsystems to provide tracking data to the Mission Flight Control Officer (MFCO) who is certified to determine if a rocket in flight is on course or errant. The weather and surveillance subsystems provide the MFCO information about the surroundings to determine if conditions are safe for launch. The communications data handling and Timing & Sequencing subsystems ensure critical data is expeditiously routed from remote sensors (e.g. radars optics etc.) to the MFCO. Finally the planning and scheduling subsystem ensures all assets are available when needed for a launch or test operation.The Air Force prioritizes procurement funds to ensure aging range equipment is modernized prior to end of life.  Sustainment trends are continuously analyzed and assessed across all twelve subsystems and procurement funds are used to modernize the most critical mission equipment.1) SLRS INTERIM SUPPLY SUPPORT: Provides peculiar and common support material required by re-procurement data and interim supply support management.2) SLRS Support Services: FY15 funds pay for FFRDC mission assurance activities to ensure all twelve subsystems are compatible with mission rules and do not pose a risk to safe and cost-effective satellite launches.  Funds are also used for SE&I to mange baseline documentation and project integration with the sustainment baseline.3) Range Command Destruct Modernization (RCDM): modernizes the Eastern and Western Range Command Destruct Systems. The Eastern Range Command Destruct will replace a sustainment "worst actor" that has been the cause of an expensive launch scrub as well as several near scrubs. In addition the Eastern Range Command Destruct will provide the capability to use a new secure Command Destruct Code structure mandated by NSA for cyber security. The Western Range Command Destruct  contract is needed for an equivalent upgrade to the Command Destruct Systems on the Western Range. The Air Force decided to award two separate contracts to ensure the Eastern Range Command Destruct contract meets the Eastern Range's more urgent need date.  However both contracts will use similar hardware and software.4) Modernized Eastern Network (MEN): upgrades the communications subsystem on the Eastern Range from Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology to today's standard of IPV4/IPV6.  MEN resolves 2018 obsolescence issues eliminates high-priority sustainment issues and provides improved cyber security for range operations. The contract was awarded as small business set aside.5) Western Modernized Network (WMN): upgrades the communications subsystem on the Western Range from Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology to today's standard of IPV4/IPV6.  WMN resolves remaining ATM obsolescence issues numerous high-priority sustainment issues and provides improved cyber security for range operations.  The WMN contract is expected to be awarded in FY15 as a small business set aside.6) SLRS Recapitalization Projects: The Air Force will use various contract vehicles (LTRS Integrated Support Contract GSA Full & Open Competition) to address the highest priority unfunded upgrades as funding is made available in execution (e.g. due to lower negotiated costs or reduced requirements on planned modernization). Obsolescence and sustainment "worst actors" in all twelve subsystems are prioritized annually in order of their criticality to the mission; priority is driven by liklihood of causing a launch delay/scrub.Funding for this exhibit is in PE 0305182F.","Air Force","2015","Spacelift Range System Space","47","836770","Millions","Millions","","0305182F","1) SLRS INTERIM SUPPLY SUPPORT: FY15 funds will pay for interim supply support to include supplies and associated interim supply support management via LISC.

CANES is the technical and infrastructure consolidation of existing separately managed afloat networks including Integrated Shipboard Network Systems (ISNS) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System - Maritime Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Networks and Submarine Local Area Network. These legacy afloat network designs are currently End of Life and CANES will replace these unaffordable and obsolete networks.The fundamental goal of CANES is to bring Infrastructure and Platform as a Service (IaaS / PaaS) within which current and future iterations of Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination computing and storage capabilities will reside. CANES will provide complete infrastructure inclusive of hardware software processing storage and end user devices for Unclassified Coalition Secret and SCI for all basic network services (email web chat collaboration) to a wide variety of Navy surface combatants submarines Maritime Operations Centers Regional Network Operations and Security Centers (RNOSCs) and Aircraft. In addition ~36 hosted applications and systems inclusive of Command and Control Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Information Operations Logistics and Business domains require the CANES infrastructure to operate in the tactical environment. Integrating these applications and systems is accomplished through Application Integration the engineering process used to evaluate and validate compatibility between the CANES IaaS / PaaS and the Navy-validated applications systems and services that will utilize the CANES infrastructure and services. Specific programs such as Distributed Common Ground System - Navy Global Command and Control System - Maritime Naval Tactical Command Support System and Undersea Warfare Decision Support System are dependent on the CANES Common Computing Environment to field host and sustain their capability because they no longer provide their own hardware. CANES equires that Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) field prior to or concurrently with CANES due to architectural reliance between the two programs.CANES will develop updates on a rolling four year hardware baseline and a two year software baseline. Fielding of rolling baselines will occur every eight years for hardware and four years for software. CANES is based on the overarching concept of reducing the number of afloat networks and providing enhanced efficiency through a single engineering focus on integrated technical solutions. This will allow for streamlined acquisition contracting and test events and significant lifecycle efficiencies through consolidation of multiple current configuration management baselines logistics and training efforts into a unified support structure.Cooperative Maritime Forces Pacific (CMFP) network supports secure coalition interoperability and information exchange at the secret-releasable level.","Navy","2015","CANES Intell","80","2925","Millions","Thousands","","0303138N","FY 2015 - CANES funds are for procurement of (33) production units (2) First Articles integration and associated costs for pre-installation design.

ITAS is the replacement for the current M220 Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wire-guided (TOW) 2 weapon system and it provides the capability to defeat armored vehicles bunkers and buildings at extended ranges in all battlefield conditions. Far Target Location includes a GPS based position and altitude determination subsystem to ITAS enabling the system to generate a 10 digit grid coordinate of a target location. ITAS's superior surveillance capability also enables the Marine to shape the battlefield by detecting targets at long range and either engaging with TOW missiles or other weapon systems to destroy those targets. ITAS continues to be the weapon of choice in precision combat engagements in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). The ITAS Image Enhancement (IE) modification kit consists of a modification to an existing circuit card assembly (CCA) and the addition of one CCA and associated software to the ITAS Fire Control Subsystem (FCS) LRU. IE reduces operator workload by automating the display's focus and brightness and contrast adjustments and optimizing the Night Sight image presented to gunner through electronic processing of the FLIR image. The Night Sight image optimization reduces the time required for the operator to identify targets thereby decreasing engagement times.

LAV-C2 upgrade provided a hardware and software module for the LAV-C2 to support complex radio configurations. The upgrade sought to integrate in the vehicle those non-developmental hardware and software components that ensured that the vehicles and the appropriate Light Armored Reconnaissance (LAR) unit command element have the capability to send and receive required voice and data communications to higher adjacent and subordinate units. The module provided isolation of critical communications functions in a self-contained module to support a mix of legacy radios. The modification was needed to maintain the LAV-C2 as a viable weapon system through the service life of the LAV Family of Vehicles.The Survivability Upgrade Program consists of a project to keep the LAV Family of Vehicles operational and effective through the year 2035.  The Survivability Upgrades program will include replacing and relocating the legacy LAV-25 fuel cells (currently located under the scout seats in the LAV-25) with self-sealing fuel cells and adding blast attenuating seats on all 7 LAV variants.The LAV-25 program is for the procurement of blast attenuating seats. Replacing these seats will ensure the USMC Light Armored Reconnaissance (LAR) battalions have added battlefield survivability in combat operations.The LAV Anti-Tank Modernization (LAV-ATM) Program will modernize the legacy turret and Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wire-guided (TOW) system in order to sustain the capability improve readiness ensure a high degree of commonality with USMC and U.S. Army systems and enable the LAR Battalion to employ the full range of current and emerging TOW munitions. The program will counter two converging obsolescence issues on the LAV-ATM platform: (1) the M901 Emerson turret is no longer in production and has been retired from the US Army inventory and (2) the M2203A3 TOW system is being replaced by the M41 SABER system in the USMC infantry and tank battalions leaving the LAR Battalion as the only unit using the legacy TOW system.Projects funded under the LAV Modification and Sustainment Program include numerous extremely important minor vehicle and weapon modifications such as focusing on safety and obsolescence issues support equipment and tools and other projects that increase LAV reliability and readiness while reducing operations and support costs. This funding is critical to offsetting support issues generated as a result of fleet operations and the advancing age of the family of Light Armored Vehicles respective of the extended service life through 2035 while maintaining acceptable levels of fleet readiness. The LAV Modification and Sustainment program also includes the Mobility and Obsolescence Upgrade kits consisting of Power Pack Driveline Steering Electrical System Suspension Hull Modifications and Ballistic Protection Upgrade Panels (BPUP) Kits.

Javelin has a high kill rate against a variety of targets at extended ranges under day/night battlefield obscurants adverse weather and multiple counter-measure conditions.  The system's soft launch feature permits firing from a fighting position or an enclosure.  Javelin uses a modular design to allow the system to evolve to meet changing threats and requirements via both software and hardware upgrades.  The system consists of a reusable Command Launch Unit (CLU) with a built-in-test (BIT) and a modular missile encased in a disposable launch tube assembly.  The system also includes training devices for tactical training and classroom training.  Javelin's fire-and-forget technology allows the gunner to fire and immediately take cover to move to another fighting position or to reload.   The Javelin provides enhanced lethality through the use of a tandem warhead which will defeat all known armor threats.  It is effective against both stationary and moving targets.  This system also provides defensive capability against attacking/hovering helicopters.  The performance improvements in Javelin Block I CLUs are: increased target identification range increased surveillance time with new battery and software management and external RS-170 interface for video output.  The performance improvements in current production Javelin Block I missiles are: increased probability of hit/kill at 2500m improved warhead lethality and reduced time of flight.

FY 2013 funding totals does not include the $8.0M appropriated via Below Threshold Reprogramming approved on 18 Nov 2013 and not reflected in ABIDES.  The USAF's Manned Reconnaissance Systems program includes seventeen RC-135 V/W RIVET JOINT three RC-135S COBRA BALL and two RC-135U COMBAT SENT mission aircraft.  The RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT is the majority variant that drives the Baseline integration and modification upgrade strategy for the entire RC-135 fleet.  Therefore the majority of the modification budget is directly related to the RIVET JOINT weapon system baseline strategy which subsequently spills over into the follow-on baseline strategies for RC-135S COBRA BALL and RC-135U COMBAT SENT weapon systems.A 2008 RC-135 Viability Assessement reported that despite the fleet average airframe age (44 years) and accumulated flight hours (38000) as of the end of FY 2007 the RC-135 should be able to continue to meet the user's needs by performing intended operations through at least 2040.  Viability was assessed based on underlying analyses of reliability maintainability performance corrosion fatigue architectural stability safety and availability.  The Viability Assessment also summarized that the RC-135 fleet has experienced significant improvements in reliability maintainability and availability since FY 2001.  The Program Manager attributes these improvements directly to the BIG SAFARI Baseline integration and modification upgrade strategy and synergies gained with long standing relationships with the RC-135 industry partners.     FY 2015 procurement funding efforts will concentrate on completing the conversion of the RIVET JOINT from a Baseline 9 to a Baseline 11 integration effort and the COBRA BALL and COMBAT SENT from a Baseline 4 to a Baseline 5 integration effort as per the programmed depot maintenance schedule (COBRA BALL and COMBAT SENT Baseline 5 configuration closely aligns with the RIVET JOINT Baseline 11 configuration).  The RIVET JOINT Baseline 11 integration effort and the Baseline 12 development efforts address the 2012 RC-135 Multi-Attribute Utility Assessment (MUA) that detailed operational effectivness cost and program analyses of the alternative weapon system configurations (e.g. C-37 KC-46 P-8 RQ-4).  The MUA determined that retaining and sustaining the RC-135V/W airframe offers the highest assessed weapons system utility (measured as a benefit of cost-to-risk ratio) over the 25 year assessment period.Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0305207F Manned Reconnaissance Systems.","Air Force","2015","RC - 135","54","DARP01","Millions","Millions","","0305207F","Where applicable justification for individual modifications is provided in the P-3A exhibits.","Aircraft Procurement Air Force","Each","Other Aircraft","Yearly","3010F","5","5","Modification of Inservice Aircraft","PB","2014-03","","","","","",

If appropriated the the Air Force intends to execute the funding currently loaded in Line #43 on the U-2 Mod in this P-1 Line (#42).The CIA established the Senior Year Program in 1955.  The program has evolved to include the airframes engines sensors cameras recorders data links life support systems test facilities and equipment.  The U-2S model airframes were constructed in the late 1980s with the last aircraft rolling off the assembly line in 1989.  The U-2S provides global reconnaissance signals intelligence (SIGINT) and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) 24 hours a day seven days a week in support of national and DoD worldwide missions.  The U-2 is currently deployed to forward operating locations (FOL) around the world.  In 2012 the Air Force decided to retain the U-2 weapon system capability instead of retiring it.  Prior to 2012 the U-2 weapon system fell under the "sunset clause" IAW Title 10 U.S.C 2244a Equipment Scheduled For Retirement Or Disposal: Limitation On Expenditures For Modifications stating that modifications to any aircraft (i.e. a given tail number) weapon or other item of equipment that the SECAF plans to retire or otherwise dispose of within five years after the date on which the modification would be completed are prohibited.  Therefore many required modifications to address diminishing manufacturing sources or vanishing vendor items were not accomplished.The U-2 Program will continue to address reliability maintainability sustainability and safety issues to ensure continued operations.  Due to the age of the existing fleet both diminishing manufacturing sources and vanishing vendor issues continue to drive modifications.  The Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) is an integral part of U-2 operations.  Therefore the U-2 must evolve and upgrade to keep pace with the DCGS.

The Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) System previously known as the Wideband Gapfiller Satellite System provides the DoD with high data rate military satellite communication (MILSATCOM) services in accordance with the Joint Space Management Board-approved MILSATCOM architecture (August 1996) the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-approved MILSATCOM Capstone Requirements Document (October 1997) and JROC-approved WGS Operational Requirements Document (May 2000).  This program was originally conceived to augment the near-term "bandwidth gap" in warfighter communications needs.  Dual-frequency WGS satellites augment then replace the DoD's Defense Satellite Communications System X-band service and augment one-way Global Broadcast Service Ka-band capabilities.  In addition WGS provides a high capacity two-way Ka-band service.WGS Block I consists of satellites 1-3.  These satellites were successfully launched on 10 October 2007 3 April 2009 and 5 December  2009 respectively.   WGS Block II consists of satellites 4-6.  Block II satellites are designed with slight modifications to better support the Airborne Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance mission.  Satellite 4 was successfully launched on 19 January 2012.

INCREMENT FIELDING: The AOC WS uses the product improvement approach to field upgraded system capabilities and for periodic Capital Equipment Replacement to keep the AOC WS interoperable supportable and compliant (e.g. certification and accreditation).  Increment Fielding will provide significant Joint Command and Control (C2) interoperability; and respond to the highest priority Combatant Commander (COCOM) interoperability problems including incorporating fixes to shortfalls in interactions with COCOM targeting support systems enhancing the effectiveness and capacity of the operational picture to respond to the proliferation of sensors and resultant data as well as address serious shortfalls in performance being experienced with older third party program deliveries.  Major subsystems have enhanced their security profile and this fielding will serve as a reaccreditation of the overall AOC Weapon System baseline.  The sustainment profile of the system is enhanced by introducing large scale virtualization and it provides an excellent transition point for the AOC WS modernization baseline.  Primary efforts in increment fielding include Capital Equipment Replacement and Recurring Events (REs).  	There are three distinct categories of AOCs:  Geographic Functional and assorted AOC Support Functions (Help Desk Formal Training Unit and Air Reserve Component sites).  While all sites start with the standardized 10.1 baseline each is specifically tailored to the needs of the associated COCOM or Functional Command.  Thus as no two AOCs are alike when a Capital Equipment Replacement or RE is accomplished each site is unique and requires its own specifically designed site-engineered fielding plan and associated hardware which drives differences in site specific (i.e. unit) costs.Funding may be used to alleviate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.     a.  CAPITAL EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT: FY15 funds will be used to keep the AOCs and their associated support sites up-to-date by replacing end-of-life/end of support components with solutions that will bridge between 10.1 and 10.2 (e.g. selective deployment of virtualization technologies and core radio package).  Virtualization technologies will help maximize system utilization by reducing costs and providing a more resilient infrastructure through the combining of multiple work environments into a single-point.  FY15 Capital Equipment Replacement will address numerous commercial end-of-life and DMS components that must be resolved.  Differences in site specific setup (due to variations between Combatant Commander or Functional Command needs) will drive differences in site specific requirements.  Therefore there is no meaningful way to measure quantities as the Capital Equipment Replacement of each site is significantly different.     b.  RECURRING EVENTS (RE): REs are regularly scheduled spiral upgrades to keep the AOC interoperable supportable and compliant (e.g. certification and accreditation).  They are normally comprised of hardware/software changes/updates and security patches.  Each RE is based on warfighter-validated needs and improvements to the AOC WS.  The spiral upgrades will vary in levels of complexity based on what system changes are required and therefore incorporated.  The level-of-complexity upgrades will impact the recurring costs of fielding the upgrades: each annual spiral upgrade is based on the number of systems affected what aging equipment needs to undergo Capital Equipment Replacement and the length of time necessary to accomplish the modification at each site.  FY15 will fund REs periodic maintenance upgrades emergency fixes and other activities (e.g. security fixes testing activities) potentially affecting some or all AOCs (Geographical/Functional/Support) and their associated support sites.  Additionally differences in site specific setup (due to variations between Combatant Commander or Functional Command needs) will drive differences in site specific requirements.  Therefore there is no meaningful way to measure quantities as the fielding of an RE to each site is significantly different.     c.  TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION: FY15 funds will procure and update the current baseline Descriptive List of Applicable Publications AOC unique systems (e.g. Boundary Security System) and technical documents for the AOC WS.  The funds will also be used to maintain the AOC WS technical documentation in a common location.     d.  TRAINING: Funds were used to provide initial cadre instruction for installation training related to operating and supporting the fielded AOC WS.  No FY15 funding requested.     e.  INTEGRATED AIR & MISSLE DEFENSE (IAMD): Operational C2 of IAMD is a project dedicated to increasing the operational capacity of the current AOC in counter air ballistic missile defense and intercontinental ballistic missile defense.  The purpose of the effort is to integrate existing systems and enhance dynamic planning re-planning capabilities.  No FY15 funding requested.     f.  FIELDING SPO SUPPORT: FY15 funds will be used to provide government oversight technical expertise and program office support associated with the fielding of AOC.     g.  TEST SUPPORT (46TS): FY15 funds will be used to provide government oversight and technical expertise associated with the testing of AOC.2.

Replacement aircraft do not increase program of record.   FY 2015 Airframe cost increases account for prime contractor's new Business System Modernization (BSM) accounting structure and increased internal research and development investment Pension Protection Act pension harmonization and higher medical forecasts and continued effects of large business base decline.  Due to airframe cost increases and USMC priorities the program's ramp rates and quantity profile were adjusted in FY 2015 through the FYDP which added one year of production.  Compared to President's Budget 2014 unit cost growth is a result of deferred aircraft to FY 2020.  Rate increases are due to varying quantities deferred each year.All GFE electronics previously harvested from UH-1N and AH-1W aircraft at no-cost were procured new at cost for all future lots beginning in FY 2013 Lot 10 due to unavailability of legacy aircraft.  Budgeted values for lots procured through FY 2012 reflect a cost avoidance from harvested components.

Refurbished T-700-401C engines are procured as budget constraints warrant and the H-60 B/F sundown schedule permits.  An additional determining factor for refurb engine procurement is the repair (refurb) contract ceiling for H-1 with General Electric Engine Services (GEES) currently at sixteen engines per year.  Due to funding constraints as a result of sequestration program reductions and airframe costs 16 UH-1Y refurbished engines were procured in FY 2013.FY 2015 AH-1Z Ancillary Equip and GFE Electronics changes due to net zero realignment of Target Sight System (TSS) between cost codes.

CANES is the technical and infrastructure consolidation of existing separately managed afloat networks including Integrated Shipboard Network Systems (ISNS) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System - Maritime Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Networks and Submarine Local Area Network. These legacy afloat network designs are currently End of Life and CANES will replace these unaffordable and obsolete networks.The fundamental goal of CANES is to bring Infrastructure and Platform as a Service (IaaS / PaaS) within which current and future iterations of Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination computing and storage capabilities will reside. CANES will provide complete infrastructure inclusive of hardware software processing storage and end user devices for Unclassified Coalition Secret and SCI for all basic network services (email web chat collaboration) to a wide variety of Navy surface combatants submarines Maritime Operations Centers Regional Network Operations and Security Centers (RNOSCs) and Aircraft. In addition ~36 hosted applications and systems inclusive of Command and Control Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Information Operations Logistics and Business domains require the CANES infrastructure to operate in the tactical environment. Integrating these applications and systems is accomplished through Application Integration the engineering process used to evaluate and validate compatibility between the CANES IaaS / PaaS and the Navy-validated applications systems and services that will utilize the CANES infrastructure and services. Specific programs such as Distributed Common Ground System - Navy Global Command and Control System - Maritime Naval Tactical Command Support System and Undersea Warfare Decision Support System are dependent on the CANES Common Computing Environment to field host and sustain their capability because they no longer provide their own hardware. To reduce risks associated with End of Life Legacy Systems awaiting CANES replacement in the out-years LI 2915 will support required emergent modernization to replace end of life components protect against new Information Assurance vulnerabilities and to remain compliant with DoD mandates.  CANES requires that Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) field prior to or concurrently with CANES due to architectural reliance between the two programs.CANES will develop updates on a rolling four year hardware baseline and a two year software baseline. Fielding of rolling baselines will occur every eight years for hardware and four years for software. CANES is based on the overarching concept of reducing the number of afloat networks and providing enhanced efficiency through a single engineering focus on integrated technical solutions. This will allow for streamlined acquisition contracting and test events and significant lifecycle efficiencies through consolidation of multiple current configuration management baselines logistics and training efforts into a unified support structure.Automated Digital Network System (ADNS): ADNS provides routing switching baseband configuration and monitoring capabilities for interconnecting naval and coalition enclaves worldwide. ADNS utilizes Commercial Off-the-Shelf/ Government Off-the-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) equipment and network protocols as specified by the joint technical architecture.  ADNS Increment I provides initial limited ship to shore IP connectivity separation of enclaves reuse of unused enclave bandwidth and ship to tactical shore IP connectivity.  ADNS Increment II provides additional capabilities of load balancing Radio Frequency (RF) restoral initial Quality of Service (QoS) to include application prioritization initial traffic management and enhancements designed to maximize use of "effective" available bandwidth for surface shore and airborne platforms.  ADNS Increment III will converge all Navy tactical voice video and data requirements into a converged IP data stream.  This includes SCIP-IWF for secure telephony over IP as well as Video Information Exchange System for secure video over IP. In addition the Increment III architecture will incorporate an IPv4/IPv6 dual stack and a cipher text security architecture to align to the Global Information Grid (GIG) in order to mesh Navy tactical surface subsurface and airborne platforms into a single IP environment with gateway functions to joint and coalition networks.

The MH-60S helicopter will be adapted for the AMCM mission in support of the development of an Organic Fleet AMCM program.  The equipment is divided into three categories -- minesweeping minehunting and  mine neutralization.  (1) Minesweeping is performed by mechanical or influence sweeps.  In mechanical sweeping the mine mooring is severed by the sweep gear allowing the mine to float to the surface where it is destroyed.  In influence sweeping a magnetic or acoustic field which simulates the magnetic/acoustic signature of a ship is introduced into the water.  This field causes the mine mechanism to actuate.  (2)  In minehunting the object is to actually locate and classify mine-like objects (usually by means of high resolution sonar). (3) Then neutralize mines using explosive devices.  AMCM squadrons currently have mechanical magnetic and acoustic sweeping capabilities and mine surveillance and marking capabilities.  Their mission is to locate classify identify and neutralize moored surface and bottom mines.[P5 / S0020 - MODIFICATION]: S0020 Modification and Product Improvements MOD/PRODFunds are provided for the modification and product improvements of Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) systems to accommodate replacement of subsystems/components because of safety maintainability reliability and obsolescence issues.

CACCTUS will also purchase software licenses and provide logistical support for communication device updates.  Decrease in FY15 funding for CACCTUS is a result of Marine Corps actions to balance the baseline.COMMAND and CONTROL TRAINING and EDUCATION CENTER of EXCELLENCE (C2 TECOE) will provide procurement funding support for equipment refresh and procurement of new training systems at the five (5) MAGTF Integrated Systems Training Centers (MISTCs).TRAINING SIMULATIONS SUPPORT (TSS) program encompasses the procurement of low density minor (low cost) MAGTF ground training equipment simulators and simulations. These devices such as Training-Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) Recognition of Combat Vehicles (ROC-V) climbing walls bleeding simulation kits Portable Infantry Target System (PITS) weapons models and mockups enhance basic occupational and combat skills across the wide spectrum of tactics techniques procedures and firearms and weapon proficiency.  TSS for the most part is for commercial/service non-developmental training devices used by Marine Corps Schools of Infantry Marine Corps Martial Arts Program Recruit Depots operating forces bases stations and support combat readiness. Funding provides capability for the USMC to conduct critical OCO training and participate as a full-fledged member of several Joint programs.   FY15 will provide support for a determined combination of minor low cost ground training equipment simulators and simulations.  The decrease in FY15 funding for TSS is a result of USMC adjustments to fiscal priorities.RANGE MODERNIZATION/TRANSFORMATION (RM/T): The decrease in funding from FY14 to FY15 is a result of USMC adjustments to fiscal priorities.Overall Training Devices Accomplishments: Baseline requests provide for seamless training environments that continue to enhance training capabilities modernize major USMC base and station live training ranges provide enhanced after action review with ground truth feedback realistic representation of opposing forces (OPFOR) and enhanced range and exercise command and control capabilities.  Without these training devices Marines will not be properly trained and prepared for combat when deployed to combat theaters.OCO: FY2013 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO): $3.602MRANGE MODERNIZATION/TRANSFORMATION (RM/T) provided funds for procurement actions to fulfill requirements for supporting pre-deployment training to better train our Marines for current combat operations.  Funds supported the procurement of Instrumented-Tactical Engagement Simulation System II (I-TESS II) training equipment for the following home-station commands: MCB Quantico Camp Lejeune and MCB Hawaii.","Procurement Marine Corps","Each","General Property","Yearly","1109N","3","6","Engineer and Other Equipment","PB","2014-03","A","","","","",

Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low-altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM).  Stinger employs an infrared (heat seeking)/ultraviolet seeker to guide to the target.  Stinger Block I has extensive infrared counter-countermeasure capabilities and can engage targets from any aspect to include head-on.  The missile utilizes a high-explosive hit-to-kill warhead.  Stinger can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles helicopters and UAS.  The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.  This effort funds the procurement and installation of the newly developed Proximity Fuze (Prox Fuze) into the Stinger Block I missile. The Prox Fuze will improve system effectiveness against the evolving UAS threat. Unmanned Aerial System Defense (UAS-D) is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff G–3/5/7 Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO–CIC) in memo dated 28 May 2013.The U.S. Army Stinger inventory is currently projected to fall below the FY15-19 Total Army Munitions Requirement (TAMR) dated 01 May 2013 of 4155 missiles by the end of 2018.

It employs the Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cell already resident in the BCT Headquarters as the command and control (C2) element; uses the existing radars in the Target Acquisition Platoon of the Fires Battalion as the Sense element; and adds enhanced C2 warning devices controllers and dedicated communications devices between the existing radars ADAM Cell and warning devices.  Integration of this equipment provides a Warn capability to the BCTs for detection of threat indirect fire (IDF) rounds and transmission of the detection data to the C2 element for correlation and determination of a predicted point of impact (POI).  Based on the POI the C2 then determines which warning nodes should send "Incoming" warning alarms and transmits this information to the appropriate warning nodes.  In addition to the representative RAM Warn capability fielded to each BCT Army Pre-positioned Stocks (APS) equipment sets are being procured to supplement the fielded capability based on mission needs.  Timely warning will enable those BCT personnel in the hazard area of an inbound IDF threat to seek cover or a prone position prior to impact thus reducing casualties.  The Capability Production Document (CPD) was approved in August 2010 and an update was approved in May 2012 to reflect the name change to RAM Warn.  An initial operational test (IOT) was conducted during November 2012 as part of Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) 13.1 and the RAM Warn Milestone Decision Authority Program Executive Officer Missiles and Space (PEO MS) approved a Milestone C Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision on 19 December 2012.  The Full Rate Production (FRP) decision is scheduled for early 3QFY14.Near-term directed enhancements to the C-RAM system-of-systems (SoS) capability include use of Army tactical communications rather than commercial systems; integration of Warn functionality into the command and control (C2) workstation to reduce complexity and footprint; integration with Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS) for enhanced situational awareness combat identification and response options; and dynamic clearance of unplanned fires (DCUF) in conjunction with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) for rapid and enhanced response.The C-RAM Program Directorate was the Materiel Developer for the Accelerated Improved Intercept Initiative (AI3) a rapid development effort to provide an Intercept capability to defeat stressing threats which culminated in a successful 4QFY13 Live Fire test.Existing C-RAM Intercept assets (i.e. Land-based Phalanx Weapon System [LPWS]) have undergone reset and are currently being fielded to the first of two Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC)/Avenger composite Battalions (5-5 Air Defense Artillery (ADA)).  The LPWS has completed a Limited User Test (LUT).
