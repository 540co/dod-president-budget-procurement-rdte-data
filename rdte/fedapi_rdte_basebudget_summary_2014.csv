On 17 September 2009 the President announced an overarching plan to provide regional missile defense to U.S. deployed forces allies and partners in Europe called the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA). The United States will also pursue phased adaptive approaches in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East by building on current efforts. The PAA envisions tailoring U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities to specific theater needs to enhance integrated regional missile defenses to protect defended assets against medium intermediate and ultimately intercontinental range ballistic missiles. Within this policy a European PAA specifically addresses a timeline to deploy a mix of afloat and land-based BMD capabilities. Aegis Ashore represents one of these land-based capabilities. Phase I of EPAA (completed December 2011): Focuses on the protection against short and medium-range ballistic missiles. As part of phase I which is already underway the United States has deployed multi-mission Aegis ships with BMD capability and the SM-3 Block IA missile. Phase I also included establishing separate forward-based AN/TPY-2 radar in Turkey to provide a cue to multi-mission Aegis ships with BMD capability and to future Aegis Ashore sites for launch on remote engagements. Phase II of EPAA (2015): Deploys the first land-based BMD configuration (Aegis Ashore) in Romania and deploys the SM-3 Block IB on land at the Aegis Ashore site and at sea on multi-mission Aegis ships with BMD capability. Phase III of EPAA (2018): Deploys a second land based Aegis Ashore in Poland and introduces an upgraded Standard Missile the SM-3 Block IIA. This missile brings improved coverage against medium and intermediate range ballistic threats and extends coverage to the bulk of the European continent. Aegis Ashore is a key component of Phases II and III in the European PAA and will provide Aegis Missile Defense capability against short and medium range ballistic missiles in an ashore configuration. It will be similar to the Aegis At-Sea BMD capability inherent in the DDG-113 series of the Arleigh Burke Class Destroyers to facilitate training and logistical support by the lead service Navy. Aegis Ashore essentially re-hosts the required BMD components of a Navy Destroyer in an ashore configuration to include SPY RADAR Vertical Launch System computing infrastructure Command Control Communications Computers and Intelligence (C4I) systems and operator consoles. It will provide sophisticated engagement strategies. Aegis Ashore can adapt to the threat and can be deployed/redeployed worldwide to areas needed to provide persistent coverage for the Geographic Combatant Commanders. The initial Aegis Ashore Missile Defense System (AAMDS) will be deployed to Romania in FY 2015. A second AAMDS will be deployed to Poland in FY 2018 as part of the European Phased Adaptive Approach.Missile Defense Agency (MDA) approved the acquisition strategy in FY 2010.

Aegis BMD provides a forward-deployable mobile capability to detect and track Ballistic Missiles of all ranges and the ability to destroy Short-Range Ballistic Missiles (SRBM) Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles (MRBM) and Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBM) in the midcourse phase of flight and Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) in early phases of flight. Upgrades to both the Aegis BMD Weapon System and the STANDARD MISSILE-3 (SM-3) configurations evolve Aegis BMD to provide effective supportable defensive capability against more difficult threats. Beginning in 2006 Aegis BMD and the Japanese Ministry of Defense (JMOD) have undertaken an SM-3 Cooperative Development (SCD) program. The objective of the SCD project is the development and initial at-sea flight test of the SM-3 Blk IIA missile and preparation for subsequent production decisions. Key technology improvements planned for the SM-3 Block IIA missile include an increase in velocity and an increase in range provided by a 21-inch diameter rocket motor propulsion stack more than doubled seeker sensitivity and more than three times divert capability incorporated in an advanced kinetic warhead. Key component technologies to be developed include but are not limited to: lightweight nosecone advanced kinetic warhead 21-inch second stage rocket motor and 21-inch third stage rocket motor. Technology risk reduction will be conducted to reduce key component development risk. The U.S. and Japan will bear equitable burden to conduct the Project. The assignment of work documented in the U.S./Japan Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) SCD Annex represents an equitable sharing of work.

The keys to a secure space environment are situational awareness to detect and characterize potential threats a proliferation of assets to provide robustness against attack ready access to space and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit assets.  Ready access to space requires the delivery of defensive systems replenishment supplies to orbit and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities.  An infrastructure to service the mission spacecraft allows defensive actions to be taken without limiting mission lifetime.  In addition developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space.Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems space-derived information and services with terrestrial users.  Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability survivability and situational awareness; enabling concepts include novel propulsion/propellants unique manufacturing processes; precision control of multi-payload systems and payload isolation and pointing systems.","","","","","R2Long",

These range from improvised devices constructed from commercially available electronic and industrial components to dedicated military devices that could be used in ways that diminish our technological advantage in conflicts with nation-states.  The surprisingly fast appearance of these threats is accelerating and is now happening faster than the requirements and acquisition process can respond.The use of asymmetric devices is well understood by terrorists and nation-states alike.  Using man portable air defense systems mortars and improvised explosive devices actuated by electronics components terrorists have attacked both air and ground forces and pose a threat in any region due to their portability.  Unmanned aircraft systems also strongly enabled by electronics components are proliferating and pose a threat both as a military capability and as a potential terrorist weapons delivery mechanism.  Technological surprise and speed of appearance are two asymmetries that highlight the need to rapidly develop and field Electronic Warfare Information Operations and Asymmetric Warfare capabilities capable of neutralizing such threats in ways that are both fiscally and temporally responsive.  This program element investigates means to rapidly mitigate asymmetric threats by integrating advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in innovative ways and rapidly demonstrating new technological capabilities to augment and/or reduce risk when inserted into service programs of record.  Efforts will also look for methods to employ asymmetric principles against our adversaries.Beginning in FY 2014 the Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) project reorganized to be in better alignment with Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering electronic warfare research priorities.  Particularly JEAT establishes three pillars that will support the JEAT approach to innovation:  1) experimentation 2) advanced concepts development/demonstration and 3) innovative technology exploration.  The overarching JEAT philosophy is to be adaptive and to help lead the pace of rapid electronic systems development and the evolving threat picture.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

The diverse and complex Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) – nuclear biological and chemical threats – mission space requires an integrated approach towards capability development. Capability development must be based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The broad CWMD military strategic objectives and mission areas encompass many nontraditional capabilities for the Warfighter and CWMD is not an isolated mission set unique to DoD – it is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense. Accordingly developing an overall CWMD capability should and must leverage complementary capabilities through integration and synchronization. A global CWMD situational awareness capability will be established and deployed worldwide via current communications systems and common operating pictures in support of this mission.  This program will incorporate portfolio management tools and comprehensive analyses to enable a balanced and integrated CWMD systems portfolio an optimized CWMD force structure and the integration with and utilization of existing military assets to fill intelligence sensor and reconnaissance gaps in CWMD.This program also responds to the strategic needs outlined in the President's initiative stated in his April 2009 speech in Prague; the US Combatant Commands integrated priorities and requirements; the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review; and the FY12-16 Defense Planning and Programming Guidance by providing improved timeliness and relevance through modernizing CWMD support to the Combatant Commands Office of the Secretary of Defense Joint Staff Intelligence Community (IC) and other U.S. Government agencies as required.

Starting in FY2013 the funding in PE 0604771D8Z JTIDS associated with communications and information networks architecture strategy and policy; and frequency spectrum analysis and management was transferred to this PE (PE 0305199D8Z Net Centricity) and aligned under the office of the DoD Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO).Funds will be used to provide technical systems engineering and capability management oversight of programs projects and activities to maximize the Department’s return on investment in information technology resources and affect a comprehensive approach for assessing and procuring critical information systems from initial design through development to capability delivery in support of improved systems performance and military operations. Emphasis is placed on the information transport information assurance net and spectrum management command and control (C2) applications and services information sharing capabilities and enterprise services activities focused on the development integration testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of command control communication computing network and Information Infrastructure (C4&II) capabilities and programs.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development.       This project provides the resources necessary to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytic methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent capabilities across all layers (ground air space) of the joint information environment architecture to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity and field effective capabilities more rapidly and efficiently as an enabler for C4&II capabilities applications and services.  Resources are required to transform current networks into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse joint information environment that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer computing networks and mission application capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected intermittent and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments modeling and simulation and analysis of the Joint space communications layer Joint aerial network layer contested communications on the move Position Navigation and Timing (PNT) and C2 mission application capabilities.  These funds develop the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground air and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance capabilities with other joint information environment capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).       In addition funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes initiating the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators engineers and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint /Allied units prior to system fielding or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the Global Information Grid (GIG) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future Tactical Data Link (TDL) capabilities. These joint standards protocols and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDL capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled Global Information Grid (GIG) initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies.","","Continuing","Continuing","","R2Long",

The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and acquisition reform initiatives call for top down national security strategy-driven capabilities-based planning. Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01 promulgate capabilities-based requirements and acquisition processes. The JSAD program enables collaborative efforts to achieve these goals. These efforts include providing support to conduct warfighting capability-based analysis; performing assessments of joint capability areas and joint integrating concepts; developing and supporting needed sets of system and system-related data; creating integrated roadmaps to support acquisition investment decisions; and performing assessments of major defense acquisition programs and major automated information systems in a capability area context.  Activities in the JSAD project are divided into three areas:  (1) capability-based analysis; (2) roadmaps; and (3) support tools and guidance. Capability-based analysis provides analysis of the different technology functionality and integration impacts of systems on warfighting capability.  Acquisition roadmaps guide systems development and associated investment plans.  JSAD support tools and guidance initiatives develop systems data and tools exploit modeling and simulation and architecture efforts to improve DoDs overall assessment capability.  These efforts guide the development and improve the testing and fielding of integrated systems of systems in order to achieve Joint mission capabilities.  The QDR also lays out the need for an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches. This means:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning  programming budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance management and execution levels.  To accomplish this direction there needs to be a focused  goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from systems acquisition to capabilities-based portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This  program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above in order to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals.  The program is broken up into two focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives) and consolidates work previously performed under various other Program Elements.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

The Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service Defense and other government agencies T&E needs maximize opportunities for joint efforts and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities.  CTEIP focuses investments on projects that will have high productivity returns on investment.  Projects under the CTEIP Program Element (PE) support two basic tasks: investments to improve the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Project (REP)).JIM projects address critically needed T&E investments in the major functional areas of: air combat; armament and munitions; Command Control Communication Computer and Intelligence (C4I) and networks; common range instrumentation; electronic combat; land combat; sea combat; space combat; threat simulators; and test environments.  Examples of project subject matter include: highly accurate time-space-position information network enhanced telemetry miniaturized flight safety systems realistic urban test environments ground testing for manned and unmanned aerial platforms and satellites and end-to-end testing of infrared countermeasure and electronic warfare systems.  CTEIP continues as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and links between test and training ranges.CTEIP has provided special focus to institutionalize the use of modeling and simulation (M&S) as a practical test tool; to link ranges through internetting to enhance inter-range and inter-Service cooperation and resource sharing; and to ensure development and acquisition of common instrumentation necessary for a more efficient test infrastructure.Analyses of alternative solutions are conducted for each investment project to validate T&E requirements to define integrated support systems and to determine overall cost effectiveness of the proposed test investments.  The use of Department of Defense (DoD)-wide processes for requirement validation prioritization and risk assessment ensures an effective test resource investment program.The REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major high priority defense acquisition programs.  These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness short timelines between system design maturity and scheduled OT and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) or system-of-systems testing.  Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning and ensures their availability and legacy for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.This Research Category 6.4 PE includes special studies analyses and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure and supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD component weapon system test requirements.","","Continuing","Continuing","","R2Long",

DTIC a DoD field activity along with its Information Analysis Centers (IACs) is the DoD designated source for DoD-funded scientific technical engineering and business-related information.With a modest funding level DTIC serves as an efficiency enabler by developing and implementing products and services supporting collaboration and communication within the Department’s Scientific and Technical (S&T) community.  Leaning on mature low-risk and commercially available technologies DTIC delivers secure and effective products to its customers.  In this manner DTIC’s collaborative products are essential to linking DoD’s dispersed laboratories and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) together.  In today’s fiscal environment the Department cannot afford to conduct business as usual.  DTIC’s existing and future suite of products provide the potential for enabling DoD customers to develop answers to complex problems--for less money--by providing the opportunity to elimination of unnecessary research efforts and reducing the traditional reliance on conferences training and travel as a means of connecting with professional colleagues.Building on progress from previous investments the FY 2014 budget request supports four major thrust areas within DTIC:  1) modernize collaborative tools and innovative applications 2) enhance the effectiveness of DTIC’s library collection and content 3) continued restructuring of the Information Analysis Center (IAC) Program and 4) recast the organization’s workforce.   In this budget program DTIC resources are focused on the following efforts:1.  DTIC is committed to accelerating the flow and dissemination of information delivering professional and organizational networking tools for use within DoD and between business partners in industry and academia.  Since the 2008 advent of DoDTechipedia DTIC’s collaborative tools enable rapid customer response to current and emerging threats across the defense enterprise and help identify solutions to complex technology challenges.  Once fully implemented these tools will offer users visualization analysis and data mining functionality all in a secure environment.  These evolving DTIC capabilities are essential to the S&T and RDT&E communities and will play a critical role in finding better faster and cheaper solutions.  A number of key tools are highlighted below:    - A recent venture for DTIC is the DoD Research and Engineering (R&E) Portal (DoDTechSpace) a secure professional networking tool for the DoD enterprise.  The tool offers a navigator through which DTIC’s customers can collaborate share find and post information.  A secure application it connects the defense research and engineering community DoD laboratories warfighters and other DoD agencies while providing current and next generation employees and researchers with advanced Web 2.0 tools.  A related tool DoDTechipedia one of DoD’s first scientific and technical wikis was launched by DTIC in 2008.  The tool provides an encyclopedia-like resource of science and technology information for DoD and federal government employees.- The Defense Innovation Marketplace (or “the Marketplace”) was launched in 2011 as an online public and non-public/limited resource for DoD and industry to exchange information.  Creation of this site was a direct result of the Department’s “Better Buying Power” initiative which calls for the DoD to deliver better value to the taxpayer and warfighter by improving the way it was doing business.  The Marketplace includes a collaborative tool that accepts industry Independent Research & Development (IR&D) project summaries to improve DoD awareness of current industry efforts and identify technology gaps.  2.  The transformation of DTIC from a static repository of information to an agile delivery agent of dynamic content; i.e. real-time user supplied collaborative information.  This effort seeks to enhance DTIC’s authoritative data.  Recent actions involve improving and expanding both the access and content available on the SIPRNET.  Improving content and the quality of information directly supports better decision-making envisioned in the Department’s Better Buying Power (BBP) initiative.  DTIC is active in working to federate access to Scientific and Technical Information (STI) content from government industry and academic sources. 3.  The Information Analysis Center (IAC) Program Office at DTIC provides core funding management and oversight of the IACs. The IACs are chartered by DoD to collect analyze and disseminate worldwide scientific and technical information in specialized fields.  At present the IAC program is undergoing a multi-year restructuring from ten IACs to three in order to reduce customer costs and reflect new DoD technical interest areas.  The new structure will focus on three technology groupings to include Cyber Security and Information Systems Homeland Defense and Security and Defense Systems.  In concert with the Department’s Better Buying Power initiative new multi-award contracts are being put into place improving competition small-business presence and reducing government costs.  Once complete the restructured IAC Program will be in an even better position to improve affordability productivity and standardization within defense acquisition programs. 4.  DTIC is in the midst of a multi-year process of transforming its workforce.  The ongoing effort is seeking through attrition to shift staff expertise and skill sets from an emphasis on traditional librarian services to one that is more technology-savvy.  Through this new staffing model the organization is hiring talent to take advantage of available technologies to collect organize model analyze and share information faster and more cheaply.  Concurrently DTIC is bolstering program management expertise to optimize business processes and operations.  In this vein DTIC is actively building an expanding cadre of experts in Information Technology Information Sciences and Architecture and Acquisition.This Program Element (PE) supports DTIC mission operations to include four core integrated functions: •	Collaboration•	Research Support & Library Repository •	Web Services & Hosting•	Information Analysis Centers (IACs) These functions are addressed in the R-2A sections of this document.Mission funding provides for salaries and benefits of government civilian personnel assigned to DTIC; training professional development and travel for DTIC personnel; support agreements for Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) facility-related services; Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) financial activities and Human Resource (HR) services; Defense Information Services Agency (DISA) communications support; annual maintenance and licensing requirements; supplies equipment Hardware/Software; and support contracts for Information Technology services Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI) system integration and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliance efforts.

The 3DELRR will respond to the operational need to detect and report highly maneuverable small radar cross section targets to enable battlefield awareness while at the same time mitigating the reliability maintainability and sustainability issues plaguing the AN/TPS-75 radar system.  The 3DELRR will provide air controllers with a precise real-time air picture of sufficient quality to conduct close control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions.  It will replace the aging USAF AN/TPS-75 radar system as the AN/TPS-75 is incapable of detecting some current and emerging threats.  In addition as the AN/TPS-75 is reaching the end of its service life it is more difficult and costly to maintain.  The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is considering 3DELRR as a potential replacement for the AN/TPS-59 at the end of its service life to support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Commander through the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS).  3DELRR will address system sustainability transportability and operational availability shortfalls while providing long-range surveillance detection and tracking of Air Breathing Targets (ABTs) and potentially Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBMs).  This capability will support the Air Force's contribution to the primary roles of the Airspace Control Authority (ACA) and the Area Air Defense Commander (AADC) and enhance the USAF contributions to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) mission area. 3DELRR will contribute to the Air Force's critically important role in the United States Govenment/DOD efforts to build partnership capacity via the Defense Exportability Features (DEF) pilot program.  This new radar will provide the USAF Control and Reporting Center (CRC) and if purchased by the USMC the Composite Tracking Network (CTN) with real-time data to display air activity.

As designed the SPP employs a cooperative objective and enterprise-level approach to implement the capabilities plans and options to deter defend against and if necessary defeat efforts to interfere with or attack U.S. or allied space systems in an increasingly constrained and hostile environment.  While the AF and National Reconnaissance Organization (NRO) each contribute to their portion of the SPP mission from separate funding sources the SPP continues to focus both partners on a common objective and remains the critical element that leverages the best efforts of the DoD and Intelligence Community (IC) to proactively plan for and respond to threats against a majority of the National Space Enterprise.  Within this Program Element the SPP is focused on targeted objectives to support Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) AF and DoD mission priorities and in tandem carry out the broader joint SPP mission.  This unique mission provides an ongoing and necessary core protection competency that advances specific projects/activities (including cyber) to deliver comprehensive economical and actionable solutions for both programmatic and operational domains.  SPP alternatives and solutions are leveraged to inform/impact budget and program formulation; develop system or segment requirements; provide technical performance parameters to programs; improve Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) and Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) for operational systems; and identify areas that need additional collection and/or analysis by the IC.  Based on recommendations from the Assessment of National Space Control Capabilities study and the effectiveness of the SPP to date the DoD is further expanding the current posture in FY14 to better meet the evolving threat and provide enduring support to the entire NSS Enterprise.  The FY14 request increases the resources required to operate and execute an enhanced synchronized and effective space protection effort for the Nation; fulfilling a unique objective and independent role that considers comprehensive enterprise-level space and non-space material and non-material solutions across NSS systems and architectures (cross-cutting cross-domain and integrated measures/recommendations).  The FY14 request accelerates the timeline to accomplish threat mitigation projects in key mission areas and expands program responsibilities to represent the whole of government in developing reviewing and integrating protection-specific measures into policy requirements acquisitions and operations.  Through this enhancement the DoD and IC are able to fully address offensive and defensive space control capabilities on an enduring basis; looking to the SPP as the center of excellence and analytical focal point for options and strategies (materiel non-materiel cross-Title cross-domain) leading to a more resilient and effective NSS Enterprise.  The FY14 request also preserves the skill-set knowledge base and multi-organizational construct required to remain ahead of the threat and to evolve programmatic direction and operational CONOPS across multiple orbital regimes in a way that minimizes duplication and inefficiency.  To that end the SPP will provide a central focus for unifying and integrating Title 10/50 roles and responsibilities (AF and NRO efforts) to deliver research analysis studies tools and capabilities necessary to identify prioritize develop and implement the most effective and economical solutions to preserve NSS capabilities. As part of the ongoing role of the program to develop and implement (when appropriate) protection solutions for the Nation the FY14 request also includes $10M in support of an incremental project to upgrade the ground-based software used to plan Satellite Communications (SATCOM) operations.  The SPP will manage this project and deliver on a tactically-responsive upgrade that is operationally integrated through the wideband architecture by FY17.  The majority of the remaining increase in FY14 request will be used to initiate stategic protection efforts focusing on establishing integrated activities supporting space survivability and protection objectives across policy requirements threat analysis and architecture evaluation regimes.This program is in Budget Activity 4 Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.","","Continuing","Continuing","","R2Long",

A number of Department of Defense (DoD) Government Accountability Office and industry studies point to a need for more disciplined early-phase systems engineering and pre-systems acquisition planning to produce the detailed acquisition information that previously did not surface until after the initiation of a program.  The RAM program element (PE) funds early systems engineering and pre-acquisition planning and analysis activities such as requirements analysis concept development acquisition strategy development cost analysis modeling and simulation and costs associated with these activities to include analytical tools and travel.  This comprehensive approach supports acquisition courses of action to initiate high-confidence acquisition programs.  Specific efforts are determined each year by requests submitted from Air Force Major Commands and subsequently prioritized and approved by the Air Force Development Planning Governance Structure.  This effort is in Budget Activity 4 Advanced Component Development and Prototypes since it involves the planning and analyses necessary to develop system specific efforts that help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use.For FY 2014 and out Space and Non-Space RAM PE activities were combined into a single Development Planning project BPAC 645349","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

The 3DELRR will respond to the operational need to detect and report highly maneuverable small radar cross section targets to enable battlefield awareness while at the same time mitigating the reliability maintainability and sustainability issues plaguing the AN/TPS-75 radar system.  The 3DELRR will provide air controllers with a precise real-time air picture of sufficient quality to conduct close control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions.  It will replace the aging USAF AN/TPS-75 radar system as the AN/TPS-75 is incapable of detecting some current and emerging threats.  In addition as the AN/TPS-75 is reaching the end of its service life it is more difficult and costly to maintain.  The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is considering 3DELRR as a potential replacement for the AN/TPS-59 at the end of its service life to support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Commander through the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS).  3DELRR will address system sustainability transportability and operational availability shortfalls while providing long-range surveillance detection and tracking of Air Breathing Targets (ABTs) and potentially Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBMs).  This capability will support the Air Force's contribution to the primary roles of the Airspace Control Authority (ACA) and the Area Air Defense Commander (AADC) and enhance the USAF contributions to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) mission area. This new radar will provide the USAF Control and Reporting Center (CRC) and if purchased by the USMC the Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC) with real-time data to display air activity.  The Pre-Engineering & Manufacturing Development (Pre-EMD) efforts of the 3DELRR Program begin in FY12 and continue through FY13.  Acquisition activities during this Pre-EMD period include but are not limited to: full and open source selection to award up to three competing contracts; requirements refinement; completion of the preliminary design development; continued software and hardware subsystem-level development; modeling and simulation to support the system development; implementation of mitigation techniques to combat existing and emerging system threats (including cyber warfare) test planning and implementation of the program protection plan. A Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Capability Demonstration C Event will be conducted during this timeframe to ensure the program is successful in the development of a preliminary system design.  Activities will also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning as well as finalization of Milestone (MS) B documentation and preparation for a MS B review.This program is in Budget Activity 4 Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.","0.000","Continuing","Continuing","393","R2Long",

Joint Tactical Radio Systems (JTRS) will link the power of the Global Information Grid (GIG) to the warfighter in applying fire effects and achieving overall battlefield superiority. By developing and implementing an open architecture of cutting-edge radio waveform technology multiple radio types (e.g. handheld manpack ground-mobile airborne etc.) are now capable of communicating with one another. JTRS radios are intended to interoperate with existing radio systems and improve Joint warfighting through a series of new joint networking waveforms enabling communication via voice data and video over mobile adhoc internet protocol (IP) based networks. Each radio will operate as a node in the network to ensure secure wireless communication and networking services for airborne mobile and fixed forces. These goals extend to U.S. allies Joint and Coalition partners and in time disaster response personnel. JTRS will make the Air Force more effective in Joint warfighting through a series of new joint networking waveforms. These waveforms included the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) which provides next generation SATCOM beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) communications as well as the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) which provide interoperability with Army ground forces from the brigade level down to the dismounted soldier. Together these waveforms enable Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) and other Joint missions. The JTRS program is built around an open Software Communications Architecture (SCA) allowing common software waveform applications to be implemented across the family of radios to provide joint-service allied and coalition interoperability.

The employment of this system interdicts our adversary's use of the electronic battlespace and is a key active component in the information battlespace and prosecution of overseas contingency operations.  EC-130H COMPASS CALL's sophisticated electronic combat system is capable of surgical denial or disruption of adversary radio frequency (RF) communications systems and sensors.  The system was fielded in 1983 and to date has evolved through the Block 35/Baseline 1 configuration.  Due to the rapid advances in electronic attack technology the EC-130H COMPASS CALL was designed to be easily modified and must continue to modernize and evolve to keep pace with adversary tactics and emerging technologies.  Continuous system development is required to maintain battlespace superiority.  The EC-130H COMPASS CALL program employs an incremental development and fielding strategy that puts capability into the warfighters hands as soon as practical and ensures each iteration of the weapon system is effective against the highest priority threats.  To sustain that process requires a steady stream of system development funds.  Development funds are required to accomplish subsystem additions and improvements such as the digital signal analysis and exciter subsystem (AXE) the Special Purpose Emitter Array (SPEAR) Integrated Modern Communication Receiver the Human-to-Machine Interface (HMI) network centric operations phased array transmit and receive apertures and other classified hardware and software developments necessary to counter military and commercial communications evolutions command and control operations enhancements and new/emerging sensor developments.

Historically aircraft systems change missions tactics and environments (including new fuels) to meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the engines through actual use and Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these field problems.  Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types/maturity of engines not by the total engine quantity.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory engines operational.  Engine CIP through "Lead the Fleet" operational use and accelerated mission testing identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts.  Engine CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when manufacturers incorporate Engine CIP improvements into production engines.  Engine CIP ensures continued improvements in engine R&M which reduce out year support costs.  Historically R&M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&M) and spares costs.  Without Engine CIP out year support funding would have to be significantly increased.

The Project AIR FORCE (PAF) research agenda is focused primarily on mid to long-term problems; in addition PAF provides quick response assistance for senior Air Force officials on high priority near term issues. Within these areas PAF addresses difficult and complex far-reaching and inter-related questions linked to future strategies approaches and policies in order to enhance Air Force senior leadership's deliberations and decisionmaking on major issues. The Air Force Steering Group chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff reviews monitors and approves PAF annual research efforts. Each project is initiated processed and approved IAW PAF Sponsoring Agreement which requires General Officer (or SES equivalent) sponsorship and involvement on a continuing basis.  PAF is organized in four primary research program areas: strategy and doctrine; force modernization employment; manpower personnel and training; and resource management. Integrative research projects are also conducted at the division level with direct support provided through the most applicable program. Research programs address organizational crosscutting issues as defined by specific research themes approved by the Air Force Steering Group. These research themes encompass a wide spectrum of topics including external challenges to national security; terrorism and homeland defense; joint and coalition operations; integrated roadmap for ISR capabilities; enhancing tailoring and reducing infrastructure to meet new force requirements; potential changes to the Active/Reserve/National Guard/Civilian/Contractor manpower mix; and improved weapon system costing.    The research program will continue to build upon research foundations examining the evolving security environment emerging threats national and military strategy transformation approaches including investment strategies to provide capabilities within changing Defense budgets operational concepts to meet evolving and increasingly joint missions exploiting advanced technologies increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of combat support and developing the total force (Active/Reserve/National Guard/Civilian/Contractor).  These efforts will continue to inform and support the senior Air Force leadership regarding personnel management and training; improving logistical efficiencies and force sustainment; ongoing conflicts and joint operations; force structure capabilities limitations and operational concepts; and making force structure tradeoffs within resource constraints to meet future national security and Air Force needs.  Future research will build upon earlier work to continue to help the Air Force to rapidly and appropriately adapt to the changing world environment and emerging threats; continue to modernize and employ its force structure to provide capabilities within changing DoD budgets; assess lessons learned from recent and ongoing conflicts; develop and utilize its total force; and enhance the support of our aerospace forces ranging from sustainment of the force structure to agile combat support.  PAF research spans functional and organizational boundaries and is managed in a manner to facilitate independence and freedom from organizational bias thereby providing perspectives and insights to senior Air Force leaders free from parochial influences not necessarily in the best interest of the Air Force at large. Benefits of independent non-Department of Defense analysis of complex present day and emerging issues are shared beyond the immediacy of the Air Force.  PAF study results are given wide dissemination within the DOD on a routine basis and are deposited with the Defense Technical Information Center available to a broad range of qualified government and commercial-sector individuals and activities.This program is in Budget Activity 6 RDT&E Management and Support because this budget activity includes research development and test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the operations required for general research development test and evaluation.","","Continuing","Continuing","","R2Long",

The PMOU went into effect in Sept 2009 when fifteen nations including the United States financially committed for procurement and delivery of the NATO Commander's number one priority to the war fighter.  Canada withdrew in August 2011 leaving 14 participating nations.  In FY2012 OSD transferred the NATO AGS project to the USAF for management and execution. The NATO AGS project funds the U.S. share of the cost for NATO to acquire an air-to-ground ground surveillance capability improvements to the radar and the U.S. support of NATO AGS-related activities. Operations and continuing support will be funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package funded within the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). The AGS system will be a NATO-owned and operated airborne ground surveillance capability that provides continuous wide area surveillance information in all weather conditions for use at the strategic operational and tactical levels of command. Interoperable with other national assets AGS will provide NATO decision makers with near real time continuous information and situational awareness concerning friendly neutral and opposing ground forces to support mission planning and execution including force protection and targeting. The NATO AGS Program includes an air segment consisting of a five (5) NATO-developed air vehicles using elements of the USN Triton (previously Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS)) command and control architecture and the U.S. Radar Technology Insertion Program (RTIP) radar; a unique configuration to allow export of system; a ground segment for data exploitation and distribution that consists of fixed-based site and transportable/mobile ground stations; establishment and operation of a management organization; development of operations and support concepts; and definition and establishment of an initial support capability.  As part of the U.S. government agreement with NATO AGS Management Agency (NAGSMA) the U.S. will integrate Maritime Moving Target and Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar capability into the RTIP radar for NATO AGS. This design and development includes correcting deficiencies flight testing on the modes and system level performance validation. The system level configuration changes include a unique configuration to allow for export of the system. (Additional details are classified and available on a need-to-know basis.)Deliveries are planned for 2016-2017. The follow-on sustainment and operations will be supported by all 28 NATO nations through their contributions of funding to the program. Mission elements will support 2 orbits. The main operating base (MOB) air vehicles and mission C2 will be in Naval Air Station Sigonella Italy. Exploitation at MOB will be developed by Selex. EADS and Selex will develop the transportable and mobile general ground stations.  The program managed by the NAGSMA is composed of design development and demonstration as well as initial in-service support (IISS). While the current program includes IISS the current Direct Commercial Sale (DCS) contract with Northrop Grumman does not include these tasks.The DCS contract between Northrop Grumman and NAGSMA was signed on 20 May 2012.

Prior to FY13 these efforts were executed within PE0305208F Distributed Common Ground System. Beginning in FY13 the AF DCGS programs and Support to DCGS Enterprise programs are reported separately for improved visibility.The DCGS Family of Systems including AF DCGS was directed to migrate to a net-centric DoD ISR enterprise enabling the Services to operate and share intelligence products more effectively in a Joint environment.  All Services must pursue a common path based on a set of common enterprise services consistent with the Department's net-centric vision while maintaining flexibility to support the full range of the warfighter missions.  Specifically the DoD charged the Air Force to lead the development upgrade integration and test of common DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) enterprise services.  The DIB is a set of enterprise standards and services that enable interoperability and component reuse.  All the Military Services are mandated to incorporate the DIB interoperability standards and commit to the DIB architecture as the migration path to common DCGS enterprise services. The Distributed Common Ground Systems-Imagery (DCGS-I) Testbed is an integration and test environment used by the Services and Agency program offices to conduct integration of DCGS components and test interoperability interfaces with new sensors applications and net- centric operations.  This testbed also supports the integration and testing of DoD DCGS components prior to introduction into the operational environment.  Upgrades to the DCGS-I Testbed will ensure it stays current with DCGS standards and architecture.  The AF-sponsored DIB System Program Office also participates in the development testing and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint allied and coalition interoperability. The Common Imagery Processor (CIP) project develops a common imagery sensor processing capability within the DCGS-I architecture.  The imagery processor accepts airborne imagery data processes it into an exploitable format and provides it to other elements within the weapon system and/or the DCGS Enterprise. Current efforts are transitioning the legacy imagery processor from a hardware/software capability to a virtual software capability improving enterprise processing capabilities.   Efforts continue to keep the capability on track to handle the current sensors. Activities also include testing development and demonstrations integrating updated and new/emerging sensors into the DCGS.Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

The Air Force faces a complex future where conflict will range across a broad spectrum of operations and lethality.  The Air Force requires capabilities with the maximum possible flexibility to deal with the widest possible range of conflict.The C2C is the enabling program element for C2 Integration/Modernization.  The Air Force is working to establish a C2 framework and architecture to be used as a unifying vision of command and control for each of the services core functions.  C2C will support the defense strategy through: integration of air space cyber and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) C2 through architectural analysis prototyping experimentation and innovation to develop cross-cutting solutions and enable an improved "sense-to-kill" cycle time.  C2C innovations and experimentation provide strategic operational and tactical direction for Doctrine Organization Training Materiel Leadership and Education Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions to facilitate an integrated mission environment that supports C2 planning and execution for air space and cyberspace.  In-depth development and analyses of C2 operational systems and technical architectures are geared towards identifying capability gaps identifying required "to be" information services and evaluating C2 program planned improvements.  Through prototyping and experimentation C2C integrates rapidly developing technologies to promote common standards data sharing and information services across Air Force and joint warfighting applications to support joint enterprise solutions.  Project 675078 Horizontal Integration (HI) conducts DOTMLPF analyses and assessments to guide cross-cutting C2 sub-enterprise and cyberspace investment decisions that integrate USAF capabilities into joint and coalition operations.  HI identifies prioritizes and develops requirements and horizontally integrated solution recommendations to ensure the latest technologies and information services are integrated into a cross cutting C2 system that enables integrated effects in all warfighter domains.  The HI strategy will be validated by Headquarters Air Force (HAF) to ensure that initiatives are harmonized with the most urgent warfighter needs described by the C2 Capability Assessment Team (CAT) and C2 Core Function Master Plan (CFMP) and supporting the 2012 Air Force Joint and Defense Strategies and Operational Concepts.

Marine Aviation Logistics Support Program II (MALSP II) Expeditionary Pack up Kit (EPUK):  Funding supports the evaluation development testing and integration of software and hardware solutions for expeditionary requisitioning and supply chain management across all US Marine Corp Aviation activities.  Marine Aviation Logistics is changing to MALSP II to meet current and future operational requirements - in support of the NAE Strategic Plan Marine Corps Vision & Strategy 2025 and the USMC Long War Concept.  MALSP II will allow aviation logisticians to decrease total infrastructure and resource inventories forward by moving the preponderance of the Maintenance and Supply workload to the CONUS Parent MALS and reducing the total forward Aviation Logistics footprint (personnel equipment facilities and spares).  EPUK as part of Marine Aviation Logistics Enterprise IT (MAL-EIT) system is an automated wireless hardware / software solution that is a key enabler in integrating US Marine Corp Aviation Combat Element (ACE) and Logistics Combat Element (LCE) logistics systems to make the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) more responsive agile flexible and lethal with the ability to support and sustain operations in austere expeditionary environments and across the Range of Military Operations (ROMO).3185 Joint Air Logistic Information System (JALIS) - A critical element of the DoD CONUS and OCONUS Air Logistics assets.  JALIS is an operational scheduling aircraft management and data analysis system that allows DoD organizations to submit airlift requirements for passengers and cargo; air logistics flying units to communicate their aircraft availability in a real time graphic display; and designated scheduling organizations to compare airlift requirements to available aircraft and create mission assignments.9406 Maintenance Data Warehouse/NAVAIR DECKPLATE - The development of the Decision Knowledge Programming for Logistics Analysis and Technical Evaluation (DECKPLATE) program is the next generation data warehouse for aircraft maintenance flight and usage data.  It provides a web-based interface to a single source of information currently being stored in multiple Naval Aviation Logistics Data Analysis (NALDA) systems.  Through the use of analysis query and reporting tools the user has the capabilities to effectively obtain readiness data in a near real-time environment as well as historical data for trend analysis and records reconstruction.  DECKPLATE supports the mission of the warfighter who requires a single source of near real-time aviation data in which to base critical readiness decisions.  This requires collecting data from authoritative sources into a data warehouse.  Because the warfighter only needs to access one database the time consuming task of collecting various pieces of data form various sources will be reduced and ultimately eliminated.  This improves data quality because it reduces the possibility of two systems providing identical data elements but slightly different data.  Data availability is improved through continuous near real-time feeds from the data sources giving the warfighter the most current information to base decisions.  In addition this also accomplishes a reduction in legacy systems mandated by OPNAV.  JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION because it includes those projects that have passed Milestone B approval and are conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirement prior to full-rate production decision.","93.121","Continuing","Continuing","","",

Key radar technologies are Space-Time Adaptive Processing Electronically Scanning Array solid state transmitter high dynamic range digital receivers and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF)/radar aperture integration. The resultant detection system will provide a substantially improved overland performance by correcting current sensor shortfalls and enhancing all current required mission areas while simultaneously contributing to the emerging TAMD mission requirements.   Mode 5/S is an upgrade to the existing IFF System providing the warfighter positive secure and reliable identification of friendly aircraft surface and sub-surface platforms.  Mode 5/S replaces the National Security Administration de-certified Mode 4 IFF capability which is no longer effective or suitable for modern military operations.  Mode 5/S will support the Joint Initial Operational Capability (IOC) as defined by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council.An In-Flight Refueling capability will allow the E-2D AHE to receive fuel from various organic and non-organic tanker aircraft.  It provides Expanded Battle Space Surveillance and Targeting through significantly enhanced persistence and increased flexibility (range & endurance).  IFR will better enable the E-2D AHE to fully support current Carrier Strike Group /Joint 24/7 Theater Operations by providing more versatile stationing and/or forward basing options.  Previous domestic E-2 concept demonstration effort successfully established the feasibility of tanking behind the F/A-18E/F and KC-130 aircraft under E-2 Squadrons PE 0204152N.Link-16 Crypto Modernization and frequency remap are required to satisfy the National Security Agency and Federal Aviation Administration mandates.  E-2D AHE uses Link-16 to exchange and provide tactical information with other tactical units.  The Link-16 Crypto Modernization and frequency remap effort requires the integration of a modified Multifunctional Information Distribution System - Low Volume Terminal (1) terminal and software modification to the E-2D AHE mission computer operational flight program.The Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Guard Radio allows the aircrew to monitor the emergency UHF Guard frequency without having to dedicate a specific radio freeing that radio up for use in the tactical mission.  Because of the UHF Tunable Filter Amplifiers the ARC-210 radios cannot provide continuous UHF guard monitoring although the internal guard receiver is operational. A separate UHF guard receiver is provided for monitoring the UHF guard (243 MHz) frequency. It is powered by the Guard switch located on the Communication/Control Display Unit Power Panel.FY2013 starts a Counter Electronic Attack (CEA) capability which will allow the E-2D radar system to maintain performance in an advanced hostile intentional electromagnetic interference environment.

JSOW will enhance aircraft survivability as compared to current interdiction weapon systems by providing the capability for launch aircraft to standoff outside the range of most target area surface-to-air threat systems.  The JSOW launch-and-leave capability will allow several target kills per aircraft sortie.  The JSOW program first developed a baseline weapon for use against fixed area targets.  JSOW is a Navy-led joint Navy/Air Force program.The JSOW Baseline (AGM-154A) variant includes a kinematically efficient airframe an integrated Inertial/Global Positioning System navigation capability and a BLU-97/B or BLU-111 payload. This weapon was designed up front for pre-planned product improvements.  Procurement of JSOW-A in the FYDP is deferred pending a fix to the Unexploded Ordnance  issue or a change in the inventory levels.  The JSOW BLU-108 (AGM-154B) variant incorporates the Sensor Fuze Weapon submunition (BLU-108) into the baseline vehicle.  Planned production of the JSOW/BLU-108 is deferred pending a change in the threat.  The JSOW Unitary (AGM-154C) variant has a terminal seeker Autonomous Target Acquisition capability and a Broach lethal package to enable the attack of blast/fragmentation and penetration type targets.  The JSOW Unitary provides increased accuracy and lethality and the capability for aimpoint selection.  Operational Testing of the JSOW-C was successfully completed in December 2004.  Approval for Milestone-III/Full Rate Production was granted on 20 December 2004.  JSOW-C Initial Operational Capability was achieved in February 2005.FY 2012-2014 includes funding for development integration qualification and follow-on developmental and operational test and evaluation of a Network Enabled Weapon moving maritime target capability into the JSOW Unitary weapon (AGM-154C-1). The moving maritime target capability is currently being integrated as an Engineering Change Proposal beginning with FY 2009 procured JSOW-C weapons.  The new AGM-154C-1 capability will enable the weapon to be integrated with the network and attack sea moving maritime targets via real-time pre-and post-launch targeting updates. JSOW will continue to conduct analysis and development of solutions to system integration challenges and continual enhancement of warfighter effectiveness in the employment of the JSOW weapon system. JSOW funding will provide enhancements to include the analysis of extended range and future improvements to the JSOW-C configuration to improve capability.  In addition FY 2012-2014 includes funding to integrate new functionality of the Common Unique Planning Component into the Joint Mission Planning Systems and Precision Guided Munitions Planning System.   JSOW utilizes a "common truck" for both AGM-154A and AGM-154C variants.

Within this vision Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) remains a Navy core competency in a dynamic and uncertain maritime environment.  U.S. adversaries continue to develop asymmetric capabilities and capacities to deter disrupt or delay the entry of U.S. and allied naval forces and pose a constant challenge as we implement the Maritime Strategy.  Evolving submarine technologies offer enhanced stealth speed endurance weapons and operational proficiency trends foretelling that the adversary submarine of the future will have a significantly larger sphere of influence while presenting less vulnerability to ASW forces.  The effective offensive engagement range of the adversary submarine of the future will continue to match or outrange individual U.S. and multinational platform sensors and weapons in many tactical environments.  Submarines are an increasing threat to all Naval and Allied ships particularly modern diesel subs and faster torpedoes.  Not only can the presence of potential hostile submarines delay naval combatant action until they are located and neutralized submarines can also disrupt all seaborne logistics supply for any ground campaign as well as maritime commerce.  ASW forces must be effective in all operating environments ranging from the deep open ocean to the littorals and are key to countering adversarial anti-access and area denial strategies.The objective of this Program Element (PE) is to significantly improve existing Surface Ship Undersea Warfare (USW) sonar system capabilities through quick and affordable development/integration of emergent transformational technologies in support of Littoral ASW Theater ASW Mine Reconnaissance and overall Sea Shield efforts required to pace the threat. Detection and classification play uniquely vital roles in the success of any ASW campaign. To be effective against increasingly stealthy threats in an often ambiguous undersea environment future sensors must be environmentally adaptive have very low false alarm rates and exploit the full range of current and future submarine detection vulnerabilities.Project 1916's primary mission is to improve AN/SQQ-89(V) Measures Of Performance (MOP) by enhancing detection tracking classification passive active torpedo Detection Classification and Localization (DCL) and sonobuoy data processing and display capabilities and increasing acoustic sensor frequency bandwidth (Operational Requirements Document #667-76-05 titled 'AN/SQQ-89 Improvement Program' Test and Evaluation Master Plan 801 and 802-2 (TEMP 801 & TEMP 802-2)). Improvements to system simulation stimulation Information Assurance (IA) software and network architectures and safety are included.  This project takes advantage of the AN/SQQ-89(V) Open System Architecture (OSA) and Acoustic Rapid Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Insertion (ARCI) initiatives to integrate a torpedo DCL and ASW sonar combat system capability improvements. This COTS-based Surface Ship ASW combat system the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 is currently planned as a backfit program for both CG47 (select CG59-73 Baseline 3 and 4 ships) and DDG51 (All DDG and follow FLT I/II/IIA) class ships. The Open Architecture (OA) (level 3 compliant) of the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 system drives the Advanced Capability Build (ACB) spiral development process and provides budget flexibility to make COTS/OA technology solutions and ARCI-type initiatives affordable. This will be accomplished via the incorporation of select Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and emergent transformational ASW technologies delivered to the AN/SQQ-89(V) prime integrator every two years.  ASW technology implementation will take advantage of improvements developed under the submarine Advanced Processing Build (APB) program and will in turn share unique improvements developed under this program with the submarine and surveillance ASW communities. This project will also contribute to development of Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) ASW Mission Packages.Project 1916 also includes funding for the Surface Ship Enhanced Measurement Program (SSEMP) which will measure the performance of existing and new Surface Ship ASW combat systems and enables data-based assessment of the capabilities and shortfalls in the performance of these systems in realistic scenarios.","113.835","Continuing","Continuing","","",

CANES is the technical and infrastructure consolidation of existing separately managed afloat networks currently under PE 0204163N (LI 3050) Ship Communications Automation including Integrated Shipboard Network Systems (ISNS) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System - Maritime (CENTRIXS-M) Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Networks and Submarine Local Area Network (SubLAN). These legacy afloat network designs are currently End of Life and CANES will replace these existing unaffordable and obsolete networks. The fundamental goal of CANES is to bring Infrastructure and Platform as a Service (IaaS / PaaS) within which current and future iterations of Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) computing and storage capabilities will reside. CANES will provide complete infrastructure inclusive of hardware software processing storage and end user devices for Unclassified Coalition Secret and SCI for all basic network services (email web chat collaboration) to a wide variety of Navy surface combatants submarines Maritime Operations Centers and aircraft. In addition approximately 36 hosted applications and systems inclusive of Command and Control Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Information Operations Logistics and Business domains require the CANES Infrastructure to operate in the tactical environment. Integrating these applications and systems is accomplished through Application Integration (AI) the engineering process used to evaluate and validate compatibility between CANES and the Navy-validated applications systems and services that will utilize the CANES infrastructure and services. Specific programs such as Distributed Common Ground System - Navy (DCGS-N) Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M) Naval Tactical Command Support System (NTCSS) and Undersea Warfare Decision Support System (USW-DSS) are dependent on the CANES Common Computing Environment (CCE) to field host and sustain their capability because they no longer provide their own hardware. CANES requires that ADNS field prior to or concurrently with CANES due to architectural reliance between the two programs.  CANES will develop updates on a rolling four year hardware baseline and a two year software baseline. CANES is based on the overarching concept of reducing the number of afloat network baselines and providing enhanced efficiency through a single engineering focus on integrated technical solutions. This will allow for streamlined acquisition contracting test events and significant lifecycle efficiencies through consolidation of multiple current configuration management baselines logistics and training efforts into a unified support structure. Platform Sets 1 2 3 and 4 define phases of CANES system development efforts.  Each platform set consists of a different ship class design baseline.In FY 2014 CANES RDT&E investment will support the developmental efforts for Technical Insertion (TI) software baselines.  Perform system engineering efforts to complete functional baselines and updates to technical data packages. Continue testing events at Enterprise Engineering and Certification (E2C) lab on Platform Sets 2 3 and 4 and on the TI software baseline. Complete Initial Operational Test and Evaluation on unit level platforms. Perform Developmental Testing (DT) on force level baseline in support of Follow-On Test and Evaluation (FOT&E). Continue hosted system integration testing and Application Integration (AI). Achieve Full Deployment Decision (FDD).The Communications Automation Program - This project is a continuing program that provides for automation and communications upgrades for Fleet tactical users. It includes Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) and High Frequency Internet Protocol/Sub Network Relay.ADNS is the method by which tactical Navy units transfer Internet Protocol (IP) data to Navy and Department of Defense communities on the Global Information Grid (GIG). ADNS serves as a gateway to enable joint and coalition interoperability for these tactical assets and ensures GIG connectivity. ADNS allows unclassified secret top secret traffic and various joint allied and coalition services to reconnect to the Defense Information Systems Network ashore via radio paths and pier connectivity.FY14 funds will be used for ADNS interface design development integration for network application and Radio Frequency (RF) paths.","87.740","Continuing","Continuing","","",

Project 0766 provides for Integrated Undersea Surveillance Systems (IUSS) Research and Development Projects under the Maritime Surveillance Systems (MSS) Program Office (PEO SUB PMS 485).  IUSS provides the Navy with its primary means of submarine detection both nuclear and diesel.  A portion of project 0766 (FSS) is classified with details available at a higher classification level. Project 0344 funds the Shallow Water Surveillance System (SWSS) project to develop and demonstrate the technology to enable autonomous installation of an acoustic recording device with a clandestine data recovery capability. The IUSS Research and Development project (0766) funds SURTASS Passive and SURTASS Low Frequency Active (LFA) developments.  SURTASS provides the mobile tactical arm of the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System providing long range detection and cueing for tactical weapons platforms against both diesel and nuclear powered submarines.  SURTASS LFA provides an active adjunct capability for IUSS passive and tactical sensors to assist in countering the quieter diesel and nuclear threats of the 1990s and beyond.  The LFA tasks are directed at detection of slow quiet threats in harsh littoral waters.In order to continue with reductions in life cycle costs and continue with system-wide consolidation a short-term goal is to develop a common IUSS processor based on NAVSEA's Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (ARCI) program.  The IUSS Integrated Common Processor (ICP) will have the capability to process and display data from all fixed and mobile underwater systems.  The IUSS ICP will be used for all new system installations and replace the legacy systems as they reach end of life and require upgrading.  Additionally SURTASS has consolidated on the TB-29A Twin-line array a variant of the Submarine TB-29A Long line array.  This reduced the number of array variants employed by SURTASS from 3 to 1 and enabled development and logistics cost savings by leveraging off the submarine TB-29A program.The Shallow Water Surveillance System (SWSS) project (0344) funds the development and demonstration of the Increment 1B system with technology to enable autonomous classification and reporting of specific submarine targets of interest.","281.537","Continuing","Continuing","","",

An effective and robust integration of commercial and military technologies can reduce costs and improve naval capabilities by keeping pace with the fast moving changes in technologies and operational needs. The RTT program is comprised of three elements: The Rapid Technology Transition (RTT) program the Technology Insertion Program for Savings (TIPS) and the Rapid Development and Deployment (RDD) program. The RTT and TIPS programs are structured to bring transition deals to closure quickly and to provide execution year funding for a rapid start bridging the gap until the program of record can fund the completion of the technology insertion. The RDD program is structured to quickly develop a prototype solution that will be deployed in theater for Naval forces engaged in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).The mission of the RTT program is to increase the rate that new innovative and potentially disruptive technologies are inserted into Department of Navy (DON) acquisition programs and the hands of the warfighter. The mission of the TIPS program is to increase the rate that new cutting edge technologies are inserted into DON acquisition programs in order to significantly reduce operations and maintenance support costs.The RDD program provides for the rapid development and fielding of prototype solutions to meet urgent operational needs. The RDD process applies when existing DON processes cannot meet urgent operational needs. Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) have generated rapidly evolving military needs that require responsive materiel solutions. Rapid transition opportunities occur when a sufficiently mature technology is identified that can meet a particular need on a timetable which matches that of an acquisition program and is supported by a business case which justifies the associated cost and schedule risk. The combination of circumstances which create such opportunities can appear and disappear well inside the Program Objectives Memorandum (POM) cycle. These programs are designed to be proactive in identifying opportunities and to work with resource sponsors fleet and force users and Program Managers (PMs) in constructing viable technology transition deals one at a time. To ensure the widest possible awareness of emergent commercial technology opportunities these programs interact with the industry and coordinate closely with Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) to maintain awareness of insertion opportunities. Utilizing existing authorities RTT applies execution year funds where necessary to "jump-start" transitions so they can be inserted and validated by Sea Trial experiments leading directly to deployment and/or demonstrations of high risk/high payoff technologies. This Program Element is the only Navy program that addresses current urgent requirements that are required by the fleet within a 18-24 month period. As such planning and execution are accomplished within the same fiscal year which causes a non-traditional financial execution profile for the program. The program therefore does not meet traditional execution benchmarks.Higher Navy priorities result in the termination of the RTT program in 2014.","39.202","Continuing","Continuing","","",

Tri-Service coordination and cooperative efforts are focused in four principal medical areas: Combat Casualty Care Military Operational Medicine Militarily Relevant Infectious Diseases and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine.  Promising medical technologies are refined and validated through extensive testing which is closely monitored by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as part of their processes for licensing new medical products. The FDA requires medical products to undergo extensive preclinical testing in animals and/or other models to obtain preliminary effectiveness and safety information before they can be tested in human clinical trials. Clinical trials are conducted in three phases to prove the safety of a drug vaccine or device for the targeted disease or medical condition starting in Phase 1 with a small number of healthy volunteers. Following Phase 1 Phase 2 clinical trials to provide expanded safety data and evaluate the effectiveness of a drug vaccine or medical device in a larger population of patients having the targeted disease or medical condition. Each successive phase includes larger numbers of human subjects and requires FDA cognizance prior to proceeding. Work conducted in this PE primarily focuses on late stages of technology maturation activities required to conduct Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Some high-risk technologies may require additional maturation with FDA guidance prior to initiating these clinical trials. Such things as proof of product stability and purity are necessary to meet FDA standards before entering later stages of testing and prior to transitioning into a formal acquisition program where large Phase 3 pivotal trials will be conducted for licensure. Activities in this PE may include completion of preclinical animal studies and Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies involving human subjects according to FDA and EPA requirements. Promising medical technologies that are not regulated by the FDA are modeled prototyped and tested in relevant environments.Blast research and research into maturing field rations in this PE are fully coordinated with the United States Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center.  This coordination enables improved body armor design and rations for Soldiers. Additionally the activities funded in this PE are externally peer reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee. The ASBREM Committee serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses biomedical research and development community as well as its associated enabling research areas.Project 810 maturates and demonstrates FDA-regulated medical countermeasures such as drugs vaccines and diagnostic systems to naturally occurring infectious diseases and wound infections of military importance as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis.  The project also supports testing of personal protective measures such as repellents and insecticides regulated by the EPA. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.Project 840 validates studies on safety and effectiveness of drugs biologics (products derived from living organisms) medical devices and medical procedures intended to minimize immediate and long-term effects from battlefield injuries; advanced technology development and clinical studies for treatment of ocular and visual system traumatic injury; and restoration of function and appearance by regenerating skin muscle and bone tissue in battle-injured casualties. Additionally this project develops and realistically tests improved occupant protection systems through medical research to characterize mechanisms of injuries sustained by occupants of ground-combat vehicles subjected to underbody blast events determine human tolerance limits to underbody blast forces and develop tools to predict injuries to ground-combat vehicle occupants exposed to underbody blast forces.Project FH4 maturates validates and supports enhanced Force Health Protection of Soldiers against threats in military operations and training. Health-monitoring tools are matured to rapidly identify deployment stressors that affect the health of Joint Forces.

The GCV IFV will provide the infantry squad with a highly mobile protected transport to the decisive locations on the battlefield.  The GCV IFV will provide both destructive fires against threat armored vehicles and direct fire support for the squad during dismounted assaults.  It will increase the Infantry's tactical mobility survivability and lethality against light and heavy armored threats across a variety of missions.  The Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program was initiated on the basis of an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) that was approved 10 December 2009.  A Capabilities Development Document (CDD) is currently under review with anticipated approval by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 3QFY2013.  The accomplishments and funding reflected in this justification are based on these documents and on program milestone decision memoranda.A Milestone (MS) A Defense Acquisition Board was conducted on 21 July 2011 and an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was signed 17 August 2011.  It granted the Army approval to enter a 24 month Technology Development (TD) phase. Two contracts were awarded on 18 August 2011.  One contract was awarded to BAE Systems Land & Armaments Limited Partnership(L.P). and one was awarded to General Dynamics Land Systems Inc. Following receipt of a protest stop work orders were issued on 29 August 2011.  The GAO denied the protest on 5 December 2011 and work resumed 6 December 2011.  The following funding requirements/justifications reflect the impact of the 100 day delay caused by the protest.Revisions to the GCV strategy were approved via an ADM that was signed on 16 January 2013.  The Army's exploration of the capabilities trade-space and full range of alternatives prior to finalizing requirements has led to a modified set of requirements that require additional preliminary design effort.  In addition the results of the three pronged development effort were considered in revising the GCV strategy.  Some relevant decisions included in the ADM were:  the TD phase is to be extended by six months a full and open competition for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase will be conducted and contract award will be to a single vendor and MS B will be conducted in late FY2014.  The GCV Project Manager is currently taking steps to incorporate these decisions into the program.  The following funding requirements/justifications reflect these decisions and are based on cost estimates generated by the Project Management Office.The GCV program is using an incremental approach with the GCV IFV as the first increment (future increments have not yet been defined).  Due to the aforementioned revision to the GCV strategy the Technology Development phase (with 2 competing contractors) that effectively began 6 December 2011 will proceed for 30 months.  Following Milestone B currently planned for 3Q2014 the program is planning to award a single competitively selected 54 month contract for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  During EMD the selected contractor will continue to refine designs and deliver prototypes to support engineering development risk mitigation and technical and operational tests.  Milestone C is planned for 1QFY2019 and will immediately be followed with award of a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract to one contractor.NOTE:  The FY2013 Accomplishments/Planned Program reflect the revised GCV strategy but the FY2013 budget breakouts reflect the submitted FY2013 President's Budget (the FY2013 words have been updated but not the dollars).","","","","","",

Additionally it provides improved fire support capability due to its increased range of 37.5 kilometers and demonstrated accuracy of < 4 meters radial miss distances which enables a first round effect on target reducing the number of rounds required while reducing collateral damage. Excalibur is compatible with the M777A2 Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155) and the M109A6 Paladin Howitzer and Sweden's Archer howitzer. Excalibur provides a 33% range increase over current Rocket Assisted Projectiles with a < 10 meter accuracy circular error probable at all ranges. Excalibur is also highly resistant to Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming. Excalibur is an international program teamed with the Kingdom of Sweden (KoS) who contributes resources towards the development and have procured rounds in accordance with an established Project Agreement for use in their Archer howitzer.      Excalibur Increments Ia-1 and Ia-2 are currently fielded and in use by units throughout Afghanistan and deployed globally to support other Military Contingency Operations. The final increment of development funding is required in fiscal year 2014 in order to complete the Ib development tasks and execute the Ib Operational Test and Evaluation in accordance with the Test and Evaluation Master Plan. Operational testing will be conducted to obtain data for evaluation of the operational effectiveness of the Increment Ib projectile when used by a typical M109A6 or M777A2 firing battery to attack Excalibur targets. The test will provide data upon which to base an assessment of the ability of a typical artillery unit to employ Excalibur in accordance with doctrine and in a timely manner using the fire support system (target acquisition fire direction and cannon systems) as well as projectile effects on target. Aspects of operational suitability (reliability logistics supportability and MANPRINT) will also be evaluated on the basis of data from this test. Fiscal year 2014 funding supports the execution of this test event including test range costs instrumentation and government support. This operational test will be executed concurrently with the Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) IOT&E. The test concept will exercise the entire fire support chain. The fiscal year 2014 funding will also fund the Excalibur Ib durability (20 year shelf life) test in order to obtain full material release and type classification standard of the increment Ib. The program was certified by the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) on January 10 2011.

The Improved Sentinel system is used with the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) element and is a key component to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense architecture via the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) to provide critical air surveillance of the forward areas.Improved Sentinel (AN/MPQ-64A1) consists of a radar-based sensor with its prime mover/power Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) and Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) Command Control and Intelligence (C2I) interfaces.  The radar is deployed in both an air defense role and a force protection role for Counter-Rocket Artillery and Mortar (C-RAM) missions.  The sensor is an advanced three-dimensional battlefield X-Band air defense phased-array radar with an instrumented range of 75 km.  The Improved Sentinel is capable of operating day or night in adverse weather conditions in the battlefield environments of dust smoke aerosols and enemy countermeasures.  It provides 360-degree azimuth coverage for acquisition tracking.  The Improved Sentinel contributes to the digital battlefield by automatically detecting classifying identifying and reporting targets (cruise missiles unmanned aerial vehicles rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft).  Improved Sentinel acquires targets sufficiently forward of the battle area to allow weapons reaction time and engagement at optimum ranges.  The Improved Sentinel's integrated IFF reduces the potential for fratricide of US and Coalition aircraft.  The Research and Development funding supports Sentinel modernization/upgrades hardware/software issue resolution resolution of obsolescence issues engineering studies and cost reduction initiatives.  The funding for FY 2012 through FY 2018 development activities addresses the following Sentinel system capability gaps and obsolescence issues identified by the User:  1) Target Detection gap; 2) Target Tracking gap; 3) Net Readiness gap; 4) Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) gap; and 5) Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Defense gap. Battle Space Improvement addresses the Target Detection gap that currently exists with the Sentinel system.  This development effort modifies the radar signal processor algorithms to reduce system processing losses.  The modified algorithms will increase target acquisition and tracking range capability by a minimum of 12 percent against the threat set within the instrumented range band.  This effort also develops modifications to the radar hardware by adding a common signal processing card to the radar signal processor to provide a common hardware and software processing configuration across the Sentinel radar fleet.Stop Stare and Track addresses the Target Tracking gap.  This development effort provides direct Fire Control Radar (FCR) support in an integrated air and missile defense architecture.  In addition this provides significantly improved Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) timeline and performance against all targets.  It also enables rapid classification of cued RAM as well as very accurate Point of Origin (POO) and Point of Impact (POI) and enables a robust Kill Assessment capability of engaged targets.Cross Domain Solution (CDS) Network Interface addresses net readiness and system security concerns. This effort develops a CDS interface to isolate the Improved Sentinel from connected networks of lower classification levels.Electronic Counter Counter Measures (ECCM) addresses the ECM gap.  This effort conducts additional testing to verify initial ECCM results and updates the database with more extensive ECCM signatures of evolving threats.Signal Data Processor (SDP)/North Finding Module (NFM) addresses the Target Detection Target Tracking and ECM capability gaps and funds the mitigation of the SDP and NFM obsolescence issues.  SDP cards are estimated to go obsolete every four to six years.Small/Low/Slow (SLS) addresses the Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Defense gap.  This effort provides an order of magnitude capability improvement in Sentinel's ability to detect track and classify new and emerging smaller and more capable UAS at extended ranges in tactically challenging natural and urban clutter environments while maintaining a low false broadcast track rate and without the use of different specialized Modes that increase chances for operator misapplication (i.e. there will be only one Mode that does all targets).","","","","","",

This system leverages current technology for an Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control System/capability.MEADS is a tri-national co-development program among the United States Germany and Italy to replace the PATRIOT and HAWK systems in Germany and NIKE Hercules systems in Italy. The NATO MEADS Management Agency (NAMEADSMA) is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) contracting authority providing management of the MEADS program on behalf of the participating nations and is responsible for managing the system acquisition. The U.S. and Italy signed the D&D MOU on September 24 2004 and September 27 2004 respectively. The NAMEADSMA awarded the MEADS D&D letter contract to MEADS International Inc. on September 28 2004 initiating the MEADS D&D phase. The MOU was amended in March 2005 by the U.S. and Italy to allow the German Parliament additional time for their signature decision and on April 22 2005 Germany signed the MOU. NAMEADSMA awarded a $3.4 billion D&D definitized contract to MEADS International Inc. on May 31 2005.  MEADS is designed to provide joint and coalition forces critical asset and defended area protection against multiple and simultaneous attacks by short to medium range ballistic missiles cruise missiles manned and unmanned aerial systems and tactical air-to-surface missiles. MEADS is being developed to have a netted and distributed architecture with modular components to increase survivability and flexibility of employment in a number of operational configurations.

These Payload programs support the Army's transformation by developing Reconnaissance Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload systems for Brigade Combat Teams Divisions and Corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  This is in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) UAS priorities.  Small Tactical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) Synthetic Aperture Radar/Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR/GMTI) is a lightweight high performance all weather multi-functional radar system for the Gray Eagle Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). The STARLite system provides wide area near real time Reconnaissance Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capabilities. It operates throughout the UAS flight mission profile in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants. The SAR mode generates quality images for the battlefield commander for detection classification and location of stationary commercial wheeled vehicle-size targets. The GMTI mode detects moving ground targets to include man-sized detection and provides location information and performs cross-cue with the Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors. Common Sensor Payload (CSP) - Electro Optical / Infra Red / Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD) provides High Definition (HD) Full Motion Video (FMV) in both the Electro Optical and Mid Wave IR spectrums with day/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery with the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons.  It is the EO/IR/LD sensor for Gray Eagle UAS which supports force applications battlespace awareness force protection and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area near real time RSTA capabilities.  Additional initiatives will continue to focus on the transition of technologies directly supporting emerging requirements and the Army's Current and Future Force.  CSP is being procured for the Gray Eagle UAS program and has potential application to other platforms.   Project 11B:   The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor currently under development for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology and as the adversaries use of technology changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system.  The TSP system is a complementary system to the aerial and terrestrial Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) layers through direct interface with the Distributed common Ground system - Army (DCGS-A) Information and Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E).  It supports Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs).

The GMD capability consists of Ground Based Interceptors (GBI) GMD Fire Control system (GFC)  GMD Communications Network (GCN) In-Flight Interceptor Communications System Data Terminals (IDT) and all of the ground Launch Support Systems (LSS) (silos silo interface vaults (SIVs) environmental control systems command launch equipment (CLE) firing circuits and safety systems). The 30 operationally deployed GBIs located at Fort Greely Alaska (26 GBIs) and Vandenberg Air Force Base California (4 GBIs) each deliver a single Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) to defeat threat warheads in space during the midcourse phase of the ballistic trajectory. The GMD Fire Control System consists of fire control nodes in Fort Greely Alaska and Missile Defense Integration and Operations Center (MDIOC) Colorado Springs Colorado. IDTs are currently located in Fort Greely Alaska Vandenberg Air Force Base California Eareckson Air Station Alaska and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) plans to deliver an additional IDT to Fort Drum New York. The GMD capability leverages integration of Ballistic Missile Defense System sensors in Japan Alaska California United Kingdom Greenland and Turkey. Development objectives for GMD include: testing and validating the performance of the Capability Enhancement I and II (CE-I and CE-II) GBIs development and testing of capability upgrades manufacturing additional GBIs in support of operational requirements flight testing upgrading fielded GBIs and conducting a comprehensive component ground testing and upgrades program that will improve GBI reliability and minimize the number of GBIs required to destroy each ICBM threat.In response to FTG-06a failed intercept the program continues to develop and qualify a modified Inertial Measurement Unit Firmware and Cradle Isolation to improve the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle's (EKV) performance in flight.  Critical to the program's success is the Systems Engineering and Test activities associated with the design modification and component testing leading up to a fully Certified IMU Design.  To reduce the concurrency risk to the GMD program's ability to execute the test program and deliver the remaining CE-II GBIs the Agency has instituted a more rigorous and systematic approach to proving out the FTG-06a failure mitigations.  Included in the new program is a robust design process additional qualification tests and design verification tests and a final certification review of all data thus ensuring the mitigations fully address the FTG-06a root cause failure.  To further reduce the concurrency risk to the GMD program the Agency has established manufacturing gates for the IMU the EKVs and the eventual emplacements of the CE-II GBI's.  These manufacturing gates are anchored to knowledge based decisions and events included in the new more robust design and qualification process.  This new approach to reduce design/manufacturing concurrency and ensure manufacturing activities are not proceeding until sufficient engineering data indicates a readiness to proceed will significantly contribute to the program's ability to successfully establish interceptor testing and delivery baselines.Cyber Operations sustains Missile Defense Agency (MDA) DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program (DIACAP) and Controls Validation Testing (CVT) activities analysis of validation results risk assessments and reviews of Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) for MDA Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) mission systems.

Lessons learned from the two STSS-D satellites are guiding decisions on the development of a fiscally sustainable continuously available future operational constellation and ground communications/processing system. STSS-D is providing risk reduction for future MDA space-layer options models algorithms sensors and spacecraft development by providing background and clutter scene characterization complex target signatures interface definition communications architectures and performance across acquisition tracking and discrimination. STSS-D is also providing definition to BMDS Concept of Operations timelines and performance requirements for sensor cuing and weapons engagement such as Aegis Launch On/Engage On from remote space sensors. STSS-D will emphasize continued research and development to address the more sophisticated threats the Agency expects to encounter in the far term. The greatest protection against missile defense threats of all ranges remains a highly available early missile tracking capability from space. Space sensors provide the most cost effective and operationally suitable means of providing global persistent surveillance and engagement directly addressing the number one missile defense priority need for Combatant Commanders. STSS-D is a capability development activity for the demonstration of technologies to support development and capability delivery of future MDA space-layer options.  In addition the STSS-D satellites have demonstrated the ability of a space sensor to provide high precision real time tracking of missiles and midcourse objects thus enabling simultaneous regional theater and strategic missile defense systems to be cued to track well beyond their organic detection capability. Data from on-going STSS-D testing has validated the ability to track cold midcourse objects from space and close the fire control loop with BMDS interceptors. During several Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Flight Tests STSS-D has provided data in real-time that has met the Aegis Missile Defense Systems Quality of Service (QoS) data requirements for Remote Engagement Authorized (REA). Finally STSS-D provides a new infrared sensor phenomenology for the BMDS that will demonstrate the benefit of future MDA space-layer capabilities when combined with radars that will provide robustness against current and advanced countermeasures. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has developed and is testing two STSS-D satellites to demonstrate key functions of space sensors in support of future MDA space-layer options risk reduction. STSS-D Element Level testing is funded as part of a capabilities development program and reflected in the Program Element submission. Element testing is based on an integrated comprehensive and phased test program. Element systems subsystems and components were tested early in development and this testing was necessary prior to conducting Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) level testing. Key data from the STSS-D satellites efforts continue to provide lessons learned as MDA pursues longer term space sensor needs. - Space sensors BMDS sensor coverage to a global level. The STSS-D has demonstrated the capability of satellites to track ballistic missiles and the ability to provide accurate tracking information to the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) battle manager to close the fire control loop with BMDS interceptors thus extending the effective range of BMDS interceptors and other sensors. - Space-based sensors are not limited by basing rights issues or deployment decisions and will allow cost effective coverage of countries and large areas not accessible from ground based sensors. - Space based visible and Infrared (IR) sensors will complement radars and contribute to a sensor architecture more robust to countermeasures - Space-based sensors will enable near continuous threat observation and tracking from launch to intercept covering threats by augmenting the coverage of the BMDS radars and providing state vectors to Command and Control Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) to enable interceptor fire control via multiple BMDS assets (Aegis Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)) Goals for STSS-D - Risk reduction for future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) space-layer architectures by demonstrating Aegis Launch on Remote in FY 2013- Risk reduction for future MDA space-layer architectures by demonstrating the ability to cue or be cued- Demonstrate C2BMC interfaces sensor registration communication chains and latencies to support future MDA space-layer concept of operations development Near Field Infrared Experiment (NFIRE) The NFIRE technology project was designed to collect near field phenomenology data for use in plume to hard body handover algorithms for boost phase interceptor programs. MDA used this data to validate the models and simulations that are fundamental to developing the guidance and endgame homing algorithms. NFIRE is now focused on future MDA space-layer sensors risk reduction and other BMDS element development support by collecting background clutter and target signatures for modeling and algorithm development and validation. A secondary objective of the experiment has been to collect hyper-temporal short wave infrared and visible data for assessing early launch detection and tracking capability. The experiment includes three plume signature mission types: targets of opportunity dedicated fly-bys and ground observations. The dedicated fly-by experiments have been accomplished. The NFIRE satellite also carries a Laser Communication Terminal which has been and continues to be used to conduct communication experiments with the German Terra SAR-X satellite. These experiments test low earth orbit satellite-to-ground and satellite-to-satellite capabilities of the terminal for potential incorporation into the BMDS. Data products are utilized by multiple programs to improve missile engagement performance. Goals for NFIRE - Conduct multiple data collection missions from the Missile Defense Space Development Center (MDSDC) against ground air space and ballistic missile targets of opportunity - Conduct low earth orbit satellite-to-satellite and satellite-to-ground laser communication experiments - Provide data to validate models and simulations that are fundamental to developing the navigation guidance and control and endgame homing algorithms as well as laser communication proof of concept MD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management costs in support of the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).","597.048","Continuing","Continuing","","",

NDEP is DoD’s primary program to execute high quality experiential STEM efforts for pre-Kindergarten-12th Grade (PK-12) students through world-class researchers to address DoD’s STEM workforce needs and to provide current and future scientific and technological capabilities.  NDEP initiatives align with the four priority areas of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Committee on STEM Education (CoSTEM) Federal Five-Year STEM Strategic Plan: (1) STEM teacher training (2) groups underrepresented in STEM (3) STEM undergraduate education and (4) STEM engagement. NDEP consists of three components:  (1) Science Mathematics and Research for Transformation (SMART); (2) the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF); and (3) pre-Kindergarten-12th Grade (PK-12).  NDEP aligns to the Science and Technology (S&T) priorities and emerging scientific research areas the integrated STEM/Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MIs) synchronized with the Federal Five-Year STEM Strategic Plan the DoD STEM Strategic Plan and the in-progress DoD Strategic Workforce Plan.  NDEP components are guided and informed by the Office of Management and Budget’s “Use of Evidence and Evaluation in the 2014” memorandum and are consistent with Government Accountability Office guidance on assessment and evaluation practices. SMART awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 academic STEM disciplines and moves graduates directly into DoD's workforce following graduation.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in hands-on research and work experiences in DoD labs thereby enhancing their educational experience and building a public service commitment to the Department’s mission.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005 SMART has supported approximately 1130 students from bachelor’s to doctoral levels and to date approximately 550 have completed program studies and transitioned into the DoD workforce.  SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of highly educated high caliber U.S. technical talent prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD ready to apply their technical knowledge skills and abilities to help DoD fulfill its mission. NSSEFF supports 29 world-class researchers (NSSEFF Fellows) in areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional future talent.  The NSSEFF Fellows work with approximately 100 undergraduate students 200 graduate students and 100 post-doctoral scholars at their respective academic institutions.  Three cohorts of NSSEFF Fellows with the first selected in FY 2008 have provided critical connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise.  Fellows’ work spans all seven DoD S&T priorities and the six emerging scientific research areas.  NSSEFF Fellows serve as speakers at DoD events reviewers on panels for DoD science and as collaborators with scientists and engineers at DoD’s laboratories and other research facilities.NDEP PK-12 engages develops and attracts STEM talent for future DoD military and civilian workforce needs via 68 local sites and nine national organizations.  NDEP PK-12 leverages the DoD’s STEM expertise to connect students teachers schools and public sector and industry partners with DoD subject matter experts (SMEs) primarily in those communities adjacent to DoD laboratories and bases where the talent pool resides.  Authentic STEM experiences for teachers and students include hands-on activities that are aligned with DoD’s technical workforce requirements.  Since FY 2007 NDEP PK-12 has increased the number of DoD facilities that directly engage local education authorities (LEAs) to: (1) build student interest in STEM fields and disciplines and in careers specific to DoD; (2) develop DoD-relevant science engineering and mathematics skills; and (3) provide future talent to fulfill DoD’s demand for highly skilled STEM professionals. NDEP PK-12 has utilized 4100 exceptional DoD STEM professionals to reach 500000 students and 8300 teachers in 30 states. As one specific example DoD SMEs contributed over 8000 hours to lead FIRST Robotics Competition teams with over 90 percent of team members reporting that the hands-on experience taught them about how science and technology can be used to solve real-world science and engineering problems.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance Combatant Command and Service requirements analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood" January 2010 the Integrated Unit Base and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process and DoD Directive 5210.41 Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  Under this integrated approach funds are used to provide advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  This program will evaluate integrated technologies representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.This appropriation will finance work including manpower performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grantarrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied)development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research for the production of useful materials devices systems or methods including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.","33.609","Continuing","Continuing","","",

Warfighter’s today rely more and more on communications networks to support and enable actions from targeting and shooting weapons to video-conferencing.  Though military basic infrastructure capabilities follow the mainstream commercial internet for many reasons (security mobility and robustness) commercial telecommunications especially commercial wireless (tactical edge) communications are not well-matched with the requirements of today’s warfighter.  These trends will continue as the military data load becomes more diverse and heavy.  These tactical edge technology challenges cut across all warfare domains (space air ground and sea).  In response to recognized technical problems today as well as anticipated problems in the future this research will focus on two key problems in networked technologies:  The need for "Joint interoperability" and  "expanded reach" (resilient and robust) where no communication infrastructure exists.  The main research objectives of this program are to:– Perform Network Communications Analysis to establish the scientific foundations for tactical mobile networking with a specific emphasis on integrating heterogeneous Networks and Integrated NetOps for tactical networks.– Complete the enhancements of joint integrated capability to predict performance of heterogeneous communication networks and expand the reach/connectivity and capacity. – Jointly manage and operate existing and planned diverse communications networks services and applications.– Create mature products for transition to programs of record (POR) or directly to field.	- -  Wireless mobile network design development & operations spectrum management information assurance and information dissemination management software tools.	- -  Joint Aerial Layer Networking (JALN) services and applications packages including hardware and software systems and integrated/joint network operations software tools and new information architectures.This research provides the technical basis to standardize the implementation of military network communications capabilities in the areas of joint airborne network gateways and network communications analysis across the military services Joint Staff Office of the Secretary of Defense and defense agencies.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

The EOD/LIC Program develops and delivers advanced capabilities for military Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) operators and Special Operations Forces (SOF) to meet the challenges of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) force protection and the war on terrorism.  EOD/LIC efforts focus in two areas:  support to SOF to combat terrorism; and access detection identification and neutralization of all types of conventional explosive ordnance and improvised explosive devices.  Requirements submitted by the Joint Service EOD and Service Special Operations communities are prioritized and approved by OASD (SO/LIC).  With a decreased budget CTTSO will proceed with The Improvised Device Defeat (IDD) subgroup expanding its inclusion of joint service EOD operators in its efforts since the Department’s announcement to cancel PE 0603121D8Z.  IDD will absorb the appropriate joint service EOD requirements for prioritization and interagency coordination going forward.  IDD will use the limited resources it possesses to provide the broadest possible capability improvement to the community.  P207 Special Reconnaissance Capabilities (SRC).  The SRC Program exploits leverages and integrates DoD’s service and agency efforts to improve surveillance and reconnaissance tools (unattended sensors tagging and tracking devices data infiltration/exfiltration remote delivery and mobility/delivery of sensors) while providing risk reduction for DoD and other agency technology and development programs.  The SRC Program identifies integrates and operationalizes the technical tools for the collection of actionable information against a variety of targets and mission requirements including emerging requirements  and maintains DoD’s on-line catalog of tools in order to minimize crisis response time for special reconnaissance and surveillance.  P208 Information Dissemination Concepts (IDC).  The IDC Program addresses technology capabilities necessary to enable sustained information dissemination campaigns in denied areas.  The IDC program working as necessary with DoD and the interagency develops modifies and demonstrates concepts mechanisms platforms and payloads to propagate themes and messages that convince target audiences to take action favorable to the United States and its allies. The Surveillance Collection and Operations Support (SCOS) subgroup has managed the IDC project for CTTSO since gaining oversight of the funding.  The language program orchestrated by SCOS will remain albeit with a drastic reduction in funding without PE 0603121D8Z. P209 Irregular Warfare Support (IWS).  The IWS Program (IWSP) develops adaptive and agile capabilities and methodologies to support irregular warfare in the current and evolving strategic environments. IWSP supports joint interagency and other partners who conduct or counter irregular warfare through indirect and asymmetric approaches though they may employ a full range of military and other capabilities in order to erode an adversary’s power influence and will. Solutions include material and non-material operational analysis concept development field experimentation and delivery of capabilities to defeat the motivations sanctuaries and enterprises of targeted state and non-state actors.  As evidenced by every applicable Defense and National Security strategy document (e.g. 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG) “Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense Irregular Warfare capabilities are vital to U.S. security.  CTTSO in coordination with the ASD (SO/LIC) is in the process of reviewing options to continue the IWS capability that is critical to the combating terrorism community.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

FY 2013 and out-year funding for the HPCMP was and will continue to be requested under 0603461A.","Today the Department of Defense (DoD) faces many challenges.  The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) provides cost effective tools the Department needs to address the most difficult defense problems. These tools include modern high performance computing hardware parallel software wide area networking services and the expertise to use them.  The HPCMP helps enables DoD personnel to:-  Conduct basic research into areas such as materials fuels turbulence proteins electromagnetic fields signal image relationships structural response blast effects and combustion;  -  Conduct applied research into areas such as aerodynamics applied to fighter and transport manned and unmanned aircraft automated target recognition; hydrodynamics applied to new hull forms  structural performance of new armor and penetrator concepts and explosives performance;-  Design elements of weapon systems such as the Hellfire missile F-35 MRAP C-17 the Javelin missile and directed energy weapons systems;-  Test and evaluate weapons system performance on systems such as F-16 F-22 F-35 C-17 FCS AIM-9X GBU-39 and Striker;-  Immediately support urgent operations for efforts such as counter IED hurricane Katrina related flood modeling and the 2010 gulf oil spill migration modeling.High Performance Computing has been identified as a key enabling technology essential to achieving the DoD's research development test and evaluation (RDT&E) objectives.  Validated requirements collected across the DoD reflect the needs of 4400 scientists and engineers located at hundreds of locations (DoD Laboratories Test Centers academic institutions and commercial businesses).  The integrated HPCMP consists of DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) and Software Application Support.  DSRCs are responsible for as large a part of DoD`s RDT&E computational workload as feasible.  DSRCs provide extensive capabilities to address user requirements for hardware software and programming environments.  Dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) augment the DSRCs to form the total HPCMP computational capability.  DHPIs address critical HPC requirements that cannot be met at DSRCs such as real-time and near real-time computing requirements and leverage significant HPC and mission expertise located at these remote sites.  All elements of the HPCMP are interconnected with all S&T and T&E user sites via the Defense Research and Engineering Network.  DREN provides the flexible wide area network fabric needed by the RDT&E community to support technology demonstrations and distributed test and evaluation events in addition to providing access to the supercomputing centers.  The Software Application Support component develops critical common DoD applications programs that run efficiently on advanced HPC systems supports technology transition activities with academic and commercial institutions trains users and builds collaborative programming environments.

The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) uniquely accomplishes this mission for the Department by providing both a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics parts that are no longer available from or bid by commercial sources but are essential to combat operations.  This is a critical capability in an atmosphere of increasing worldwide supply chain risks with threats to defense microelectronics.  The threats include risks such as counterfeiting Trojan horses unreliability and rapid obsolescence coming from an unpredictable and unsecure supply chain.   As fiscal pressures force the Department to maintain its weapon systems longer than originally planned and their extended combat use increases attrition the need for DMEA’s unique capabilities increases.Microelectronics is a crucial technology and central for all operations within the Department.  Yet as vital as this technology is to Department operations the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market.  The Department frequently requires legacy microelectronics long after commercial foundries have moved on to advanced technology levels.  As such the semiconductor industry does not respond to the Department’s unique needs of ultra-low volumes long availability time frames or its high-level security concerns.  In these cases DMEA procures a license to produce technologies in-house that are no longer commercially manufactured or are unavailable due to no-bids owing to low volume requirements.  These licenses enable DMEA to be the Department’s microelectronics supplier of last resort providing the Department with a long-term trusted and assured source. DMEA provides increasingly rare microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries.  DMEA provides decisive quick turn solutions for defense intelligence special operations cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market.  DMEA’s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions—along with its unique technical perspective—allows it to develop manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability.  DMEA can then use these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele.  After many years of performing analogous efforts the technical experience mission knowledge and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are often incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects.  DMEA’s capabilities make it a key tool in the intelligent and rapid development and application of advanced technologies to identified military needs.  Working alongside industry DMEA has created a model partnership that provides this capability for the Department.  DMEA’s unique flexible foundry supports the Department with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now assured to remain in one location for as long as they are needed.  To obtain these processes DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses.  These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed intellectual property (IP) and the related processes for Department needs.  These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry’s right to bid first on resulting production volumes.  DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components.  If not only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production.  A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners’ valuable IP and processes.  DMEA is Government owned and operated providing the structure and confidence that an industry partner’s IP is protected from potential competitors.  This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring installing and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department.  This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems combat operations and support needs.  As such DMEA serves the Department other US Agencies industry and Allied nations.DMEA assists hundreds of programs every year.

The Teleport program has fielded system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational approach with Generation 1 and 2 Full Deployment authorized by DoD Chief Information Officer on February 18 2011. Teleport Generation 3 consists of three phases; Phases 1 and 2 are in Production and Deployment while the Phase 3 is in Engineering and Manufacturing Development. Each Teleport investment increases the warfighter’s ability to communicate with a world-wide net-centric set of information capabilities which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.Currently the Teleport system operates as an upgrade of satellite communication capabilities at selected DoD satellite communications gateways.   This system provides deployed warfighters with seamless worldwide multi-band SATCOM connectivity to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Service Delivery Nodes and legacy tactical command control communications computers and intelligence systems. It also provides centralized integration capabilities contingency capacity and common interfaces to access the DISN. Teleport's goal is to provide secure seamless interoperable and economical upgrades to DoD SATCOM Gateways and meet the growing throughput requirements of the deployed warfighter.The primary beneficiaries of the Teleport investment are the DoD Combatant Commanders Military Departments Defense Agencies and the warfighter. Teleport Generation 3 is designed to meet the growing demands of the warfighter through the execution of the following phases:  Phase 1: Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency [Extended Data Rate] terminals provides tactical users with a 350% bandwidth increase in survivable anti-jam communications through all peacetime and combat operations by installing Navy Multiband Terminals (NMT) at select Teleport sites. In addition to enhanced throughput the NMT maintains compatibility with legacy waveforms and current tactical terminals. Phase 2: Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM X/Ka-band terminals provides enhanced Wideband Global System (WGS) X/Ka capability to warfighters worldwide by installing terminals from the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal (MET) program at Teleport and other gateway sites. This gateway enhancement allows Teleport to replace end-of-life Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) terminals while remaining interoperable with tactical WGS X/Ka-band users.  The MET enhancement provides a 300% Ka-band capacity increase and an 1100% X-band capacity increase to current enterprise terminal X/Ka capabilities. Additionally it enables the Teleport system to maintain operational availability consistent with Generation 2 requirements and reduce the overall life-cycle cost of X/Ka capabilities across the DoD. Phase 3: Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy UHF systems interoperability will provide interoperability between MUOS users and legacy UHF users by installing MUOS-to-Legacy UHF SATCOM Gateway Component (MLGC) suites of equipment at Teleport sites.  MUOS is the next generation DoD UHF SATCOM system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services utilizing the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band. MLGC suites will provide critical continuity and interoperability as DoD tactical satellite users transition from legacy waveforms and radios to the Joint Tactical Radio System.","24.504","Continuing","Continuing","","",

Through FY05 Polar Satellite Communications funded three low data rate (LDR) Milstar payloads on three classified host satellites as an expedited interim solution for protected connectivity requirements in the north polar region (i.e. Interim Polar System (IPS)).  Two satellites with hosted payloads are required to provide the necessary 24-hour coverage.  The third payload went into operations in November 2008 to sustain the 24-hour coverage.  In FY06 the DoD began funding the next generation Polar Satellite Communications capability with two more polar payloads via the same host vehicle type (i.e. Enhanced Polar System (EPS)).  The host spacecraft and the polar communications payloads required design modifications that replaced obsolete components and took advantage of the more capable Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) technology including the eXtended Data Rate (XDR) waveform.

The purpose is to help test organizations improve and develop their test infrastructure and capabilities to keep pace with improvements in weapon system technologies.  The improvement and modernization (I&M) requirements are defined through the AF Test Investment Planning & Programming (TIPP) Process.  All projects have been reviewed through the Tri-Service Reliance process (to communicate AF efforts to the other Services and avoid unwarranted duplication of effort) and are documented in the Technology Development Acquisition Program (TDAP) database.  Each project has its own planning development equipment acquisition equipment installation and checkout phases which often require significant differences in funding from one year to the next.  As such the changes in category funding from year to year do not necessarily indicate program growth but rather a planned phasing of improvement and modernization efforts.  The test capabilities at these locations enable testing through all phases of weapon system acquisition from system concept exploration through component and full scale integrated weapon system testing to operational testing.  These test organizations are a part of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) operated and maintained by the Air Force for DoD test and evaluation.  These national test assets are available to others requiring their unique capabilities.The 96TW at Eglin AFB FL conducts and supports developmental test and evaluation (DT&E) of non-nuclear air armaments; Command Control Communications Computers Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems; target acquisition and weapon delivery systems; navigation systems; provides a climatic simulation capability; determines target/test item spectral signatures; and provides Cyber testing capabilities as part of the Joint Information Operations (IO) Range.  The 96TG at Holloman AFB NM provides independent test and evaluation of inertial Global Positioning System and integrated systems used for aircraft navigation and missile guidance systems including vulnerability to electronic interference; provides the liaison function for coordinating and scheduling all US Air Force test operations at White Sands Missile Range; provides subsonic through hypersonic ground testing of aircraft and missiles in a flight-representative environment under highly instrumented conditions; and executes flight test and test support for advanced avionics and weapons development of joint international and commercial test programs.AEDC at Arnold AFB TN provides pre-flight and reliability ground environmental test support for DoD aeropropulsion flight systems and space and missile programs.  The center has 53 test facilities providing: aerodynamic testing of scale model aircraft missiles and space systems; testing of large and full-scale satellites sensors and space vehicles in a simulated space environment; altitude environmental testing for aircraft missile and spacecraft propulsion systems; and testing of large-scale models such as space boosters together with their propulsion systems.The 412th Test Wing at Edwards AFB CA conducts and supports DT&E and Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) of aircraft and aircraft systems aerospace research vehicles unmanned aerial vehicles cruise missiles parachute delivery/recovery/systems and cargo handling systems.I&M efforts within this PE are identified in four mission area categories:  Airframe/Propulsion/Avionics (APA); Armament/Munitions (A/M); Command Control Communications Computers Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (C4ISR); and Space.  These categories describe general types of effort that will be conducted in this PE.  APA provides planning improvements and modernization needed for test capabilities to conduct and support DT&E and OT&E of aircraft and aircraft systems aerospace research vehicles unmanned aerial vehicles cruise missiles parachute delivery/recovery systems cargo handling systems and turbine engines.  APA focuses on evaluation of the vehicle airframe propulsion system and avionics systems as well as overall systems integration testing.  It encompasses both ground test facilities and open-air range infrastructure including instrumentation and data processing.  A/M provides planning improvements and modernization to conduct DT&E of air-to-ground and air-to-air armaments and munitions which include gun chaff and flare systems as well as aerial decoy and target systems.  The A/M category encompasses the full range of DT&E from digital modeling and simulation to precision measurement testing to hardware-in-the-loop and installed systems testing to open-air range testing.  Elements of A/M DT&E include environmental warhead effectiveness arena blast/fragmentation guidance navigation and control aerodynamics propulsion electromagnetic interference and compatibility mass properties seeker and signature measurement survivability lethality integration reliability net-centric and terminal effects testing.  A/M also involves the design and development of systems needed to support A/M DT&E including the design and development sleds targets range support systems and various instrumentation and measurement systems.  C4ISR provides planning improvements and modernization to conduct DT&E of systems that support C2 functions which range from air campaign planning at the theater level to wing level C2 operations to planning individual missions to putting weapons on target using concepts such as machine to machine targeting.  C4ISR includes ground and flight performance testing of airborne C2 networks and tactical data links air operation centers mission planning systems multi-level security systems radio and communication systems ISR systems information assurance systems and radar systems such as those used by JSTARS and air traffic control systems.  C4ISR conducts DT&E on a full range of systems covering the sensor (detection) to the shooter (weapon) including functional and environmental testing of these systems.  C4ISR includes DT&E for offensive and defensive Cyber capabilities.  Space provides planning improvements and modernization needed for test capabilities to perform developmental and operational testing for space and launch acquisition and sustainment programs.  Test capabilities include launch vehicle satellite missile sensor thermal protection system signature hardness and interface testing.  The capabilities reside at Vandenberg Kirtland Arnold Patrick Schriever Peterson Holloman Air Force Bases and others.  Infrastructure includes launch sites mobile control units thermal vacuum chambers sled track arc heated wind tunnels ballistic test ranges signature collection and the requisite personnel.

As a result U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) identified three needs: 1) to rapidly augment existing space capabilities when needed to expand operational capability; 2) to rapidly reconstitute/replenish critical space capabilities to preserve "continuity of operations" capability; 3) to rapidly exploit and infuse space technological or operational innovations to increase U.S. advantage. Since the ORS standup in 2007 the terms resiliency and responsiveness in association with space programs are now seen in almost every policy and guidance document not just at the DoD level but at a National level as well.  Resilience has become a key criterion in evaluating alternative architectures including cost-effective space system protection hosting payloads on a mix of platforms in various orbits drawing on distributed international and commercial partner capabilities and developing and maturing responsive space capabilities.  The Air Force is transitioning the activities of the ORS program and synergistically applying its efforts to other space technology efforts.This refocused effort will integrate the operationally responsive space efforts lessons learned principles and activities into other Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) programs of record.  SMC will then be better able to improve resilience survivability and flexibility within programs across the SMC portfolio and to explore space mission augmentation options.The Department of Defense will support the new approach by developing architectures for space mission areas that will include international cooperation and commercial solutions and will also look at how space missions are sustained and augmented to support the warfighter in all contingencies.  The end result of the program's termination will be that operationally responsive space activities are fully integrated into SMC's ongoing architectures and Space Modernization Initiative increasing resilience and flexibility in space systems.This program is in Budget Activity 04 Advanced Component Development and Prototypes because the efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies representative modes and prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic environment.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

The Air Force Research Lab Rome Research Site Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division (AFRL/RIE) works directly with users employing evolutionary approaches and integrating finished modules directly into the field.  The programs are oriented toward specific shortfalls and deficiencies as documented by the Major Commands (MAJCOMS) unified commands and intelligence organizations in their mission and functional area plans. This PE expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational users via rapid prototyping focusing on technology insertion correcting AF intelligence deficiencies at the tactical and operational levels. This PE bridges the technology transition from Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) and Integrated Technology Thrust Programs (ITTPs) into current/new systems and also supports the associated Defense Technology Objectives (DTOs). IAD may also reallocate existing resources to support out-of-cycle new/updated warfighter requirements. Requirements for this PE are gathered and prioritized by the Air Force Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency (AF ISR Agency). Development of new/improved capabilities to meet the requirements is managed by AFRL/RIE. Prototype products usually in the form of software once evaluated by the users are transferred to the operational environment.

It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapons cargo passenger and/or fuel delivery calculate fuel requirements and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review print and brief the mission plan; and download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics.The Mission Planning Systems (MPS) program is a collaborative program with the Army and Navy to leverage technical solutions and business practices for all Department of Defense (DoD) platforms.  It provides automated mission planning tools and support for fixed and rotary wing aircraft and guided munitions.  It replaced two closed architecture legacy mission planning systems (Unix-based MPS (Unix-MPS) and the PC-based Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS)) with a single multi-service open architecture system more commonly referred to as the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).  MPS will compress the mission planning cycle by providing an improved integrated planning environment reducing the time required to respond to changing situations and urgent needs such as striking time sensitive/critical targets and conducting combat search and rescue.  The MPS development program will migrate a variety of Air Force aircraft weapons and airdrop payload systems from legacy mission planners to MPS.  These systems include but are not limited to the: A-10 B-1B C-5 C-17 C-130 E-3 E-8 F-15 F-16 F-22A RC-135 HH-60 and their associated weapons (e.g. Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Munitions (JASSM) etc.) and airdrop payloads.  In addition basic MPS products have the potential to support all DoD fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft and will be shared with other AF programs as well as the Army and Navy.  MPS will deliver significant benefits to command and control performance by enhancing information superiority for the warfighter and by providing unique capabilities in support of both precision engagement and dominant maneuver.  To meet the unique needs of Air Mobility Command (AMC) the Mobility Air Force Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS) component of MPS will provide a centralized/net-centric global mobility mission flight planning capability. This service will provide significant fuel savings through automated flight route optimization utilizing aircraft performance air traffic management weather and other data.  Additionally elements of Mission Planning Systems will be utilized to continue the development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) in conjunction with the Army.The JPADS System of Systems (SoS) capability provides a planning and execution capability for DoD airdrop requirements. It is the primary airdrop mission planning and execution system for all ballistic airdrop mission as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and/or standoff precision delivery.  JPADS enables high-altitude precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces mitigating surface-to-air threats reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and insurgent attack on ground convoys. JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather terrain aircraft capabilities threat etc. to accurately deliver payloads to keep the warfighter supplied and in the fight.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development which includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

The F-15C/D continues to provide air superiority with an undefeated and unmatched aerial combat record.  The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems such as advanced imaging and targeting systems to meet the requirement for all-weather deep penetration and night/under-the-weather air-to-surface attack.  Configured with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) the F-15E deploys worldwide with minimal tanker support and arrives combat-ready.  A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad upgrades to the F-15 (avionics armament airframe and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality survivability and supportability). Projected to remain in service past 2030 avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability.  This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors) forestalling obsolescence exploiting proven technological advances and leveraging new technology.  Major avionics upgrades center around radar modernization (both hardware and software upgrades) and the exploitation of enhanced capability via precision timing data delivery and processing technology precision registration systems cockpit Head Up Display (HUD) instrumentation digitization and modernization central computer processing power increases digital mission event recording systems and an infrared (IR) based fire control system.  Funds are also used as required to resolve Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. The proliferation of fourth generation enemy aircraft and sophisticated "double-digit" anti-aircraft missile systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability.  A fully integrated electronic warfare suite holds the promise of providing survivability as well as expanded electronic attack capability. Nearly all improvements are linked to an aircraft operational flight program update schedule that works to integrate new capabilities with the airframe.  These updates are a responsive way to increase the offensive and defensive capability and survivability of the F-15.  Incorporation of corresponding spiral and/or phased technology/equipment improvements that include support equipment mission planning systems and training device upgrades will improve performance supportability and aircrew trainingThis program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

USNDS supports NUDET detection requirements across five mission areas: Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) Nuclear Force Management (NFM) Space Control (SC) Treaty Monitoring (TM) and a classified mission.  The USNDS program is jointly sponsored and funded by the Department of Defense (DoD) through the US Air Force and the Department of Energy (DOE) through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its Nuclear Detonation Detection (NA-22) office respectively. NNSA/NA-22 supplies at no cost to DoD USNDS NUDET space sensors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the Air Force's USNDS Program Office which is responsible for all acquisition and systems engineering integration and test (SEIT) activities on space vehicles (SVs) to include Global Positioning System (GPS) and additional hosts and their supporting ground control segments.DoD funds their contribution to the NDS program in Program Element (PE) 0305913F with RDT&EAF OPAF and Operation & Maintenance (O&M) dollars. NDS payload integration onto GPS satellites is funded in the GPS Space & Control PE 0305165F for GPS IIF and in the GPS III Space Segment PE 0305265F for GPS III.USNDS consists of both space and ground segments.  The space segment sensors funded by DOE consists of three nuclear detection sensor payloads: the Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) payload for Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites the Global Burst Detection (GBD) payload for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) platforms (GPS satellites) and the Space Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) payload for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) platforms (classified GEO hosts). The RADEC sensor includes neutron gamma optical and X-ray sensors.  The GBD payload consists of optical x-ray and Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) sensors.  The SABRS payload consists of neutron gamma ray and space environmental sensors. Together these sensors comprise the global NUDET detection capability for USNDS. Space sensors communicate NUDET indications to the ground control segment which includes the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS) Ground NDS Terminals (GNTs) and Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs) when fielded. These ground systems funded by the Air Force perform data analysis and provide a decision support tool to the Air Force controllers concerning probability of NUDET occurrence. ICADS resides on two fixed ground terminals as well as GNT which provides ground receiving analysis and reporting capabilities to national authorities commands and forward users.  The ground control segment is being modernized and continuously improved through an incremental evolution acquisition approach.  The upgrade to the GNT is the Universal Ground Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) Terminal (UGNT) which is funded with RDT&E AF in this PE. The UGNT provides NUDET Detection Reports to end users supports Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) missions and provides survivable and endurable USNDS communications via Milstar/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) circuits. The UGNT program modifies the baseline of the GNT program and deploys as an integral part of the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Survivable / Endurable Evolution (S2E2) Mobile Ground System (SMGS) units.  The UGNT when integrated with the SMGS will perform NUDET event processing with fused NDS data from GPS and DSP.  SMGS capability refers to the result of the S2E2 upgrade program for the MGS mission processing capability including the integration of UGNT.  The intended end state of UGNT integration is delivery of enhanced missile warning and NUDET detection capabilities that meet survivable/endurable ITW/AA requirements directed by the President SECDEF Joint Staff and USSTRATCOM delivering long-term cost effective multi-role multi-mission space effects to the war fighter across the range of military operations.This NDS PE 0305913F includes systems engineering research development manufacture integration on-orbit and field testing and end-to-end verification of USNDS space sensors ground analysis and reporting systems in support of the 5 (five) USNDS mission areas.

The Integrated Sensor IS Structure (ISIS) project was planned to develop a radar which is fully integrated into a station-keeping stratospheric airship. ISIS supports the nation's need for persistent wide-area surveillance tracking and engagement of time-critical air and ground targets. Automated surveillance and tracking includes air targets to the radar horizon of 600 km and all ground targets to a range of 300 km. The radar aperture is intended to provide track data directly to users in-theater. The objective system was planned to launch from CONUS locations with a multi-year operational life.The Blue Devil Block 2 (BD2) project was an Air Force-led single ship technology and concept demonstration of multi-intelligence cross-platform tipping and cueing of fused SIGINT wide area and high-definition (HD) EO/IR motion imagery on a persistent lighter-than-air (LTA) airship.  BD2 was intended to employ a payload integration infrastructure (PII) with a Command and Control (C2) and Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) Ground Station in mid FY 2012 through FY 2013.

CEC distributes sensor data from each ship and aircraft or cooperating unit (CU) to all other CUs in the battle force through a real-time line of sight high data rate sensor and engagement data distribution network. CEC is highly resistant to jamming and provides accurate gridlocking between CUs. Each CU independently employs high capacity parallel processing and advanced algorithms to combine all distributed sensor data into a fire control quality track picture which is the same for all CUs. CEC data is presented as a superset of the best AAW sensor capabilities from each CU all of which are integrated into a single input to each CU's combat weapons system. CEC significantly improves our Battle Force defense in depth including both local area and ship defense capabilities against current and future AAW threats. Moreover CEC provides critical connectivity and integration of over-land air defense systems capable of countering emerging air threats including land attack cruise missiles in a complex littoral environment.CEC consists of the Data Distribution System (DDS) the Cooperative Engagement Processor (CEP) and interface with Combat Systems and sensors. The DDS encodes and distributes own-ship sensor and engagement data and is a high capacity jam resistant directive system providing a precision gridlocking and high throughput of data. The CEP is a high capacity distributed processor that processes force levels of data in near real-time. The data is passed to the ship's combat system as high quality data for which the ship can cue its onboard sensors or use the data to engage targets without actually tracking them. CEC incorporates Advanced Capability Build-12 (ACB-12) into the CEC baseline for FY09 - FY13.The Navy implemented a Signal Data Processor (SDP) approach to modify the current equipment to meet reduced size weight cost power and cooling objectives. This SDP approach also supports continuity for interoperability improvements and program protection as well as supporting open architecture initiatives and comms independence. The SDP will provide hardware which complies with Category 3 Open Architecture Computing Environment (OACE) standards with rehosted existing software which will be fielded fleet-wide to allow affordable replacement of obsolete computing system components and eliminate dependencies on "closed" equipment operating systems and middleware.Additionally CEC is working with the Army to engineer a Joint Track Management (JTM) and sensor measurement fusion capability which will be implemented in their respective programs to achieve interoperability across the battle space.COMOPTEVFOR found the AN/USG-3 (E-2C Airborne CEC) Operationally Effective but not Operationally Suitable. Reliability and availability issues are addressed by the replacement of four Weapons replaceable Assemblies (WRAs) with the new SDP-S. Backfit of the SDP-S in the E-2C will resolve suitability issues and satisfy National Security Agency (NSA) directed Crypto Modernization requirements.  The SDP-S will also be used in E-2D.A family of antennas approach will be used to satisfy CEC requirements with lower life cycle costs (procurement installation and maintenance) and reduced weight (on mast and below deck).  These antennas enable future capability as well as providing a solution extensible to additional platforms.  This effort for Common Array Block (CAB) antennas will be competed and awarded to a single Design Agent in FY12 and a competitive award for production is planned for FY14.Large Nets respond to emergent needs of operational forces and missions provides an extensible foundation for capability growth provides interoperability with legacy units in Global Mode. This will provide an increase in DDS network size. This is needed to improve multiple battle group operations. Applicable ships and systems include all CEC deployed units and future fielding to include CG/DDG Modernization and its Pathfinder Programs. Data Distribution System (DDS) must increase nodes to support the increasing number of fielded CEC assets.In support of Interoperability CEC will continue to work collaboratively with other Combat Systems programs (AWS E-2C E-2D SSDS CDLMS C2P and SGS/AC) to develop the software and implement design corrections and system changes. CEC will analyze the interactions of interoperability issues and impacts and provide collaboration for development of CEC and other system changes. Develop the long term solutions including the engineering process to validate small parts of developmental software ideas and utilize M&S to validate design approaches in the systems engineering realm.","329.287","Continuing","Continuing","582","",

Analysis and demonstration have established that surface SSD based on single-sensor detection point-to-point control architecture is inadequate against current and projected Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats.  The supersonic seaskimming ASCM reduces the effective battle space to the horizon and the available reaction time-line to less than 30 seconds from first opportunity to detect until the ASCM impacts its target ship.  Against such a threat multi-sensor integration is required for effective detection and parallel processing is essential to reduce reaction time to acceptable levels and to provide vital coordination/integration of hardkill and softkill assets. These SSD projects address and coordinate the detect and control functions necessary to meet the rigorous SSD requirements. DETECTION: Improvements in coordinated sensor performance to increase the probability of detecting low altitude low observable targets are to be achieved through the synergism gained from the integration of dissimilar sensor sources.  Multi-sensor integration is being addressed through the efforts of Quick Reaction Combat Capability (QRCC PU 2178). This provides improvements to both active and passive detection. CONTROL: Multi-sensor integration parallel processing and the coordination of hardkill/softkill capabilities in an automated doctrine-based response to the ASCM threats are the cornerstones of Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) being developed through QRCC (PU 2178) efforts.  In addition this project provides for the central system engineering management for the integration of SSD developments including efforts required to integrate SSDS with the Advanced Combat Direction System (ACDS) functionality for those ships having a CDS with the Open Architecture Computing Environment and with advanced sensor weapon and C4I upgrades.  The SSDS Training Improvement Program (PU 3358) is for the integration of Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC) improvements into the SSDS Advanced Capability Build (ACB) and Technology Insertion (TI) efforts under QRCC (PU 2178).Integrated Swimmer Defense (ISD PU3306) scope is to provide the Navy Expeditionary security forces with capabilities of a portable marine integrated swimmer defense system (ISDS) to engage combat swimmers/divers or unknown individuals underwater once they have been detected.Non-Lethal Weapons (PU 3172) provides a long range laser warning and dazzle systems for use in the maritime environment.  Optical warning and distraction has been identified by the services as a possible technology solution to mitigate and/or address several known joint non-lethal capability gaps.","662.132","Continuing","Continuing","","",

ISSP includes protection of the Navy's National Security Systems and Information (NSSI).ISSP is the Navy's implementation of statutory and regulatory requirements specified in Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA 44 U.S.C. section 3541) the Computer Security Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-235) Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. section 552a Public Law No. 93-579) National Security Act of 1947 (Public Law 235) Comprehensive National Cyber security Initiative (CNCI) National Security Presidential Directive 54/Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23 (NSPD-54/ HSPD-23) National Security Directive 42 Presidential Decision Directive 63 Executive Order 13526 Appendix III of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130 Revised Committee for National Security Systems (CNSS) Policy 22 Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Instructions 6510.01F and 6510.02D Department of Defense (DoD) Directives 8500.01 O-8530.01 and 8570.01 the new DoD Instruction 8500.02 and CNSS Instruction 1253.ISSP activities address the risk management of cyberspace defined in "The National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dec 2006 of defensive Information Operations (IO) defined in Joint Publication 3-13 including the capabilities to protect detect restore and respond. ISSP supports the entire naval cyberspace domain from the mobile forward-deployed subscriber through the ashore supporting critical information infrastructure and the interconnection with other cyberspace domains. Navy cyberspace is a higher value and more vulnerable target due to the interconnectivity of naval and joint networks connections to allied and coalition partners connections to the public information infrastructure and their use in naval and joint war fighting. Navy cyber systems face advanced attacks involving malicious changes to critical information changes to the functionality of critical systems denial of service (including jamming) and the destruction of systems and networks. Since many naval cyber systems are based on commercially available technologies adversaries often have access to the technologies they seek to exploit.Rapid changes in the underlying commercial and government cyber infrastructures makes cyber security an increasingly complex and dynamic problem. ISSP provides the Navy's warfighter the essential information trust characteristics of availability confidentiality integrity authentication and non-repudiation. Information Assurance (IA)/Computer Network Defense (CND) key supporting cyber security activities must evolve quickly to meet the rapidly evolving threats and vulnerabilities. Implementing ISSP requires rapid acquisition approaches to stay ahead of nation-states terrorists and criminal organization adversaries among others.The Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) provides the Navy with the following cyber security elements: (1) defense of Navy's National Security Systems and Information (NSSI); (2) assured separation of information levels and user communities including allied coalition non-Governmental Defense Industrial Base and other public partners; 3) technologies supporting the Navy's Computer Network Defense Service Providers (CNDSP) operations; (4) assurance of the Navy's telecommunications infrastructure and the wireless spectrum; (5) assurance of joint-user cyberspace domains using a defense-in-depth architecture; (6) assurance of the critical computing base and information store; and (7) supporting assurance technologies including the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). The ISSP program must be rapid predictive adaptive and tightly coupled to cyberspace technology. Through modeling and simulation of Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial cyberspace systems evolution the ISSP program provides architectures products and services based on mission impacts information criticality threats vulnerabilities and required defensive countermeasure capabilities.All ISSP Research Development Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) efforts comply with the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-113) as implemented through Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-119 of February 10 1998 DoD Instruction 4120.24 Defense Standardization Program (DSP) and DoD Instruction 4120.3-M Defense Standardization Program Policies and Procedures. The predominant commercial standard bodies in ISSP-related matters include International Organization for Standardization American National Standards Institute Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Internet Engineering Task Force World Wide Web Consortium and National Institute of Standards and Technologies. The joint interoperability required in today's telecommunications systems makes standards compliance a must and the ISSP RDT&E program complies with the joint technical architecture. The FORCEnet architecture and standards documents reflect this emphasis on interoperable standards.The connection of FORCEnet with the DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) requires all ISSP RDT&E activities to adopt a minimum standard of "best commercial IA practices." The ISSP program examines commercial technologies to determine their fit within Navy architectures provides feedback to vendors about what the Navy requires and participates in thestandard bodies themselves. When necessary to protect mission critical systems specified in the Clinger/Cohen Act ISSP RDT&E develops or tailors commercial and government technologies standards and processes to meet Navy-unique requirements; prototypes systems or portions of systems and examines their utility in operational Navy settings; andprovides Information Assurance (IA) expertise and engineering to Navy and joint information system developments. All ISSP technology development efforts endeavor to solve specific Navy and joint IA problems using techniques that speed transition to procurement as soon as possible.Maritime Operations Center (MOC) will respond to new technologies and advanced hardware and software tools to support the development and deployment towards automated autonomous Computer Network Operations (CNO) Network Operations (NetOps).Justification for Budget Activity: This program is funded under Operational Systems Development because it encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for the upgrade and integration of existing operational systems.

The budget enables Acquisition Category (ACAT) III development to address Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) defined capability-based requirements and mission needs. This Program Element (0205632N/0366) is tied to development programs that leverage a joint United States/Australia Armaments Cooperative Project (ACP) to develop MK-48 ADCAP CBASS; and Future Naval Capability (FNC) technologies developed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR).														Countermeasure (CM) sophistication and availability on the open market directly affects ADCAP kill proficiency and its ability to counter rapidly evolving threats. The focus of the MK-48 ADCAP torpedo Research and Development (R&D) program from FY 2001 and out shifted from being primarily concentrated on Software Block Upgrade efforts towards coordinated hardware upgrades rapid Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) insertion and APBs to rapidly upgrade the ADCAP to counter evolving threats and maintain robust performance. The CBASS program developed and fielded a broadband sonar capable of identifying CMs and discriminating them from the target. CBASS Phase I achieved IOC in FY 2006.  The Commonwealth of Australia Royal Navy is jointly participating to develop CBASS Phase II to improve shallow water performance and signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) extension November 2009.  The MOA extension expires Nov 2019.				The MK-48 ADCAP torpedo R&D program focuses on two specific areas near term; Torpedo APBs and hardware tech insertions. The CNO continues to stress shallow water (less than 600 feet) as a critical operating area to counter third world diesel electric submarines. Torpedo testing in shallow water has demonstrated that in-service ADCAP has less than full capability in this difficult environment. However this testing in conjunction with laboratory simulation efforts has shown that significant performance improvements can be made by implementing changes to weapon tactics and software algorithms. Development implementation and testing of these changes is being accomplished under the Torpedo APB program. The APB program also leverages the RAN joint torpedo program and FNC technologies developed by the ONR in the areas of torpedo broadband signal processing tactics processing and alertment. The Torpedo tech insertion program will leverage the MK-54 Lightweight torpedo algorithms. Further hardware investment involves development of Guidance & Control (G&C) replacement required to support production and development of Automated Test Equipment replacement to improve comprehensive system testing of full up CBASS Torpedoes.The Torpedo Technology Insertion program will provide for evolutionary torpedo improvements and upgrades (including the transition and testing of advanced technologies from the R&D community).  This approach will incorporate developmental testing of the FNC transitioning technologies for ADCAP upgrades in the areas of torpedo sensors weapon/platform connectivity warhead lethality speed and depth. These efforts will continue torpedo development investment at a lower cost and shorter term than traditional torpedo programs.The MK-48 ADCAP torpedo program completed the OT phase of testing Spiral 4 on ACOT and CBASS units in 1st Qtr 2013 in support of IOC.APB5 software upgrades are currently in process for MK-48 ADCAP torpedoes.  FNC technologies and MK-54 Lightweight torpedo developments will be transitioned into ADCAP through APBs and Technology Insertion packages. Priorities for APBs and Technology Insertion are; (1) Improved torpedo effectiveness through advanced processing algorithms (2) advanced counter-countermeasure capability and (3) a new array to improve torpedo effectiveness.","164.443","Continuing","Continuing","","",

The ATCCS program provides automation in the five battlefield functional areas (BFAs) with the following specific systems: (1) Maneuver Control System (MCS); (2) Effects and Fires Command and Control Systems (EFCCS); (3) All Source Analysis System (ASAS) for Intelligence/Electronic Warfare; (4) Forward Area Air Defense Command Control and Intelligence System (FAADC2I); and (5) Battle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3). To provide an overall technically sound cost effective and operationally responsive approach the design and development of ATCCS must be accomplished on a total systems basis. The Common Hardware Systems (CHS) program provides state-of-the-art fully qualified interoperable compatible deployable and survivable hardware and computer networking equipment for command control and communications at all echelons of command for the United States Army and other Department of Defense (DoD) services. CHS services are provided through strategically located contractor-operated Regional Support Centers (RSC) for tactical military units and management of a comprehensive 5-year warranty and 72-hour turnaround for repairs. Common Software(CS) is the program through which the Army procures develops integrates and tests common software products and/or components used for communication between ABCS Joint and coalition Command and Control (C2) applications. The CS project provides state-of-the-art software technologies and functionality that is used by numerous Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS) and joint systems to eliminate the need for service independent development and duplication of effort. The CS project also manages and performs technology demonstrations of emerging technologies for future use by Army C2 systems. The CS program is a cornerstone in the Army's digitization efforts. Funding supports on-going development of common software solutions and the technical evaluation of previously developed software capabilities for integration into the computing environments of the Army COE architecture to include appropriate Mounted and Mobile Computing environments. Efforts will include assessment of softwarematurity and readiness development/modification of software as necessary to integrate integration with common computing environments and validation. This program element also includes the Central Technical Support Facility (CTSF) which is the Army's single strategic facility responsible for executing SoS Interoperability checkout testing physical system integration and configuration management of the Army's LandWarNet Baseline. The Technical Management Division (TMD) effectively manages the engineering Enterprise and Integration efforts within the Program Executive Office Command Control Communication and Tactical (PEO C3T) portfolio of technology and across the capability enhancement packages to deliver efficient and effective cross-domain technical solutions. TMD efforts will focus on System-of-Systems (SOS) engineering and integration for evolution of the network (Warfighter Information Network-Tactical Joint Tactical Radio System) and associated services (Unified Battle Command Joint Battle Command-Platform Net-Enabled Command Capability Network Service Center) with increased emphasis on immediate Warfighter needs as well as leveraging emerging technologies. TMD efforts support working Army Network Modernization strategy and implementation to include: network integration; emerging technologies; coordination of network services; current and force integrated Command Control Communications Computers Combat Systems Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) network/transport architectures; integrated developmental technical and operational test schedules/documentation; and the tactical assessment and execution of the enterprise implementation and framework. TMD synchronizes the integration of many Headquarters Department Of The Army (HQDA) initiatives and also oversees the technical analysis supporting the Army Common Operating Environment (COE) Assessment and implementation. The JNN Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T Increment 1) is intended to replace MSE while moving the Army to a unified EOIP Communications System. JNN Testing is the Increment 1b Technical Insertion to Increment 1a for Operational Test which was conducted in FY 2012 in conjunction with the Increment 2 Initial Operational Test and Evaluation. These systems support the Legacy to Objective transition path. The network is capable of passing unclassified and classified traffic throughout its entire structure from Home Station Operations center to the furthest forward Battalion Elements.

Biometrics Center of Excellence:  DoDD 8521.01E directs the BCoE to conduct biometrics S&T research and engineering for the DoD and other USG sponsors in support of the DoD S&T Roadmap. The BCoE will conduct biometrics test and evaluation activities to include standards conformance testing (which include evaluations and assessments of biometric-enabled IT devices and systems that interoperate with the authoritative biometric database); support DoD acquisition organizations in developmental testing systems integration and independent verification and validation; support operational test and evaluation activities that determine system operational effectiveness and suitability; and acquire and conduct COTS and GOTS testing to identify functionality performance and conformance to DoD standards.The Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) is the Department of Defense's (DoD) authoritative biometric enterprise database repository. The current operational capability is the Next Generation Automated Biometrics Identification System (NG-ABIS aka DoD-ABIS); it will transition to the BEC Increment 0 Program of Record (POR) at the Full Deployment Decision (FDD). NG-ABIS receives multi-modal biometric submissions from collection devices allowing the Warfighter to distinguish friend from foe and enabling near real-time retention capture or release decisions. The system has a direct impact on the availability of critical intelligence information that is of vital interest to DoD and other government agencies in efforts to capture detain question and deny access to known and emerging threats to our National Security. Latent fingerprint matching allows the Warfighter to accurately identify and detain those responsible for Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) weapons trafficking and other terrorist attacks against US and partner nation's assets across the globe. NG-ABIS stores processes shares and matches four different biometric modalities (fingerprint facial images palm-prints and iris patterns) against over 9.5 million records as it searches for known and suspected terrorists enemies and persons of interest. The system uses advanced algorithms to combine partial matches of multiple biometric modalities in order to increase the frequency of conclusive and automated matches; thereby decreasing the amount of required manpower.BEC Increment 1 will build upon the success of NG-ABIS/BEC Increment 0 and will include a web-based interface and cross-domain security capabilities across the SECRET and UNCLASSIFIED security domains. It will also build upon the current capability with increased matching throughput (number of records that can be processed within 24 hours) increased storage capacity and the ability to process bulk biometric submissions. BEC Inc 1 will have an automated customizable Biometric Enabled Watch List (BEWL) that will be electronically input into the system and link an individual's record to the watchlist. This will facilitate on-demand access and development of watchlist data and provide match alerts to the collector through their collection system as well as to the intelligence community. This future system will also streamline interoperability and data sharing with government agencies and stakeholders including the Department of Justice (DOJ) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) Department of State (DOS) United States Central Command (CENTCOM) United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and other DoD and Federal agencies as required and in accordance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 24/National Security Presidential Directive 59.BEC Increment 1 is currently conducting Pre-Milestone B acquisition activities to support a Pre-EMD and Milestone B decision reviews planned for FY2014.","","","","","",

The C2BMC enables the BMDS to manage complex threats -- near simultaneous enemy missile shots aimed at theater regional or homeland assets. The systems linked through C2BMC include Phased Array Tracking Radar Intercept on Target (PATRIOT) Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Ground Based Midcourse Defense (GMD); and sensors such as the Army Navy/Ground Transportable Radar Surveillance model 2 (AN/TPY-2) radar Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX) Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and (BMDS) Overhead Persistent Infra-Red (OPIR) Architecture (BOA). The C2BMC Program will ship a C2BMC Deployable Interface Node (CDIN) in support of a second forward based AN/TPY-2 to the Pacific Command. The C2BMC program will install communications support Hardware-in-the-Loop (HWIL) integration testing provide operations and sustainment and training. Based on the Missile Defense Agency`s defined architectures and system specifications the C2BMC program will provide the warfighter the capability to plan the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) fight while concurrently tracking all potential ballistic missile threats and pairing any sensor with any shooter to defeat ballistic missile threats at any range in any phase in all theaters. C2BMC battle management via the Global Engagement Manager (GEM) will deliver full AN/TPY-2 X-Band radar sensor control and capabilities for improved threat object correlation which calculates a common threat track from multiple sensors through data fusion with sufficient data accuracy and timeliness for BMDS weapon elements to enable successful engagements via Link-16 and satellite communications. The C2BMC program also works to increase coalition partners` capabilities. The C2BMC Program will expand defense of the United States allies and deployed forces by continuing work that enables a coordinated missile defense against short - to long - range threats in multiple regions/theaters. One of the best ways to dissuade deter and defeat ballistic missile threats is through integrated ballistic missile defense capabilities: weapons; sensors; and command and control battle management and communications. A potential or actual attack may cross regions and may fly higher and faster than stand-alone autonomous capabilities operated by a single Military Service can defend against. Integrated Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities draw on space- land- and sea-based assets operated by multiple Services to provide the best sensor information about the enemy missiles location and track a more diverse and effective set of weapon options to be used by the Combatant Commander to defeat the attack; with all connected by a unifying Command and Control Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) system. As a result an effort funded in a program element may be critical to the success of efforts in other program elements. These connections are referred to as interdependencies.MD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management costs in support of the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).","1674.244","Continuing","Continuing","","",

The suite of remote ground-based sensors provide early warning midcourse and terminal ballistic missile defense threat data enabling layered detection and tracking of ballistic missile targets providing fire-control quality position velocity and discrimination data through Command and Control Battle Management Communications (C2BMC). Overlapping sensor coverage of geographically diverse sensors provides improved threat track data as well as reducing the loss of any one sensor and reducing the potential impact of countermeasures. The extended coverage and accuracy provided by a network of layered sensors increases the defensive footprint and reduces the number of target engagements required thereby conserving interceptor inventory and ensuring a high probability of successful engagement. Networked forward-based sensors enables C2BMC to pair the best sensor coverage with the best available weapon system to provide the most effective defense against ballistic missile threats. The BMD Sensors Program contributes to regional missile defense through the following activities: Development delivery and deployment or redeployment of remote forward based Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance and Control (AN/TPY-2) radars to include radars for tests or operations. Radars provide early warning track and discrimination data through all phases of ballistic missile flight. Through the BMDS C2BMC and coalition data links the AN/TPY-2 provides fire control data to enable remote Standard Missile (SM)-3 engagements by Aegis BMD to allow earlier engagement by the Arrow Weapon System and to cue deployed THAAD and U.S. and partner Patriot batteries. Provides the enhancements/development of AN/TPY-2 software across the fleet of radars. Lessons learned from each radar are addressed in new software builds that are developed tested and subsequently installed at each radar. AN/TPY-2 radars can be configured to operate either as a THAAD Fire Unit Radar (terminal mode) or Forward-Based Radar. These radars are transportable adding flexibility to respond to geographical changes in threats. Under this Program Element seven AN/TPY-2 radars have completed manufacturing. The AN/TPY-2 used in a forward-based role provides detection and tracking during the boost phase. This significantly reduces the uncertainty in target discrimination and reaction time increasing the probability of a successful BMDS engagement. In forward-based mode the AN/TPY-2 also provides acquisition and track data via the BMDS C2BMC and Link 16 to the Aegis missile defense system for cueing. The AN/TPY-2 used in terminal mode is an integral component of the THAAD Battery. The THAAD battery radar is capable of tracking multiple threats and multiple interceptors during engagements in the terminal phase. It provides surveillance acquisition track discrimination interceptor communications and hit assessment data collection for the fire control. The current and planned utilization of the AN/TPY-2 radars supports GMD THAAD and the Aegis Weapon System via C2BMC. The Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) network of sensors also includes the Cobra Dane Radar at Eareckson Air Force Station in Alaska and the Upgraded Early Warning Radars (UEWR) at Beale Air Force Base CA Fylingdales Royal Air Force Station United Kingdom and at Thule Air Force Station in Greenland. These Ultra High Frequency Early Warning Radars (EWR) have been upgraded to include missile defense functionality. This upgrade expands the capabilities of the U.S. to include defense against limited long-range threats. The Clear EWR located at Clear Air Force Station AK is also being upgraded to include missile defense functionality. Upgrade activities began in FY 2012 and are expected to be completed in FY 2017. The addition of the Clear UEWR into the BMDS sensor architecture will improve BMDS sensor coverage and provide new engagement options against long-range missile threats and reduce reliance on the Cobra Dane asset. The BMDS Sensors Program also contributes to the testing and proving of the U.S. missile defense systems through the following activities: -Participation in BMDS flight and ground test campaigns -Modeling and simulation (M&S) efforts to include: enhanced sensor models development of Radio Frequency scene generators integration of digital simulations into the BMDS M&S architecture and Verification Validation and Accreditation of radar models.MD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management costs in support of the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).","509.898","Continuing","Continuing","","",

Based on the Systems Engineering assessments of realistic threat scenarios test events demonstrate capability of the evolving integrated layered missile defense system in a simultaneous test and operations environment. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) employs a systematic review of BMDS testing that establishes a convention for setting test objectives that go beyond simply exercising newly delivered elements of the system. The BMDS Test Program establishes and documents in the Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP) the test requirements for the BMDS with specific focus on collecting the data needed for the verification validation and accreditation (VV&A) of the BMDS models and simulations (M&S). The BMDS performance evaluation strategy is to develop M&S of the BMDS and compare predictions to empirical data collected through comprehensive flight and ground testing to validate accuracy. Critical Engagement Conditions (CECs) and Empirical Measurement Events (EMEs) are the conditions and events which define or describe the data to be obtained from flight and ground tests in order to independently accredit M&S. CECs and EMEs are utilized to design a test to further advance the understanding and confidence of the M&S tool set that will be used to evaluate all possible engagements. MDA testing is based on an integrated developmental and operational test program. The MDA Test Program is based on a commitment to deploy technology that is proven cost-effective and adaptable to an evolving security environment. MDA in full collaboration with its IMTP stakeholders: Combatant Commands; Service Operational Test Agencies (OTAs); Director Operational Test & Evaluation; and Director Developmental Test and Evaluation develops and approves the IMTP which aligns the BMDS Test Program to the PAA phases for proven capability delivery. This PE provides consolidated MDA-wide capabilities and resources for the planning design execution provision of infrastructure and management of BMDS testing. This PE also provides funding to the Operational Test Agencies (OTA) which are active in all phases of test planning execution and post-test analysis to include the development of the IMTP.

As a result we anticipate less partner funding for those strategic investment areas and will have to rely on greater partner funding for other Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) projects.  Overall we envision fewer JCTD projects that will be longer in duration.Today's operations require faster delivery of new capabilities.  Therefore the JCTD Program works to accelerate project selection encourage capability demonstration of less than two years where possible but supports longer term projects (three years or more) when technical challenges warrant it.  This revised process includes:  streamlined project approval and initiation; clear one-year deliverables and decision points for projects greater than a year in duration; and annual reviews of ongoing JCTDs to assess deliverables and continuation of the project.","The JCTD Program directly addresses Joint Coalition and/or Interagency capability needs expressed by Combatant Commands (COCOMs).  Due to significant successes since inception of the program (initially the Advanced Capability Technology Demonstration (ACTD) Program) the JCTD Program is often viewed by COCOMs as a primary means to rapidly develop assess and transition time-sensitive capability solutions into operations.  Through partnering with other solution providers and resource sponsors the JCTD Program typically leverages two dollars in partner funding for every one dollar in the JCTD budget.  Thus the value and impact of JCTDs to the COCOMs is significantly greater than a traditional Research and Development (R&D) program.Key values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:- The program has a long history of providing enduring capabilities:  to date over 80 percent of completed JCTDs have successfully transitioned capabilities to warfighters.  70 percent of completed ACTD projects successfully transitioned their products.  See “Section D.  Acquisition Strategy” for transition discussion.- The program delivers capabilities rapidly; projects execute quicker than the Department of Defense (DoD) Planning Programming Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.  The result is that 74 JCTD/ACTD projects delivered capabilities used in Operation Iraqi Freedom and 57 projects delivered capabilities to Operation Enduring Freedom.  Most of those capabilities would not have been delivered – or would have been significantly delayed – without the JCTD program.  Recent examples are:  sensor capabilities for finding and interdicting tunnels delivered to Afghanistan to address a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) requirement and to interdict tunnels on the US-Mexico border; autonomous technologies for unmanned aerial resupply of forward operating bases; a sensor capability to provide situational awareness in the riverine environment; and a deployable integrated system to provide essential services in the immediate aftermath of a crisis event to include renewable-powered water desalination deployed to all the COCOMs.  -The program enables Coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources; approximately one-third of JCTD projects involve some degree of coalition partner participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom Canada Australia the Republic of Korea and the Republic of Singapore.- The program enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects such as projects with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Department of State (DOS) and Department of Transportation (DOT).  Recent examples are interdepartmental collaborations for maritime awareness air domain information sharing tunnel detection and characterization and Arctic awareness.- The program enables rapid response to new DoD priorities before Service PPBE cycles can respond.  For example the DoD has recently established priorities for Anti-Access/Area-Denial Building Partner Capacity understanding human terrain and nuclear forensics.  The JCTD Program quickly responded to the new priorities and is providing initial capabilities that are transitioning to Service efforts.MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  Metrics include all JCTDs will have deliverables within 15 months (analyses designs models etc.) to enable assessment for project continuation; 50 percent of JCTDs will provide an operationally-relevant prototype within 18 months; and 75 percent will complete final demonstration within 24 months of receiving funding.  JCTDs will spiral products and deliverables during the demonstration to meet COCOM needs.  Capabilities delivered and technologies transitioned are additional key metrics.Transition Achievement:  The JCTD program has been achieving actual transition rates of over 80 percent well in excess of the DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D Performance Measure 3.5.1-2D goal of 40 percent.  The JCTD Program defines transition as all or components of the demonstrated JCTD going to a new or existing Program of Record (POR) providing fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater or commodity-type capabilities entered onto General Service Administration (GSA) schedule for procurement by DOD users.  13 of 16 completions in FY 2012 were successfully transitioned.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

Historically the Joint Data Management program was restructured to evolve into the revised Data to Decisions Applied Research program a FY 2012 new start to support the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review mission:  Succeed in counterinsurgency stability and counterterrorism operations.  Additionally this program addresses a signed Secretary of Defense S&T priority Data to Decisions which reduces the cycle time and manpower requirements for analysis and use of large data sets.","The DoD response to a changing threat environment includes an expansion of the types of sensors deployed new types of information collected and different features used to classify these new threats.  As the DoD increases the capability and capacity to generate increasing amounts of data from numerous sensors in the battlespace the issue of handling very large data sets has become more challenging.  From a technical perspective data creation speeds have outpaced the speed and ability to transport store and process the data created.  S&T investigation into new and novel ways to manage and exploit this data is required to more efficiently use sensor assets and effectively use information in a timely fashion.The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Data to Decisions program (PEs 0602663D8Z and 0603663D8Z) uniquely addresses three specific gap areas not addressed by Component S&T:  minimal dedicated Data to Decisions research to support Joint and emerging mission areas; DoD needs a mechanism to increase responsiveness of Component Data to Decisions research and lower the time-to-solution across a broad DoD-wide user base; and limited investment in multi-disciplinary research investigations of Data to Decisions issues and solutions.  The OSD Data to Decisions program pulls together research efforts to address shortfalls within the context of Joint and emerging missions to ensure that the distinctive needs of these joint analysts and decision makers are addressed by DoD science and technology.  As an example irregular warfare non-state terrorism movements and uncertain environmental patterns that trigger major weather disasters are producing a reality for military and government leaders where traditional physics-based sensors alone are insufficient to plan current and future actions in a region of interest or need.  Component Data to Decisions efforts focus on developing technology to overcome a particular challenge within a mission or advance a particular priority area of that Component as a result the Research and Engineering Database has over 388 references to Decision Support programs all of which are designed to address a specific need over the course of several years.  However there exists no other program in the DoD that focuses on technology development efforts to speed the delivery of the Component solutions and lessons learned to a DoD-wide user base.  The OSD Data to Decisions program provides the common platform (access to datasets infrastructure and metrics) to integrate and evaluate the technology development and research methods to support various missions driven by the challenge problems.  This ability to rapidly evaluate technology development and research methods will allow technology transfer for mission analysis not previously foreseen and lower the time-to solution across DoD by rigorously analyzing technical performance for more immediate use.  Traditional approaches within research seek to advance machine systems for a specific mission effect resulting in large complex data sets.  While necessary for sensor system improvements potential Data to Decisions solutions require a coupling of automated data analysis with human analysts operators and decision makers in order to reduce time and limit the number of people required.  Many research studies workshops and analysis have stated that solutions to data issues are multi-disciplinary.  The OSD Data to Decisions program is in the unique position to reach across Components and research disciplines to blend promising research in new ways in response to cross-service Challenge Problem statements.  For Challenge Problems contextual understanding will result from research combining human sciences with computer processing techniques to take advantage of a person’s cognitive ability to fuse and assimilate multiple sources and types of information for new insights.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective thus ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating establishing and maintaining five ten and fifteen year technology development plans and roadmaps 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate Program Executive Offices (PEO) for insertion in their Insensitive Munition (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.   The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technical Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technical Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior DoD and DOE laboratory representatives and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight policy direction and priorities during its annual meeting.The Insensitive Munitions effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with Insensitive Munitions requirements established in United States Code Title 10 Chapter 141 Section 2389 and DoDI 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads 4) Anti-Armor Warheads and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG) under tri-service leadership have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  These IM technologies alone or in combination will be incorporated in hardware simulating real-world munitions to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.The Enabling Fuze Advanced Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development (GDF) of the Force the Secretary of Defense Memorandum DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration weapons and programs based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&T) communities.  In this way promising multi-point initiation architectures high reliability fuze architectures survivable components modular fuze packaging and components produced based on ease of manufacturing can be integrated into munitions applications and its ability to address required capability needs will be validated.  Mature fuze technologies will be transitioned to Weapon PEO’s and/or Industry thereby decreasing program costs and schedule risk while facilitating technology into potentially broader range of munitions applications.The JFTP investments focus on four specific capability areas that have been identified by the Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and as validated by the PEOs and the Service S&T communities.  These capability areas are:  1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing 3) High Reliability Fuzing and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.   These Fuzing technologies will be incorporated in weapon applications to demonstrate their maturity and utility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

It is conducted as a DoD program jointly planned and executed by the DoD DOE and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with strong participation by other Federal agencies industry and academia.  SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and cost-effective technologies in the areas of Environmental Restoration Munitions Response Resource Conservation and Climate Change and Weapons Systems and Platforms.  SERDP does this by addressing high priority DoD environmental technology requirements.  SERDP enhances military operations improves military systems` effectiveness enhances military training/readiness sustains DoD’s training and test ranges and installation infrastructure and helps ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  As a secondary benefit SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems.  The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively and proactively to priority defense environmental needs; the pursuit of world-class technical excellence; and an emphasis on constant technology transfer.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

Coalitions provide a broad base of technological operational and logistical support for military operations and ease the U.S. financial and manpower burdens associated with meeting military goals and objectives.  U.S. strategic guidance confirms that coalitions and relationships with international partners are high priorities for the nation and the Department of Defense.  The Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) responds to this guidance while striving to deliver new and improved capabilities to the warfighter.  CWP provides seed funding to DoD organizations to conduct cooperative research development test and evaluation (RDT&E) projects with foreign government partners.  It is the only Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) program dedicated to initiating cooperative RDT&E projects with allied and partner nations.  CWP seed funding is leveraged against funding from other U.S. government sponsors and foreign partners.  In its twelve-year history CWP has leveraged $3.1 of other U.S. funding for every $1 it has invested in cooperative projects and $4.4 of foreign partner funding for every $1 investment.  CWP projects enable Project Teams to move a technology into the next stage of development or prepare for transition to operational forces.  These projects may also form the basis for future cooperation with our international partners.  CWP projects support DoD acquisition by helping program offices convert U.S.-only projects into coalition solutions for the U.S. warfighter influencing coalition interoperability in major programs that will have far-reaching use by U.S. forces addressing requirements of combined operations early in a program’s development cycle to avert risks to joint/coalition operations and avoid costs associated with adding requirements later in the acquisition process enabling U.S. DoD access to leading-edge global technology and providing significant cost savings to the DoD while maintaining a strong research and development base.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

Space-based sensors also expand the battle space of all BMD ships operating in the northern hemisphere with increased raid size handling and threat range capability. With the two Space Tracking & Surveillance System (STSS) demonstration satellites (launched in 2009) the Agency regularly and consistently demonstrated space-based remote sensor and fire control integration initially in April 2011 in Flight Test Marine (FTM)-15 and most recently in May 2012 in FTM-16 Event 2A.  These successes are informing the design integration and operations of the Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS). The PTSS is a space and ground segment system that will provide persistent sensor coverage of enemy ballistic missiles. The PTSS is designed to be an integrated part of the BMDS: one that receives cues from all acquisition sensors and provides outputs to the BMDS battle manager & missile systems. The program mitigates cost schedule and performance risk by: 1) simplifying the design by focusing on the BMDS mission 2) incorporating components and subsystems with high technology readiness levels and on-orbit pedigrees and 3) involving industry and the military services up front & early to inform the design for producibility operations and sustainment. The PTSS has inherent capability for other missions such as Space Situational Awareness. The Agency expects that capability to be exploited by the joint warfighter when the PTSS is not engaged in a missile defense mission. The Combatant Commands and Services have a need for a persistent ability to provide fire-control quality tracking of a raid of ballistic missiles over their entire trajectory for both homeland and regional defense scenarios specifically improve birth-to-death tracking identification and targeting including the capability to detect track discriminate and counter large dense raids and structured attacks. Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) systems acquire and track the boost and early post-boost phases of a missile`s trajectory but the PTSS is required to continue to track ballistic missiles through their accent apogee and until they reenter into the earth`s atmosphere. Goals and objectives for the PTSS are:    - Develop an operational missile tracking capability from space which will close the BMDS fire control loop specifically the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and Ground Based Interceptor weapon systems by way of the BMDS battle manager.    - Reduce operational fire control risk by co-locating the national lab design teams for PTSS and Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and by embedding US Navy and US Air Force operations and sustainment experts in the PTSS hybrid program office.    - Focus on tracking raids of regional Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missiles and Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles from today`s regional threats.    - Develop and test the development satellite articles and the integrated ground system with the BMDS.    - Ensure early industry involvement by awarding contracts to join the Integrated Systems Engineering Team (ISET) during the development satellite article design. Six Industry partners (Ball Boeing Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman Orbital and Raytheon) contribute to the national lab development effort to improve the Precision Tracking Space System design for manufacturability and reduce the production risk.    - Use data from the on-orbit Space Tracking & Surveillance System (STSS) demonstration satellite testing events    - Benchmark models and simulations.    - Allocate requirements interface controls and evaluate operations concepts.    - Leverage experience gained from STSS test events to demonstrate capability and insight into Command Control Communication Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance linkages and hand off to the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense fire control system.    - Develop a government owned design to foster production competition over the life of the program.The Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS) contributes to defense of the U.S. homeland and regional missile defense including large raid protection. MD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management costs in support of the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).","35.630","0","408.1020","","",

The program funds will be replenished through non-recurring cost recoupment in future Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cases Cooperative Program MOUs or direct commercial sales contracts for sale/transfer of DoD systems benefiting from exportability investments. This program funds activities to support identification of major defense acquisition programs for possible export and the planning for design and incorporation of exportability features during research and development of these programs. Features include but are not limited to technology and engineering design activity such as capability differentials anti-tamper system assurance and software assurance. Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements onto contracts; and research development test and evaluation activities. Defense exportability features plays a critically important role in United States Government/DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits by providing these resources up front then collecting ‘fair share’ non-recurring cost recoupment the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems. Funding is increased in FY14 to expand the number of systems included in the Defense Exportaiblity Pilot Program that are used to define and implement DEF ‘best practice’ program management system engineering and program protection measures in the DoD acquisition process. Failure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs delayed delivery and higher risk of  sensitive technology compromise due to ad-hoc sales late in production.  Early development of export variants including systems design approaches to integrate adequate domestic and exportable anti-tamper (AT) protection and differential capability (DC) requirements to lower production costs increase quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends and enhance US industry share of the global marketplace.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

Operating forces have a critical need for defense against worldwide proliferation of CB warfare capabilities and for medical treatment of CB casualties.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) CB Defense initiatives both medical and non-medical.  This program element supports the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) of medical and non-medical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Projects within BA5 are structured to consolidate Joint and Service-unique tasks within four commodity areas:  contamination avoidance individual and collective force protection decontamination and medical countermeasures.  This consolidation provides for development and operational testing of equipment for Joint Service use and for Service-unique requirements.  Contamination avoidance efforts under this system development program will provide U.S. forces with real-time hazard assessment capabilities.  They include multi-agent point and remove chemical detection for ground aircraft and shipboard applications; automated warning and reporting systems; integrated radiation detection and monitoring equipment; and enhanced battlefield reconnaissance capabilities.  Force protection efforts will increase protection levels while decreasing physical and psychological burdens imposed by protective equipment.  The DoD Biological Defense mission requires the detection of validated biological threat agents to provide early warning capabilities on mobile and fixed platforms.  This program element will provide theater protection through the development of point and stand-off detection systems.  The detection system concept will provide detection identification warning and sample collection for verification that a biological agent attack has occurred.  The Secretary of Defense is responsible for research development acquisition and deployment of medical countermeasure equipment and materiel to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD unlike those developed to support U.S. population must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasize prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this SDD such as vaccines and chemical prophylaxis conserves fighting strength decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation and satisfy the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available efforts on this SDD support pre-hospitalization treatment en-route care hospital care and long-term clinical outcomes. Specific items in this category include CB diagnostics and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic threats and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  DoD is the only Federal activity conducting SDD on these prophylactic therapeutic and rapid identification and diagnostic CB medical countermeasures.  The Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  This Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process ("One Portfolio").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research development acquisition and deployment not  only ensures protection of the Armed Forces it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research development and acquisition because of its unique facilities testing capabilities and trained and experienced personnel.  Key efforts within this PE are in support of the FY14 policy priorities for Countering Biological Threats.  Approximately $148.4M supports the priority to "Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capacity to prevent detect and respond to infectious disease threats whether caused by natural accidental or deliberate events."  Approximately $61.8M supports the priority to "Expand our capability to prevent attribute and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities."  Approximately $288.3M supports the priority to "Leverage science technology and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capacity to respond to and recover from biological incidents."The projects in this program element support efforts in the engineering and manufacturing phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 5.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

This mission directly reflects several national and Department of Defense level guidance/vision documents to include the National Security Strategy Unified Command Plan National Strategy to Combat WMD Counterproliferation Interdiction National Strategy for Combating Terrorism National Military Strategy Global Development of Forces Global Employment of Forces National Military Strategy for Combating WMD National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex) and Nuclear Posture Review.  To achieve this mission DTRA has identified principal objectives along with strategies and tasks to ensure the objectives are met.  Three of these objectives are to deter the use of WMD reduce the present threat and to prepare for the future threat.  A focused and strong threat reduction technology base is critical to achieving these objectives and is closely tied with the operational support programs that make up its combat support mission.  DTRA has taken the steps to develop this technology base and provide a foundation for transformational activities within the WMD arena.Activities funded by Program Element 0602718BR implement a wide set of National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 17 and emerging Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) guidance for prevention of proliferation of WMD and WMD terrorism.  Projects support strengthening nonproliferation through the development of the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES) and development of Arms Control inspection training and operational capabilities.  Through development of new sensor systems sensor networks counterforce and fundamental CWMD research these programs contribute to securing and interdicting WMD WMD delivery systems and related materials.  Finally programs in this area fund development and operation of the STRATCOM-DTRA SCC-WMD Technical Reachback center which supports all GCC US and Allied Forces and civil authorities with 24/7 analysis support enabling force and civilian population protection against WMD attack.The DTRA’s WMD Defeat Technologies program element also supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats priorities. The strategy spells out four focus areas:  1) Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capabilities to prevent detect and respond to infectious disease threats whether caused by natural accidental or deliberate events 2) Establish and reinforce norms against the misuse of the life sciences 3) Expand our capability to prevent attribute and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities (Capability Expansion) and 4) Leverage science technology and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capabilities to respond to and recover from biological incidents (Leveraging Science).   There are two of the four focus areas (3 and 4) supported in this program element under projects RA-Information Science and Applications RL-Nuclear & Radiological Effects RM-WMD Counterforce Technologies and RR-Test Infrastructure.  Details are provided in the R-2a exhibits.Project RA (Information Science and Application) develops innovative technologies and modeling and simulation (M&S) capabilities and provides Technical Reachback support to create decision advantage for the U.S. and our Allies through improved situational understanding across the complete CWMD mission space.Project RE (Counter-Terrorism Technologies) provides research and development support to Joint U.S. Military Forces specifically U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in the areas of Explosive Ordnance Disposal Device Defeat; counter-WMD technologies for warfighters; the USSOCOM Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction – Terrorism Support Program (SCSP); and oversight of counterproliferation (CP) research and development resources sent directly to USSOCOM for warfighter-unique CP technologies.  Project RF (Detection and Forensics Technologies) develops technologies systems and procedures for post detonation nuclear forensics and to detect identify track tag locate monitor and interdict strategic and improvised nuclear and radiological weapons components materials or infrastructure in support of Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism counterproliferation and nonproliferation homeland defense and international initiatives and agreements.  Project RG (Defeat Technologies) develops advanced technologies and weapon concepts and validates their applicability as counter WMD weapon systems.Project RI (Nuclear Survivability) provides the capability for DoD nuclear forces and their associated control and support systems and facilities in wartime to avoid repel or withstand attack or other hostile action to the extent that essential functions can continue or be resumed after the onset of hostile action.

The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&E of the program is complete.  DOT&E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&E's oversight authority include: -	The approval of component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS).-	The approval of component OT&E Test Plans (TPs).-	Oversight of Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.-	Reporting results of OT&E that supports BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.DOT&E also oversees and resources OT&E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises and reports the trends and findings in the annual report. This Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support in performing the described tasks travel funds to carry out oversight of the OT&E program funds for Service teams performing information assurance and interoperability assessments during exercises and contractor support related to the conduct of operational test and evaluation and exercise assessments.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

Starting in FY 2013 the JASP and JTCG/ME programs are realigned from the Operational Test Activities and Analyses program (0605814OTE) to the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program element (0605131OTE).  The JASP and JTCG/ME programs focus on the survivability of currently fielded systems; therefore the two programs are more appropriately funded within the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program element.This Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E).  The primary objective of LFT&E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or if not available acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.This Program Element also supports DoD’s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&E related initiatives.  JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons both U.S. and foreign for their lethalities against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.  The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD’s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Aeronautical Systems Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&E to improve military aircraft survivability develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&S) facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG) which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT) is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&E and is also an Executive Agent for the Survivability Vulnerability Information Analysis Center (SURVIAC) the repository for aircraft survivability information.The Joint Logistics Commanders Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME) was chartered more than 40 years ago to serve as DoD’s focal point for munitions effectiveness information.  This has taken the form of widely used Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) which address all major non-nuclear U.S. weapons.  JTCG/ME authenticates weapons effectiveness data for use in training systems acquisition weapon procurement and combat modeling and simulation.  JMEMs are used by the Armed Forces of the U.S. NATO and other allies to plan operational missions support training and tactics development and support force-level analyses.  JTCG/ME also develops and standardizes methodologies for evaluation of munitions effectiveness and maintains databases for target vulnerability munitions lethality and weapon system accuracy.  The JMEM requirements and development processes continues to be driven by operational lessons learned (Enduring Freedom Iraqi Freedom and Odyssey Dawn) and the needs of Combatant Commands Services Military Targeting Committee and Operational Users Working Groups input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. This program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&E programs.This program element is budgeted in Budget Activity 6 RDT&E Management Support to support LFT&E management activities for the oversight of RDT&E of new systems as well as RDT&E of fielded systems.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

SBIRS provides increased detection and tracking performance in order to meet requirements in Air Force Space Command's Operational Requirements Document. The SBIRS system includes both space and ground elements. The space segment consists of Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites payloads hosted on satellites in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) and Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites. The ground segment consists of both fixed and mobile data processing elements communications infrastructure and relay ground stations serving all SBIRS space elements. The HEO-1 and HEO-2 payloads are on-orbit and certified for Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) missile warning operations and technical intelligence operations. The GEO-1 satellite is on-orbit and is undergoing testing and calibration to prepare for operational acceptance. GEO-2 exited storage in 4Q FY12 and is in final preparation for launch scheduled in March 2013. Ground segment development continues through the FYDP. Concept studies/activities may be implemented to investigate obsolescence issues Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) solutions to potential operational concerns and future evolution paths of the ground and/or space segment.Future SBIRS OPIR satellites will be procured using the Department of Defense (DOD) Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) concept (formerly Evolutionary Acquisition for Space Efficiency (EASE)). ESP is an approach which seeks stable production and efficient sub-contractor product management through the block buy of two space vehicles at one time (please see SBIRS P-40 Exhibit). A portion of the savings realized from ESP block buys are reinvested into the OPIR Space Modernization Initiative (SMI). The primary objective of SMI is to enable and inform future decisions to maintain a capable resilient and affordable OPIR architecture. SMI supports the Program of Record by assessing future parts/material obsolescence and future affordability and capability design modifications. SMI funds engineering activities to reduce future system and production costs through manufacturing/ producibility enhancements and through technology insertion. SMI will also mature potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for future space and ground architecture affordability and capability enhancements. The SBIRS OPIR SMI plan includes studies and risk reduction activities to evolve the current Program of Record SBIRS GEO satellites.  SMI funded data exploitation efforts include OPIR data processing data publication algorithm development network connectivity and sensor performance assessments. The data exploitation efforts will identify affordable responsive and resilient measures to improve battlespace awareness data dissemination to the warfighter. SMI Architecture and Component Study efforts will assess future architecture alternatives for viability affordability capability and resilience. The SMI Hosted Payloads and Wide Field of View Testbeds efforts will explore technology maturation qualification of new components and subsystem/component prototyping to evolve the OPIR architecture.The Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload (CHIRP) demonstration received FY11 and FY12 funds for a Wide-Field-of-View (WFOV) demonstration for technology maturation.  CHIRP performed risk reduction and evaluation of WFOV infrared staring and data processing technology to potentially evolve future SBIRS staring sensors and processing algorithms.  An on-orbit demonstration quantified performance levels of a prototype WFOV sensor in an operational environment.  CHIRP sensor testing provided Focal Plane Array (FPA)performance/calibration characteristics assessed WFOV staring algorithm performance in an operational environment and investigated compatibility with current OPIR ground systems for missile warning missile defense and other mission areas.

Armed with a W80 warhead it is designed to evade air and ground-based defenses in order to strike targets at any location within any enemy's territory.  The ALCM is designed for B-52H internal and external carriage.  The purpose of this program element is to ensure ALCM sustainability to 2030 in support of Air Force strategic nuclear deterrence and global strike mission requirements.An ALCM Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) was developed to support ALCM Service Life to 2030.  The results of SLEP studies identified system components and support equipment that will become non-supportable prior to 2030.  Service life extension of this critical weapon is essential to meet United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) deliberate planning commitments.The Aging and Surveillance program for ALCM continuously assesses critical components such as those in the safe arm and fuze subsystem navigation/guidance system and electrical/power distribution system.  The program identifies aging trends prior to failures in fielded components that would result in fleet-wide reliability and supportability problems.  Development funds are required to update software test procedures and test equipment.  FY12 funding supported development of new hardware and software to update the contractor's testing complex/capabilities in order to add the Guided Missile Flight Controller (GMFC) to the annual Aging & Surveillance testing program.  As part of the build phase of the sustaining engineering approach the SPO is developing a plan for ALCM sustainment using a computer-aided decision making process.

It carries the largest payload of both guided and unguided weapons in the Air Force inventory.  The multi-mission B-1B is the backbone of America's long-range bomber force and can rapidly deliver massive quantities of precision and non-precision weapons against any adversary anywhere in the world at any time. The current service life extends beyond 2040.This Research Development Test & Engineering (RDT&E) effort provides funding for B-1B modernization programs. These modernization programs alleviate aircraft obsolescence issues due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) while at the same time providing improved capabilities to the B-1B weapon system that require significant hardware and software development and testing. B-1B RDT&E efforts include development of the Self-Contained Standby Attitude Indicator (SCAI). If the primary flight instruments are lost due to electrical failure the SCAI will remain powered by the backup battery and continue to provide the primary flight information needed to keep the aircraft in stable flight providing attitude altitude and airspeed/Mach. This development activity will replace three standby flight indicators (attitude indicator altimeter and airspeed indicator) with a more reliable/supportable off-the-shelf display that combines all necessary flight information into one device. SCAI must be functional and reliable in the event of primary flight display failure and is a Mission-Essential Subsystem List (MESL) item required for flight. RDT&E funding will also provide upgrades to the B-1B training systems (both flight and maintenance simulators/trainers) that are included in the modernization programs to bring the training systems to the same configuration as the Central Integrated Test System (CITS) Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL) and Vertical Situation Display Upgrade (VSDU) programs. The B-1B training system provides the war fighter fully integrated cost effective high fidelity training in the operation weapons employment and maintenance of the B-1B weapon system. Upgrades to the B-1B flight test aircraft are included in the modernization programs to keep the test flight systems current. RDT&E funded test jets are currently configured with Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) for CITS FIDL and VSDU. Replacement of the EMD LRUs are required to bring two flight test aircraft to a fleet-representative configuration to ensure maximum supportability maintainability and reliability for continued and future flight tests. In addition program funds cover engineering/planning studies related engineering efforts and auxiliary requirement for development programs that have not yet fielded due to diminishing manufacturing sources.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  The AFWWS provides timely accurate consistent and relevant space and terrestrial weather information for global battlespace situational awareness.  The AFWWS supports worldwide operations of Air Force and Army warfighters Special Operation Forces (SOF) and other government agencies with weather observing and forecasting capabilities at in-garrison and deployed locations as well as centralized reach-back capabilities.  Air Force Weather (AFW) programs align under the five capability areas of Weather Data Collection (WDC) Weather Data Analysis (WDA) Weather Forecasting Product Tailoring/Warfighter Applications (PT/WA) and Weather Dissemination (presently relies on Commercial-off-the-Shelf products and so does not use RDT&E funding). Through this alignment AFW ensures an integrated and systems-oriented approach to program management decisions.   WDC provides automated terrestrial and space environmental sensing capabilities at fixed and deployed locations worldwide.  WDA provides a net-centric infrastructure that assimilates worldwide sources of terrestrial and space weather data and produces decision-quality information for warfighters.  Improved weather analysis of real-time information also supports DoD's role in transformation of the National Airspace System through the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and enhances Air Force energy security plans.  Weather Forecasting provides advanced scientific numerical weather prediction capabilities for automated high resolution forecast products for mission planning rehearsal and execution.  Additionally WDA and Forecasting capabilities will be expanded to integrate and exploit data from a new generation of environmental sensing satellites.  PT/WA provides timely local and regional target-scale weather information to operational commanders for a given Area of Responsibility and at tactical levels provides front-line weather information to warfighters in support of combat operations.  PT/WA supports the 'train as you fight' concept by assuring fixed and deployable systems have a similar look and feel. FY14 funding will enhance current and develop new computations based on dual-polarization technology for improved severe weather detection and rainfall amount forecasting.  During FY14 the weather data analysis capability will continue to develop incremental software enhancements and integrate improved analysis capabilities including processing of data from a new generation of environmental sensing satellites.

BPAC 676029 was established in FY13 for the Global ASNT program. Nuclear Command Control and Communications (NC3) Long Term Solution (LTS) was a FY12 New Start but was cancelled during FY13 budget development due to higher Air Force priorities.","Nuclear Deterrence Operations (NDO) is an Air Force Core Function.  Within this core function Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) is the exercise of authority and direction by the President as Commander in Chief through established command lines over nuclear weapon operations of military forces.  The President's authority and direction are exercised through the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS).  The NCCS is the designated combination of flexible and enduring elements including facilities equipment communications procedures personnel and the structure in which these elements are integrated all of which are essential for planning directing and controlling nuclear weapon operations.The Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) portfolio modernizes the systems necessary to effectively provide assured communications connectivity between the President and the strategic deterrence forces in stressed environments. There are several on-going MEECN activities working to modernize strategic forces' communication networks. MEECN System Improvements (MSI) is a long-range planning process with users (Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) Air Combat Command (ACC) Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) Air Mobility Command (AMC) US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and the Navy) to develop positions for current and future requirements/issues based on available technology. MSI is used to conduct technology testing develop technology strategies and build technology roadmaps as pro-active support to the Nuclear Command Control and Communications (NC3) community. The Minuteman MEECN Program Upgrade (MMPU) modernizes existing Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Launch Control Center (LCC) Extremely High Frequency (EHF) communications to provide an Advanced EHF (AEHF) capability and a capability for Missile Combat Crew Members to have operator control of the terminal in the LCC to switch rapidly among various satellite constellations.  This upgrade will be compatible with the AEHF satellite and the supporting key management infrastructure (crypto interoperability).  AEHF is an eXtended Data Rate (XDR) waveform that provides more secure transmit/receive capability at higher data rate frequencies than the low data rate frequencies currently used on MILSTAR satellites. The AEHF terminal will provide both receive and report-back capability.  These modifications comply with the USSTRATCOM requirement for strategic terminals to communicate at higher data rates.Global Aircrew Strategic Network Terminal (Global ASNT) will be comprised of EHF/AEHF Very Low Frequency (VLF)/Low Frequency (LF) High Frequency (HF) Ultra High Frequency (UHF) and the Aircrew Alerting System (AAS) components (pagers/klaxons) and will provide secure survivable inter-site intra-site and mobile communications to bomber tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs) and mobile relocation teams with strategic responsibilities. Global ASNT terminals will be developed and fielded to replace strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals and Aircraft Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse System/Electromagnetic Pulse Hardened Dispersal Communications (AACE/EHDC) systems. The primary mission of Global ASNT is to provide strategic WCPs and mobile support teams with survivable communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) and Force Management messages from NC2 nodes and disseminate them to bomber tanker and reconnaissance aircrews.  Global ASNT will provide solutions to existing capability shortfalls for NC2 and has significant potential to provide distributed and transportable command and control capabilities beyond the traditional NC2 mission. Global ASNT will be fielded in separate increments; the first increment fields the EHF/AEHF capability; the second increment fields HF/UHF/AAS capability; and the third increment fields VLF/LF capability. Global ASNT is the last line of operational communications when all other peacetime links fail.

TACP-M is a buy-to-budget program with requirements based on ACC's evolving combat needs and the capabilities available in the commercial market. Therefore requirements are frequently adjusted to accomodate warfighter needs while working within available funding. The TACP-M program acquires capabilities for TACP operations.  TACP members deploy with Army maneuver units and provide a command and control (C2) link for close air support (CAS) airlift and Air Force surveillance/reconnaissance missions.  TACPs are equipped with various targeting and communications equipment which interfaces with ground maneuver forces CAS aircraft joint fire assets C2 aircraft/agencies and Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms/agencies.  Throughout the performance of their duties TACPs detect targets and compute precision coordinates to aircraft to ensure pilots track the correct target in the employment of GPS aided weapons.  The actions performed by TACPs not only shorten the kill chain but also reduce the potential for fratricide and collateral damage in civilian-occupied areas.  The TACP-M program provides equipment modernization capabilities to TACPs Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) and Tactical Operations Center (TOC) personnel. The program supports Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and significantly increased the mission effectiveness of the TACPs and ASOCs during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New Dawn.  The TACP-M program continues to be instrumental in providing ground communications for TACPs during federal emergency relief operations and homeland defense initiatives.The purpose of the TACP-M program is to reduce reliance on voice transmission and replace analog equipment with the latest digital data link and streaming video (e.g. Streaming Video Receiver) technology.  Upgraded digital communications enable machine-to-machine interface between TACPs and Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft Army units and other TACP units.  Machine-to-machine communication provides reliable high speed digital communications supports joint and multinational interoperability improves battlefield Situational Awareness (SA) increases targeting accuracy reduces kill chain decision time improves data flow/information exchange and reduces potential fratricide. TACPs use software communication architecture (SCA)-certified Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) software programmable radios and ancillary components for reliable voice & data UHF SATCOM and LOS UHF /VHF communications.  TACP-M is divided into three segments:  software dismounted and mounted. The mounted segment is further divided into fixed and mobile elements. The software segment utilizes a common Close Air Support System Software(CASS) baseline across all TACP systems.  The CASS software provides cross-service interoperability with numerous aircraft (A-10 F-16 F/A-18 etc) helicopters unmanned air vehicles (Predator) land and naval artillery network enabled weapons command & control nodes and communications systems utilizing numerous messaging systems (such as Variable Message Format (VMF) Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) and Link-16) to provide maximum flexibility and capability to the TACPs for the execution of joint fire support mission. In addition TACP-M is working with various contractors and laboratories to conduct demonstrations and risk reduction efforts to assess advanced HMI and interoperability technologies for future fielding. The dismounted segment consists of integrated systems and equipment comprised of non-developmental and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components which are carried by dismounted TACP. These include laser range finders thermal imagers laser designators manpack and handheld radios ruggedized tactical computers streaming video receivers and other required equipment. The dismounted segment also incorporates the development of an advanced Target Location Designation System (TLDS) which is also being managed under the Army-led Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS) program.  TLDS will combine the capability of a laser marker designator and thermal imagers into a small lightweight system. The mounted (fixed) segment integrates computer and communications equipment into re-locatable vehicle rack or transit case mounted systems for use in Tactical Operations Center (TOC) or Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) locations.  The TACP mounted (fixed) segment includes the High Mobility Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV)-mounted Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) gateway gateway lite and the Dismounted Communications Package (DCP).  The TACP-M Mounted (mobile) segment integrates similar equipment into mobile tactical vehicles employed by the Army and provides on-the-move tactical voice and data capability.  Following the termination of the Vehicular Communications System (VCS) in FY11 the TACP community has capability gaps in vehicle mounted communications systems.  As a result and based on ACC priorities and available funding the TACP-M team is working through the JCIDS process with ACC to identify and resolve capability gaps related to vehicle mounted communications which is referred to as the Mobile Communications System (MCS).  These gaps are being addressed in a stepwise fashion:  an initial implementation of a very limited PRC-117G-based voice-only capability in approximately 220 TACP HMMWVs that were originally slated for the VCS.  This limited capability is referred to as the Voice Communications Package (VCP) and replaces the more capable Mobile Communications Package (MCP) that was going to take multiple years to implement.  A more robust capability implementing voice and data communications through additional PRC-117G and PRC-150 radios computers streaming video and advanced soldier radio waveforms will follow as the requirement is formalized funding becomes available and contracts can be awarded to fill the long-term need.Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipated production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","Continuing","Continuing","","R2Long",

It directly supports Air Force Joint Coalition composite training and rehearsal concept development and acquisition and testing through model and simulation development as well as the integration of these across and within Live Virtual and Constructive (LVC) environments.  This program focuses on support of Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2) acquisition excellence initiatives and foundational capabilities needed for interoperability accessibility reuse and scalability.  It allows the authoritative portrayal of new and emerging Air Force capabilities within Army Navy Marines OSD interagency and coalition LVC environments; as well as reciprocating their capabilities within our Air Force LVC environments.  LVC environments today are used as the most cost effective means to meet mission needs the most practical means and sometimes the only way.  In support of the DoD T2 initiative USAF M&S program thrust areas develop and modernize models and simulations that are the constructive backbone of Air Force and joint training and rehearsal.  Once these models and simulations are developed they are integrated across training LVC environments for use by Major and Combatant Commands.  This development and integration is imperative to ensure that air space and cyberspace training and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic interoperable and readily available tools data and services.  These in turn enable joint coalition and interagency training required to prepare forces for combat by generating the air and space picture for the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) and Joint Force Commander in combat exercises; training over 30000 personnel per year in exercises (e.g. Ulchi Freedom Guardian Red & Blue Flags Unified Endeavor etc).  These programs also provide the current foundational environment that enables warfighters to interact with high-fidelity tactical cockpit simulators like 5th Generation (5th Gen) and beyond which replicate high demand/low density platforms that are often unavailable for training due to real-world operations; while simultaneously linking it to warfighters using their current command and control systems 1000 miles away and the constructive simulations being run from key operational wargaming and simulation centers worldwide. USAF M&S is integral to inter-agency Homeland Defense (HLD) exercises chartered to train combat units tasked to protect the Homeland including the National Capital Region (exercise Amalgam Arrow); generates equipment and manpower efficiencies by using simulations which reduce fuel consumption aircraft wear and tear and manpower costs.  In support of the DoD drive to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its enterprise-wide acquisition business processes the USAF M&S Program Element develops and supports enhancements to models simulations tools and the LVC infrastructure to provide for system-of-systems M&S capabilities across the lifecycle reduce developmental costs and minimize risks. These capabilities support the acquisition process from concept development through test and evaluation.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.Activities and efforts in this program address the advanced technology development test and evaluation of a dynamic distributed common picture based on emergent technologies that will improve situational awareness across command echelons.  The promise of net-centricity and potential for persistent and pervasive sensing creates greater demand for automated fusion of large volumes of multi-sensor data techniques to coordinate deployment of multiple diverse sensors and tailored dissemination of information to support network centric operations.  The focus of this program is to refine technologies that exploit information and networking technology to ensure mission success in unpredictable warfighting environments.  These missions include the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) urban operations and asymmetric warfare.  To ensure Maritime Domain Awareness the Navy must be able to collect fuse and disseminate enormous quantities of data drawn from US joint forces and government agencies international coalition partners and forces and commercial entities.  To further network centric capabilities this project demonstrates technologies that support seamless information services afloat and ashore; collaborative decision-making among geographically dispersed warfighters; a common consistent view of the battlespace geared to user requirements; system interoperability with coalition forces; real-time information access with quality of service guarantees; and information assurance.  Technologies of interest provide access to and automated processing of information necessary to make decisions that lead to rapid accurate decision-making and result in decisive precise and desired engagement outcomes.  The payoff is access to tailored information in near real time with corresponding increases in speed of command improved decision-making and reduction in manpower.

The consistent accuracy unaffected by location or weather and available in real time significantly improves effectiveness of reconnaissance weapons delivery mine countermeasures and rapid deployment for all services. GPS must comply with Title 10 United States Code (USC) 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures that continued sustainment and operations of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 51 USC sec 50112 which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation. The system is composed of three segments: user equipment (funded under PE 0305164F) space (funded under this PE and PE 0305165F) and a control network (funded under PE 0305165F and PE 0603423F). The satellites broadcast high accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals which are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. This equipment computes the platform position and velocity and provides steering vectors to target locations or navigation waypoints. The control segment provides daily updates to the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to maintain system precision in three dimensions to 16 meters spherical error probable worldwide. Additionally GPS supports the Unites States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) mission and provides strategic and tactical support to the following Department of Defense (DoD) missions: Joint Operations by providing capabilities for Positioning Navigation and Timing (PNT); Command Control Communications and Intelligence; Special Operations; Military Operations in Urban Terrain; Defense-Wide Mission Support; Air Mobility; and Space Launch Orbital Support. GPS III is the next generation Space Vehicle (SV) to join the GPS constellation.  GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements including a new civil (L1C) Galileo-compatible signal enhanced anti-jam power and affordable on-ramps to provide full warfighter capabilities (e.g. better signal maintainability (Digital Waveform Generator (DWG) Unified S-Band (USB) near-real time Command and Control) and the civil search and rescue payload (SAR/GPS).

The Countermeasure Anti- Torpedo (CAT) program develops a canisterized Anti-Torpedo Torpedo (ATT) as an ACAT II program.  The Torpedo Warning System (TWS) develops the required ship systems as an ACAT III program.  The AN/SLQ-25X solicitation has been cancelled due to a more cost effective technical solution of interfacing the TWS to NIXIE system.The program will focus on first providing torpedo defense capability to High Value Units (HVU). The Initial Operational Capability (IOC) system will be installed on one CVN and one Combat Logistics Force (CLF) ship (both HVUs) with IOC in FY19.Additionally the program will develop and field six Surface Ship Torpedo Defense prototype (TWS/CAT) Engineering Design Model (EDM) systems on CVNs. Each prototype consists of one TWS and eight CATs. The six systems were accelerated due to the lack of torpedo defense on HVUs which has been exacerbated by recent real-world events and evolving threats. The systems provide a hard-kill torpedo defense capability in advance of the IOC as part of the program of record. To accomplish this effort the department reprogrammed $9.9 million of FY10 funds $6.1 million of FY11 funds and $6.4 million of FY12 funds.  Furthermore the department received a prior approval reprogramming for an additional $7.9 million of FY10 funds.  The first two prototypes are expected to deliver in FY14; these two systems will be delivered in a roll-on/roll-off (RO-RO) configuration and delivered to the theater commander.  Following delivery of the RO-RO capability the program will build and deliver the final four EDM systems for installation on two carriers each year in FY15 and FY16.Additionally the program will deliver one hybrid prototype system in FY13. This is in addition to the six prototype EDM systems discussed above. The system will deliver some capability to a forward deployed CVN asset before the first prototype EDM system is available.Compact Rapid Attack Weapon (CRAW) - At about one-third the weight of the current lightweight ASW weapon CRAW is projected to cost less while performing at least as well.

The program was constructed to mature both technical and business model integration for C5I systems programs of record in an open architecture environment. The priority was incorporating the principles of modular design and design disclosure reusable application software interoperability and secure information exchange lifecycle affordability and encouraging competition and collaboration.Project Unit 0324: Funding is to maintain and update a information exchange environment to improve transparency of design disclosure and information exchange on past and current investments to support the principle of cross-program reuse and to provide the tools and leadership for assisting programs through the transition to Naval Open Architecture (OA).  The other elements of the OA transformation effort are being realized as management efficiencies within programs.  Those elements include ensuring that all naval systems families of systems and programs move to modular OA in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.1 dated 12 May 2003 which mandates that all DoD programs utilize open systems architectures to rapidly field affordable and interoperable systems.  By direction of the Navy Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) PEO IWS was assigned overall responsibility and authority to direct the Navy's OA effort until that duty transferred to DASN (RDTE) in 2011. The Core OA funding line has remained with PEO IWS.  That policy established a need to coordinate acquisition strategies develop guidance and tools and develop analysis of alternatives to determine OA software reuse practices within and across the Navy Communities of Interest (COI - Surface Subsurface Air Space C4I USMC and ONR).  This project facilitates a strategic shift in the acquisition business process to facilitate cooperative competition in cross-domain/COI business relationships.  This improves innovation and economies of scale throughout the Navy and Marine Corps.  This leadership effort has identified the business case and potential return on investment for moving the Navy towards an open systems approach supported the development of open systems technologies and integrated best business and technical practices for open systems development within Naval acquisition.  Naval OA ensures Navy-wide system architectures become extensible and scalable in function capacity and workload to meet Joint warfighting requirements.  This also includes the identification and development of common software components functions reuse methodologies and extensible product lines.  In summary this funding supports the management of a reuse repository and reuse information exchange portal and the evolving business systems engineering and cultural changes required across all Naval programs as they migrate to function in a Joint net-centric warfare environment.","60.121","Continuing","Continuing","180","",

Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) acts as management lead for Joint System Command (SYSCOM) system certification policy and guidance and certifies platforms for interoperability within the platform and throughout the enterprise in accordance with Commander US Fleet Forces Command/Commander Pacific Fleet (COMUSFLTFORCOM/COMPACFLT) Inst. 4720.3B (OCT 2008) C5ISR Modernization Policy.  COMUSFLTFORCOM/COMPACFLT Inst. 4720.3B also requires that NAVSEA act as administrative agent for COMNAVNETWARCOM Command and Control Communications Computers and Combat Systems Integration Modernization Process (C5IMP) and execution agent for Navy Command and Control Communications Computers and Combat Systems Integration (C5I) Modernization Conferences (NCMC).  This program conducts Interoperability Assessments that are required to certify Aircraft Carriers Amphibious Assault Ships and Surface Combatants in accordance with the Naval Warfare System Certification Policy (NWSCP) NAVSEAINST 9410.2A NAVAIR 5230.20 SPAWAR 5234.1.The SFI Program ensures overall strike force interoperability is characterized and assessed. NAVSEA is assigned central United States Navy (USN) responsibility for interoperability directing the development of policy and architecture for Strike Force warfare systems engineering and implementation of a common warfare systems engineering process. There are three priorities within the Strike Force Interoperability Program:  1) Support Fleet As-Is state which includes Navigation System Certification (NAVCERT) Interoperability Capabilities & Limitations and Interoperability Tactical Information Coordinator Technical Aids (TIC TECHAIDs); 2) Ship system modernization (non-HME) including warfighting capability & other C5I upgrades. This includes C5IMP Baseline Management and Non-Aegis Combat System Integration Testing; and 3) Ship Warfare System Certification & Force Level Assessments. This includes Warfare Systems Certification Interoperability Certification Force Level Interoperability Analysis Assessments and reports recommending force level interoperability improvements to the program offices for implementation at the systems level. In addition to these core efforts this program also aims to improve the efficiency of testing processes through the Automated Test and Re-test (ATRT) program and engages in efforts designed to ensure the U.S. Navy is interoperable with Joint and Coalition forces through the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD).Project 0164 Combat System Integration:This project consist of five key pillars executed within the SFI program beginning in FY13: 1) Command & Control Communications Computer Combat Systems and Intelligence Modernization Process (C5IMP) and Fleet Readiness. The C5IMP validates the introduction of new systems into the Fleet and ensures system maturity prior to installation thereby reducing risk and enhancing readiness and effectiveness of deploying ships and strike groups; 2) Warfare Systems Certification which is essential to validating the maturity and operational performance of warfare systems prior to fleet delivery and deployment; 3) Navigation Certification (NAVCERT) and Electronic Charting and Display System - Navy (ECDIS-N) certification which certifies ship electronic charting capability and certifies the accurate transmission of navigation data to combat and weapons systems; 4) Combat Systems Integration Testing (CSIT) formerly known as Warfare Systems Integration and Interoperability Testing (WSI2T) which is essential in the identification of critical integration and interoperability issues.  CSIT also provides Objective Quality Evidence (OQE) for warfare system certification decisions for installation and deployment; and 5) Interoperability Certification and Assessment the independent assessment of Strike Group Warfare Systems operational performance.  Interoperability Assessments examine force level engagement threads aircraft control air battle-space management and operational displays.  Assessments of deploying ships in Strike Force configurations are accomplished through the utilization of the Navy's Distributed Engineering Plant (DEP) which is the cornerstone for the Distributed Integration & Interoperability Assessment Capability (DIIAC) Concept.  It is a U.S. Fleet Forces Command and Commander In Chief U.S Pacific Fleet (COMPACFLT) requirement that all Strike Forces undergo Interoperability Assessment testing in the DEP prior to deployment.  Interoperability Certification results are used to develop fleet tactical tools (Capabilities & Limitations (C&L) and Tactical Information Coordinator Technical Aids (TIC TECHAIDs)) which ensure that operators understand the interoperability capabilities and limitations of their combat systems.      Project 3312 Maritime Theater Missile Defense Forum (MTMD):This project funds participation in the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended in 2009).  Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) forum it promotes interoperability with the Navies of nine participating nations.  This project funds participation in several Project Arrangements and includes maritime contribution to the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project.The MTMD forum provides protection against the proliferation of short medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the creation of an interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations.  This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats. MTMD supports USN participation in several MTMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:(1)  Battle Management Command Control Communications Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps.(2)  Modeling & Simulation (M&S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.(3)  Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.(4)  Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.(5)  Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.(6)  Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.(7)  Next Generation Infrared Search and Track (IRST) to evaluate commercial-based technologies to develop a passive IRST sensor system in support of coalition maritime missile defense operations.Project 9B88 Automated Test and Retest (ATRT):The Navy through Automated Test and Re-Test (ATRT) is developing an automated test/analysis capability which is applicable at phases within system development and integration which provides reproducible and quantitative evaluation of system performance with reduced levels of effort and schedule in order to support one of the Navy's priority initiatives of reduction of Total Ownership Cost (TOC).

The system operates in a variety of environments and supports joint coalition and allied forces.  GCCS-M is implemented Afloat and at Ashore fixed command centers.  Mission Planning:  The Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) is the designated automated mission planning system for the Navy.  JMPS enables weapon system employment by providing the information automated tools and decision aids needed to rapidly plan aircraft weapon or sensor missions load mission data into aircraft and weapons and conduct post-mission analysis.  JMPS is a mission critical system which is a co-development effort between the United States Navy (USN) and United States Air Force (USAF). Common requirements are identified and capabilities are developed and prioritized in an evolutionary approach.  An individual JMPS Mission Planning Environment (MPE) is a combination of the JMPS framework common capabilities and the necessary system hardware required to satisfy mission planning objectives.  Most Tactical Naval Aviation platforms are dependent solely on JMPS to plan precision guided munitions sensor systems tactical data links secure voice communications and basic Safety of Flight functions.  The following type/model/series (T/M/S) naval aircraft are supported by JMPS:  AH-1W F/A-18 A-F E-2C EP-3E EA-6B AV-8B S-3 V-22 Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) EA-18G MV-22 C-2 MH-53E P-3 Aircraft Carrier Intelligence Center (CVIC) SH-60B/F HH-60H CH-53D/E CH-46E UH-1N VH-3/VH-60 AH-1Z UH-1Y MH-60R/S and E-2D. All of the aforementioned T/M/S are required to transition to Microsoft Windows 7 before Microsoft XP support ends April 2014 by using Framework (FW) Version 1.3.5. An extension of Windows XP is planned to allow all naval aircraft to be supported during the transition.  Future JMPS platforms include: MQ-4C (Triton) and H-53K.  The next JMPS architecture version will support net-centric goals by providing route "publish and subscribe" capabilities transition to 64 bit and emerging technology and Information Assurance (IA) requirements. Funding profile includes 64 bit development which requires a complete software restructure to address memory limitations and system errors resulting in JMPS computer crashes.  Failure to move to 64 bit will result in an inability to support future advanced platform mission planning needs based on processing space and capability.Shipboard Local Area Network (LAN)/Wide Area Network (WAN) : Integrated Shipboard Network System (ISNS):  ISNS provides Navy ships with reliable high-speed SECRET and UNCLASSIFIED LANs providing the network infrastructure (switches and drops to the PC) Basic Network Information Distribution Services and access to the Defense Information Systems Network WAN Secure and Nonsecure Internet Protocol Router Network  (SIPRNET and NIPRNET) which are used by other hosted applications or systems such as Naval Tactical Command Support System Global Command and Control System - Maritime Defense Messaging System Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System Naval Mission Planning System Theater Battle Management Core Systems and Tactical Tomahawk Weapons Control System.  It enables real-time information exchange within the ship and between afloat units Component Commanders and Fleet Commanders and is a key factor in the implementation of the Navy's portion of Joint Vision 2020.   Naval Tactical Command Support System (NTCSS): Enterprise Database and Maritime Logistics Data Network (MLDN): The NTCSS is a multi-function program designed to provide standard tactical support information systems to various afloat and associated shore-based fleet activities.  The mission is to provide the Navy and Marine Corps with an integrated scalable system that supports the management of logistical information personnel material and funds required to maintain and operate ships submarines and aircraft.Maritime Tactical Command and Control (MTC2): MTC2 provides Navy with the ability to deliver maritime domain-unique tactical Command and Control (C2) capabilities from Maritime Operations Centers down to the lowest tactical unit of operations.  MTC2 supports alignment and provides interoperability of Navy C2 with the Department of Defense (DoD) joint C2 way-forward.  The program  will fully align with joint C2 data and service exposure and consumption goals architectures and Net-Centric Enterprise Service efforts.  These resources support the evolutionary acquisition materiel solution analysis technology development engineering and software development of these capabilities. Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI) is the Department-wide enterprise solution that enables visibility/accessibility/sharing of data applicable to the entire DoD force structure. GFM-DI is the enterprise solution for force structure representation and MTC2 will be the data source for the Navy's force structure representation. In FY 2014 GFM-DI will perform design and development for integration into MTC2 and will align to the joint command and control objective architecture (jC2 OA).Navy Air Operations Command and Control (NAOC2): integrates and tests Air Force produced systems that provide for an integrated and  scalable planning system that provides standardized secure automated decision support for Air Force Joint and Allied commanders worldwide.  These programs provide automated air operations planning execution management and intelligence capabilities at the Force level to include Fleet Commanders Numbered Fleet Commanders Commander Carrier Strike Group Commander Expeditionary Strike Group Commander Landing Force and Joint Task Force Commanders. NAOC2 includes Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS) Command and Control Air and Space Operations Suite (C2AOS) plus Command Control and Information Services (C2IS). C2AOS and C2IS are being developed as Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) services to allow for scalability and integration with Common Computing Environments (CCE). Continuation of these efforts will significantly enhance the Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) and Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) personnel to plan daily air operations including strike airlift offensive and defensive air and tanker missions in support of combat operations addressing the requirement of war fighter of distributed planning and execution processes and significantly improving Joint interoperability. TBMCS continues a hardware transition to CCEs such as Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES). Currently TBMCS is the key system that is used to conduct real world air planning in the Joint and Navy environment. C2AOS and C2IS will replace TBMCS in a SOA environment while bringing more flexibility to the war fighter planner and executor. FORCEnet:  Initiative's mission is to deliver Information Dominance by (a) accelerating the transformation to a Distributed Networked force; (b) achieve interoperability based on Architectures and Standards; and (c) Experiment with evaluate and employ the enabling technologies.  Effort is a non-acquisition program that is the operational instantiation of FORCEnet.  The end-state is a distributed network of weapons sensors Command and Control (C2) platforms and warriors.  Trident Warrior (TW): TW enables early delivery of Net-Centric Operation/Warfare (NCO/W) capabilities to the warfighter via Fleet-directed Trident Warrior operational events with an emphasis on delivering Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) with Maritime Operations Center (MOC) capability.","764.217","Continuing","Continuing","","",

This PE also supports the Congressionally mandated Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E) program for new ship designs.Contract Design has traditionally been the engineering development of the technical and contractual definition of the ship design (including ship specifications and drawings) to a level of detail sufficient for shipbuilders to make a sound estimate of the construction cost and schedule. Additionally the contract design package developed under this PE has provided the technical baseline from which the Navy selects the shipbuilder who then develops the detail design package required to support the construction and eventual delivery of the ship. This PE also supports the development of design methodologies/tools which facilitate and optimize the transition from ship design documents to efficient production of new ships and ship conversions and supports engineering planning and ship affordability studies.Under Acquisition Reform for new design ships traditional distinct phasing of the design process has been replaced with a continuous concurrent engineering Integrated Product and Process Development (IPPD) process extending through and after contract award. This serves to maintain the focus of multi-discipline teams consisting of the governmentshipbuilder system programs and suppliers.

It includes the Advanced Tactical Data Link Systems (ATDLS) Integration Programs specifically Link 16 Network Command and Control Processor (C2P) and Link Monitoring and Management Tool (LMMT) (formerly Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI)); and Network Tactical Common Data Link (NTCDL) Program which provides the ability to transmit/receive real-time Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) data simultaneously from multiple sources (surface air sub-surface) and exchange command and control information (voice data imagery and Full Motion Video) across dissimilar Joint Service Coalition and civil networks. The Program Element also develops and tests tactical data link capability to distribute other data types to new and existing platforms.JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under Operational Systems Development because it encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for upgrade of existing operational systems.The Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) program consists of two products MIDS Low Volume Terminal (LVT) and MIDS Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). MIDS-LVT provides Link 16 capability to platforms that were unable to employ Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) due to space and weight constraints. The MIDS-LVT effort is multinational (U.S. France Germany Italy and Spain) with joint service participation (Navy Army and Air Force). The Department of Defense (DoD) established the program to design develop and deliver low volume lightweight tactical information system terminals for U.S. and Allied fighter aircraft bombers helicopters ships and ground sites. MIDS-LVT provides interoperability with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) users significantly increasing force effectiveness and minimizing hostile actions and friend-on-friend engagements. The terminal design is smaller lighter highly reliable interoperable with JTIDS Class 2 terminal compatible with all the participants' designated platforms affordable and re-configurable to individual user needs and budgets. MIDS JTRS designed as a Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) and executed as an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to the production MIDS-LVT configuration completed qualification in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. It facilitated the Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) JTRS incremental approach for fielding advanced JTRS transformational networking capability and transformed the MIDS-LVT into a 4-channel Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant Joint Tactical Radio. A form-fit-function replacement to MIDS-LVT MIDS JTRS also adds three programmable 2 Megahertz (MHz) to 2 Gigahertz (GHz) channels capable of hosting the JTRS legacy and networking waveforms. In addition to the Link 16 Tactical Air Navigation and voice functionality found in MIDS-LVT MIDS JTRS has four channels and adds capabilities such as Link 16 Enhanced Throughput four nets Concurrent Multi-Netting (CMN) with Concurrent Contention Receive (CCR) (CMN-4) Link 16 Frequency Re-mapping (FR) software programmability and Cryptographic Modernization (CM). With CMN-4 MIDS JTRS also utilizes Tactical Targeting Network Technology for MIDS JTRS Naval Integrated Fire Control Counter Air and From the Air Advanced Tactical Data Links.  These capabilities provide Joint Airborne Network-Tactical Edge functionality to run advanced mission applications in a cross-platform/cross-domain tactical network enterprise and the ability to simultaneously participate in four Link-16 Nets.","526.025","Continuing","Continuing","554","",

The popular name Triton was approved for the MQ-4C UAV in June 2012 designating the RQ-4 Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) as the MQ-4C Triton. The MQ-4C Triton is a High Altitude-Long Endurance UAV designed to provide Fleet and Combatant Commanders with persistent maritime Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) of nearly all the world's high-density sea-lanes littorals and areas of national interest. Envisioned as an unmanned adjunct to the P-8A Multi-Mission Maritime Aircraft and crucial to the recapitalization of Navy's airborne maritime ISR capability the system will seek to leverage Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force manpower training and maintenance efficiencies.The MQ-4C air vehicle is based on Northrop Grumman's Block 20 Global Hawk and features sensors designed to provide near worldwide coverage through a network of five orbits inside and outside continental United States with sufficient air vehicles to remain airborne for 24 hours a day 7 days a week out to ranges of 2000 nautical miles. Onboard sensors will provide detection classification tracking and identification of maritime targets and include maritime radar electro-optical/infra-red and Electronic Support Measures systems. Additionally the MQ-4C will have a communications relay capability designed to link dispersed forces in the theater of operations and serve as a node in the Navy's FORCEnet strategy. Tactical-level data analysis will occur in real-time at shore-based Mission Control sites connected to the air vehicle via satellite communications. Further intelligence exploitation can be conducted at Fleet shore-based sites or aboard Aircraft Carriers and other ships.MQ-4C will play a significant role in the Sea Shield and FORCEnet pillars of Sea Power 21. In its Sea Shield role the system will rely on its key attribute of persistence to provide the supported Combatant Command or Fleet Commander with unparalleled situational awareness of the maritime battle space as it develops and sustains the Common Operational Tactical Picture. The system will also serve as a Fleet Response Plan enabler while acting as a trip wire for Intelligence Preparation of the Environment. Additionally Triton UAV will be a FORCEnet enabler and relay platform directly connected to both the Global Information Grid and the Distributed Common Ground System-Navy Information Backbone.This PE includes funding in FY15-18 for future incremental development in support of Triton Increment 3 signals intelligence (SIGINT) capability.","963.751","7.310","3358.630","373","",

The JPO's role is to complete consolidation and replacement of existing IBS terminal functionality and capability and to complete execution of the IBS Technical Transition Plan (TTP). The JTT family of systems currently consists of the JTT-Senior and JTT-IBS. The TTP is a comprehensive refresh effort of the entire IBS network focused on rearchitecting the broadcast from its current multi-broadcast multi-data format structure to a single broadcast (Common Interactive Broadcast - CIB) and single data format (Common Message Format - CMF). The JTT family of systems is a critical component of the TTP as these systems are the only IBS receiver/transceiver devices in the DoD being modernized to support both the new consolidated broadcast architecture and the National Security Agency's (NSA) crypto modernization mandate. The JTT upgrades must execute the over-the-air broadcast portion of the TTP and IBS data flow via the existing over-the-air IBS broadcast networks. The JTT is the official IBS producer system and ensures continued IBS interoperability to a variety of tactical receivers across DoD and the Services throughout the TTP implementation period and beyond. This program funds the completion of evaluation of JTT hardware and software modules as well as performance enhancements to the family of JTT equipment. This is necessary to ensure crypto modernization compliance and to complete migration to a rearchitected CIB and CMF-based IBS broadcast structure. Funds also support the coordination of JTT configuration management training equipping and supporting the Warfighter with improved Joint Readiness and Interoperability.FY14 Funds of $0.079 million support the continued test and evaluation of the Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) crypto modernization waveform for migration to the IBS intelligence Data Enterprise.","","","","","",

ASAS provided the means to enhance the commander's timely and comprehensive understanding of enemy deployments capabilities and potential courses of action. The system used standard joint and Army protocols and message formats to interface with selected National joint theater and tactical intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance systems and preprocessors and Army joint and coalition battle command systems. The ASAS Family of Systems migrated into the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) program and Army is using it as the initial platform to provide accelerated DCGS-A capabilities to the force. The Counterintelligence (CI) and Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Automated Reporting and Collection System (CHARCS) is the Army's CI and HUMINT tactical collection and reporting system.  CHARCS provides automation support for information collection reporting investigations source & interrogation operations and document exploitation. The CHARCS automation architecture extends from the individual HUMINT team soldier or CI agent to the Corps Analysis and Control Element (ACE).  CHARCS reports digital data such as maps overlays images video biometrics scanned documents and audio files.  These media are transmitted through secure networks and interfaces with the Distributed Common Ground Systems-Army (DCGS-A) for detailed analysis and creation of finished intelligence products.  Collection and reporting teams at Military Intelligence (MI) battalions and their operational managers are equipped with one of two CHARCS systems.  The first is the AN/PYQ-8 Individual Tactical Reporting Tool (ITRT) which provides collection and processing devices for individual HUMINT team member or CI agents.  The second is the AN/PYQ-3 CI/HUMINT Automated Tool Set (CHATS) which provides the team leader (who normally directs 3-5 team members) tools to process and manage team-collected information and a robust set of devices such as printers scanners cameras and audio recorders to assist the collection mission.  The CHATS is also used by Operational Management Team (OMT) (who normally directs 5-10 collection and reporting teams).  Each CHATS has an associated Mission Support Peripheral Sets and Kits (MS-PSK) or Collection Peripheral Sets and Kits (C-PSK). The Machine Foreign Language Translation System (MFLTS) formerly Sequoyah develops fields and sustains a basic automated foreign speech and text translation capability for Army tactical systems to augment and compliment limited human linguistic resources.  These integrated automated translation capabilities will be applicable across three different system configurations; a hand-held/wearable portable device a laptop/mobile device and in a networked/web-enabled system.

Trojan research and development supports Trojan Classic XXI (TCXXI) and next generation (NexGEN) future capabilities to fulfill the Army's need for a worldwide deployable remotable intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance support that can dynamically execute operations from sanctuary-based to deployed assets in theater. In support of Army Modernization and Army Force Generation TCXXI TROJAN NexGen and TROJAN SWARM will provide soldiers with a real-world hands-on live and near-real time SIGINT training environment sustaining maintaining and enhancing their military occupational specialty proficiencies and specific target expertise. This operational readiness training will fulfill the Army's larger intelligence training requirement via a secure collaborative architecture. A key factor for future force success is the ability to collect process and use information about an adversary while preventing similar information from being disclosed. Trojan is a combined operational and readiness mission system which uses advanced networking technology to provide seamless rapid radio relay secure communications to include voice data facsimile and electronic reconnaissance support to U.S. forces throughout the world. Trojan operations may be easily tailored to fit military intelligence unit training schedules and surged during specific events to involve every aspect of the tactical intelligence collection processing analysis and reporting systems. This project engineers tests and evaluates new digital intelligence collection processing and dissemination technology using the fielded Trojan systems prior to the acquisition of those technologies. As part of the objective intelligence architecture these capabilities will enable processing and dissemination of real-time intelligence data from various sources to form the intelligence needed to issue orders inside the threat decision cycle. To that end it is imperative that Trojan keeps pace with digitization initiatives in order to respond aggressively to the emerging intelligence communication threats.","","","","","",

Products result from investigating analyzing assessing and reporting on the survivability of Soldiers and on the survivability lethality and vulnerability (SLV) of the highest priority Army systems whether those systems are employed during stability support defensive or offensive missions.  Developed through measurement experiment test support and modeling and simulation (M&S) the products funded by this project are used in many ways to make the Army force more survivable.  The project provides quantitative lethality and survivability analyses and data for fielded and developmental systems as the Army makes the required choices to decisively transform into a modular Brigade Combat Team (BCT) based organization.  Specific survivability analysis products include assessments of systems such as Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Stryker Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) Army fire support systems direct fire munitions; Army air defense and missile defense systems; Army aviation systems including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; network communications and other network enabled battle command systems communication systems; and selected joint services systems particularly relevant to the Army's joint and expeditionary role.  Products also include analysis and data concerning individual Soldier items including protective equipment such as helmets and vests.  These survivability products are leveraged into rapid-equipping initiatives and other technical support for operational forces involved in the current fight.  Continued development of these products also guarantees preservation of the Army's vitally needed technical corporate memory for expert survivability advice.Survivability analyses funded by this project are conducted across the spectrum of battlefield threats to include guns missiles mines and other methods of inflicting physical damage; jammers countermeasures and other electronic warfare techniques; information assurance and computer network operations; and directed energy weapons.  This survivability information enables developers users and decision makers to perform credible survivability tradeoffs for both Soldiers and materiel.  These technical survivability details enable properly informed decisions concerning systems and tactics that maximize both the combat power and survivability of Army forces.  Survivability data and analysis results funded by this project are efficiently leveraged for many different Army uses reducing total cost to the Army by eliminating the need for duplicative capabilities funded by individual system developers.  Central funding of this mission assures the Army accurate and consistent treatment of survivability across all classes of systems across all formal system Evaluations and across the Army's AR 5-5 studies process.  Work program is prioritized principally by the ATEC/AEC and is used by them in the Army's formal Evaluation process in such a way that ATEC can comply with its legally mandated responsibility to assess system survivability along with effectiveness and suitability.  Program Managers (PM) and the Program Executive Officers (PEO) use the survivability analyses and data funded by this project to make design decisions that are optimized for survivability to direct specific weapon system development efforts that are needed for survivability enhancement and to structure product improvement programs. Soldier survivability data and analysis is leveraged to support the survivability portion of the HQDA G1 MANPRINT program.  TRADOC combat developers exploit the survivability products funded by this project to initiate and improve survivability/lethality requirements and to develop and refine doctrine and tactics.  Also the quantitative analytical results funded by the project are leveraged as core inputs to formal AR 5-5 studies and other studies as directed by Army leaders.  While the Army is at war analytical results funded by this project are also directly leveraged for survivability support to current operations.  Finally for particularly urgent or controversial survivability issues data and analysis funded by this project are used directly by senior Army decision makers to assure technically sound program/production decisions.    This project also supports highly technical specialized information assurance and computer network defense survivability analysis of Army battle command/networked systems as well as Army network architectures and technology.  Supports ATEC and other electronic warfare vulnerability testers and evaluators by developing and providing highly technical specialized field countermeasure environments that threat forces may employ against Army communications networks air defense and other systems.

In FY14 the program office will initiate the execution of the AFATDS Increment 2 requirements. AFATDS provides the Army Navy and Marine Corps automated fire support command control and communications and functions as the land component’s automated Fire Support Command and Control (FSC2) system.  AFATDS is used in the Fires Warfighting Function to plan execute and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects within the overall Mission Command and Control (MC2) enterprise. Additionally the system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems to include Navy and Air Force command and control weapon systems; and the German French Turkish and Italian fire support systems.  AFATDS fuses the essential situational awareness (SA) data intelligence information and targeting data in near real time in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities.  Additionally the system will pair targets to weapons to provide optimum use of fire support assets and timely execution of fire missions.  Also the system automates the planning coordinating and controlling of all fire support assets (field artillery mortars close air support naval gunfire attack helicopters offensive electronic warfare fire support meteorological systems forward observers and fire support radars).  Furthermore the system will automatically implement detailed commander’s guidance in the automation of operational planning movement control targeting target value analysis and fire support planning. Currently the system interoperates with the other Army mission command systems and is being used in operations in Afghanistan. The program office is currently fielding non-developmental rugged common hardware running the Windows Operating System. The total force will be fielded a Windows based platform by fiscal year 2013.  Currently AFATDS Version 6.8 and 6.8.X are being developed and expect to achieve Full Materiel Releases (FMR) in 2Q FY2013 and 2Q FY2015.  With the completion of AFATDS Version 6.8.X the program office will complete the AFATDS Increment 1 requirements and will start the Increment 2 development in 4Q FY2014.  JADOCS is a Joint Interagency Intergovernmental and Multinational (JIIM) Targeting Mission Management and Common Operational Picture (COP) Windows-based software suite which functions as a complementary system to the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). JADOCS provides integration and synergy between multiple Command & Control (C2) systems of the uniformed services and joint and combined elements involved in the targeting process and performs coordination and calculates collateral damage. JADOCS Mission Managers support this coordination amongst Warfighter functional areas to rapidly execute critical missions. JADOCS enables coordination and de-confliction of conventional and asymmetric war-fighting missions. JADOCS is fielded to Air Force Navy Marine Corps and Army units involved in the targeting process at Division Corps and Echelons Above Corps. JADOCS provides the Combatant Commands with the capability to plan and direct theater counter-fire and precision strike operations through the real time synchronization of US and Coalition assets. The application provides the Warfighter with a combination of tools services and Mission Managers for rapid "system of systems" integration visualization coordination and deconfliction of critical mission information.

The Aegis BMD element of the BMDS capitalizes upon and evolves from the existing U.S. Navy Aegis Weapons System (AWS) and Standard Missile (SM) infrastructures. Aegis BMD provides a forward-deployable mobile capability to detect and track Ballistic Missiles of all ranges and the ability to destroy Short-Range Ballistic Missiles (SRBM) Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles (MRBM) and Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBM) in the midcourse phase of flight Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) in early phase of flight and shorter range missile in terminal phase. Aegis BMD also provides a Long Range Surveillance and Track (LRS&T) capability to the BMDS. Upgrades to both the Aegis BMD Weapon System and the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) configuration enable Aegis BMD to provide effective supportable defensive capability against longer range more sophisticated threats and an enduring Aegis Ashore defensive capability. Aegis BMD provides/will provide several capabilities in support of the objective to defend allies and deployed forces from intermediate threats: Aegis BMD 4.0:-Aegis BMD 4.0 and the SM-3 Block IB missile improve Aegis BMD`s ability to engage longer range more sophisticated ballistic missiles that may deploy countermeasures and are launched in larger raid sizes. Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) sensor improvements include the AN/SPY-1 radar`s signal processor and the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IB kinetic warhead`s (KW) two-color infra-red (IR) seeker. The Aegis BMD Signal Processor provides a real-time discrimination and characterization capability. The two-color seeker with an Advanced Signal Processor improves sensitivity for longer range targets high speed processing for multiple targets and improved performance against more sophisticated threats. Besides the two-color IR seeker the SM-3 Block IB Kinetic Warhead (KW) divert engine system has been upgraded over the SM-3 Block IA. The new divert engine the Throttleable Divert and Attitude Control System (TDACS) provides more flexible divert to maneuver the Kill Vehicle (KV) to intercept. MDA anticipates Aegis BMD 4.0 to be assessed as operationally suitable and effective the 4th quarter of FY 2013. Deploying FY 2014: -Aegis BMD 5.0 - Integrates Aegis BMD 4.0.1 capability into the Navy-developed Open Architecture (OA) computing environment. This change is necessary for Aegis BMD to remain compatible with Navy as ship modernization plans are executed. Improves human-systems interface through display enhancements; eliminates the need for a separate computing system specific to the BMD mission; enables more ships to serve in the BMD mission; supports the BMDS Integrated Build D; and provides the basis for Aegis Ashore. Deploying in the Future: -Aegis BMD 5.0. Capability upgrade (CU) - Enhances Aegis BMD 5.0 by restoring the terminal defense layer increasing raid size and expanding the threat set by FY 2015. -Aegis BMD computer program baseline and missile system modifications necessary to place Aegis BMD capability on land (Aegis Ashore) will take place by FY 2014. -SM-3 Block IIA - Aegis BMD and the Japan Ministry of Defense (JMOD) have undertaken an SM-3 Cooperative Development (SCD) program which consists of a spiral upgrade to a 21-inch diameter SM-3 missile (SM-3 Block IIA). Missile development will be covered under the SCD project prior to the SM-3 Block IIA incorporation into the Aegis BMD 5.1 upgrade to the Aegis BMD system. The design will be completed by FY 2018; Initial Production by FY 2018; and production by FY 2020. -Aegis BMD 5.1- Integrates the SM-3 Block IIA missile and future missiles. It will provide an improved terminal defense capability in an Open Architecture (OA) environment. The SM-3 Block IIA missile will expand available battlespace and include Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) and selected longer-range threats and when combined with additional weapon system modifications will enable an Engage-on-Remote (EoR) capability. SM-3 Block IIA and Aegis BMD 5.1 will further extend Aegis BMDs range capability by capitalizing on globally-deployed BMDS sensor assets. The certification and deployment will take place by FY 2018. BMD Systems Engineering:Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Systems Engineering integrates element development and Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP) work to optimize the capability of the BMDS. Modeling and simulation (M&S) activities support all phases of Aegis BMD`s development including development of Aegis Weapon System (AWS) and SM-3 variants flight test missions ground tests war games exercises and performance assessment. Models and simulations are tailored to the specific need of a component in its current phase of development ranging from low-to-medium fidelity analysis supporting concept definition studies to high-fidelity models used to support engineering development or testing and are integrated into the BMD Digital Simulations Architecture. Proving Missile Defense: Working with the Services` Operational Test Agencies (OTA) with the support of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has developed a test program to improve confidence in missile defense capabilities under development and ensure the capabilities transferred to the war fighter are operationally effective and suitable. As part of the Agency`s rigorous test program System Pre-Flight predictions provide confidence in test execution by predicting element performance and exercising element interfaces. System Post Flight Reconstruction replicates the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) configuration and actual environmental conditions and target dynamics observed in flight to anchor modeling and simulation results. Testing includes SM-3 intercept using Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) as a remote sensor. The Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP) is event-oriented and extends until the collection of all identified data is completed to ensure adequate data is collected to support Verification Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) for Missile Defense Modeling and Simulation (M&S).

Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network robotic and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability lethality and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are:  (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible robust and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  The Maritime Systems project will identify develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Naval forces play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.","","","","","",

These projects are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF); 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF); 3) Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) Architecture and Integration (RAI) program; 4) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support; and 5) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) support.  QRSP provides the flexibility to respond to emergent Department of Defense (DoD) issues and address technology surprises and needs within the years of execution outside the two year budget cycle. The QRF Program objectives are to respond to emergent conventional warfare needs during the execution years that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies.  The QRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office.  Examples of the types of projects that are envisioned include:  force protection projects to enhance anti-access and area denial capabilities undersea offensive capabilities and broad electronic warfare capabilities.  The QRF focuses on maturing technologies critically needed for the Combatant Commands.  QRF projects are typically 12 months in duration and produce prototypes with new capabilities for demonstration and evaluation. The RRF objectives are to leverage the DoD science and technology (S&T) base and those of the other federal departments and to provide feedback to the S&T community to guide long term developmental strategies.  The RRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  RRTO works to anticipate adversaries’ exploitation of new technologies and advanced capabilities and develop counters to those capabilities.  Additionally RTTO works to leverage technology developed outside of the DoD in the commercial sector academia international arenas and small non-traditional businesses to expose them to specific DoD needs areas as identified by Combatant Commanders Military Service organizations other Defense agencies and interagency organizations.  The typical length of an RTTO program falls within a 6 to 12 month range in order to more effectively aid the warfighter.  The RRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 30 percent for demonstration programs (DoD Strategic Objective 4-3). The RDT&E Architecture and Integration (RAI) program objectives are to enhance and expand rapid technology architecture and assessment capabilities in general; and to enhance the Joint Experimentation Range Complex (JERC) Stiletto maritime test platform and the Thunderstorm ISR exercise series.  The JERC provides a venue to evaluate a wide range of new technologies in a dessert environment.  The requested funding will also support Stiletto a maritime test vessel that routinely hosts numerous new technologies for evaluation in a maritime environment.  Thunderstorm an ongoing Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) exercise series is also supported by this budget line.  Thunderstorm brings emerging ISR technologies together in a common architecture for exercise and operational demonstration.   The JRAC Program objectives focus on responding to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) that have been submitted by Combatant Commanders and validated by the Joint Staff.  In addition the JRAC’s objectives are to manage the delivery of capabilities as requested by the Combatant Command (COCOM) in a time frame acceptable to the COCOM.  Efforts in most instances are conducted outside of the processes described in the Defense Acquisition System in DoD Directive 5000.1 and utilize contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.The SMA cell program objective is to support all Combatant Commands (COCOMs) Joint Force Commanders and other government agencies by assessing complex operational/technical challenges which require multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the United States Government academia and the private sector the SMA cell develops solution options to COCOM generated challenging problems and informs the command’s senior leadership.  Each SMA cell effort is initiated at the request of COCOM senior leadership. Priorities for SMA Cell programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy for Operations.  Products are typically produced within six months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the COCOM’s senior leaders.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment to this effort.  The DoE matches the DoD JMP funds budgeted in this justification dollar for dollar.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation DoD’s relatively small investment leverages DOE’s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills advanced scientific equipment and facilities and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services’ needs have provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration development and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.The JMP seeks to develop:  improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions design and evaluation including evaluation of vulnerability (for example:  design of insensitive munitions (IM)); novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation; higher power and safer explosives and propellants; miniaturized lower cost and higher reliability fuzes initiators power systems and sensors; design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons such as penetrators that are hardened against high impact loads; and tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.The JMP is aligned with Department strategic plans and policies such as:– Munitions for contingency operations particularly for the reduction of unintended collateral effects.– Reducing time and cost for acquisition of munitions.– Rapidly transitioning science and technology (S&T) to support the warfighter in today’s conflicts.– Establishing future core capabilities and maintaining our national S&T capabilities through joint investment and interagency cooperation and teaming.– Aiding in recruiting and retaining high-caliber scientists and engineers at DoD S&T organizations.– Developing advanced munitions technologies to support the increased role of conventional weapons to deter and respond to non-nuclear attack as described in the Nuclear Posture Review report.– Developing safer munitions that are compliant with IM standards to meet statutory and Department policy requirements.The JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  This community develops technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) which is comprised of over 25 senior executives from the Army Navy Air Force Special Operations Command the Defense Threat Reduction Agency OSD and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content relevance and progress.  The TCG conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCG to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD needs.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.The JMP has a long history of successful transitions and significant Return on Investment (ROI).– The JMP is the primary provider of high performance structural mechanics computer codes used by DoD.  According to the FY 2010 High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) Requirements Analysis Report the DOE computer codes are used for over 70 percent of all (classified and unclassified) structural mechanics simulations and for virtually all of the classified calculations run by DoD on HPCMP platforms.  The Department expects this heavy reliance on DOE codes to grow for several reasons including: preference for using DOE codes because they are export-controlled; DOE codes are scalable incorporate multiphysics and run on massively parallel computer systems; and the Department can obtain source codes to modify for individual Service needs.– A significant number of defense industrial contractors also use the DOE structural mechanics computer codes.– CHEETAH a standalone thermochemical computer code is the most widely used code by DoD and defense contractors for predicting performance of energetic materials.– The Army Research & Engineering Development Center (ARDEC) has stated that the DOE computer codes are now routinely used to design all new warheads.  The use of these tools has reduced the number of validation tests required for each new warhead from about five to one with concomitant cost and time savings.– The Army Research Laboratory has used DOE computer codes to develop and deploy new armor solutions to Iraq and Afghanistan with unprecedented speed.– New munitions’ case material and explosive fill technologies provide the warfighter with a lethal and low collateral damage capability.  These technologies have been transitioned to the Focused Lethality Munition variant of the Small Diameter Bomb which is currently fielded.  The technologies are also the basis for a new GBU 129 weapon that is currently under rapid development to meet a Joint Urgent Operational Need requirement for a low-collateral Mk-82 class weapon.– The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has supported applications of JMP technologies including: compact synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) efforts; pre-deployment training of military personnel by DOE explosive experts on how to recognize feed stocks and processes for homemade explosives; and use of massively parallel multiphysics computer codes to understand how explosive blast waves cause brain injury and how to mitigate these injuries.– An erosive initiator technology developed under the JMP has been transitioned to the Services for use in selectable output weapons and self-destruct capabilities.– A novel approach to controlling the sensitivity and therefore the initiability of explosives using microwave energy as well two new insensitive energetic materials have transitioned to development projects in the Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology and Joint Fuze Technology Programs.– Reliability analysis tools were used by Army Missile Command to assess Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM) and Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wire command data-linked guided Missile (TOW).– Robotic demilitarization processing systems were installed at several locations including a system at Hawthorne Army Depot to recover copper shape charge liners Comp A5 and grenade bodies. The JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Warheads and Energetics Consortium (NWEC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors.  In addition to the computer codes mentioned earlier the JMP has transitioned case technology for low-collateral weapons low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology for smaller less expensive fuze electronic components and erosive initiator technology for selectable effects weapons to defense industrial suppliers.The integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions’ technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the approximately 35 JMP projects require multi-year efforts and sustained long-term investments to achieve success.The JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling; Energetic Materials; Initiators Fuzes and Sensors; Warhead and Penetration Technology; and Munitions Lifecycle Technologies.","","Continuing","Continuing","","R2Long",

The OSD JWP account underwrites two related activities supporting development of the Department's joint warfighting capabilities.  In anticipation of constrained military budgets there will be increased demand for JWP support as Combatant Commanders will be under pressure to refine their requests for supplementary capabilities to define their capability requirements and identify potential solution options.  The Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP) segment provides innovative and responsive analytic support on joint capability development serving the needs of joint capability clients.  It provides an independent source to examine potential remedies for mission capability gaps and can establish a framework for accelerated acquisition subsequent field experiments and capability demonstrations.  JAWP often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine Organization Training Material Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.  JAWP resources sustain a small dedicated staff of civilian operation research analysts (currently hosted by the Institute for Defense Analysis – IDA).  Administered by the Joint Operations Support cell within OSD/AT&L the JAWP conducts an annual call for inputs from Combatant Command staffs elements that formulate Capability Gap assessments and technology based initiatives.  Project selection is undertaken in consultation with the OSD staffs serving AT&L and Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff. The balance of JWP resources are dedicated to analytic support for joint capabilities and joint customers.  JWP provides a safety net for analytic support responding to emergent joint capability requirements and capability gaps.  Typical projects funded with JWP include translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements identification of candidate solutions via experimentation translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources dedicated to direct support joint commands provides analytic expertise not normally allocated via formal staffing billets.

The PE funds advanced technology development for Joint Service and Service-specific requirements in both medical and physical sciences CBR defense areas.  The medical program (was TB3 TC3 TR3 but in FY13 these continue within one project TM3) aims to produce biological diagnostic assays and reagents diagnostic device platforms pretreatments and therapeutics for bacterial viral and toxin threats as well as for chemical threats and medical devices as countermeasures for CBR threat agents.  Specific areas of medical investigation include: prophylaxis pretreatment antidotes and therapeutics personnel and patient decontamination and medical management of casualties.  In the physical sciences area (CB3) the focus is on demonstrations of CB defense technologies including biological detection chemical detection information system technology for hazard prediction and systems performance and protection and decontamination. NT3 consolidated all efforts related to non-traditional agents (NTAs) including NTA chemical diagnostics medical pretreatments therapeutics detection and protection and hazard mitigation. The PE also provides for the conduct of advanced technology development in the areas of real-time sensing accelerated biological warfare operational awareness and the restoration of operations following a biological warfare or chemical warfare attack (project TT3).  The PE is dedicated to conducting proof-of-principle field demonstrations and testing system-specific technologies to meet specific military needs.  Work conducted under this PE will transition to and will provide risk reduction for System Integration/Demonstration (PE 0603884BP/PE 0604384BP) activities.Key efforts within this PE are in support of the FY14 policy priorities for Countering Biological Threats.  Approximately $71.9M supports the priority to "Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capacity to prevent detect and respond to infectious disease threats whether caused by natural accidental or deliberate events."  Approximately $60.0M supports the priority to "Expand our capability to prevent attribute and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities."  Approximately $75.4M supports the priority to "Leverage science technology and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capacity to respond to and recover from biological incidents."To recap in FY13 all traditional agent Medical Biological and Medical Chemical Defense efforts (Projects TB3 and TC3) were re-aligned to Project TM3 - Techbase Medical Defense (ATD).  CB3 Advanced Technology Development efforts continue to pursue solutions against traditional agents.  All non-traditional agent (NTA)-dedicated research (both medical and non-medical) was re-aligned to Project NT3 - Techbase Non-Traditional Agents Defense (ATD).

This program element supports the Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) of medical and non-medical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) medical and non-medical CB Defense initiatives.  DoD missions for civil support operations have recently expanded and have resulted in providing focus to develop technologies to support CB counterterrorism initiatives.  Projects within BA4 are structured to consolidate Joint and Service-unique tasks within four commodity areas: contamination avoidance individual and collective force protection decontamination and medical countermeasures.  ADC&P is conducted for an array of chemical biological and toxin detection and warning systems providing early warning collector concentrators generic detection improved reagents and decontamination systems using solutions that will remove and/or detoxify contaminated materiel without damaging combat equipment personnel or the environment.  CB sensors and diagnostics enhance the Departments environmental and medical surveillance efforts by improving the monitoring and surveillance of threats and forces preparing for and engaged in military operations.  These efforts are required to enable military commanders and the Military Health System to prevent treat and mitigate threats to individual Service Members and military units.  Integration of CB sensor and diagnostic data from the programs in this ACD&P will also be usable within the homeland security and Federal public health common operating pictures.  The Department of Defense is responsible for research development acquisition and deployment of medical countermeasures to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD unlike those developed to support U.S. population must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasizes prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this ACD&P such as vaccines against the most likely biological threat agents and traditional / non-traditional chemical agent prophylaxis conserves fighting strength decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation and satisfies the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available efforts on this ACD&P support pre-hospitalization treatment en-route care hospital care and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include improvements to CB diagnostics and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic agents and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  DoD is the only Federal activity conducting ACD&P on these prophylactic diagnostic and therapeutic CB medical countermeasures.  The Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  The Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process ("One Portfolio").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research development acquisition and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research development and acquisition because of its unique facilities testing capabilities and trained and experienced personnel.  ACD&P also supports the development of updated test capabilities to evaluate Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Defense systems.  Also included is the Techbase Technology Transition effort which validates high-risk/high-payoff technologies that could significantly improve Warfighter capabilities.  Key efforts within this PE are in support of the FY14 policy priorities for Countering Biological Threats.  Approximately $92.9M supports the priority to "Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capacity to prevent detect and respond to infectious disease threats whether caused by natural accidental or deliberate events."  Approximately $45.8M supports the priority to "Expand our capability to prevent attribute and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities."  Approximately $124.0M supports the priority to "Leverage science technology and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capacity to respond to and recover from biological incidents."The projects in this program element support efforts in the technology development phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 4.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

The Common Joint Tactical Information funding line responds to the Department's requirement for joint and combined network-enabled tactical data link (TDL) capabilities and for communications which meet net-centric standards to ensure interoperability and seamless integration with joint communication systems. It will be used to assess and promote competition across TDLs DoD-wide and to provide acquisition oversight of TDL-related activities such as CDL waveforms Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN) narrowband TDL gateways Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) and datalink roadmaps to guide future investments. This funding line provides resources for acquisition support and management oversight of critical command control communications (C3) and non-intelligence space capabilities as the Department migrates to netcentric operations. Funds will be used to provide technical systems engineering and acquisition management oversight of programs projects and activities to maximize the Department’s return on investment in information technology resources and to effect a comprehensive approach for assessing and procuring critical information systems from initial design through development to capability delivery in support of improved weapons systems performance and military operations. Resources will be allocated for architecture design and development portfolio management enterprise-wide systems engineering and operational impact analyses related to C3 and non-intelligence space systems. They will also be used to provide expertise required for exercising technical direction over design performance and cost parameters of key systems and their dependencies. The goal of this funding is to eliminate redundancy reduce time to the field evaluate projects and concepts for adherence to net-centric guidelines minimize performance and operational risk of developing and fielding complex major systems which rely on networks and supporting applications ensure program dependencies are documented and included in acquisition decisions and address interoperability requirements gaps and best value technical solutions.

Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability readiness and safety and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD has been estimated at over 23 billion each year. The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010. (U) The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&L)) designated a Director Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies materials and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus technology development demonstration and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.  In FY 2009 the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities. (U) The Corrosion Prevention Control Integrated Product Team membership consists of both the equipment and infrastructure corrosion control experts from the Services the Joint Staff the Coast Guard and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  The Services are given project submission instructions evaluation procedures and selection criteria.  The CPC project selection board chaired by the Director Corrosion Policy and Oversight reviews the projects and makes recommendations to the USD(AT&L) for final approval.(U) The former DoD Corrosion Executive issued a policy letter that states: "Basic systems design materials and processes selection and intrinsic corrosion-prevention strategies establish the corrosion susceptibility of Defense material.  The early stages of acquisition provide our best opportunity to make effective trade-offs among the many competing design criteria. . ."  The Congress and former DoD Corrosion Executive made it clear that research and development into materials and methods to prevent or mitigate corrosion should receive high priority.  Since Congress has clearly established this program as one of its highest priorities and has reiterated its expectations regarding funding levels and methods our budget request is designed to reflect both fiscal realities of one or more on many proposed projects over the next five to ten years. These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of storage tanks and other mission support facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of electrical and avionics equipment.  Likewise an array of highly effective rapid cure coatings that are easy to apply and can forestall corrosion for many years on aircraft and ships are being developed.  Other vital projects being considered include sealants wash down systems sensors and prognostic technologies that have joint service applications and potential to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects over a wide range of systems.  Funding for this program will provide a critically needed resource to trigger even larger investment and cost avoidance.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

JSIC promotes Service/Defense Agency C2 capability integration and conducts technical operational and DOTMLPF assessments of Command and Control (C2) and Command Control Computer Communication Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) capabilities.  JSIC serves as the technical analysis and operational assessment activity in support of the Joint Staff capability-driven requirements process the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS).  JSIC also serves as a joint interoperability compliance activity for the milestone decision authorities/program managers in the Defense acquisition enterprise.The FY 2005 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) directed the transfer for Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding for joint warfare experimentation and training programs from Navy accounts to new Defense Wide RDT&E accounts beginning in FY 2007.  Joint Staff J8 is the executive agent for the JSIC PE and Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD (R&E)) provides execution oversight.JSIC provides Combatant Commands at the joint force headquarters level with a laboratory and assessment environment for the warfighter and capability developer.  This environment provides for assessment of current and near-term joint and coalition capabilities primarily at the operational and tactical levels. JSIC's Persistent Command and Control (C2) Environment accurately replicates an operational C2 environment. With this capability JSIC assesses system of systems interoperability operational capability procedural compliance and technical suitability of emerging and existing systems and programs to confirm readiness for deployment.  Through JSIC's analysis and assessment systems are evaluated for "value-added" prior to employment in joint and coalition environments typical of deployed theaters of operation.  By establishing ground truth for interoperability and suggesting remedies for demonstrated shortfalls JSIC is an enabler for interoperable joint and coalition solutions and provides a means to foster rapid near-term insertion of C4ISR technology by promoting the ability to meet the DoD direction for spiral development and evolutionary acquisition.  JSIC's mission is to provide for the fielding of warfighter C2 systems through rapid systems integration technical assessment and operational evaluation using laboratory environments and field venues.  In the world of C2 and ISR interoperability performance in the field is the bottom line. In terms of investment JSIC is the "ounce of prevention" that precludes a "pound" of mission failure and loss of life due to interoperability failures in military operations.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the DoD’s “Testing in a Joint Environment Roadmap” to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to “test like we fight.”  JMETC provides a persistent distributed test and evaluation (T&E) capability that otherwise would not be readily available to Service/Component acquisition programs.  This program is funded within the RDT&E Management Support Budget Activity because it is intended to provide test capability in support of RDT&E programs.         JMETC creates a common corporate capability to link live systems with virtual and constructive representations in order to generate a realistic joint mission test environment for the system(s) being tested.  To support the DoD guidance on cyber defense and attack operations the JMETC environment includes a distributed cyberspace interoperability testing capability for systems under test.  JMETC is a widely applicable persistent service provider for the Department’s acquisition and net-centric programs.  Key JMETC products include readily available connectivity over existing networks standardized data transport solutions tools and utilities for planning and conducting distributed integrations DoD corporate distributed testing expertise and a reuse repository.  This common integration capability through the use of the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) provides compatibility between JMETC and the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) streamlining reuse of technical resources across the test and training communities.  In turn this integration capability enables combined test and training exercises.        By linking distributed facilities JMETC allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  This enables a customer-defined joint mission test environment for systems engineering and testing extensible to training and experimentation in a timely and cost effective manner.        JMETC’s institutional funding builds maintains and operates the JMETC infrastructure and pays for persistent availability of national connectivity for testing; data communications middleware; identification and development of interface standards; common software tools and components; and a reuse repository.  It also funds JMETC program management facilities equipment operating costs and special studies and analysis related to distributed test capabilities and infrastructure.  Key attributes of the JMETC include:  persistency; interoperability; reuse; various combinations of distributed capabilities (reconfigurable infrastructure to meet customer requirements to include distributed cyber testing); modeling and simulation (M&S) linkage; Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) test resource integration; and distributed test support to satisfy both Service and Joint needs.  System engineering training and experimentation all benefit from a corporate JMETC developed for T&E.       The Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is the Department’s lead for the JMETC program and oversees both its development and its operations.","","Continuing","Continuing","","R2Long",

This PE includes application of R&D to expedite prototype development and mission support efforts to sustain and/or modernize operations required for general RDT&E.Project 1:  Joint Service Training & Readiness System Development.  This program transfers to OUSD (P&R) in FY 2013. Project 2:  The Defense Training Resources Analysis.  This program transfers to OUSD (P&R) in FY 2013.Project 3:  DoD Enlistment Processing and Testing. The project administers testing programs which enable the Armed Services to select highly qualified military recruits. The DoD uses a single test the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) to determine eligibility of military applicants and to report recruit quality data to Congress. High quality recruits are obtained from administering the ASVAB annually to approximately 600000 applicants for Military Service as part of the DoD Enlistment Testing program and to 1 million students in the DoD Student Testing program. Each Service also uses ASVAB test forms developed in this program as part of their in-service testing programs. New ASVAB test forms and related support materials are implemented approximately every four years. This allows DoD to make measurement improvements as well as decrease the likelihood of test compromise. Ongoing RDT&E efforts include development and evaluation of procedures which (1) reduce or eliminate threats to the validity of the ASVAB test scores generated; (2) improve the efficiency of the test development calibration and validation process; and (3) improve selection and classification decisions made by each Service through more effective use of test score information. In addition periodic assessments are required to provide DoD manpower planners and Congress with information on aptitude trends in the population from which recruits are drawn.Project 4:   Federal Voting Assistance Program.  Given the agile planning and deployment flexibilities required in as dynamic a RDT&E environment as internet voting the FY 2013 execution plan will be significantly influenced by the results of the FY2011 and FY2012 research development and evaluation results.  However current plans are to initiate the first two phases of the internet voting demonstration competition challenge:o  Phase I of Internet Voting Competition Challenge:  In the first phase submissions will focus on defining security reliability usability and accountability requirements for internet voting systems. Submissions will be open to the public and will be open to public critique. FVAP will review those submissions and critiques and then consolidate them into a single set of requirements for Phase II. o  Phase II of Internet Voting Competition Challenge:  In this phase submission will provide high level designs and detailed hardware and software architectures along with procedures necessary for secure operation. Submissions will be sufficiently detailed so that a reasonably skilled information technologist could implement the system to allow for broader peer review.  However many details such as user interfaces and database layouts will be likely be undefined. As with the first phase submissions will be open for critique. In this phase critiques will focus on identifying areas where designs do not meet the requirements defined in the first phase. The result may be modification of architectures to incorporate ideas from several teams. At the conclusion of this phase the Department will narrow down the set of acceptable architectures. o  RDT&E funding for the internet voting program is discontinued in FY 2014 until the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have established the measurements and standards against which internet voting can be evaluated.  Project 5: Civilian HR automation enhancements planned for FY 2012 and FY 2013 are focused on software development to support the Department’s civilian workforce including readiness requirements for the development of automation for an expeditionary civilian workforce; an SES-focused performance management system; development of interfaces with the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) and other civilian HR systems to fully expand the Enterprise Staffing Solution; development of DCPDS interfaces with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) initiative mandates for HR Line of Business (LoB) electronic Official Personnel Folder Retirement Systems Modernization implementation and HR Line of Business. DoD is one of five designated Shared Service Centers in the federal government focused on providing standard services across agency lines gaining potential significant business and cost-saving benefits. DoD is considered a leader in this initiative. Continues the conversion of employees back to other personnel systems as mandated in NDAA 2010 and designs new flexibilities to include but not limited to the establishment of policies and procedures for a new Performance Management System a redesigned hiring process adhering to veterans’ preference requirements a “Department of Defense Civilian Workforce Incentive fund” and a Mandatory Training and Retraining Program for Supervisors. DCPDS is the Department’s enterprise civilian HR system that has provided the savings originally projected in the achievement of full operational capability in 2002 and which has continued to operate as the DoD system serving over 800000 employee records. Additional initiatives to sustain the Department’s lead in automated systems to include expansion of employee self service functionality and systems to support civilian HR requirements of the intelligence and National Guard communities. All enhancements will support the Department’s focus on the further consolidation of civilian HR operations to a single operational site with linkage to Component operations worldwide.Project 6:  The integrated DoD SAPR Data Collection and Reporting System (Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database (DSAID)) must accommodate a variety of uses including the tracking of sexual assault victim support services support SAPR program administration program reporting requirements and data analysis. In order to facilitate analysis at the OSD level the System should be able to easily export data for analysis in computerized statistical applications such as Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Service field-level users may use the system to track support to victims of sexual assault throughout the lifecycle of that support requirement and to facilitate sexual assault case transfer between SARCs and Services. Service headquarters-level users will use the system to support program planning analysis and management. DoD SAPR Office (SAPRO) users and Service headquarters-level users will access the system to produce mandated and requested reports monitor program effectiveness and support cohort and trend analysis. The Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database (DSAID) will support SAPR programs for all active duty and Reserve personnel including National Guard (NG) Service members when on active duty or when performing active service and inactive duty training (as defined in Section (101)(d)(3) of Chapter 47 of title 10 United States Code) with the ability to expand to cover other DoD personnel as required. Additionally system implementation at the state level will provide a new capability to manage SAPR programs for National Guard personnel under Title 32 USC.  Implementation of this capability will be based on a state NG structure grouped according to state and subdivided into sexual assaults from the separate Army and Air National Guard.  Full Deployment and Delivery (FDD) is scheduled for Q4 FY2012 as a result additional RDT&E funding will not be required after FY2012.Project 7:  Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) acts as the authoritative source for identity and personnel information for the DoD Net Centric Enterprise Computing vision of the Department of Defense’s Global Information Grid (GIG 2.0). Based on the DEERS identities DMDC provides the key attribute service for the Department of Defense (DoD) Identity and Access Management (IdAM) Capability. The Enterprise Identity Attribute Service (EIAS) supports IdAM through the distribution of DoD person and personnel attributes to applications and services in a controlled consistent and secure manner to support ABAC decisions. The controlled authoritative information provided via EIAS can be used to confirm an individual’s identity affiliation to the DoD clearance pay grade/rank organization and occupation series for an authorization decision. A key attribute for decision makers is organization. The Global Force Management Data Initiative (GFM_DI) provides the unique organization identifier (OUID) in the EIAS payload. To meet the DoD demand for the OUID DMDC working with J8 and the Service/Agencies has to 1) establish the linkage between a person (EDI_PI) and the OUID 2) provide the OUID attribute in the EIAS payload for access decisions and 3) standardize the organizational attributes required to make access decisions. Project 8:  The Neo Tracking System (NTS) / Emergency Tracking Accountability System (ETAS) is a certified and accredited DoD automated system that accounts for and sustains visibility of noncombatant evacuees during a NEO under the authority of DODD 1000.25 DoD Personnel Identity Protection (PIP) Program. NTS is currently being used in the USAFRICOM USCENTCOM USEUCOM USSOUTHCOM and USPACOM AORs. The ETAS component is the CONUS domestic version of NTS and is for use by USNORTHCOM during disasters in the CONUS whether natural accidental or acts of terrorism. The primary purpose of the NTS/ETAS is to provide individual accountability of the evacuee by creating and maintaining a database of evacuees assembled during an evacuation operation and subsequently tracking the evacuees' movement throughout the evacuation process.Project 9:  The Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker Enterprise Suite (SPOT-ES) is the Department of Defense (DoD) system of record for accountability and visibility of contracts and contractor personnel authorized to operate in a contingency operation.  SPOT-ES provides web based tracking and visibility into contract services personnel and equipment locations; provides a common operational picture for Combatant Commanders; enhances the analytical tools to accurately plan for the quantity of contracted support required for future contingency operations; and collects accurate data for the OMB-directed quarterly census of all contractors supporting contingency operations.","64.408","Continuing","Continuing","","",

PCL delivers vital one-of-a-kind research development test and evaluation (RDT&E) expertise directly to the warfighter capability developer and allied/coalition forces.From its inception in 1985 PCL constantly advances the state-of-the-art for developmental smart munitions seekers/sensors and their platforms.  PCL also focuses its capability against today's networked weapons emerging weapon concepts and helps develop innovative targeting technologies to be employed against a wide variety of vehicle targets theater air defense units and an extensive array of associated equipment.  Combat systems and support equipment exhibit physical characteristics (i.e. signatures) and present certain vulnerabilities which can be exploited by various targeting technologies leading to the elimination or incapacitation of the threat through the application of force (e.g. smart munitions or directed energy) or application of intelligence surveillance reconnaissance (ISR) methods.  PCL collects physical functional and signature attributes of real foreign threat systems and related equipment; these data feed high-fidelity models used to predict detection classification vulnerability and effectiveness performance for ISR sensor and weapon system design.  PCL collects high resolution signature data using a variety of ground air and space-based sensors against both new and existing (obtained sustained and maintained to be signature representative) foreign targets; with and without the presence of camouflage concealment and deception materials; and operated using enemy tactics/CONOPS.  The resulting highly reliable realistic  data directly supports munitions/targeting development programs and helps mitigate overall acquisition risk. PCL serves as a major focal point for joint signature exploitation collection and dissemination amongst the DoD and intelligence community (IC). PCL is a prime contributor in the time critical process to rapidly exploit assess and determine US and allied weapon/targeting performance against high value targets.  Customers include: the major Defense and Service Intelligence Centers all Services the Joint Technical Coordinating Group (JTCG) who develop the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) Combatant Commands AF Major Commands US Air Force Weapons School curriculum support and others. Current projects include but are not limited to: target signature exploitation target geometric modeling (for identifying vulnerabilities) improving air capabilities against protected structures (specifically hard and deeply buried targets) and the testing of multiple seekers sensors and targeting technologies in representative environments against COCOM/MAJCOM/IC high value targets.This program is in Budget Activity 5 System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.","","Continuing","Continuing","","R2Long",

It is a fixed-wing high performance single-engine fighter aircraft.  In its 35-year history the F-16 has proven itself in combat in a variety of air-to-air and air-to-surface missions such as offensive and defensive counter-air close air support forward air control air interdiction (day/night and all-weather) and suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD)/destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD).  Also during these years the aircraft has evolved in its capabilities to exploit the advances made in computer avionics systems engine and structures technologies.  The F-16 has been selected by more than 20 air forces around the world and foreign military sales production continues in the 21st century. AFLCMC/WWM (The F-16 System Program Office) develops integrates and qualifies systems to enhance the overall performance of the F-16 mission.  Enhancements which are being or will be developed during the Five Year Defense Plan (FYDP) include:  a. Operational Flight Program (OFP) Development:  Blk 40-52 OFP (M-tapes) are updated continually to integrate new precision weapons advanced targeting pods improved avionics hardware and software mods to keep F-16 training simulators current  and other hardware (HW) Group B subsystems.  Major tapes (e.g. M6/6+) are released every three years and a minor tape (e.g. M6.2+) is released 1 year after each major tape.  The European Participating Air Forces (EPAF) countries participate in the development of M-tapes and share the cost of developing common capabilities and totally fund development of their unique capabilities.  Generally three major or minor tapes are under development/testing at any one time.  Extensive ground and flight testing is required to field each M-tape.  Advanced weapons integration includes joint air-to-surface stand-off missile (JASSM) and joint direct attack munitions (JDAM Laser JDAM) small diameter bomb (SDB and SDB II) advanced medium range air-to-air missile (AMRAAM) AIM-120D Sidewinder (AIM-9X/AIM-9X Block II) and updates to existing weapons.  JASSM-ER (Extended Range) integrates JASSM-ER on F-16 Blk 40-50 aircraft includes NRE SEEK EAGLE test assets integration and test. Weapons integration also includes tasks such as performing risk reduction activities on advanced weapon integration developing and integrating advanced racks pylons adapters and the universal armament interface (UAI) and ensuring nuclear surety safety and compatibility. Updates to electronic warfare systems allow for incorporation of latest updates for changing threat environment reducing war fighter vulnerabilities.  Link 16 provides the F-16s with a secure jam resistant high-capacity data communications link with other combat aircraft airborne control aircraft and ground control centers.  Major new capabilities currently being integrated via M-tapes include GPS inertial navigation set (GPS/INS) updates to improve targeting accuracy and GPS security EGBU-12 (laser/GPS guided bomb) Mode 5 identification friend or foe (IFF) SDB with UAI AIM-120D joint mission planning system (JMPS) and Alpha II Lite.  As part of OFP transition and M6.5/M7+ OFP upgrade Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (LM Aero) and Ogden Air Logistics Center will split responsibility for software development.  LM Aero will produce the common USAF/EPAF core software tape for USAF M6.5+ and serve as the baseline for the USAF M7+ OFP. OO-ALC will have software development responsibility for the M7+ software/hardware candidates being incorporated on USAF jets with M7+ Phase III OFP development scheduled to field in FY16.  M8+ will be the initial CAPES OFP.  b. F-16 Blk 40-52 Legacy SLEP structures: includes full scale durability test (FSDT) which requires a test fixture and structural analysis to begin structural testing.  The test fixture began fabrication in FY11. FSDT is intended to determine whether the F-16 Block 40-52 airworthiness certification can be extended from the current certified service life of 8000 equivalent flight hours (EFH) to 10000+ EFH.  In accordance with the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) and MIL-STD 1530C testing will support Blk 40-52 structural upgrade program that replaces or reworks known life-limited structure to preclude the onset of widespread fatigue damage maintain safety of flight and enhance aircraft availability beyond 8000 hours.  Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) extends through FY16. c. F-16 Blk 40-52 Combat Avionics Programmed Extension Suite (CAPES): This avionics modernization program is needed to keep the F-16 Blk 40-52 aircraft viable in the threat environment beyond 2025.  It includes but is not limited to an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar that offers improved destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD) and advanced electronic protection capabilities as well as improved reliability and maintainability; center display unit (CDU) which replaces the existing flight instrument cluster with a large higher resolution color multi-function display; electronic warfare suite (EW) which provides a single-point access for automated or hands-on EW system control; and an integrated broadcast service (IBS) that integrates multiple intelligence broadcasts into a system of systems and migrates tactical receive terminals into a single related joint tactical terminal (JTT) family and modular mission computer (MMC) throughput memory upgrades high speed data communications within the aircraft systems. FY12 risk reduction funding was available as part of SLEP avionics to initiate this capability modernization. d. Auto ground collision avoidance system (AGCAS) builds on the Air Force research laboratories (AFRL) fighter risk reduction program (FRRP) demonstrated capability and results in the AGCAS capability being production ready for incorporation in the M6.2+ OFP fielding in FY14 with potential for nearly eliminating controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents a leading cause of F-16 loss of pilot and aircraft accidents.e. EMD hardware/advanced capability improvements:  EMD HW provides funding to develop test and qualify weapon systems aircraft subsystems replaced or modified due to requirements changes pre-planned product improvements (P3I) diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) and parts obsolescence.

Operational uses of core technologies would include but are not be limited to signals intelligence to signals intelligence (SIGINT-SIGINT) correllation and ground moving target indicator to signals intelligence (GMTI-SIGINT) correllation.  Operational uses of sub-nodal analysis tools would include but are not be limited to determining which nodes of the adversary's Command Control Communications Computers Intelligence (C4I) network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects and modeling execution plans to determine the need to disrupt or monitor the required network aimpoints in order to redirect activities based on changing battlefield conditions.  NCCT software applications employ machine-to-machine (M2M) interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate sensor cross-cues and collection activities.  NCCT correlation and fusion services ingest collection data to produce a single composite track (geo-location and identification) for high-value targets.  NCCT research and development funding supports evolutionary development of the NCCT message set and network management systems (Operations Interfaces Network Controller Fusion Engines Data Guard Interface to Command & Control and Interface to Overhead Intelligence Operations) the migration of the NCCT technologies to emerging network centric technologies (Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and web services) and satisfying DoD standards and Information Assurance requirements.  Core Technology develops the hardware and software to horizontally integrate Joint and Coalition dissimilar Battle Management Command & Control (BMC2) and ISR assets and systems into integrated target tracks shared across networked platforms.  Core Technology includes but is not limited to network management software operator interfaces standard network messages and formats correlation software and data rules of interaction NCCT multi-level security hardware and software items and platform specific Platform Interface Modules (PIMs).

Prospective Coalition Joint or Service systems are required to fund their respective integration unique core technology improvements/upgrades to support system integration.  Information Operations Battle Management (IOBM) and the SUTER Program System (SPS) develop concepts Tactics/Techniques/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network.  SPS's planning execution and assessment capability is implemented in a distributed operations architecture taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR non-kinetic and/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets.  Impacting these target sets can be achieved by "attacking" or influencing/shaping links nodes or end points in the network to include:  RF and terrestrial links switches routers hubs servers IP addresses cell phones antennas radars microwave relays SATCOM receivers transceivers etc.  The three main pieces of the SPS CONOPS include: first the use of SPS's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second the SPS's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs JIOWC etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aimpoints; and third via SPS's combined network Common Operating Picture (COP) all involved "players" monitor the plan's execution provide near-real time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities provide continuous assessment/updates of the execution of the plan and within authorities (Rules of Engagement/ROEs) re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions.  SPS is the technology that assists COCOMs and Components to exercise synchronized dynamic Command and Control (C2) of ISR kinetic and non-kinetic Joint operations against conventional and terrorist threat networks.  SPS provides decision makers and operators supporting airborne shipborne cyber and landbased C2ISR platforms and at supporting locations continuous Predictive Battlespace Awareness (PBA) of the information superiority fight.  It also incorporates the machine-to-machine capabilities that rapidly synchronize the employment of kinetic weapons non-kinetic weapons and ISR assets to target challenging threat systems responsively.

As the CDL Executive Agent (EA) the Air Force is responsible for cross-service application of CDL RDT&E funds facilitating compliance to Congressional and DoD mandates. Military Intelligence Program (MIP) funds are used to maintain distribute and upgrade the CDL specifications while ensuring design configuration commonality and interoperability among ISR platforms. Additionally funds are used for the management of resources allocated for development and migration of CDL technologies. Updates to the CDL specification and developmental systems impact 10000+ DoD airborne and ground ISR systems. The CDL program enables compliance with OSD and Congressional mandates to minimize spectrum usage use of cryptographic equipment and direct support to current operations. The CDL specifications permit current and future ISR assets to operate worldwide by providing sensor data directly via point-to-point broadcast to ground sites airborne platforms and dismounted users. CDL is a vital link in DoD's emerging communication architectures. CDL provides the capability to relay data via air-to-air or compatible satellite links when the asset and ground site are not in line-of-sight. CDL provides the largest bandwidth datalink in DoD accommodating numerous sensors collecting Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) and video data. Research and development activities include achieving higher data rates for CDL operations in other spectral bands and support of large area surveillance missions while supporting continuous improvements and implementation of line-of-sight platform and CDL terminal Command and Control plus increased Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) capabilities. Activities also include studies and analysis to support current and future program planning and execution. CDL terminal designs provide for future technology insertion and reduce non-recurring engineering and life-cycle costs to the user. The addition of Gigabit Encryption thrust enables CDL to develop a miniaturized gigabit rate Communication Security (COMSEC) device that will be capable of managing CDL data.  The miniaturized COMSEC device will allow faster throughput while reducing Size Weight and Power (SWaP) requirements.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","Continuing","Continuing","","R2Long",

Stores are carried in countless different loading combinations determined by operational and training scenarios missions tactics and weapon development programs. Aircraft stores combinations change as operational plans and tactics change and as new stores are developed and fielded. Before operational training or test use the Air Force must certify these configurations for safe loading carriage and separation (jettison and normal release) as well as verify ballistics accuracy under the user-certified carriage and employment parameters. The Air Force SEEK EAGLE program completes certification recommendations and recommended flight clearances through any combination of engineering analysis wind tunnel testing modeling and simulation and ground/flight test and evaluation. The SEEK EAGLE effort encompasses eight disciplines: Fit and Function Flutter Loads Stability and Control Electromagnetic Compatibility/Interference (EMC/EMI) Separations Ballistics and Safe Escape.In support of certification the program recommends about 1000 aircraft/store combinations for flight each year with analysis and testing requiring from weeks to years depending on the complexity. Integrated solutions for combat aircrew weapon delivery planning problems are developed and provided to combat forces via Combat Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS) and Joint Safe Escape Analysis Solution (JSEAS).  SEEK EAGLE works in coordination with the Air Force Safety Center to provide Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) analysis and certification recommendations of ordnance systems containing electro-explosive devices.

To meet that requirement this program funds the AF Life Cycle Management Center (LCMC) Aerospace Management Systems Division (AMSD) the designated AF Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management and Navigational Safety (CNS/ATM) Center of Excellence (COE).  This COE provides expertise to the Air Staff MAJCOMs and all platform program offices manned and un-manned on meeting civil CNS/ATM performance standards necessary to operate in the US National Airspace System (NAS) and international civil airspace.   This centralized capability precludes the necessity for the MAJCOMs and over 50 AF platform program offices to have resident technical CNS/ATM expertise.The COE monitors and evaluates ever-evolving international civil aviation standards for operations in sovereign airspace worldwide.  Analyzing civil documents CNS/ATM experts identify specific technical and engineering criteria and document them for AF stakeholders in Generic Performance Matrices (GPMs).  Once identified the Air Staff and MAJCOMs determine how the AF will address these civil standards for each platform to best perform the AF specific mission.  When a material solution is required CNS/ATM experts considering the platform's engineering characteristics work with the platform program office to meet the civil standards in the GPM.  Once the work is complete the COE verifies and validates the CNS/ATM performance meets the standards necessary to operate in the civil airspace.  This is an iterative process to address both changes in civil airspace standards and shifts in AF military operational requirements.The COE manages Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for centralized procurement of CNS/ATM and Nav Safety products.  These contracts are used by platform programs across the AF and DOD other federal agencies and in support of foreign military sales; they provide the benefits of quantity cost savings and industry-unique warranty clauses. The CNS/ATM COE performs periodic audits on the processes and procedures used to develop and distribute the Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF).  This electronic navigation database created by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) contains safety of flight critical information and  is used by AF and DOD aircrews to fly instrument departure and arrival procedures worldwide.  The COEs unique expertise is recognized and accepted by the NGA the FAA AF and DOD operating organizations.The AF is the Lead Service for DOD to coordinate the department's support of the Congressionally mandated Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) program to upgrade the US NAS over the next 25+ years.  In 2012 the CNS/ATM COE was designated DOD's NextGen Joint Program Office (JPO).  They are to provide acquisition and engineering support to coordinate activities across DOD and advocate for DOD interests as NextGen (and similar CNS/ATM programs being initiated worldwide) is implemented.

The JTRS family of products will be multifunctional multiband multimode network capable and capable of providing communications through a range of low probability of intercept low probability of detection and anti-jam waveforms. JTRS products will provide transformational communication capabilities for the warfighter.  JTRS is intended to support communications readiness and mission success in the 2 Megahertz (MHz) to 2 Gigahertz (GHz) operating frequency range by providing military commanders with the ability to command control and communicate with their forces via secure voice/video/data media forms.  JTRS products are hardware-configurable and software-programmable radio systems that provide increased interoperability flexibility and adaptability to support varied mission requirements.The Airborne & Maritime/Fixed Station Joint Tactical Radio System (AMF JTRS) radios are software programmable multi-band multi-mode mobile ad hoc networking radios providing simultaneous voice data and video communications.  The radios will operate in networks supporting the Common Operational Picture situational awareness and interoperability of Mission Command (MC) systems throughout the battlefield.  AMF JTRS must ensure the Warfighters' ability to communicate both horizontally and vertically via voice and data within all mission areas and Combat Operational Environments.  AMF JTRS helps close capability gaps by extending data networking to company and below echelons enabling network services to the platform and connecting Army Aviation platforms to Army ground and Joint air network domains.  Per Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) direction the redefined AMF JTRS Program will procure radios as Non-Developmental Items (NDI).MIDS - Low Volume Terminal (LVT) is a jam-resistant secure digital (voice and data) information distribution system enabling rapid integrated communications navigation and identification for tactical and command and control operations. The technical objective of the MIDS JTRS program is to transform the MIDS-LVT into a four-channel Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant JTRS while maintaining current Link-16 and tactical air navigation system (TACAN) functionality.  MIDS JTRS is designed to be plug-and-play interchangeable for U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force platforms that use MIDS-LVT while accommodating future technologies and capabilities.  Improvements such as Link-16 enhanced throughput Link-16 frequency remapping and programmable crypto are realized in the MIDS JTRS design.  The MIDS JTRS core terminal includes three 2 MHz to 2 GHz programmable channels that allow the warfighter to use multiple waveforms in development by JNED.  Total core terminal program requirements include: terminal development F/A-18 Level 0 integration software hosting (operating environment/waveforms) and production transition.  MIDS JTRS will also provide Concurrent Multi-Netting-4 (CMN-4) and Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT).  These capabilities provide Joint Airborne Network-Tactical Edge (JAN-TE) functionality to run advanced mission applications in a cross-platform/cross-domain tactical network enterprise and the ability to simultaneously participate in four Link-16 Nets.  GMR following a critical Nunn McCurdy breach the USD AT&L conducted a reassessment of the GMR program. Conclusions of the reassessment did not support certification of the program thereby cancelling the program.

Each squadron is organized by Boat Detachments Security Detachments and Command and Control (C2) divisions. The C2 Division is comprised of Sensor Detachments (SENSDET) operating the Radar Sonar Surveillance Center (RSSC) and Communications Detachments (COMMSDET) operating the Mobile Ashore Support Terminal (MAST IIIs) each separately funded. The Radar Sonar Surveillance Center (RSSC) is the only land-based and rapidly deployable mobile Navy system with the ability to conduct surface and subsurface surveillance in coastal and littoral areas. The system provides detailed contact information via various C4I systems to the tactical area commander based on radar visual thermal electronic and underwater acoustic sensor information. Missions supported with the MIUW-RSSCs are: OCONUS and INCONUS Force Protection protecting port areas high value assets and surveilling the near shore areas. The MAST III is the C4ISR hub for the NCW Commander. MAST IIIs deploy to support Force Protection/Force Security Officer for Commander Amphibious Group in its Harbor Defense and Coastal Sea Control missions.As stated in the Maritime Expeditionary Security Force (MESF) CONOPS dated 11 April 2007: The MESF organization will be established through realignment of the CRF organizations (CRF Squadrons Mobile Inshore Undersea Warfare Units Inshore Boat Units Mobile Security Squadrons Mobile Security Detachments Embarked Security Detachments and Embarked Security Teams) into the CRF structure. Further realignment will result in the integration of intelligence VBSS and additional waterborne and security detachments to support new mission capability and provide additional NCC / JFMCC capacity. In addition to enhancing readiness of the current force CRF will deploy adaptive force packages (AFPs) tailored for the specific missions to achieve greater efficiency and combat readiness than the current CRF force. By establishing a professional warfare community and dedicated Maritime Expeditionary Security Force capable of meeting the full range of security requirements CRF closes a critical gap essential to full mission readiness for MSO. CRF provides a structure that establishes a single integrated maritime security force with one standard for training certification employment and tactics techniques and procedures (TTP).  This funding supports the future direction of the CRF as it is being determined externally by world events and internally by the progress of DoD initiatives modernize forces and capabilities.. CRF force will be agile tailorable and scalable and will use applied technology to quickly detect deter or interdict potential threats to DoN assets in the littoral environment. Next generation surface and subsurface surveillance systems as well as enhanced C4I capabilities are required to meet these operational objectives. These capabilities must be interoperable with higher and adjacent echelons of command (to include coalition allies) as well as with supporting elements to include joint forces.The Expeditionary Warfare Decision System (EWDS) (formerly Tactically Integrated Sensors (TIS)) software constitutes an upgrade to the MAST-RSSC and is being executed as a separate Abbreviated Acquisition Program. The AAP will enable the deployment of a currently fielded Program of Record (POR) combat system (AN/SQQ-34C) known as Tactically Integrated Sensors (TIS) to the CRF units. TIS system restores the acoustic surveillance capability that has been eroded from the current RSSC suite. Additionally future mult-spectal technologies are being looked at as enabling capabilities to expand the situational awareness of the littoral region providing additional tactical decision aids to the local area commander.This funding supports the Identity Dominance System (IDS) as key enabler in support of the Joint Personnel Identity (JPI) program. OPNAV N957 conducted the NCW CBA and MES ICD. MESF forces have a mobile security mission that requires methodologies procedures equipment and the communications capacity to identify individuals who represent a potential threat as a means to deter and eliminate individuals from conducting asymmetric/non-traditional attacks upon friendly forces high value assets and coastal areas that NCW is charged with protecting. The Vessel Boarding Search and Seizure (VBSS) teams conducting Expanded Maritime Interception Operations also have a similar requirement to identify individuals. The development of a device to support identity functions is captured in the Identity Dominance System Capability Development Document (IDS CDD). IDS will be used in the following environments: aboard ship and ashore in ports the littorals and extended inland field environments worldwide. IDS will be employed in maritime and very austere ashore environments and carried by individuals who are part of ship boarding parties and dismounted patrols. These mission and environmental demands dictate a portable lightweight rugged and reliable system with intuitive and user friendly features. IDS biometric modalities may differ by mission profile requiring the authoritative response to the On-Scene Commander/Boarding Officer on whether to detain or further investigate an individual of interest.Coastal Riverine Force will integrate and employ a variety of surface and air assets special vehicles weapons and appropriately trained personnel. Mission assets needed to support the operational capabilities will vary widely dependant on the Host Nations involved. The Riverine Squadron will deploy with inherent but limited force protection capabilities. The Modular Unmanned Scouting Craft Littoral (MUSCL) is man-portable "X-Class" Unmanned Surface Vehicle providing enhanced surveillance and reconnaissance capability to Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) Riverine forces.This program provides efforts in support of the Navy Expeditionary Warfare Division (formerly known as Navy Irregular Warfare (IW) Office).  It provides for the identification and assessment of available technologies to confront expeditionary challenges including irregular warfare urgent/emergent and unfulfilled needs of the warfighter.  It provides for the validation and combat demonstration of identified technologies and/or packages of technologies to meet Oversea Contingency Operation (OCO) goals.  It also provides funding necessary to attract additional investment and sustainment of demonstrated capabilities.  The goal of the Navy Expeditionary Warfare Innovations Branch office is to: identify those requirements necessary to meet the immediate warfighter needs; integrate those existing unique and/or related capabilities that can best meet those warfighter needs; test those integrated capabilities; and then demonstrate in real time and/or during planned deployments all within an 8 month period. Combatant Craft Replacements will provide second generation Riverine Multi Mission Craft that will replace in-service Riverine Patrol Boats (RPBs) and Riverine Assault Boats (RABs).  Combatant Craft replacements will: conduct inland waterway patrol and interdiction to preserve the rivers for friendly use as lines of communications; deny the use of rivers and waterways to waterborne and immediate shore sited hostile forces by barrier and interdiction operations;  and with augmentation of ground and air forces locate and destroy hostile forces within a riparian area.  Specific mission and capabilities will be identified in an NECC developed/OPNAV N95 approved Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).  RDT&E funding will fund feasibility studies and procurement of mock-ups and prototype craft to demonstrate capabilities prior to production craft procurement.","26.693","Continuing","Continuing","","",

Tasks in this Program Element support research development and test efforts in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phases of these systems.  Beginning in FY 2013 funding on this Program Element was split into Projects C97 Aircraft Avionics and VU3 Networking and Mission Planning. The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) is the transformational system that provides Army Aviation interoperability capability for Future Force and Joint Force operations. The JTRS integration effort provides for the non-recurring engineering required to integrate and qualify the JTRS certified radios with Link 16 and/or other advanced networking waveforms into the AH-64E and Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  Funding in FY 2014 will complete the Apache Block III (AB3) Link 16 non-developmental item radio integration through AB3 Lot 4 Follow-On Operational Test and Evaluation.  In addition FY14 funding initiates integration activities to install and qualify a JTRS certified networking radio on the Grey Eagle and AB3 Lot 6 platforms and also supports continued development of common radio control software for use on multiple platform integrations. The Improved Data Modem (IDM) is the common solution for digitizing Army Aviation. It performs as an internet controller and gateway to the Tactical Internet and Fire Support internet for Army aircraft. With interfaces supporting a transmit/receive terminal the IDM provides radio connectivity to the ARC-201D/231 ARC-186 ARC-164 and the Blue Force Tracker transceivers. IDM provides a flexible software driven digital messaging system that is interoperable with existing Army and Joint forces battlefield operating systems. The IDM provides Situational Awareness and Variable Message Format messages capability to the cockpit. The Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) is a precision approach and landing system providing joint operational capability for U.S. forces assigned to conventional and special operations missions including those operating from fixed base ship tactical and special mission environments under a wide range of meteorological and jamming conditions. The Army plans to integrate JPALS capabilities as defined by the Navy (Shipboard operations) and the Air Force (Land-based operations) through the JPALS Army Risk Reduction (JARR) and the JPALS Common Avionics Technology Development (JCATD) efforts. JARR defined implementation alternatives for aircraft integration. JCATD continues the alternative analysis.The Doppler Global Positioning System (GPS) Navigation System (DGNS) Upgrade program conducts system engineering trade studies to reduce space weight and power with the introduction of new navigation support capabilities such as inertial sensor MIL-STD-1553 interface card and Instrument Flight Rules map display and prepares Engineering Change Proposals to the existing DGNS ASN-128D Line Replaceable Units as a result of those trade studies.  The effort also derives DGNS compliance matrices for current and planned Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) capabilities for the upcoming decade.The Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) previously referred to as Apache Block III is a set of standards jointly developed by government and industry consortium members; conformance to this standard is Army Aviation's conduit to compliance with the Common Operating Environment (COE) directive. The mechanism for certification of FACE conformance is the FACE Ecosystem and the laboratory test environment which is being developed implemented and updated as part of this effort.  This will be accomplished through the integration of the selected middleware into Army Aviation Platforms.  This includes the non-recurring engineering for integration test and air worthiness qualification. As part of the Army's migration to a net-centric fighting force it is necessary for aircraft to access certain critical services that enable seamless access and operation on the future force network.The Aviation Data Exploitation Capability (ADEC) is an Army Aviation program to develop integrate and test specific capabilities needed at the Aviation unit level to implement and support improvements within aviation maintenance operations safety and training. ADEC will standardize data and information formats and provide a comprehensive and fully integrated automated information system. ADEC provides a common and interoperable capability required to implement Condition Based Maintenance Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance and Platform Maintenance Environment processes. The Aircraft Notebook (ACN) will provide users with an aviation centric suite of software utilized for streamlined documentation and completion of aviation maintenance activities","","","","","",

The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information and distribution of relevant red (threat) gray (non-aligned) and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning and targeting capability.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors other information sources all Warfighting Functions and the Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed and Mobile configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested annual software releases are integrated into Army Common/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process.The Army Acquisition Executive designated to PEO IEW&S and DCGS-A as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead.  As such DCGS-A is defining the architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.DCGS-A consolidates enhances and modernizes the Tasking Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities formerly found in nine Army intelligence programs of record and two Quick Reaction Capabilities.  DCGS-A provides these technologically advanced PED capabilities in tailored and scalable mobile and fixed configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  The program also will develop software packages to be embedded in mission command and other select systems to provide required ISR/analytic capabilities.  DCGS-A is a key component of the DoD ISR Task Force modernization efforts and a critical Army priority.DCGS-A software will be tailored by echelon and scalable to each unit's mission.  DCGS-A provides commanders and staffs the ability to maintain an accurate and up to date understanding of the operational environment.  DCGS-A's contributions to commanders' visualization and situational awareness rapid planning and the synchronization of all warfighting functions enable Army units to operate within the enemy's decision cycle.  This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from humanitarian to major combat operations.The DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a Cloud Processing Architecture.  Main Cloud nodes are placed in data centers strategically located across the globe while tactical edge Cloud nodes will be integrated within select existing equipment currently on units' Modified Tables of Organization & Equipment (MTOE).  The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers where the data is stored.  This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems.  The first DCGS-A Cloud node reached its initial operating capability in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in FY11.  Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12/Full Deployment Decision in 1QFY13 DCGS-A Increment 1 Release 1 Software Baseline capability will be deployed throughout the Army.FY14 Base funding in the amount of $27.622 million will be used for the development and testing of the DCGS-A Increment 1 Software Releases as well as the continued development and testing of the of the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) as it fits into the Army's overarching Common Operating Environment (COE) construct.

Currently Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has three major projects with Israel to develop and improve their indigenous capability to defend against short and medium range ballistic missiles. These include the Arrow Weapon System (AWS) the David`s Sling Weapon System (DSWS) for Short Range Ballistic Missile Defense (SRBMD) and the Arrow-3 Interceptor. Within these projects MDA develops and produces weapon systems conducts tests and exercises interoperability between U.S. BMDS and the Israeli Missile Defense Architecture. U.S.-Israel Cooperative Programs consist of the following major efforts: Israeli Upper Tier Project:The Upper Tier Program provides the Arrow 3 missile increasing the system`s capability against advanced medium range threats by providing approximately four times the current Arrow-2 battle space. The primary near term objective for Upper Tier is to demonstrate readiness for a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) delivery in FY 2016 through successful flight testing. Israeli Arrow Weapon System (AWS):The Arrow System Improvement Program (ASIP) includes block upgrades to the Arrow Weapon System that enhances capabilities against more stressing evolving medium range threats by increasing the total defended area by approximately 50 percent. ASIP elements include the Arrow-2 missile and launcher Citron Tree Battle Management Center (BMC) Green Pine (GP) and Super Green Pin (SGP) Radars and the Hazelnut Tree Launcher Control Center (LCC). Also included is the integration of Block 5 assets which include the Arrow-3 missile and launcher. Arrow Block 5 under the ASIP agreement will also incorporate a Long Range Detection suite that consists of an unmanned aerial vehicle Airborne Early Warning System (ABEWS) and a S-Band Silver Oak radar for increased sensor range early detection and enhanced raid size capacity. The program also includes the continued development of Arrow`s interoperability with U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS). Related activities include the Israeli Test Bed (ITB) and the Israeli Systems Architecture and Integration (ISA&I) study that assesses requirements and growth paths for the 2025 Israel Missile Defense Architecture. Short Range Ballistic Missile Defense (SRBMD):SRBMD also known as The David`s Sling Weapon System (DSWS) is designed to counter short range rockets and missiles and serve to fill the lower-tier gap between the Arrow Weapon System and Iron Dome. The first fielded block capability will perform the short range rocket and missile defense mission. Subsequent blocks will address a cruise missile defense capability. David`s Sling Weapon System (DSWS) elements include the Stunner Interceptor Missile Firing Unit (MFU) Multi-Mission Radar (MMR) and the Golden Almond Battle Management Center (BMC). The main near term objectives for DSWS are successful completion of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) in FY 2014 initiation of Interceptor Full Rate Production (FRP) and completion of final Block 1 flight testing.","371.799","Continuing","Continuing","","",

Starting in FY 2013 a portion of Program-Wide Support (Budget Project MD40) transfers in from BMD Test and Targets PE 0603888C (Budget Project MD40).","As part of the total Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) the Test Program Element (PE) brings the BMDS element capabilities together for an integrated system-level test approach. Based on the Systems Engineering assessments of realistic threat scenarios test events demonstrate capability of the evolving integrated and layered missile defense system in a simultaneous test and operations environment. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) in collaboration with its Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP) stakeholders: Combatant Commands; Service Operational Test Agency (OTA); Director Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E); and Director Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) employs a systematic review of BMDS testing that establishes a convention for setting test objectives that go beyond simply exercising newly delivered elements of the system. The BMDS Test Program establishes and documents in the IMTP the test requirements for the BMDS developed by Systems Engineering with specific focus on collecting the data needed for the verification validation and accreditation (VV&A) of the BMDS models and simulations (M&S). The BMDS performance evaluation strategy is to develop models and simulations (M&S) of the BMDS and compare predictions to empirical data collected through comprehensive flight and ground testing to validate accuracy. Systems Engineering develops Critical Engagement Conditions (CECs) and Empirical Measurement Events (EMEs) which are the conditions and events which define or describe the data to be obtained from flight and ground tests in order to anchor M&S. CECs and EMEs are utilized to design a test to further advance the understanding and confidence of the M&S tool set that will be used to evaluate all possible engagements. MDA testing is based on an integrated developmental and operational test program. The MDA Test Program is based on a commitment to deploy technology that is proven cost-effective and adaptable to an evolving security environment. This PE also provides funding to the OTA which is active in all phases of test planning execution and post-test analysis to include the development of the IMTP. BMDS Test Program Functions: -Direct the testing required to verify validate and accredit (VV&A) MDA`s models and simulation (M&S).-Plan tests according to BMDS and Element objectives.-Develop MDA test policy. -Execute BMDS ground and flight tests. -Ensure appropriate data is collected at the necessary fidelity. -Collect data for BMDS analysis and manage MDA data centers. -Provide BMDS and Element performance results for IMTP stakeholders. -Provide final target system integration target mission logistics and launch execution for BMDS test target systems.-Provide test infrastructure and resources for flight and ground tests. Major Test Program Goals: -Direct planning execution analyses and reporting of BMDS test events to support system verification.-Improve test execution and discipline for on-time successful testing. -Integrate Element test processes into BMDS processes. -Develop Element lessons learned and best practices to support BMDS test design. -Provide required infrastructure and environmental compliance for robust BMDS testing. -Ensure test readiness realism and accuracy and improve test execution quality.

The goals of this program will be shifted to the Department of Defense (DoD) Components under the direction of the Research and Engineering Executive Committee and will conform with the DoD Data to Decision Priority Steering Council roadmaps.  Historically the Joint Data Management program was restructured to evolve into the revised Data to Decisions program to support the FY 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review mission:  Succeed in counterinsurgency stability and counterterrorism operations.  In addition this program addresses a signed Secretary of Defense S&T priority Data to Decisions which reduces the cycle time and manpower requirements for analysis and use of large data sets.","As the DoD increases the capability and capacity to generate increasing amounts of data from numerous sensors in the battlespace the issue of handling very large data sets has become more challenging.  This is in part due to Department of Defense response to a changing threat environment where there is an expansion of the types of sensors deployed new types of information collected and different features used to classify these new threats.  From a technical perspective data creation speeds have outpaced the speed and ability to transport store and process the data created. Science and Technology (S&T) investigation into new and novel ways to manage and exploit this data is required to more efficiently use sensor assets and effectively use information in a timely fashion.The OSD Data to Decisions program (PEs 0602663D8Z and 0603663D8Z) uniquely address three specific gap areas not addressed by Component S&T:  minimal dedicated Data to Decisions research to support Joint and emerging mission areas; DoD needs a mechanism to increase responsiveness of Component Data to Decisions research and lower the time-to-solution across a broad DoD-wide user base; and limited investment in multi-disciplinary research investigations of Data to Decisions issues and solutions.  The OSD Data to Decisions program pulls together research efforts to address shortfalls within the context of Joint and emerging missions to ensure that the distinctive needs of these joint analysts and decision makers are addressed by DoD science and technology.  As an example irregular warfare non-state terrorism movements and uncertain environmental patterns that trigger major weather disasters are producing a reality for military and government leaders where traditional physics-based sensors alone are insufficient to plan current and future actions in a region on interest or need.  Component Data to Decisions efforts focus on developing technology to overcome a particular challenge within a mission or advance a particular priority area of that Component as a result the Research and Engineering Database has over 388 references to Decision Support programs all of which are designed to address a specific need over the course of several years.  However there exists no other program in the DoD that focuses on technology development efforts to speed the delivery of the Component solutions and lessons learned to a DoD-wide user base.  The OSD Data to Decisions program provides the common platform (access to datasets infrastructure and metrics) to integrate and evaluate the technology development and research methods to support various missions driven by the challenge problems.  This ability to rapidly evaluate technology development and research methods will allow technology transfer for mission analysis not previously foreseen and lower the time-to solution across DoD by rigorously analyzing technical performance for more immediate use.  Traditional approaches within research seek to advance machine systems for a specific mission effect resulting in large complex data sets.  While necessary for sensor system improvements potential Data to Decisions solutions require a coupling of automated data analysis with human analysts operators and decision makers in order to reduce time and limit the number of people required.  Many research studies workshop and analysis have stated that solutions to data issues are multi-disciplinary.  The OSD Data to Decisions program is in the unique position to reach across Components and research disciplines to blend promising research in new ways in response to Challenge Problem statements.  For Challenge Problems contextual understanding will result from research combining human sciences with computer processing techniques to take advantage of a person’s cognitive ability to fuse and assimilate multiple sources and types of information for new insights.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

Projects are distributed among 9 mission categories: Advanced Analytics and Capabilities Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat; Investigative Support and Forensics; Personnel Protection Physical Security; Surveillance Collection and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support; and Training Technology Development.  This program is a diverse advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility or effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements.  It includes technology capability development proof-of-principle demonstrations in field applications and coordination to transition from development to operational use.  CTTS manages approximately 450 individual projects in support of Defense federal state local and international customers and partners.For the Department of Defense CTTS focused on requirements that support military forces in demanding or hostile environments in Afghanistan Yemen Africa the Philippines and Colombia; by rapidly developing and delivering leading edge products such as tactical sensors and unmanned vehicles personal and physical protection user friendly apps for analytical tools and reference guides and weapons sights and ammo modifications.  Several of the highly successful products include Legacy human source information programs in Afghanistan and Mexico the Lighthouse and PALANTIR information collection and analysis systems the Enhanced Mortar Targeting System (EMTAS) and Insider Threat Situation Awareness Training. For U.S. federal state and local law enforcement and first responders CTTS improved personal protection equipment for chemical biological radiological nuclear and high explosive protection; as well as developed apps for interactive reference data to assist in identifying and neutralizing threat agents in the field and in laboratories.  CTTS also hosted interagency and foreign partner information exchange seminars and capability exercises to share and enhance response techniques and procedures for first responders.  FY14 plans for CTTS will continue to address combating terrorism requirements from Defense federal state local and international customers and partners at home and abroad.  As U.S. forces are withdrawn from Afghanistan CTTS will continue to address force protection needs for the remaining forces as well as develop releasable technology solutions that may assist Afghan security forces.  Additionally CTTS will address technology requirements requested from USSOCOM’s field components as they begin to increase their regional operations tempo in other parts of the world. Special emphasis will be for the Theater SOF in Africa and to support Theater SOF in the Pacific in support of the National Strategy to shift focus towards the Pacific.  Another areas of increased emphasis will be in the protection of U.S. personnel to include State Department personnel in locations overseas that need increased security.  CTTS will also address technology and advanced analytical analysis requirements that will enhance Customs and Border Patrol along the U.S. Southwest Border; and will partner with Homeland Security as they identify requirements that will proactively address improvised explosive devices in a domestic environment.","","Continuing","Continuing","","R2Long",

The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective thus ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating establishing and maintaining five ten and fifteen year technology development plans and roadmaps 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEOs for insertion in their Insensitive Munitions (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) laboratory representatives and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight policy direction and priorities during its annual meeting.The Insensitive Munitions (IM) effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with requirements established in United States Code Title 10 Chapter 141 Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion (HPP) 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion (MSP) 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads (BFW) 4) Anti-Armor Warheads (AAW) and 5) Propulsion (GP).  MATGs under tri-service leadership have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies alone or in combination will be developed and tested at the small-scale and for eventual incorporation in hardware simulating real-world munitions to demonstrate their utility and feasibility. The Enabling Fuze Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force (GDF) the Secretary of Defense Memorandum DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will develop fuzing technologies and mature them for transition into advanced technology (6.3) programs and/or design tools and protocols for weapon fuzing.  In this way the Service and Industrial base weapon and fuze will be able to heavily leverage and apply these emerging and promising technologies in fuzing modeling and simulation tools multi-point initiation high reliability fuze architectures survivable components modular fuze packaging and fuze sensor.

Funding for Advanced Technology Development in PE 0603781D8Z will decrease beginning in FY 2014 to reflect a pivot toward more fundamental research that will enable the DoD to address longer-term challenges in software technology and engineering.  When combined together the two PEs represent a level of investment consistent with previous plans.","Software is key to meeting the DoD’s increasing demand for high-quality affordable and timely national defense systems.  Systemic software issues are significant contributors to poor program execution and reliance on software-intensive mobile and net based products and systems has been increasing (e.g. Joint Tactical Radio System DDG-1000 Joint Strike Fighter F-22 and Army Modernization).  As stated in the 2010 National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences report entitled Critical Code “It is dangerous to conclude that we are reaching a plateau in capability and technology for software producibility.”  The report notes that software is “…unconstrained by traditional physical engineering limitations…” and what we can accomplish is derived “…from [the] human intellectual capacity to conceptualize and understand systems….”  With growing global parity in software engineering the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Program Element (PE) addresses the critical need to research develop and rapidly transition state-of-the-art software technology tools development environments and best practices to improve the engineering management fielding evolution acquisition and sustainment of software-intensive DoD systems.  The SEI PE’s program of work seeks to coordinate across the Department and the Services and leverages expertise in industry and academia to enable the development of joint capabilities.Software is more pervasive than ever and computer programs are growing in size and complexity.  Designing managing and securing integrated complex and large-scale mission-critical systems are abilities that the DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) have not yet mastered.  The P781 project within this PE funds research and development at the SEI Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  The SEI FFRDC is an institute which enables the exploitation of emerging software technology by bringing engineering management and security discipline to software acquisition development and evolution.  The SEI FFRDC focuses on software technology areas judged to be of the highest payoff in meeting defense needs.  To ensure that the DoD retains a differential advantage over potential adversaries research funding at the SEI FFRDC will include a new Budget Activity 2 funding line beginning in FY 2014.  The reduction in P781 in this line beginning in FY 2014 is offset by the creation of the new line the SEI Applied Research PE.  The creation of this new line represents a pivot toward more fundamental research that will enable the DoD to address longer-term challenges in software technology and engineering.  The SEI Applied Research PE will also increase the collaboration opportunities for the SEI FFRDC with academia and attract top research talent to the SEI.  Private sector investment has created rapid advances in information technologies but the pace of transition to DoD applications is often very slow or the commercial applications do not meet DoD unique needs e.g. high assurance software or large-scale integrated systems.  The DoD needs to create opportunities to discover emerging technologies to evaluate their potential to fit DoD needs and where appropriate conduct critical tests of the technologies under DoD conditions.  The P783 project within this PE funds the Software Producibility Initiative.  The Software Producibility Initiative works across the Services industry and academia to research and transition software science and tools that address the capacity to design produce assure and evolve software-intensive systems in a predictable manner while effectively managing risk cost schedule quality and complexity.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

The HD R&D Program is the only U.S. organization conducting research and development for Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) detection and mechanical clearance technologies.  HMA is a critical component of stability operations which HD R&D directly supports by speeding improvements to technologies used by U.S. forces in support of USG operations; reducing the post-conflict threat to host nation population and U.S. forces; reducing insurgent access to explosives (landmines and UXO); enhancing mine action capacity of non-governmental organizations and mine action centers in mine-affected countries; and providing engagement opportunities for DoD personnel in mine-affected countries.  The HD R&D Program adapts commercial-off-the-shelf equipment integrates mature technologies and leverages R&D activity within DoD particularly in the Army's Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) Tactical Countermine mission area.  The program aims to improve existing technologies for: mine/UXO detection technical survey/area reduction mechanical mine/UXO clearance vegetation clearance mine neutralization and post-clearance quality assurance (QA).  Evaluations of HD R&D Program-developed technologies in actual minefields are conducted by host nation demining partners (foreign military non-governmental organizations and mine action centers) and provide valuable data for U.S. military countermine R&D and next generation HD technology developments while directly contributing to worldwide mine and UXO clearance.  Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 160 evaluations in 36 countries including Iraq and Afghanistan.  The program’s technologies have cleared 18+ million sq meters of the world’s toughest minefields; found or destroyed 80000+ mines and UXO; and provided 280000 mine/UXO disposal charges with 33 tons of explosive recovered from stockpiles and abandoned munitions in PACOM.Under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (OASD SO/LIC) the HD R&D Program works closely with the U.S. combatant commands (COCOMS) and the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) to support the Warfighter.  Areas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop held by OASD SO/LIC.  The Requirements Workshop involves representatives from Department of State (DoS) COCOMS and mine-affected nations.","","Continuing","Continuing","","R2Long",

The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) establishes a capabilities-based adaptive near real-time readiness information system for the DoD. This system is being designed to measure the readiness of military forces and supporting infrastructure to meet missions and goals assigned by the Secretary of Defense. DRRS also hosts information and applications used to support Joint Forces Command (JFCOM) Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and Strategic Command (STRATCOM) in their roles as the Joint Force Providers.The transformation of readiness reporting into a new comprehensive readiness system presents a number of significant challenges. First there are thousands of new potential reporting entities to include in DRRS such as Combatant Commands Joint Task Forces Services Active and Reserve component units installations depots ports and major elements of the industrial base. These entities must not only define and implement reporting based on specific readiness metrics but they must make their readiness status continuously available in near real time to DRRS. Second the current National Military Strategy (NMS) makes substantially more complex demands on readiness reporting. Instead of basing readiness on traditional MTW-based scenarios the NMS asks us to contemplate readiness for an entire range of operational forms and to design DRRS to assess global readiness impact based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements. Finally Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) sourcing challenges mean that force managers need applications that will query the entire Department for suitable available organizations to meet current needs. The need for these applications and the underlying data are a top priority for the DRRS project.The realization of DRRS requires integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that supports distributed collaborative and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment. The primary technical goal is the creation of a highly reliable and securely integrated readiness data environment to leverage and extend current readiness information systems. This system is based on intelligent agents dynamic databases semantic middleware and publish/subscribe concepts; providing a logically uniform view into the multiple databases and information sources that feed DRRS. Crucially through this type of advanced information environment we dramatically expand the range of readiness queries that DRRS can be able to handle. This environment supports a suite of analysis tools that allow users to explore the consequences of readiness deficiencies in terms of the ability to generate forces and assess transportation feasibility as it pertains to specific scenarios. These tools and tool suites harness the power of the information environment to make possible the kind of quick-turnaround excursion-driven readiness assessment that is at the heart of DRRS.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

G-TSCMIS will consolidate improve upon and is intended to replace all existing TSCMIS solutions hosted at and supporting more than 20 Department of Defense (DoD) Services Agencies and Combatant Commands (CCDRs).  It will provide a comprehensive picture of whole-of-government SC activities and will contribute to planning more effective cooperative security activities to align or meet desired outcomes in support of SC end states.  The program is an evolutionary rapid Information Technology (IT) acquisition pilot program as described in FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act  (NDAA) Section 804 that provides users at every user command with greater capability through several iterations and releases that are developed and implemented over time.  The Department of Navy (DoN) was assigned acquisition lead for the effort by Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF). G-TSCMIS is a fully interoperable component of Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) and the DoD Joint C2 (JC2) Capability.  The effort will support the strategic planning of CCDRs by providing access to reports of programs activities events funding assessments and status of achieving defined end states.  G-TSCMIS will provide visualization assessment reporting and data management throughout the conduct of SC activities planning and execution phases. Information from the SC activities will be binned by separate SC programs budget lines/funding streams equipment drawdown etc.  This will enable users at the tactical level to focus on specific programs participating forces events and activities while users at the strategic level will be able to access summary reports of geographic regions resource requirements or total expenditure of funds by source. G-TSCMIS support to DoD's SC reporting requirements is mandated by federal law for many SC programs and activities.  To adhere to U.S. regulations G-TSCMIS reports will be tailored to include programs events and activities by category geographical areas assessments U.S. staffing levels and sources of funding. G-TSCMIS interfaces with other systems such as Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS) Joint Capability Requirements Manager (JCRM) and Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS).  G-TSCMIS must also be interoperable with the other United States Government (USG) foreign assistance and international cooperation information systems.  G-TSCMIS will allow decision makers and analysts to identify redundant investments plan more effective engagements and find gaps and opportunities for building more capable partners. The program uses multiple rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Milestone B equivalent initial build decision held in Quarter 1 FY 2012 which resulted in approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase.  The initial releases require defined objectives and mature technology.  Based on analysis of required capabilities and resources the Program Office is planning on executing G-TSCMIS in five major releases each with three or four sub-iterations across the period of FY 2012-FY 2020.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

The Basic Research Initiative program provides for the discovery and development of fundamental knowledge and understanding by research performers drawn primarily from academia and world-class research institutions in government and industry.  This leverages Department of Defense’s $2 billion annual investment in basic research by ensuring a motivation within the scientific community to conduct research benefiting Weapons of Mass Destruction-related defense missions and by improving Agency knowledge of other research efforts of potential benefit to DTRA nonproliferation counter proliferation and consequence management efforts.  These efforts are closely coordinated with the Chem-Bio Technology portfolio which executes a basic research program under the joint Chem-Bio Defense Program.  Agency research interests are coordinated with those of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Service basic research programs through the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group.  DTRA reviews research interests annually to focus on technology areas not clearly addressed by other basic research efforts.The DTRA’s Basic Research Initiative program element supports several National and Department initiatives directly related to countering WMD.  The 2010 QDR directs capability enhancements including: accelerate the development of standoff radiological/nuclear detection capabilities; and prevent proliferation and counter weapons of mass destruction with specific initiatives to: 1) Research countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents 2) Enhance nuclear forensics 3) Secure vulnerable materials 4) Develop new verification technologies and 5) Develop an in-depth understanding of the capabilities values intent and decision making of potential adversaries whether they are individuals networks or states.  Basic research supporting all of these needs is included in this program element under projects RU-Fundamental Research for Combating WMD.   Additionally it supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats priorities.  This strategy spells out four focus areas:  1) Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capacity to prevent detect and respond to infectious disease threats whether caused by natural accidental or deliberate events 2) Establish and reinforce norms against the misuse of the life sciences 3) Expand of our capability to prevent attribute and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities (capability expansion) and 4) Leveraging science technology and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capacity to respond to and recover from biological incidents (Leveraging Science).   Again all four focus areas are supported in this program element under Project RU-Fundamental Research for Combating WMD.  In the general sense these efforts are relevant for biologically-based and inspired materials for DoD applications including passive and/or remote sensing; and expand- our capability to apprehend those engaged in bio-weapons proliferation and terrorism by supporting basic research on bio-agent neutralization and bio-agent defeat employing combustion or deflagration.

It addresses the gap that exists between when a technology is first demonstrated and when it can be successfully acquired as an operational capability.  TTP bridges that gap by funding promising system and subsystem concepts for technology integration and demonstration to continue beyond the laboratory.  It allows acquisition program managers (the developers and providers) and warfighters (the end users) to integrate prototype and demonstrate candidate technologies and assess them in an operational environment.  As a result the warfighters can assess the capability first-hand and accurately fund the follow-on acquisition program during the next budgeting cycle.  TTP includes research and development funds for the following transition activities: prototyping of promising high-priority concepts and technologies in an operational environment to lower acquisition risk by raising the technology readiness level; performing pre-acquisition systems engineering to facilitate transition from a demonstration program into acquisition programs of record; assessing interface requirements of candidate concepts technologies and demonstration projects to better understand true engineering costs resulting from insertion of new technologies into the Air Force architecture; and capturing data through information technology tools and databases to help formulate strategies and gather proposals for development that have the potential to perform Department of Defense (DoD) missions.  The program provides funding to mature adaptive turbine engine technologies for next generation propulsion systems.  The program will leverage adaptive turbine engine science and technology demonstrations to develop a multi-platform common adaptive engine built around a commercially derived core.  It will enable multiple high confidence engine acquisition programs through the common engine architecture and accomplishment of early risk reduction and early competition prior to an acquisition program.  TTP funding will also provide for the demonstration of systems and technology to enable increasingly responsive resilient and affordable architectures via development of hostable payloads small satellites interface standards and government/commercial hosting opportunities.  These efforts are in Budget Activity 4 Advanced Component Development and Prototypes since they involve system specific efforts that help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use.","","Continuing","Continuing","","R2Long",

These programs were terminated in the FY13 PB.","B-52 MODERNIZATION PROGRAMSPrior to FY13 all B-52 modernization programs were funded in a single BPAC 675039 B-52 Modernization.  B-52 modernization is a comprehensive program to ensure B-52 viability to perform current and future wartime missions to include datalinks navigation sensors weapons and electronic warfare (EW) and training capabilities.  B-52 modernization (initiated in FY 2005) integrates and adds both tactical and global datalink communications for real time command and control targeting and intelligence.  It upgrades antiquated air traffic management (ATM) systems with those supported by three key functions using satellite technology:  Communications Navigation and Surveillance (CNS).  Modernization upgrades training devices to support aircrew and maintenance training with the latest B-52 capability.  In addition modernization improves conventional warfare capability with additional MIL-STD-1760 smart weapons and improved weapons carriage and fully integrates advanced targeting pods with the offensive avionics system.  B-52 modernization upgrades or replaces legacy defensive EW systems to include the radar warning receiver jammers chaff and flare dispensers and situational awareness displays as well as integration of offensive EW such as the Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) and MALD-Jammer (MALD-J).   CONECT The B-52 Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) acquisition program supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with tactical datalink and voice communications capabilities along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. The CONECT upgrade includes new multi-functional color displays (MFCDs) and a digital interphone system which will survive and function through the nuclear environment to enhance crew interaction and situational awareness. To enable net centric operations the CONECT upgrade integrates the following systems: on-board client/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions UHF Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability via ARC-210 Warrior radio to exchange J-Series messaging within theater Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR) limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link supporting e-mail and file transfers and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink to significantly enhance close air support (CAS) missions. This integrated suite will provide the B-52 fleet with a machine-to-machine data transfer capability supporting aircraft re-tasking and re-targeting of Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM) Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile/JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM/JASSM-ER) and other J-series weapons across the range of B-52 military operations and missions. In the FY13PB the CONECT program was restructured to only replace the current Multi-Function Displays (MFDs) located at each of the crew stations make the temporary Evolutionary Data Link (EDL) modification permanent and demod of the CONECT test aircraft as required.   However the original CONECT development effort as laid out in FY12 will be completed as planned and the technical design/baseline is being maintained in support of the FY14 POM decision to reinstate the program.For FY14 the FY13 decision to restructure the CONECT program was reversed.  The Air Force FY14 PB submission funds the completion of the full CONECT capability development updates due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Materiel Sources (DMSMS) issues changes to incorporate updates to GFP recurring changes to B-52 Software baseline CONECT capability inclusion into the required B-52 training systems and production/installation/initial support for a total 30 CONECT capable (2 kits were funded in EMD) aircraft.  The test aircraft will not be de-modified from its CONECT configuration.TRAINERS AND UPGRADES FOR CONECTIn order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration the CONECT program will update existing trainers or use computer-based training to add CONECT functionality to meet user-training requirements and establish a system integration laboratory (SIL) for updates of the Weapon System Trainers (WST).   MIL-STD 1760 IWBUThe MIL-STD 1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade (IWBU) program modifies hardware and software for seventy-six (76) B-52H aircraft.  It also modifies hardware for the Common Strategic Rotary Launchers (CSRL).  The 1760 IWBU program is segmented into two increments.  Increment 1 consists of two sub-increments: 1.1 and 1.2.  Increment 1.1 provides capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) smart weapons on a rotary launcher. Excess Nuclear CSRLs will be converted to Conventional Rotary Launchers (CRL).  CRL Hardware modification: Consists of Group A equipment racks and electrical wiring Group B consists of one Integrated Weapons Interface Unit (IWIU) per CRL this Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) was previously developed under the Advanced Weapons Integration (AWI) program and work previous accomplished for a 2005 demonstration or developed using 2006 and 2007 Congressional Add funding. CRLs will lose their nuclear capability until integration of the Mil-STD 1760 System II nuclear munitions and development and integration of a nuclear hardened IWIU.  No new Nuclear CSRLs are required. Aircraft Software modification: Consists of modifying existing aircraft JDAM Software and ground based Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).     Increment 1.2 provides capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missiles-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) or eight Miniature Air Launched Decoys (MALD).  Internal capabilities include authorized munition variants for example JDAM GBU-31 (v)1 (v)3 GBU-38 JASSM and MALD-Jammer (MALD-J). Common Rotary Launcher(CRL) Hardware modification: Consists of modifying the Increment 1.1 configuration by adding four Group B LRUs (three power supplies one junction box) and Group A associated interface wiring. Seventy-six (76) Aircraft Hardware modification: Consists of Group A wiring and circuit breakers to supply additional power to the CRL.  Aircraft Software modification: Includes modifying existing JASSM-ER MALD software.Support Equipment:  Thirty-eight (38) Multi-Use System Tester Armament Next Generation (MUSTANG) testers will be modified to support both increments.Increment 2 will provide carriage expansion of the CRL through a software and hardware modification and will increase the number of weapon stations from 8 to 16 to support 500 lb class munitions. This will occur after increment one completes.  Mode S/5 IFF Mode S/5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) is part of the Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) effort and will develop and integrate modern technolog into the B-52 to enable it to operate in the evolving air traffic environment.  This effort is driven by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandates to comply with performance standards to allow the B-52 to operate safely in controlled airspace.  This program will also yield significant savings by allowing the use of more efficient flight routes and altitudes.CNS/ATMCapabilities identified under CNS/ATM activities will include Frequency Management (FM) immunity digital communications (voice and data) improved navigation accuracy such as Required Navigation Performance (RNP) or Global Positioning System (GPS) enhancements Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) enhanced situational awareness such as Mode S/5 IFF Communications Management Unit HF Data Link Auto Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and any follow-activities to associated components/systems resulting from modifications to CNS/ATM systems.Anti-Skid ReplacementAnti-Skid system is used to maintain control of aircraft during landings and taxi operations.  The B-52 Anti-Skid system prevents aircraft skidding by sensing the exact amount of brake pressure needed for safe braking under all runway conditions without tire damage.  Previous B-52 Anti-Skid supportabilty analysis completed in 2006 by General Atomics indicated a supportability end date of 2011 based on parts obsolescence a lack of test equipment and a lack of repair personnel.  Parts obsolescence continues to be a major supportability factor.  However since the previous analysis test equipment and new depot maintenance procedures to refurbish previously failed Anti-Skid Detectors have been put in place in order to provide spares until 2015 when the replacement will be availabale.  The Anti-Skid Replacement program develops and installs a new system.  This effort includes an upgrade of the maintenance trainers.B-52 EHF The B-52 Extremely High Frequency (EHF) program integrates and installs the B-52 fleet with the equipment needed to provide secure survivable two-way EHF SATCOM link for Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) and report-backs to meet Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) nuclear protected Information Exchange Requirements (IERs). The B-52 EHF will install/integrate the Family of Advanced Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Terminal (FAB-T) Airborne Wideband Terminal system developed and procured by Space and Missile Center (SMC) through PE 0303601F or other equivalent terminals/solutions as necessary to meet user requirements.  The B-52 EHF will also integrate a high data rate BLOS communication link supporting IP-based Global Information Grid (GIG) interoperability into the B-52 architecture. The B-52 EHF program is planned to be accomplished in two increments. Increment 1 preserves the existing B-52 capability to receive EAMs and report-backs via SATCOM to include an Environmental Control System (ECS) modification required to support the additional communication equipment.  Increment 2 provides GIG and net-ready capability as well as full integration with other-B-52 systems.The B-52 EHF program was terminated in the FY13 PB. SR2  The B-52 Strategic Radar Replacement (SR2) program replaces the current AN/APQ-166 Strategic Radar fielded in the 1960s and then upgraded in the 1970s and 1980s.  Although modified several times it has never been totally replaced and several parts of the system remain from the original design such as the antenna reflector feed and casting.  Although sustainable through the current service life of the B-52 the legacy radar system MTBF continues to degrade and sustainment costs are expected to significantly increase after 2017. The SR2 program is a radar replacement program that may take advantage of the advanced capabilities of modern non-developmental radars maximizing commonality with other platforms.  The B-52 SR2 Program will integrate test and field a modern radar system which supports all weather targeting and navigation to support the requirements of keeping the B-52 combat capable for its extended service life.  Additionally the remaining two legacy MFDs will be upgraded to take advantage of the replacement radar's full capability.The B-52 SR2 program was terminated in the FY13 PB.Reconstitution of B-52 Nuclear Capability Study/Electromagnetic Pulse Test (EMP)Renewed emphasis of the Air Force Nuclear Mission and the pivotal role the B-52 capabilities play into that role require a study be completed to ensure the platform maintains an enhanced level of readiness.  The study wlll evaluate the nuclear hardening of the platform and ensure the survivability of existing Global Strike Weapons.  Tasks include development of a plan required for full-scale EMP test of the B-52's nuclear mission essential systems.ENGINEERING STUDIES & ANALYSIS AND TEST & EVALUATION  B-52 modernization funds test activities at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) engineering and planning studies for potential future weapon system enhancements (weapons sensors avionics and EW) and emerging requirement on current programs upgrades to the B-52 SIL AISF and WSTs and weapon system operational/safety supportability reliability and Total Ownership Cost (TOC) improvements.ARMS CONTROL ACTIVITIES (Funding is in the ARMS Control PE 35145F)Arms Control Activities under the New START Treaty drives the need to modify a number of B-52s to a conventional only role by removing the Code Enable Switch and associated equipment.  This effort requires a complete design to remove the equipment from the aircraft and install metal plates prohibiting reinstallation of removed equipment to comply with treaty protocols.ADDITIONAL EFFORTS  B-52 modernization funds additional efforts that stem from the operation and maintenance of a 50-plus-year-old aircraft such as parts obsolescence DMS and emerging requirements to add to or maintain the existing capabilities.  Examples include but are not limited to upgrades to outdated avionics computers mission planning interfaces to JMPS Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS) and other mission planning systems (JMPS) upgrades to the EW suite and studies and analysis.  All B-52 development programs support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases.    This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

This mission has been defined by the 2002 Unified Command Plan (UCP) changes 1 and 2.  To enable completion of these missions USSTRATCOM is modernizing the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as SWPS) developing information systems and techniques to counter and conduct Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) and establishing a unified national architecture integrating disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) systems into a single Internet Protocol (IP)-based system known as the Global Sensor Integrated Network (GSIN) to provide redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership.  When the ISPAN modernization is complete the system will support the warfighter in both deliberate and adaptive planning environments while allowing the National Command Authorities to employ the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons.  The ISPAN system will continue to evolve as weapon systems are matured new systems are developed and the threat changes particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).   Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) is a warfighting application of electronic warfare (EW) Information Operations (IO) and space control (SC) employing various techniques and technologies to negate or prevent hostile use of positioning navigation and timing (PNT) information and protect unimpeded use of PNT information by U.S. Allied and Coalition Forces while not unduly disrupting peaceful use outside an area of operation.  The Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) was established to integrate and coordinate NAVWAR PNT capabilities across the mission areas of intelligence surveillance reconnaissance information operations electronic warfare and space control.  The JNWC is also commissioned to integrate NAVWAR into space operations and assists the warfighter with subject matter expertise to "operationalize" NAVWAR encouraging the NAVWAR view that the Global Positioning System is a taskable weapons system in addition to being a worldwide PNT service.  The JNWC establishes and maintains the Department's premier basis of NAVWAR expertise and provides subject matter expertise and knowledge support to warfighters Department decision makers the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure) and the coalition through testing and evaluation; modeling simulation and analysis; and exercise and training support.  The nation's strategic Command and Control (C2) sensors and mission planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes.  GSIN establishes a unified national architecture integrating disparate MW/MD systems into a single IP-based system providing redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership.  GSIN nets together all sensors from tactical to strategic including the Nation's most modern and capable assets - taking advantage of their larger numbers improved algorithms mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts.  GSIN will permit an IP-based User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) to augment voice conferencing and rapidly build a single unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time senior collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) and decision-making. This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","Continuing","Continuing","N43","",

This focus is driven by the National Security Agency's tenets calling for (1) a totally "man-out-of-the-loop" electronic crypto key distribution system from the actual generation of the key in the key processor all the way into the using End Crypto Unit (ECU) (eliminates the current key vulnerability to compromise by individuals transporting or loading the key); and (2) an inventory of cryptographic devices that are more robust modular scalable capable net-centric and durable (allows more effective and efficient performance including reduced inventory expanded data rates simplified upgrades and ensured global information grid-compatibility).  The second focus is to rapidly provide new/improved capabilities to 24 AF-led forces further enabling them to protect and defend USAF Command Control Communications Computers and Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and Weapon Systems from Information Warfare (IW) attacks and to ensure affected system recovery from such attacks. To this end the project does research and development of information protection tools and transitions them to operational systems.  These efforts not only provide AF passive Net Defense capabilities but also an increasing share of the active Net Defense capabilities. This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","Continuing","Continuing","","",

AWACS provides a real-time picture of friendly neutral and hostile air activity. Its capabilities include all-altitude/all-weather surveillance of the battle space; early warning of enemy actions; a real-time ability to find fix track and assess airborne or maritime threats; and detection location and identification of electronic emitters.This program element funds four areas in support of the AWACS program:  1. AWACS Modernization 2. AWACS Infrastructure and Support Systems 3. Material Solutions Development and Analysis and 4. Program Management and Administration (PMA). The first three areas include studies and analysis to support both current planning and execution as well as future program planning.1. AWACS Modernization (RDT&E AF):a. Block 40/45 is replacing AWACS 1970's vintage mission systems that are experiencing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues are difficult and expensive to upgrade and limit overall AWACS system performance. The Block 40/45 upgrade will improve integration quality and timeliness of sensor data to the shooter improve Combat Identification (CID) improve AWACS contribution to Time Critical Targeting via Data Link Infrastructure (DLI) improve electronic support measures processing and enable more effective faster upgrades via an open-system Ethernet-based architecture. The upgrade will also update the ground support infrastructure including training systems.b. The Next Generation Identification Friend or Foe (NGIFF) Program provides AWACS with enhanced IFF interrogator operation to add a more secure Mode 5 capability. NSA declared IFF Mode 4 unsecure and obsolete on 5 Nov 2003. Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo 047-07 requires IFF Mode 5 interrogation capability by FY14. The new Mode 5 interrogation capability extends the effective range of the AWACS interrogator while helping discriminate against closely spaced cooperative targets. NGIFF developed and integrated a basic Mode 5 capability on Block 30/35 starting in FY09 and began developing a full Mode 5 capability on Block 40/45 in FY11. Hardware will be common between the Block 30/35 and Block 40/45 platforms. NGIFF will also integrate Mode S a civilian air traffic control capability residing in the NGIFF hardware as funding allows.c. DMS Replacement of Avionics for Global Operations and Navigation (DRAGON) completes the FAA/International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)/ EUROCONTROL air traffic control mandated safety of flight capabilities. This program will provide the E-3 fleet with the flight instruments and other avionics for the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) and the surveillance and communication capabilities necessary to maintain continued critical unrestricted access to global airspace. Non-compliance will result in airspace restrictions and denials that will impact AWACS ability to support worldwide responses to situations requiring immediate on-scene C2 BM. The DRAGON modifications replace the existing DMS Global Positioning System (GPS) Integrated Navigation System (GINS) with a modern Flight Management System (FMS) that will accommodate new capabilities including Mode 5 IFF and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). Also included as part of the modification is the addition of data link communications voice and data link digital radios and improved visual displays. Emphasis on employment of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) avionics is expected to lower cost reduce the tech refresh cycle and enhance life cycle management. Replacement of critical avionics subsystems that became unsustainable beginning in 2010 is included in the DRAGON program. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of DRAGON is being executed as a Cooperative Program between the US and NATO.d. The Flight Performance Software (FPS) program automates calculations currently performed manually by the pilot and flight engineer in accordance with the E-3B and C flight manual.  Phase I automates the Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD) calculations; Phase II automates the high speed calculation.  Automated calculations using the original source data used to create the flight manual charts increases safety improves on time departure/arrival improves crew efficiency and reduces tanker support.e. Electronic Protection (EP): The EP program funds acquisition and retrofit of the E-3 AWACS radar processing capability.  EP will provide improved radar processing in a specific flight environment to meet a classified requirement.  Processing will initially address radar modes comprising 90% of actual operational AWACS radar usage.  EP will install an adjunct processor that works in parallel with the current Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) system.  The EP-processed radar picture will appear on the operator screen in place of the current RSIP output when the EP radar modes are selected.  The EP program plans for multi-year advanced buys of COTS equipment due to the short life-cycles in high tech components starting in FY17.  The program will buy FY17 and FY18 COTS equipment in FY17 including initial spares.  Equipment non-recurring Group B includes efforts for Tech Refresh Active DMS and Software Releases.   2.  AWACS Infrastructure and Support Systems (RDT&E AF): These efforts synchronize modernization requirements and infrastructure support across the entire weapon system from depot and field test equipment to maintenance trainers and integration labs.a.  Training Support and Infrastructure (TSI) provides continuing system engineering and management support for AWACS modernization and enhancement. These activities include managing the AWACS developmental infrastructure AWACS Development Integration Test Support (ADITS) support for equipment concurrency modernization planning/analysis trainer/simulator integration and concurrency as well as the Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL). The contractor maintained and operated E-3 Radar Systems Integration Lab/Software Development Facility (SIL/SDF) provides US FMS and international customers with a functioning E-3 radar configuration to support radar development production and sustainment programs.  TSI efforts allow new support equipment technologies and test strategies to be analyzed to ensure concurrent capability to sustain existing modified and upgraded E-3 equipment. TSI supports trainer/simulator concurrency analysis and requirements definition to ensure trainers and simulators are kept current with the AWACS baseline. The overall DT&E test infrastructure supports both development and sustainment projects and maintains facilities to support AWACS aircraft during system and sub-system testing at Boeing Field WA.  The TSI assets also support multiple international Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) projects on a maintenance fee basis including projects for France Saudi Arabia United Kingdom Japan and NATO AEW&C efforts.3.  Material Solutions Development & Analysis (RDT&E AF): These efforts look toward the future by investigating enhanced capabilities and exploring new mission areas through C2ISR System Development while advancing the capabilities of the current weapon system through the Support The War Fighter (STWF) effort.a. C2ISR system improvements investigate and develop future capabilities of the AWACS weapon system or next C2ISR platform. These efforts also include investigation analysis and development to ensure that AWACS successfully integrates with joint and coalition forces in a net-centric environment. C2ISR primarily supports pre-systems acquisition in the areas of material solution analysis and technology development. This is accomplished by prototyping and demonstrating capabilities required by the warfighter but also includes developing an E-3 Modernization & Sustainment Roadmap that projects user capability needs as well as material solutions for the user needs. b. Internet Protocol Enabled Communication (IPEC): IPEC will provide the Block 40/45 E-3 with a wideband communications capability to connect to the Global Information Grid and will support net-centric operations/warfare.  The E-3 lacks an IP-enabled communication capability.  As a result the E-3 is not able to support a shortened digitized kill-chain of time sensitive targets.  IPEC will provide a roll-on/roll-off IP-enabled communications package supporting warfighter identified requirements for higher bandwidth SIPRNet and multi-domain networks.4.  Program Management and Administration (PMA)(RDT&E AF): This effort is PMA support for all AWACS Modernizations AWACS Infrastructure and Support Systems and Material Solutions Development and Analysis.  This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational Systems Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","Continuing","Continuing","","R2Long",

JTC TRS is essential to future upgrade and continuation training and currency control requirements due to an increase in USAF JTAC numbers while current and future available air assets to accomplish training are decreasing.  Future JTAC control requirements will exceed the ability of live air to meet and JTC TRS is the only future capability currently projected to allow USAF JTACs to achieve and maintain minimum required controls for both qualification and proficiency demands.  JTC TRS development will provide the capability to network aircrew full mission trainers and training centers with other trainers including the Personnel Recovery Training and Rehearsal System (PR TRS). This development effort will also integrate ASOCs with the Joint Theater Air to Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS) trainer for Joint Fires. The JTC TRS Project provides research and development to facilitate interoperability with joint and sister Service air-ground simulation using industry standards.   JTC TRS will allow JTAC and CCT to perform Close Air Support (CAS) Call-for-Fire (CFF) and Tactical Air Traffic Control (ATC) missions and allow ASOCs to perform Command and Control (C2) missions in a Live/Virtual/Constructive (LVC) environment.  JTAGSS is a continuation of the ASOC simulation trainer initially funded in 2009 and complements the JTC TRS trainer by providing a total air-ground constructive simulation environment for integrated networked training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop JTAC/CCT and ASOC/SOF (Special Operations Forces) C2 (Command and Control) battle staff skills.  JTAGSS will provide the ASOC SOF and TACP (Tactical Air Control Party) with the vertical and horizontal C2 communications and coordination training and mission rehearsal required for mission effectiveness.   JTAGSS is required to train 400 ASOC personnel with limited to no live training opportunities to align with the AF move to using simulation for stand-alone and distributed training.  There are insufficient exercises and live training events available to meet mandated readiness requirements.  The system will include a secure network connection a constructive simulation environment generator with sharable databases computer work stations that have synthetic reflex agent applications for every ASOC/SOF crew position and an instructor/operator station.  PR TRS is envisioned to be a "plug and play" module for the host JTC TRS. PR TRS will provide Para-rescue (PJ) personnel with an immersive LVC environment to plan train and rehearse their employment rescue/recovery and combat trauma care skills.  JTC TRS will host the network connection for PR TRS to conduct distributed training and rehearsal with other Recovery Forces.  PR TRS will supplement live field training and live tissue training to provide realistic introductory proficiency currency and upgrade training in a simulated battlefield disaster or humanitarian relief environment for Air Force PJs.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","Continuing","Continuing","","R2Long",

The E-4B NAOC fleet also satisfies the military requirement to provide a highly survivable node of the National Military Command System (NMCS). This PE's developmental modifications include but are not limited to upgrades and enhancements to aircraft structures propulsion system fuel system environmental control system electrical generation and distribution systems flight safety and navigation systems (with their associated communications equipment) and the related aircraft operations center facilities equipment and communications necessary for the E-4B fleet to execute its mission. Additionally funds may be used to explore modifications upgrades and future systems required to meet evolving mission requirements. Developmental modifications and studies/projects currently underway or planned for accomplishment under this program include:- The Super High Frequency Multiplexor (SHF MUX) effort integrates an upgraded and logistically supportable MUX to replace the obsolete legacy solution. The legacy SHF MUX is prone to intermittent disconnects and poor performance. The updated device will allow the E-4B to efficiently combine secure and non-secure digital data streams via satellite.- The Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) efforts upgrade the air traffic communications systems to improve navigation and instrument approach capabilities. These efforts are necessary to maintain air worthiness certifications for the E-4B platform. CNS/ATM is an incremental program and this effort will specifically address:  -- Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out) capability  -- Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) capability  -- Multi-Mode Receiver for Global Positioning System (GPS) Precision Instrument Approaches   -- Updates to the obsolete Flight Management Computer (FMC)- The SHF Modernization program updates system to meet immediate needs and eventual replacement of the SHF System. Upgrade of the current SHF system is required in the near-term to replace the most critically obsolete components to ensure that the system remains operable and logistically supportable until a replacement system is fielded. A replacement to the SHF system is required as secure survivable communications capability transitions from the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS).- The Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Compatible Terminal/ Presidential National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) Program integrates externally provided  AEHF Compatible Command Post Terminals and PNVC capability onto the E-4B NAOC platform. This integration is necessary to replace the legacy Military Strategic Tactical and Relay (MILSTAR) terminal and provide access to protected wideband AEHF satellite networks. PNVC replaces Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN) which will not be supported once the AEHF satellite network is in place.- The Low Frequency Transmit System (LFTS) program will replace the current Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) Transmit system that is on the E-4B. The current system has been on the E-4B for over 35 years and is past its useful life. This system must be replaced in order to meet existing National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-28 requirements and ensure there is constant and consistent connectivity to National Leaders and Forces in real world situations. The transmit system consists of three primary equipment groups: a Receiver/Transmitter group a Power Amplifier-Coupler (PA-C) group and a Trailing Wire Antenna (TWA) group.- The Secure Data Crypto modification replaces various E-4B cryptographic systems currently scheduled to be decertified by the National Security Agency (NSA). This modification ensures the continued transmission and receipt of critical strategic force orders. Funds for this modification will be used to design an engineering solution develop compatible software and conduct pre-production studies for integration of NSA approved and Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) compliant secure data cryptographic devices and associated peripherals on the aircraft.Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning execution and future program planning.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","Continuing","Continuing","","R2Long",

The two D-RAPCONs are incrementally funded in FY13 and FY14.","To support the Air Force worldwide flying mission this program element funds research development and management of new air traffic control surveillance positioning and precision approach landing systems.  When applicable this includes joint efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  ATCALS funding focuses on three main efforts as follows: Deployable Instrument Landing System (D-ILS).  This effort develops a deployable Category I (200ft decision height/2400ft runway visual range) ILS with remote monitoring and maintenance capabilities. D-ILS will provide precision approach capability in adverse weather conditions for contingency operations and humanitarian or disaster relief operations.  D-ILS will replace the current Air Force mobile Precision Approach Radar (PAR) system used to support operations at deployed locations which were procured in the 1970s are manpower intensive and logistically unsupportable.  On average only 18% (three of 17 systems) of the mobile PAR systems are operational on a daily basis.  Development and deployment of D-ILS will support increased operations in the area of responsibility allow phase out of the currently obsolete legacy systems and provide interoperability with the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF).  FY14 funds complete engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) under the EMD contract awarded in Aug 11.  Due to a contractor protest the start of EMD execution was delayed until Dec 11.  EMD execution includes assembling two EMD pre-production units for test and evaluation.  D-ILS Milestone C is scheduled for FY14.  Related OPAF funds are in program element (PE) 0305114F (Weapon System Code 833010).Deployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON).  D-RAPCON will replace the 40 year old AN/MPN-14K and AN/TPN-19 Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and Operations Shelter (OPS) subsystems with state of the art digital systems.  Modification and overhaul of the existing systems has proven to be ineffective due to diminishing manufacturing sources.  The D-RAPCON will be used to provide both a terminal and enroute surveillance capability.  The D-RAPCON will also be used with the D-ILS and a fixed or mobile control tower to provide a complete air traffic control capability.  The D-RAPCON will support tactical military and worldwide humanitarian operations and also provide a capability to support domestic disaster relief.  The primary surveillance radar coverage (non-cooperative targets) is out to 60 nautical miles (nm) and the secondary surveillance radar coverage (cooperative targets) is out to 120 nm.  FY14 funds continue EMD efforts which include the completion of two pre-production systems and the start of contractor testing.  Related OPAF funds are in PE 0305114F (Weapon System Code 833010).Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  This is an interagency effort designed to enable the transition from a ground infrastructure dominated Air Traffic Management capability for the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) to a capability that leverages advances in Performance Based Navigation (PBN) non-radar based surveillance services and transition from voice communications to digital data exchange.  Per Deputy Secretary of Defense direction the Air Force is the DoD lead Service for NextGen implementation and architecture development.  NextGen will be built on key elements from existing programs and technologies and on new systems under development.  As these technologies and architectures mature ground system upgrades will be coordinated and fielded concurrently with aircraft avionics capabilities that are acquired and integrated into Air Force aircraft (manned and unmanned).  These efforts will also run in close parallel with the Communication Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) program in PE 0305099F.  FY14 efforts will continue proof of concept demonstrations and analysis leading to Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA) RPA Pilot/Controller Communications and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) ground system implementation.  These efforts will improve the display of aircraft position to air traffic controllers enhance flight safety and support the seamless integration of RPAs into the National Airspace System and the airspaces of other nations.  FY14 funding also begins development/test of new Instrument Procedures Development System (IPDS) software (joint effort with FAA and Services); upgrade of surveillance radar and automation systems with new capabilities such as Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe; and continues NextGen Lead Service Office efforts which include preparation of NextGen Concept of Operations and Implementation Plans PBN and ADS-B Benefits/Business Cases a DoD Integrated Work Plan RPA GBSAA Engagement Plan and a DoD NextGen Enterprise Architecture Strategic Roadmap.

AFOSI's mission includes investigating criminal  matters affecting AF personnel contract fraud and economic crimes involving AF weapons systems and spare parts the investigation of environmental crime counterdrugs computer intrusion detection and forensic media analysis of computer crimes. This element supports Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) Computer Crime Investigations (CCI) and technical support to criminal and counterintelligence investigations and operations conducted by AFOSI. AFOSI's TSCM mission conducts counterintelligence investigations for both AF and DoD facilities and programs in order to deter and detect technical surveillance operations conducted by Foreign Intelligence Services to compromise classified or sensitive information.   The purpose of CCI research is to improve AF and DoD Information Operations capability by enhancing AFOSI's ability to deter or prevent spies hackers or saboteurs from manipulating damaging or stealing sensitive war fighting data or systems.  Failing that to investigate identify and prosecute those who do.  While most research to meet operational requirements is Operational System Development there is also research in the category of Engineering and Manufacturing Development due to a need for modifications to present technology.  The equipment required to provide technical support to investigations is unique and complex. This equipment must be continually updated to provide state-of-the-art capabilities to detect and neutralize criminal activities targeted against the AF and DoD. In an era of advancing technology reduced manning and increasingly high level fraud environmental crime and computer crime investigations technical investigative equipment must be continuously updated to enable AFOSI special agents to have the most cost effective and best possible means of thwarting criminal acts. The evolution of a new wave of computer crimes has made AFOSI responsible for the collection investigative analysis national level law enforcement coordination and dissemination of hacker activity and intrusion incidents for the Air Force. AFOSI's computer crime equipment must stay on the leading edge of technology to collect criminal information as well as pursue and apprehend criminals through a global medium. AFOSI must continually update its existing high tech computer surveillance equipment to support ongoing and future investigative operations to identify hackers and hacker groups as well as potential hostile government activities targeting Air Force communication and control systems.    Critical Infrastructure Protection identifies weaknesses in the Air Force Critical infrastructure highlights critical countermeasures and acquires and deploys cost-effective solutions.

The F-16 HARM Targeting System (HTS) is currently the only programmed reactive SEAD capability and enables targeting the HARM missile in its most lethal 'range known' mode. The program provides F-16 Block 50/52 and Block 40/42 aircraft with the ability to employ the AN/ASQ-213 Pod. With the introduction of HTS Revision 7 (HTS R7) in 2007 the AN/ASQ-213 Pod now has a precision geo-location capability to target Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) to destroy fixed and mobile enemy air defense elements.  Additionally by relocating the AN/ASQ-213 HTS R7 Pod to the aircraft's left inlet hard point the F-16 can simultaneously carry the HTS R7 Pod and an Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). HTS R7 fielding is complete and represents the Air Force's near-term solution for reactive time critical targeting for DEAD until this mission can be transferred to F-35 or a yet to be defined system. HTS R7 derived precision targeting data can be provided to all Joint Forces via Link-16. This effort continues preplanned product improvements (P3I) for the HTS and applies technologies similar to those demonstrated in the Advanced Tactical Targeting Technologies (AT3) program and HTS R7 development.

SEWIP Block 1 will provide required EW capabilities and will incorporate technology advances as they become available to provide incremental upgrades and improvements in performance. 2190 - The Offboard Active Decoy (NULKA) is a joint cooperative program between the United States and Australia that developed an active offboard decoy that utilizes a broadband radio frequency repeater mounted atop a hovering rocket. NULKA is designed to counter a wide variety of present and future radar guided Anti-Ship Missiles (ASMs) by radiating a large radar cross section while flying a ship-like trajectory. The United States developed the electronic payload and fire control system while Australia developed the hovering rocket.  Future efforts involve development of the capability for high value unit protection.3227 - SEWIP Block 2 is developing an upgraded antenna receiver and combat system interface for SLQ-32. The upgrades are necessary in order to pace the threat improving detection accuracy and mitigation of Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). 3316 - The Advanced Offboard EW (AOEW) program is for the development of long duration off-board decoys integrated with onboard systems for EW coordination to counter identified EW gaps (additional details classified) in response to an urgent operational need from the Fleet that has been approved by the CNO for execution. Currently no counter to the threat exists. The program consists of a Rapid Response Effort (RRE) to provide an initial limited decoy capability to the Fleet by 2014 and a Decoy Development Effort (DDE) culminating in the delivery of a fully supported full capability system. The RRE (FY12-FY13) consists of the evaluation and integration of commercially available decoys. The DDE (commencing in FY12) concerns the development and evaluation of a long duration active electronic offboard decoy system (vehicle and payload) and an onboard/offboard EW coordinator fully able to counter the threat.3321 - SEWIP Block 3 will provide an Electronic Attack (EA) capability improvement required for the SLQ-32(V) system to keep pace with the threat.  SEWIP Block 3 will provide a common EA capability to all surface combatants (CVN CG DDG LHA) outfitted with the active variant of the AN/SLQ-32 mainly the (V)3 and (V)4 as well as select new-construction platforms.3362 - E-Nulka is an upgrade to the Nulka decoy to expand frequency coverage to counter an emerging class of Anti-Ship Missiles (ASMs) for which no active countermeasure currently exists. The Program supports the engineering development of the payload receiver signal processor and transmitter construction of complete payloads integration of the completed payload with the Nulka vehicle and subsequent technical and operational assessment.","615.284","Continuing","Continuing","582","",

The Department of Defense (DoD) has defined a DCGS architecture that will be verifiably compatible and interoperable across all of the Services' Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems and operations. DCGS accesses and ingests data from space borne airborne subsurface and surface ISR collection assets intelligence databases and intelligence producers. This collected data is shared across a Joint enterprise using the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) and in time the Joint Intelligence Enterprise (JIE) to enhance access and sharing of ISR information across Joint forces through the use of common enterprise standards and services. DCGS FoS supports Joint Task Force (JTF)-level and below combat operations with critical intelligence for battle management and information dominance across the full spectrum of operations including peace conflict war and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). DCGS is a cooperative effort between the services agencies and DoD to provide systems capable of receiving processing exploiting and disseminating data from airborne and national reconnaissance platforms. DCGS-N core components include the Analyst Work Station from the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) - Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (I3) Generic Area Limitation Environment (GALE) Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Common Geo-positioning Services (CGS) Image Product Library (IPL) Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB) Joint Concentrator Architecture (JCA) and Track Management Services. The DCGS-N system represents the integration of 1) The processing and exploitation of tactical and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) and Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); 2) Precision target geopositioning mensuration and imagery dissemination capabilities; 3) Selected national IMINT requirements and processing capabilities from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA); and 4) Sharing of Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance and Targeting and Command and Control information via DIB JIE and Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) standards with a wide range of customers (e.g. Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M)) Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) and many others. The DCGS-N Enterprise Node (DEN) which incorporates DIB and JIE standards facilitates interoperability and data sharing among the DCGS FoS. DCGS-N will stay abreast of evolving requirements and ensure compliance with the DoD DCGS network architecture.  The Navy is focusing on establishing an ISR Enterprise way ahead that will emphasize a reach back strategy with a focus on providing intelligence products to support deployed ship and shore operations. The Navy will also initiate migration to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that requires the development integration and testing of a Maritime ISR Enterprise capability development and migration of ISR SOA applications and development and integration to leverage the Consolidated Afloat Network and Enterprise Services (CANES) strategy for a Common Computing Environment (CCE). Additionally DCGS-N will become the focal point for migration of Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) fusion and analysis (MFAS) tool applications for the Navy. DCGS-N Increment 2 addresses a critical shortfall in Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) capability and capacity to support operational tactical planning and execution across the full range of joint military operations. Existing TCPED shortfalls will be exacerbated by planned Navy Joint and Allied fielding of new Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms. Currently fielded systems provide localized processing capabilities that will be overwhelmed in future years without a significant change in the way the Navy processes exploits and disseminates intelligence data. DCGS-N Increment 2 will deliver all source fusion and analytical capabilities; provide Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) capabilities; integrate Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) capabilities to improve the use and analysis of sensor and platform data; based on an enterprise solution to share this information across commands services and agencies to promote shared situational awareness. DCGS-N Increment 2 consists of at least two releases. The first release provides an enhanced Navy ISR enterprise that converges and builds on the DCGS-N Increment 1 and Maritime Domain Awareness Enterprise Nodes; leverages the Joint Intelligence Enterprise (JIE) framework; federates ISR and TCPED workflow and production improving throughput through automation; exploits new and evolving sensors; provides Multi-Intelligence (Multi-INT) cross-queuing and provides modular tools accessible via a web browser. The second release enhances afloat ISR capabilities by providing a set of software centric tools hosted on the Consolidated Afloat Network and Enterprise Services (CANES) providing Multi-INT fusion and analysis behavior prediction and intelligent knowledge management designed to operate in disconnected or denied comms environment. Unit Level Rapid Technology Transition (RTT) Prototype is the initial implementation of the Intelligence Carry-On Program (ICOP) which is planned for program initiation in Fiscal Year 2014 (FY14). The RTT Prototype responds to multiple fleet and expeditionary requirements for a subset of DCGS-N intelligence capabilities to meet Navy Cruiser-Destroyer ships river/coastal patrol expeditionary and similar platforms and addresses current Commander Third Fleet (C3F) and Commander Fifth Fleet (C5F) Urgent Operational Needs (UON). The RTT Prototype provides a solution based on mature Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) products served in scalable modular hardware framework that ranges from a small footprint server with workstations to a stand-alone portable workstation. The RTT Prototype extends the ISR enterprise and DCGS Family of Systems (FoS) to disadvantaged users and it makes Navy organic sensor information available to the Joint Intelligence Community. Intelligence Carry-On Program (ICOP) is a suite of multi-source intelligence and analytical capabilities which includes an integrated Three-Dimensional (3-D) operational picture displaying intelligence and other data sources to provide a richer and more complete picture of the battle space on Unit Level platforms. The system supports a full motion video capability that receives processes exploits and disseminates organic and non-organic data as well as the ability to process and correlate Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) and external Communications Intelligence (COMINT Externals). It integrates a menu of mature Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) applications with shared storage and communication paths to reach back to the DCGS-N Enterprise Node (DEN) and to provide data sharing to the Maritime Operations Centers (MOCS) and national ISR systems making tactical users a part of the larger ISR enterprise.  In FY14 DCGS-N Increment 1 will develop a final patch to the Block 2 baseline based on discrepancy reports noted during FY13 integration efforts and FY14 test events. Additionally Increment 1 will complete development of appropriate schoolhouse curricula in support of DCGS-N training plans. In FY14 DCGS-N Increment 2 will complete a build decision Milestone B. The results of that decision will result in the award of a development and integration contract. FY 2014 activities will focus on design development and initial testing for DCGS-N Increment 2 Release 1 capabilities. Following contract award there will be a Critical Design Review (CDR) for Release 1. DCGS-N Increment 2 will employ an agile development methodology including frequent interactions between the developer and the user community to ensure that delivered capabilities meet evolving user needs. Concurrent with development of Release 1 the Program Office will be defining the requirements for Release 2.  The FY14 Intelligence Carry-On Program (ICOP) will build on the Unit Level Rapid Technology Transition (RTT) Prototype and manage capabilities gathered from DCGS-N Increment 1 Unit Level requirements Commander Third Fleet (C3F) and Commander Fifth Fleet (C5F) Urgent Operational Needs (UON) 2010 Combatant and Command (COCOM) Integrated Priorities Lists (IPL) and from the ICOP Requirements Working Group (IRWG). ICOP will also build on lessons learned from the RTT prototype capability currently deployed on USS VICKSBURG (CG 69) with initial operational capability (IOC) anticipated in FY15. ICOP will develop the associated training documents and the recommended acquisition documents including the Acquisition Strategy Cost Analysis Requirements Description (CARD) and Acquisition Program Baseline (APB).","127.403","Continuing","Continuing","","",

CANES is the technical and infrastructure consolidation of existing separately managed afloat networks currently under PE 0204163N (LI 3050) Ship Communications Automation including Integrated Shipboard Network Systems (ISNS) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System - Maritime (CENTRIXS-M) Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Networks and Submarine Local Area Network (SubLAN). These legacy afloat network designs are currently End of Life and CANES will replace these existing unaffordable and obsolete networks.   The fundamental goal of CANES is to bring Infrastructure and Platform as a Service (IaaS / PaaS) within which current and future iterations of Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) computing and storage capabilities will reside. CANES will provide complete infrastructure inclusive of hardware software processing storage and end user devices for Unclassified Coalition Secret and SCI for all basic network services (email web chat collaboration) to a wide variety of Navy surface combatants submarines Maritime Operations Centers and Aircraft. In addition approximately 36 hosted applications and systems inclusive of Command and Control Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Information Operations Logistics and Business domains require the CANES infrastructure to operate in the tactical environment. Integrating these applications and systems is accomplished through Application Integration (AI) the engineering process used to evaluate and validate compatibility between CANES and the Navy-validated applications systems and services that will utilize the CANES infrastructure and services.  Specific programs such as Distributed Common Ground System - Navy (DCGS-N) Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M) Naval Tactical Command Support System (NTCSS) and Undersea Warfare Decision Support System (USW-DSS) are dependent on the CANES Common Computing Environment (CCE) to field host and sustain their capability because they no longer provide their own hardware. CANES requires that Automated Digital Network System (ADNS)field prior to or concurrently with CANES due to architectural reliance between the two programs.    CANES will develop updates on a rolling four year hardware baseline and a two year software baseline. CANES is based on the overarching concept of reducing the number of afloat network baselines and providing enhanced efficiency through a single engineering focus on integrated technical solutions. This will allow for streamlined acquisition contracting test events and significant lifecycle efficiencies through consolidation of multiple current configuration management baselines logistics and training efforts into a unified support structure. Platform sets 1 2 3 and 4 define phases of CANES system development efforts.

When the FY 2012 budget was approved/appopriated the $44.3M was returned by the Army (RDT&EA) to RDT&EDW.  The actual FY 2012 appropriated Army program was $228.15 million including the paid back funding.","This program element (PE) demonstrates and provides high performance computing hardware parallel software wide area networking services and expertise that enable the Department of Defense (DoD) Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) community to investigate and understand physical phenomena and behavior of systems through large scale computational simulation. DoD users of these services work in a diverse variety of science and technology areas including structural mechanics fluid dynamics material science chemistry biology electromagnetics and acoustics weather ocean modeling signal/image processing forces modeling and simulation environmental quality electronics/networking/systems/C4I and space and astrophysical sciences.  The computational expertise and resources (massively parallel networked multi-core computers advanced software applications and secure connectivity) provided by this Program enable DoD researchers and engineers to analyze complex problems and phenomena and develop novel solutions using state-of-the-art physics-based and discrete event simulations.  The combined capabilities of the HPC centers and the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) enable massive calculations to be completed more efficiently and at reduced cost than if each DoD research organization were to duplicate the necessary resources. For example DoD personnel use High Performance Modernization Program (HPCMP) resources to do such things as improve the performance of manned and unmanned aircraft validate design concepts and establish expected performance of new armor and penetrator designs speed the development of new ship designs and demonstrate the viability of weapons systems performance. The HPCMP supports the requirements of DoD scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) and support for software applications. Dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) augment the DSRCs to form the total HPCMP computational capability. In 2012 the HPCMP provided approximately 1.47 billion processor hours to a user community representing requirements from all three services and the agencies of the DoD. The bulk of this capability is provided via 13 supercomputers (including systems for classified processing) located in the 5 DSRCs across the country providing a total of approximately 180000 processors and 1.7 quadrillion floating point operations per second (1.7 petaFLOPS). DoD users store their results in 16 petabytes (16000000000000 bytes) of storage archival distributed across the centers and duplicated for backup (for a total storage capability of 32 petabytes). The DREN interconnects HPCMP resources and users nationwide via a research infrastructure that provides an aggregate network capacity of 25 billion bits per second to 38 user sites 5 DSRCs and 4 smaller affiliated resource centers (ARCs). Individual user site speeds range from 45 to 622 million bits per second ARC speeds range from 155 to 2488 million bits per second and DSRC speeds range from 622 to 3110 million bits per second. Mission-critical DoD applications across the spectrum of DoD activities are supported by the software component of the Program through training in advanced computational methods the development of productive application development environments tools and methodologies and through the direct provision of computational scientists and engineers to improve the performance accuracy and relevance of physics-based computational models.The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.","","","","","",

ManTech projects are primarily performed by industry participants that bill the COE which in turn bills the Navy which causes a non-traditional financial execution profile for the program.  The program therefore does not meet traditional execution benchmarks.  The ManTech program by providing seed funding for the development of moderate to high risk process and equipment technology permits contractors to upgrade their manufacturing capabilities.

The FAAD C2 system provides alerting data to air defense gunners airspace battle management and up-linking of mission operations thereby enhancing force protection against air and missile attack.  Situational awareness and targeting data is provided on threat aircraft cruise missiles and unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The FAAD C2 system provides this mission capability by integrating dynamic FAAD C2 engagement operations software with the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT) Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) Enhanced Position Location and Reporting System (EPLRS) Global Positioning System (GPS) Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) Sentinel radar and the Mission Command architecture.  In addition FAAD C2 provides interoperability with Joint C2 systems and horizontal integration with PATRIOT and Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor (JLENS) by fusing sensor data to create a scalable and filterable Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP) and common tactical picture.  The system software is a key component of the Air Defense and Airspace Management (ADAM) Cell that is being fielded to Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) Multi-Functional Support Brigades and Division Headquarters as part of the Army's modularity concept.  System software is able to provide target data and engagement commands/status to AMD Battalions. FAAD C2 is also a principal air defense system within the Homeland Defense Program. Soldiers from activated Army National Guard AMD battalions operate the FAAD C2 systems in the National Capital Region and other locations.The Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control System (AMDPCS) is an Army Objective Force System that provides integration of AMD operations at all echelons. AMDPCS systems are deployed with Air Defense Artillery (ADA) brigades Army Air and Missile Defense Commands (AAMDCs) and ADAM Cells at the Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) Multi Functional Support Brigades and Divisions/Corps. AMDPCS systems also provide air defense capabilities to Homeland Defense systems. The fielding of ADAM Cells is essential in fulfilling the Army's Modularity requirement.  ADAM Cells provide the Commander at BCTs Brigades and Divisions with air defense situational awareness and airspace management capabilities.

ATC systems are required to achieve or maintain compliance with civil military domestic and international air traffic control and combat identification requirements and mandates.  Funding will be utilized to develop evaluate and integrate candidate technology mandates.  Funded in this program element is the development of an ATC Tactical Network the Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS) Web Based Architecture and Airspace Improvements Initiative Advanced Surveillance and Air Traffic Navigation Integration and Coordination System (ATNAVICS) modernization.  ATNAVICS provides all weather instrument flight capabilities to include enroute terminal radar precision approach and landing services to all Army Joint and allied aircraft.  TAIS develops software and required hardware for airspace management web services to operate effectively in a dynamic net-centric interconnected environment.  TAIS also integrates advanced surveillance interfaces to further enhance airspace integration and dynamic management capabilities.  Funded improvements to ATC systems including TAIS ATNAVICS MOTS and TTCS will align these programs with advanced networking communications and interoperability goals and provide compatibility with the Army Aviation aircraft and avionics upgrade programs including military (Global Air Traffic Management) and civil initiatives (Next Gen).  This includes development of an ATC tactical network with individual data interfaces between any two ATC systems.  The ATC Tactical Network is complete when TAIS MOTS ATNAVICS and TTCS are all interconnected and share data and information between one another.  This program element includes funding for development of each interface in a sequential manner with work allocated among four developers.  In a networked battlefield joint service systems and radars provide operational data to ATC missions assuming a communications infrastructure and data processing capability is embedded in ATC systems.  ATC systems control and maintain information relevant to higher level organizations or other external systems.  Advanced networks and communications allow such information to be transmitted to include aircraft positional information weather data landing surface conditions airspace density airspace control orders restricted airspace and flight plan data.  As the Department of Defense transitions military aircraft to positional self-reporting technologies these various technologies will be incorporated in the Advanced Surveillance program.  Advanced Surveillance allows ATC reception of aircraft self-reporting technologies which include Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) Mode 5 and Mode S.  Initial testing and integration of these systems are foundational to Advanced Surveillance to increase ATC systems availability to detect manage and disseminate aircraft information.  ATNAVICS will network its radar picture and advanced surveillance data (Mode 5 and Mode S) to aviation and joint network nodes through TAIS.  TAIS the Airspace Management System of the Army Mission Command System (AMCS) requires the development and testing of web-based services for Airspace Command and Control (AC2) and ATS and integration of these new web-based services into a common Army Battle Command hardware ATS and Airspace Integration Improvement Initiatives (AI3).  This will be accomplished through advanced surveillance interfaces mission planning interfaces and providing TAIS dynamic airspace updates to the cockpit.  TAIS efforts also include developing and testing improvements to the air picture including the addition of Blue Force Tracker (BFT) correlation and radar fusion capability.  To facilitate increased maintenance and system support a remote maintenance capability will be developed for robust maintenance and troubleshooting.","","","","","",

In addition these databases are required to have a higher resolution of data within the database. Budget adjustment received to achieve requirements.","The Combined Arms Tactical Trainers (CATT) represent a family of combined arms simulation systems designed to support the Army's simulation-based Combined Arms Training Strategy.  CATT enables units from crew to the battalion task force level to conduct a wide variety of combat tasks on a realistic interactive synthetic battlefield.  CATT's combination of manned simulators and staff officer workstations enables units to train as a combined arms team in a cost effective manner.  The primary CATT system is the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) which provides the underlying baseline architecture and After Action Review (AAR) for CATT expansions Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and system enhancements.  The Reconfigurable Vehicle Simulator (RVS) and the Dismounted Soldier Training System (DSTS) variants support combat convoy operations and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) tasks.  Synthetic Environment (SE) Core provides for the expansion of the synthetic environment baseline to include enhanced interoperability and the products and infrastructure to support current and future combat operations and mission rehearsal required for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and Unified Land Operations.  The first synthetic environments expanded were in the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and the CCTT for both the Active and Reserve components.  Gaming Technology provides an application to train and rehearse convoy-operations platoon level mounted infantry tactics dismounted operations rules-of-engagement training cross-cultural communications training IED defeat training route clearance ground-air coordination Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) integration and other small unit and individual training and mission rehearsal requirements.  Soldiers can train in a common environment on geotypical or geospecific virtual terrain.  It is also possible to link Gaming technology to actual communication command control computer and intelligence (C4I) systems and other CATT simulation systems to increase the utility and realism of the training.  By practicing skills in CATT units are able to effectively prepare for costly live fire and maneuver exercises as well as train tasks deemed too hazardous to conduct in a live training environment.  Fielded in both fixed site and mobile versions CATT enables both Active and Reserve component units to prepare for real world contingency missions.  By being able to use a wide array of training terrain databases and modify the behavior of the computer generated opposing forces CATT offers an unlimited array of training options to support the Army's many regional combat missions.  The combination of tough field and live fire training and realistic simulation training in CATT is the formula to prepare Soldiers and their Leaders for the uncertainties they face in current combat operations in Afghanistan and their transition to Unified Land Operations.FY 2014 Project 571 core funding of $.828 million for CCTT enables the P3I for the CCTT DSTS in support of Infantry Brigade Combat Teams Stryker Brigade Combat Teams Airborne Ranger Special Forces units and Heavy Brigade Combat Teams.
