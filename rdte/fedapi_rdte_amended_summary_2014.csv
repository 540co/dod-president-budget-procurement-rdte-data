These missions include the following: line haul local haul and unit resupply. These trucks transport water ammunition and general cargo over all terrain and throughout the battle-space.  Funding will also be used for developing the Army's next generation of tactical trucks as part of the Army's Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Modernization Strategy. Funding in Project 659 supports the Family of Heavy Trucks (FHTV) Heavy Dump Truck (HDT). Funding in Project VR5 supports periodic evolutionary upgrade of survivability and crew protection for Heavy Tactical Vehicles as described in the Long Term Protection Strategy.In FY14 Army PM MRAP will execute research and development on survivability mobility and storage technologies. Within the survivability arena JPO MRAP will focus on improved underbody armor concepts to improve current capabilities and to accomplish this with no to only minimal increase in vehicle weight.  Additional survivability efforts will work toward RPG/Shaped Charge threat defeat mechanisms that have a higher probability of defeating this prolific threat as well as developments in Transparent Armor (TA) that will extend the life of the TA in order to reduce sustainment costs.  Additional analysis of black box data recorders from vehicles operating in a home station training profile will also give us opportunities to reduce operating and sustainment costs when operating CONUS. Due to the size and increased weight of the enduring MRAP variants mobility studies will be conducted to identify technologies that will regain levels of mobility that were traded off during previous survivability upgrades. Since a significant portion of the MRAP vehicles will be stored in APS locations PM MRAP will also conduct corrosion protection efforts to develop strategies to minimize degradation of systems that are held in long term storage."FY 2014 OCO funds support upgrades for vehicles in ongoing combat operations."",
