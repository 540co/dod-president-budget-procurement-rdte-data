Based on the Systems Engineering assessments of realistic threat scenarios test events demonstrate capability of the evolving integrated and layered missile defense system in a simultaneous test and operations environment. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) in collaboration with its IMTP stakeholders: Combatant Commands; Service Operational Test Agencies (OTA); Director Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E); and Director Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) employs a systematic review of BMDS testing that establishes a convention for setting test objectives that go beyond simply exercising newly delivered elements of the system. The BMDS Test Program establishes and documents in the Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP) the test requirements for the BMDS developed by Systems Engineering with specific focus on collecting the data needed for the verification validation and accreditation (VV&A) of the BMDS models and simulations (M&S). The BMDS performance evaluation strategy is to develop models and simulations (M&S) of the BMDS and compare predictions to empirical data collected through comprehensive flight and ground testing to validate accuracy. Systems Engineering develops Critical Engagement Conditions (CECs) and Empirical Measurement Events (EMEs) which are the conditions and events which define or describe the data to be obtained from flight and ground tests in order to anchor M&S. CECs and EMEs are utilized to design a test to further advance the understanding and confidence of the M&S tool set that will be used to evaluate all possible engagements. MDA testing is based on an integrated developmental and operational test program. The MDA Test Program is based on a commitment to deploy technology that is proven cost-effective and adaptable to an evolving security environment. This PE also provides funding to the OTA which are active in all phases of test planning execution and post-test analysis to include the development of the IMTP. BMDS Test Program Functions: -Directs the testing required to verify validate and accredit (VV&A) MDA`s models and simulation (M&S).-Plans tests according to BMDS and Element objectives.-Develops MDA test policy. -Executes BMDS ground and flight tests. -Ensures appropriate data is collected at the necessary fidelity. -Collects data for BMDS analysis and manages MDA data centers. -Provides BMDS and Element performance results for IMTP stakeholders. -Provides final target system integration target mission logistics and launch execution for BMDS test target systems.-Provides test infrastructure and resources for flight and ground tests.

Once the governance plan is approved this document will be updated with any changes to the Joint Experimentation Program plan for FY 2013 and beyond.  The department will make the appropriate notifications.","Consistent with strategic guidance the Joint Experimentation (JE) Program Element targets DoD’s highest priority experimental needs defined by combatant commands and Services and synchronizes development of relevant and actionable Doctrine Organizational Training Materiel Leadership Personnel Facilities and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) solutions to enable trained ready and adaptable joint and coalition forces and improve capabilities of current and future Joint Force Commanders.  The program is governed through the JCD&E Executive Council which is composed of generals admirals and members of the Senior Executive Service representing the combatant commands and Services.  The JE program is the key synchronizing program for a diverse portfolio of concept development and solution evaluation and validation focused on combatant command and Service problems defined in Integrated Priority Lists (IPL) Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUON) and Warfighter Challenges (WFC).  In addition to defining the problems the combatant commands and Services prioritize the JE program of work and are active partners in the execution oversight and governance of the efforts.  Partners also include a broad range of civilian agency multinational academic and private sector partners.  When appropriate state and local governments participate in the development of solutions.  Projects typically confirm critical joint mission capability gaps; identify potential remedies; explore a range of DOTMLPF-P solutions; and establish the best path to solving security challenges.   The JE program is the Department’s primary program to explore the connecting ideas and processes that cannot be solved by buying a new tool or creating a new acquisition program.  Experiments span a spectrum from early efforts to develop new joint operational concepts to refinement of joint doctrine to scenario-based examination of science and technology-based solutions to validation of non-material solutions such as organization structure new processes improved training and education and recommended policy changes.  By defining emergent shortfalls and exploring force enhancement options JE serves as an early risk mitigation tool that precedes implementation of doctrine changes capability demonstrations acquisition investment decisions and policy changes.  JE supports the development of projected mission critical capabilities through rigorous objective assessment of enabling processes and technologies identification of capability/system requirements and innovative employment of existing capabilities in the context of scenarios depicting current and projected Defense operations.  Combatant commanders and Services are the primary customers of projects funded by the JE Program but through a whole of government approach projects also provide collateral benefits to a wider Defense Experimentation Enterprise including Agencies and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) intra-government international and Non-Government Organization (NGO) partners.  The experiments funded by this program establish the path to resolve current joint warfighting deficiencies and lay the foundation for trained ready and adaptive joint and coalition forces.  The Assistant Secretary of Defense Research & Engineering (ASD(R&E)) within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) provides oversight to ensure alignment with strategic guidance and emphasizes disciplined design and cost control of individual projects with meaningful results that can be assessed with metrics based on incremental force improvements.   The experimentation efforts in this program align directly to the Key Mission Areas (KMA) outlined in the February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) the National Military Strategy and the Secretary of Defense’s Efficiency Initiatives.  Flexibility will be maintained in the JE Program to address emergent requirements identified by combatant commanders and Services and will be prioritized by the JCD&E Executive Council.  The Joint Staff J7 executes the JE program and leads the JCD&E Enterprise.  The Joint Staff J7 works with the Assistant Secretary of Defense Research & Engineering (ASD(R&E)) to provide responsive support to customers and partners.The JE Program Element provides funding for the Department’s Joint Experimentation (JE) effort carried out by the JCD&E Enterprise governed by an Executive Board composed of admirals generals and Senior Executive Service members and led by a JCD&E Executive Agent.  The JCD&E Enterprise includes the combatant commands the military services the National Guard Bureau the Joint Staff the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and several Defense agencies.  Intra-government agencies and coalition partners often participate in JCD&E processes and projects.  The JE program element focuses on producing validated concepts and solutions to combatant command and Service defined problems.  Important collateral benefits accrue to other members and partners in the extended experimentation community; much of the joint content in military "Title 10" wargames can be traced to coordination within the JCD&E Enterprise.  To ensure the program focuses on needs of the warfighters joint experiments originate from an annual call for nominations from combatant commands and Services and from assessment of combatant command identified critical warfighting capability gaps articulated in combatant command Integrated Priority Lists and Joint Urgent Needs documents submitted to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS).  JE nominations undergo preliminary analysis by the JCD&E Enterprise to confirm suitability for experimentation alignment to strategic guidance and where feasible to associate closely related subjects for economy of effort. The resultant list is termed Warfighter Challenges (WFCs) and constitutes experimentation efforts eligible for design and execution. These efforts are prioritized and approved by the combatant command and Service members of the Executive Council.  Experimentation plans are developed in consultation with JE partners and consolidated into an annual program of joint experimentation known as the JCD&E Campaign Plan.  The Executive Council meets regularly to review and approve the progress of the efforts in the campaign plan.  The JCD&E Campaign Plan allows the Department to synchronize experimentation efforts over multiple years to avoid duplication of effort and to create synergy among the defense experimentation entities.      JE experiments and activities examine potential solutions for combatant command operational needs through targeted DOTMLPF-P improvements.  JE tackles joint concept and capability issues demanding sophisticated analysis innovative design and complex execution.  JE addresses topics that would prove difficult for individual combatant commands and Services to capture in the context of their immediate operational and force generation responsibilities.  Experiments and efforts produce a range of outcomes inclusive of fundamental joint doctrine inputs to major policy documents such as the Quadrennial Defense Review and the Defense Planning and Programming Guidance (DPPG). In partnership with the combatant commands and Services JE mitigates operational risk by establishing procedural models to conduct emergent concepts like Irregular Warfare Integrated Financial Operations and Joint Operational Access that are not yet instantiated in conventional force generation.  The results are briefed to Functional Capability Boards who integrate solutions into their functional investment plans.JE examines joint concepts and develops exploratory concepts to describe how the Joint Force Commander will meet current and future security challenges and explores joint capabilities required to execute those concepts.  To support the continued transformation of the joint force even while it is engaged in operations around the world joint concept development applies historical precedents lessons learned from current operations and Defense planning scenarios then studies the projected joint operational environment to lay the conceptual foundation for the future force.  After the current adjustment a relatively stable investment projection for the JE Program drives aggressive efforts to derive greater return on investment for the DOD in the face of increasing demand for projects from combatant commands and joint experimentation partners.Joint and Service experimentation are complementary efforts and require a unified approach.  Joint experimentation focuses on the needs of the Joint Force Commander while Service experimentation enables the components the Joint Force Commander will employ.  Complementing the efforts undertaken by the JCD&E Executive Agent (USJFCOM and/or successor organization) other combatant commands conduct Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs) to address operational capability gaps and support identification of potential solutions for theater specific and functional joint warfighter needs as part of the overall JCD&E campaign.  Within the process the JCD&E enterprise leverages Service wargame/experimentation to address joint challenges.   Experimentation activities are coordinated within the JCD&E enterprise to cover gaps and pursue efficiency and the results are shared throughout the enterprise.  The collaborative planning effort of the JCD&E enterprise is intended to ensure coherent and transparent application of JE funds joint context and concepts capabilities are integrated into Service experimentation as appropriate.  A biennial report captures activities across the Defense Experimentation enterprise activities to inform Congress of program execution and project accomplishments.","Continuing","Continuing","",

JSIC promotes Service/Defense Agency C2 capability integration and conducts technical operational and DOTMLPF assessments of Command and Control (C2) and Command Control Computer Communication Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) capabilities.  JSIC serves as the technical analysis and operational assessment activity in support of the Joint Staff capability-driven requirements process the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS).  JSIC also serves as a joint interoperability compliance activity for the milestone decision authorities/program managers in the Defense acquisition enterprise.The FY 2005 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) directed the transfer for Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding for joint warfare experimentation and training programs from Navy accounts to new Defense Wide RDT&E accounts beginning in FY 2007.  Joint Staff J8 is the executive agent for the JSIC PE and Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD (R&E)) provides execution oversight.JSIC provides Combatant Commands at the joint force headquarters level with a laboratory and assessment environment for the warfighter and capability developer.  This environment provides for assessment of current and near-term joint and coalition capabilities primarily at the operational and tactical levels. JSIC's Persistent Command and Control (C2) Environment accurately replicates an operational C2 environment. With this capability JSIC assesses system of systems interoperability operational capability procedural compliance and technical suitability of emerging and existing systems and programs to confirm readiness for deployment.  Through JSIC's analysis and assessment systems are evaluated for "value-added" prior to employment in joint and coalition environments typical of deployed theaters of operation.  By establishing ground truth for interoperability and suggesting remedies for demonstrated shortfalls JSIC is an enabler for interoperable joint and coalition solutions and provides a means to foster rapid near-term insertion of C4ISR technology by promoting the ability to meet the DoD direction for spiral development and evolutionary acquisition.  JSIC's mission is to provide for the fielding of warfighter C2 systems through rapid systems integration technical assessment and operational evaluation using laboratory environments and field venues.  In the world of C2 and ISR interoperability performance in the field is the bottom line. In terms of investment JSIC is the "ounce of prevention" that precludes a "pound" of mission failure and loss of life due to interoperability failures in military operations.","Continuing","Continuing","",

Pursuing the R&E mission requires attention to: identification and development of new technological opportunities; insertion of new technologies into warfighting systems and operations; and management and evaluation of the effectiveness of technology programs.  This program element provides mission support to the Office of the ASD(R&E) (OASD(R&E)).  It covers a wide range of studies and analysis in support of the R&E program and it impacts the Department's decision to fund RDT&E efforts.  The program element provides funding for the Defense Laboratory Office within the OASD(R&E)).  The Defense Laboratory Office advocates and invests in the DoD laboratory system in three areas: facilities and infrastructure; quality of workforce; and global insight of critical or strategic technologies important to the Department and the Nation.The program element also provides engineering scientific and analytical support to the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research in its responsibility for direction overall quality and content of the science and technology (S&T) program and ensures that the technology being developed is affordable and minimizes system development risk.  The Defense Technology Analysis program conducts assessments and analysis to ensure maximum utilization of research and development funds to accomplish the overall objectives of the S&T program.  The Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) of 2009 expanded the role of the ASD(R&E) in acquisition decisions.  Full implementation of the Act requires increases in both the number and depth of technology maturity assessments.  Funds are required for technical analytical and management support equipment and supplies travel and publications.The DoD's key expertise for reviewing and guiding R&E programs resides in the OASD(R&E).  The OASD(R&E) staff augment their responsibilities through their connections to technology experts in various fields throughout academia industry and government.  The Defense Support Teams project supports the directed responsibilities by building teams of technology experts to conduct program technical assessments.  The teams analyze the key engineering problem areas and offer adjustments in the development and test plan; alternate technical approaches; or new technologies that could enable successful development.  The teams constitute expert non-advocate reviews and gather advice from the Nation's leading technical experts.","Continuing","Continuing","",

It addresses the gap that exists between when a technology is first demonstrated and when it can be successfully acquired as an operational capability.  TTP bridges that gap by funding promising system and subsystem concepts for technology integration and demonstration to continue beyond the laboratory.  It allows acquisition program managers (the developers and providers) and warfighters (the end users) to integrate prototype and demonstrate candidate technologies and assess them in an operational environment.  As a result the warfighters can assess the capability first-hand and accurately fund the follow-on acquisition program during the next budgeting cycle.  TTP includes research and development funds for the following transition activities: (1) prototyping of promising high-priority concepts and technologies in an operational environment to lower acquisition risk by raising the technology readiness level; (2) performing pre-acquisition systems engineering to facilitate transition from a demonstration program into acquisition programs of record; (3) assessing interface requirements of candidate concepts technologies and demonstration projects to better understand true engineering costs resulting from insertion of new technologies into the Air Force architecture; and (4) capturing data through information technology tools and databases to help formulate strategies and gather proposals for development that have the potential to perform Department of Defense (DoD) missions.  The program provides funding to mature adaptive turbine engine technologies for next generation propulsion systems.  The program will leverage adaptive turbine engine science and technology demonstrations to develop a multi-platform common adaptive engine built around a commercially derived core.  It will enable multiple high confidence engine acquisition programs through the common engine architecture and accomplishment of early risk reduction and early competition prior to an acquisition program.  TTP funding will also provide for the demonstration of systems and technology to enable increasingly responsive resilient and affordable architectures via development of hostable payloads small satellites interface standards and government/commercial hosting opportunities.

C2C will support:  C2 C2 of Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) integration by providing architectural analysis prototyping experimentation innovation to develop cross-cutting solutions and enable an improved "sense-to-kill" cycle time.  C2C innovations and experimentation provides strategic operational and tactical direction for Doctrine Organization Training Materiel Leadership and Education Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions to facilitate an integrated mission environment that support C2 planning and execution for air space and cyberspace.  In-depth development and analyses of C2 operational systems and technical architectures are geared towards identifying capability gaps identifying required "To Be" information services and evaluating C2 program planned improvements.  Through prototyping and experimentation C2C will integrate rapidly developing technologies to promote common standards data sharing and information services across Air Force and joint warfighting applications to support joint enterprise solutions.  Project 5078 Horizontal Integration (HI) conducts DOTMLPF analysis and assessments to guide cross-cutting C2 sub-enterprise and cyberspace investment decisions that integrate USAF capabilities into joint and coalition operations.  HI identifies prioritizes and develops horizontally integrated solution recommendations to ensure the latest technologies and information services are integrated into a cross cutting C2 system that enables integrated effects in all warfighter domains.  The HI strategy will be validated by Headquarters Air Force (HAF) to ensure that initiatives are harmonized with the most urgent warfighter needs described by the C2 Capability Assessment Team (CAT) and C2 Core Function Master Plan (CFMP).  Once validated HI funds are applied toward identifying the most critical warfighter capabilities and ensuring they are horizontally integrated into both Air Force and joint C2 programs of record.Project 5140 Joint Expeditionary Force Experiments (JEFX) are agile and frequent innovation-focused experiments which lead to pre-fielded operational and technical assessments.  Constructive live and virtual operationally representative warfighter environments are created to support integration challenges which focus on critical C2 areas of interest that support the joint warfighter; including C2 of ISR innovation that supports the air space and cyberspace domains.  JEFX provides the infrastructure and integration initiatives for experimentation with emerging operational concepts and attendant new technologies that fill operational gaps in Air Force capabilities to meet emerging and rapidly changing real world threats.  The JEFX strategy is validated and supported by Commander Air Combat Command (COMACC) and coordinated with Headquarters Air Force (HAF) ensuring initiatives are harmonized with the most urgent warfighter needs and validated requirements described in the AF Core Function Master Plans (CFMP) and supported through MAJCOM Core function Lead Integrator (CFLI).  JEFX initiatives are based on emerging CONOPS and warfighter challenges important enablers of innovation and transformation which are designed to support the themes and demonstrate emerging Air Force capabilities to deploy and employ decisive air space and cyberspace power in support of the Joint Force.

The CRC is identified as a component of the Integrated Air Missile Defense Family of Systems that defends the Homeland and US national interests at home and abroad by negating an adversary's ability to achieve adverse effects from their air and missile capabilities.   The CRC mission is to provide battlespace awareness and tactical battle management command and control (BMC2) in an assigned area.  It is a ground-based theater air control system (TACS) surveillance and BMC2 element.  It consists of facilities equipment and people and is a tailorable modular transportable sustainable and persistent weapon system employed at the tactical level to support air and surface operations.  Currently the CRCs are fully employed in Operations ENDURING FREEDOM and NOBLE EAGLE.  The CRC projects include development and modernization of Theater Air Control Systems Improvement (TACSI) capabilities and the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR).TACSI efforts include but are not limited to the AN/TYQ-23 Operations Module (OM) AN/TPS-75 Long-Range Surveillance Radar and the AN/TRC-215 Remote Radio Secure Voice System (RRSVS) that may be tasked across the full range of military operations.  AN/TYQ-23 OM is a low source/high demand (LS/HD) deployable ground-based C2 asset.  This automated computer-based information system provides operators the real-time battlespace visualization necessary to plan direct and control tactical air operations and airspace management tasks.  AN/TRC-215 RRSVS is a mobile vehicle-mounted voice radio and OM-interface unit.  The RRSVS allows real-time secure voice communication between aircraft operating in the battlespace and ground-based BMC2 operators located in the OM of the CRC.  The AN/TRC-215 is typically deployed to a remote area which can extend the CRCs radio coverage beyond line of sight (BLOS) using organic SATCOM capabilities.The 3DELRR program is developing a replacement for the current legacy AN/TPS-75 radar.  3DELRR will be the principal USAF long-range ground-based sensor for detecting identifying tracking and reporting aircraft and missiles in support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) through the Ground Theater Air Control System (GTACS).   The primary mission of the 3DELRR will be to provide long-range surveillance control of aircraft theater ballistic missile detection and Combat Identification (CID).  The 3DELRR will respond to the operational need to detect and report highly maneuverable small radar cross section targets to enable battlespace awareness while at the same time mitigating the reliability maintainability and sustainability issues plaguing the AN/TPS-75 radar system.  Ongoing planning and associated activities will take place to prevent and overcome diminishing manufacturing sources and obsolescence issues as required.Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution as well as future program planning.    This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","Continuing","Continuing","",

Joint Tactical Radio Systems (JTRS) will link the power of the Global Information Grid (GIG) to the warfighter in applying fire effects and achieving overall battlefield superiority. By developing and implementing an open architecture of cutting-edge radio waveform technology multiple radio types (e.g. handheld ground-mobile airborne maritime etc.) are now capable of communicating with one another.   JTRS radios are intended to interoperate with existing radio systems and improve joint warfighting through a series of new joint networking waveforms enabling communication via voice data and video over mobile ad-hoc internet protocol (IP) based networks.  Each radio will operate as a node in the network to ensure secure wireless communication and networking services for airborne mobile and fixed forces. These goals extend to U.S. allies joint and coalition partners and in time disaster response personnel. JTRS will make the Air Force more effective in Joint warfighting through a series of new joint networking waveforms.  These waveforms included the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) which provides next generation SATCOM beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) communications as well as the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) which provide interoperability with Army ground forces from the brigade level down to the dismounted soldier.  Together these waveforms enable Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) and other Joint missions.  The JTRS program is built around an open Software Communications Architecture (SCA) allowing common software waveform applications to be implemented across the family of radios to provide joint-service allied and coalition interoperability.

Historically aircraft systems change missions tactics and environments (including new fuels) to meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the engines through actual use and Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these field problems.  Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types/maturity of engines not by the total engine quantity.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory engines operational.  Engine CIP through "Lead the Fleet" operational use and accelerated mission testing identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts.  Engine CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when manufacturers incorporate Engine CIP improvements into production engines.  Engine CIP ensures continued improvements in engine R&M which reduce out year support costs.  Historically R&M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&M) and spares costs.

The U-2 has special fuel requirements due to the extreme temperatures it encounters in its operating environment.  The production special handling and prepositioning of JPTS results in significant cost increase.  By switching to an additive to the common JP8 the logistical challenges are greatly reduced and the fuel costs are reduced by 50%. The U-2 Sump Tank activity develops a composite materials replacement for the existing aluminum sump tank that will reduce the mean time between failure rate for this key component.  Annual cost of replacing the existing aluminum tank is currently $1.8M. The U-2 GPS receiver replacement activity addresses a vanishing vendor item/diminishing material source issue in the FY17 timeframe for this critical navigation component.  Development and testing of a replacement GPS receiver for the U-2 in FY13 is required to ensure continued operations beyond FY17. Activities also include but not limited to studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","Continuing","Continuing","R2Long",

USNDS supports NUDET detection requirements across five mission areas: Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) Nuclear Force Management (NFM) Space Control (SC) Treaty Monitoring (TM) and a classified mission.  The USNDS program is jointly sponsored and funded by the Department of Defense (DoD) through the US Air Force and the Department of Energy (DoE) through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its Nuclear Detonation Detection (NA-22) office respectively. NNSA/NA-22 supplies at no cost to DoD USNDS NUDET space sensors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the Air Force's USNDS Program Office who is responsible for all acquisition and systems engineering integration and test (SEIT) activities on space vehicles to include GPS and additional hosts and their supporting ground control segments.DoD funds their contribution to the NDS program in PE 0305913F with RDT&EAF OPAF and Operation & Maintenance dollars. NDS payload integration onto GPS satellites is funded in the GPS Space & Control Program Element (PE) 0305165F for GPS IIF and in the GPS III Space Segment PE 0305265F for GPS III.USNDS consists of nuclear detection space sensors and ground control segments.  The space segment consists of three sensor payloads: the Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) payload for Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites the Global Burst Detection (GBD) payload for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) platforms (GPS satellites) and the Space Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) payload for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) platforms (Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites and other GEO hosts). The RADEC sensor includes gamma neutron optical and X-ray sensors.  The GBD payload consists of optical x-ray and Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) sensors.  The SABRS payload consists of neutron gamma ray and space environmental sensors. Together these sensors in orbit on GEO and MEO platforms comprise the global NUDET detection capability for USNDS. Space Sensors communicate NUDET detection to the grounds control segment which includes the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS) Ground NDS Terminals (GNTs) and Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs). These ground systems perform data analysis and provide a decision support tool to the Air Force controllers concerning probability of NUDET occurrence. ICADS consists of two fixed ground terminals and GNT provides ground receiving analysis and reporting capabilities to national authorities commands and forward users.  UGNT will upgrade GNT with survivable and endurable capabilities.  The ground control segment is being modernized and continuously improved through an incremental evolutional acquisition approach.  The upgrade to the GNT is the Universal Ground Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) Terminal (UGNT) which is funded with RDT&E AF in this PE. The UGNT provides NUDET Detection Reports to end users supports Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) missions and provides survivable and endurable USNDS communications via Milstar/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) circuits. The UGNT program modifies the baseline of the GNT program and deploys with the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Survivable / Endurable Evolution (S2E2) Mobile Ground System (SMGS) units.  The UGNT when integrated with the SMGS will perform NUDET event processing with fused NUDET Detection System (NDS) data from Global Positioning System (GPS)and DSP.  SMGS capability refers to the result of the S2E2 upgrade program for the MGS mission processing capability including the integration of UGNT.  The intended end state of UGNT integration is delivery of enhanced missile warning and NUDET detection capabilities that meet survivable/endurable ITW/AA requirements directed by the President SECDEF Joint Staff and USSTRATCOM delivering long-termcost effective multi-role multi-mission space effects to the war fighter across the range of military operations.This NDS PE includes systems engineering research development manufacture integration on-orbit and field testing and end-to-end verification of USNDS space sensors ground analysis and reporting systems in support of the 5 (five) USNDS mission areas. This program is in Budget Activity 7 - Operational System Development because it supports operational systems.","Continuing","Continuing","R2Long",

CEC distributes sensor data from each ship and aircraft or cooperating unit (CU) to all other CUs in the battle force through a real-time line of sight high data rate sensor and engagement data distribution network. CEC is highly resistant to jamming and provides accurate gridlocking between CUs. Each CU independently employs high capacity parallel processing and advanced algorithms to combine all distributed sensor data into a fire control quality track picture which is the same for all CUs. CEC data is presented as a superset of the best AAW sensor capabilities from each CU all of which are integrated into a single input to each CU's combat weapons system. CEC significantly improves our Battle Force defense in depth including both local area and ship defense capabilities against current and future AAW threats. Moreover CEC provides critical connectivity and integration of over-land air defense systems capable of countering emerging air threats including land attack cruise missiles in a complex littoral environment.CEC consists of the Data Distribution System (DDS) the Cooperative Engagement Processor (CEP) and interface with Combat Systems and sensors. The DDS encodes and distributes own-ship sensor and engagement data and is a high capacity jam resistant directive system providing a precision gridlocking and high throughput of data. The CEP is a high capacity distributed processor that processes force levels of data in near real-time. The data is passed to the ship's combat system as high quality data for which the ship can cue its onboard sensors or use the data to engage targets without actually tracking them. CEC incorporates Advanced Capability Build-12 (ACB-12) into the CEC baseline for FY09 - FY13.The Navy implemented a Signal Data Processor (SDP) approach to modify the current equipment to meet reduced size weight cost power and cooling objectives. This SDP approach also supports continuity for interoperability improvements and program protection as well as supporting open architecture initiatives and comms independence. The SDP will provide hardware which complies with Category 3 Open Architecture Computing Environment (OACE) standards with rehosted existing software which will be fielded fleet-wide to allow affordable replacement of obsolete computing system components and eliminate dependencies on "closed" equipment operating systems and middleware.Additionally CEC is working with the Army to engineer a Joint Track Management (JTM) and sensor measurement fusion capability which will be implemented in their respective programs to achieve interoperability across the battle space.COMOPTEVFOR found the AN/USG-3 (E-2C Airborne CEC) Operationally Effective but not Operationally Suitable. Reliability and availability issues are addressed by the replacement of four Weapons replaceable Assemblies (WRAs) with the new SDP. Backfit of the SDP in the E-2C will resolve suitability issues and satisfy National Security Agency (NSA) directed Crypto Modernization requirements with funding provided in FY10 and FY11. The SDP will also be used in E-2D.A family of antennas approach will be used to satisfy CEC requirements with lower life cycle costs (procurement installation and maintenance) and reduced weight (on mast and below deck).  These antennas enable future capability as well as providing a solution extensible to additional platforms.  This effort for Common Array Block (CAB) antennas will be competed and awarded to a single Design Agent in FY12 and a competitive award for production is planned for FY14.Large Nets respond to emergent needs of operational forces and missions provides an extensible foundation for capability growth provides interoperability with legacy units in Global Mode. This will provide an increase in DDS network size. This is needed to improve multiple battle group operations. Applicable ships and systems include all CEC deployed units and future fielding to include CG/DDG Modernization and its Pathfinder Programs. Data Distribution System (DDS) must increase nodes to support the increasing number of fielded CEC assets.In support of Interoperability CEC will continue to work collaboratively with other Combat Systems programs (AWS E-2C E-2D SSDS CDLMS C2P and SGS/AC) to develop the software and implement design corrections and system changes. CEC will analyze the interactions of interoperability issues and impacts and provide collaboration for development of CEC and other system changes. Develop the long term solutions including the engineering process to validate small parts of developmental software ideas and utilize M&S to validate design approaches in the systems engineering realm.","Continuing","Continuing","",

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises the combatant commands the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.Activities and efforts in this program address the advanced technology development test and evaluation of a dynamic distributed common picture based on emergent technologies that will improve situational awareness across command echelons.  The promise of net-centricity and potential for persistent and pervasive sensing creates greater demand for automated fusion of large volumes of multi-sensor data techniques to coordinate deployment of multiple diverse sensors and tailored dissemination of information to support network centric operations.  The focus of this program is to refine technologies that exploit information and networking technology to ensure mission success in unpredictable warfighting environments.  These missions include the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) urban operations and asymmetric warfare.  To ensure Maritime Domain Awareness the Navy must be able to collect fuse and disseminate enormous quantities of data drawn from US joint forces and government agencies international coalition partners and forces and commercial entities.  To further network centric capabilities this project demonstrates technologies that support seamless information services afloat and ashore; collaborative decision-making among geographically dispersed warfighters; a common consistent view of the battlespace geared to user requirements; system interoperability with coalition forces; real-time information access with quality of service guarantees; and information assurance.  Technologies of interest provide access to and automated processing of information necessary to make decisions that lead to rapid accurate decision-making and result in decisive precise and desired engagement outcomes.  The payoff is access to tailored information in near real time with corresponding increases in speed of command improved decision-making and reduction in manpower.  The Common Picture Program supports FORCEnet Sea Shield and Sea Strike pillars and contains investments in the following Enabling Capabilities (ECs):  Combatant Commanders (COCOM) to Marine Combat ID; Combat ID Information Management of Coordinated Electronic Surveillance; Combat ID in the Maritime Domain to Reveal Contact Intent; Automated Control of Large Sensor Networks; Dynamic Command and Control (C2) for Tactical Forces and Maritime Operations Center (MOC); Dynamic Tactical Communications Networks; Globally Netted Joint/Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander; OCO Focused Tactical Persistent Surveillance; Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance; High Band Width Free-Space Laser Communications; Pro-Active Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance; Fast Magic; Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Space; Advanced Tactical Data Link; and Autonomous Tactical Persistent Surveillance.In the context of the Naval Transformation Roadmap construct this investment will achieve capabilities required by FORCEnet (Persistent Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Time Sensitive Strike; and Sea Based Information Operations) Sea Strike (Ship-to-Objective Maneuver) and Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense).Due to the number of efforts in this PE the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.","0.000","140.511","",

The budget enables Acquisition Category (ACAT) III development to address Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) defined capability-based requirements and mission needs. This Program Element (0205632N/0366) is tied to development programs that leverage a joint United States/Australia Armaments Cooperative Project (ACP) to develop MK-48 ADCAP CBASS; and Future Naval Capability (FNC) technologies developed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR).														(U) Countermeasure (CM) sophistication and availability on the open market directly affects ADCAP kill proficiency and its ability to counter rapidly evolving threats. The focus of the MK-48 ADCAP torpedo Research and Development (R&D) program from FY 2001 and out shifted from being primarily concentrated on Software Block Upgrade efforts towards coordinated hardware upgrades rapid Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) insertion and APBs to rapidly upgrade the ADCAP to counter evolving threats and maintain robust performance. The CBASS program developed and fielded a broadband sonar capable of identifying CMs and discriminating them from the target. CBASS Phase I achieved IOC in FY 2006.  The Commonwealth of Australia Royal Navy is jointly participating to develop CBASS Phase II to improve shallow water performance and signed a MOA extension Nov 2009.  The MOA extension expires Nov 2019.				(U) The MK-48 ADCAP torpedo R&D program focuses on two specific areas near term: Torpedo APBs and hardware tech insertions. The CNO continues to stress shallow water (less than 600 feet) as a critical operating area to counter third world diesel electric submarines. Torpedo testing in shallow water has demonstrated that in-service ADCAP has less than full capability in this difficult environment. However this testing in conjunction with laboratory simulation efforts has shown that significant performance improvements can be made by implementing changes to weapon tactics and software algorithms. Development implementation and testing of these changes is being accomplished under the Torpedo APB program. The APB program also leverages the RAN joint torpedo program and FNC technologies developed by the ONR in the areas of torpedo broadband signal processing tactics processing and alertment. The Torpedo tech insertion program will leverage from MK-54 Lightweight torpedo algorithms. Further hardware investment involves development of Guidance & Control (G&C) replacement required to support production and development of Automated Test Equipment replacement to improve comprehensive system testing of full up CBASS Torpedoes.(U) The Torpedo Technology Insertion program will provide for evolutionary torpedo improvements and upgrades (including the transition and testing of advanced technologies from the R&D community (6.2/6.3 and contractors). This approach will incorporate developmental testing of the FNC transitioning technologies for ADCAP upgrades in the areas of torpedosensors weapon/platform connectivity warhead lethality speed and depth. These efforts will continue torpedo development investment at a lower cost and shorter term than traditional torpedo programs.(U) A modification to the CBASS Spiral 4 program was directed by CNO to address a Fleet Urgent Operation Need (UON) which enables the early fielding of specific Spiral 4 capabilities. Development of these changes are being accomplished under the APB program and are referred to as the Torpedo UON Rapid Fielding (TURF) effort. The TURF effort was inserted into CBASS Spiral 4 and was Fleet released in FY11 pushing spiral 4 IOC from 2nd Qtr FY12 to 4th Qtr FY12. The TURF effort also extended APB 5 development and delayed APB 5 IOC until 4th Qtr FY17.(U) Both FNC technologies and MK-54 Lightweight torpedo developments will be transitioned into ADCAP through Technology Insertion packages. Priorities for Technology Insertion are a new array to improve torpedo effectiveness advanced processing and advanced counter-countermeasure capability.It has been determined that program effectiveness can be improved by developing and delivering Automated Test Equipment (ATE) production restarts so development is planned to start in FY 2012.  RDT&E is planned for redesign and development of obsolete components necessary to reconstitute Guidance & Control (G&C) torpedo sections.","Continuing","Continuing","",

The Department of Defense (DoD) has defined a DCGS architecture that will be verifiably compatible and interoperable across all of the Services' Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems and operations. DCGS accesses and ingests data from space borne airborne subsurface and surface ISR collection assets intelligence databases and intelligence producers. This collected data is shared across a Joint enterprise using the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) and in time the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) to enhance access and sharing of ISR information across Joint forces through the use of common enterprise standards and services. DCGS FoS supports Joint Task Force (JTF)-level and below combat operations with critical intelligence for battle management and information dominance across the full spectrum of operations including peace conflict war and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). DCGS is a cooperative effort between the services agencies and DoD to provide systems capable of receiving processing exploiting and disseminating data from airborne and national reconnaissance platforms. DCGS-N core components include the Analyst Work Station from the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) - Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (I3) Generic Area Limitation Environment (GALE) Lite Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Common Geo-positioning Services (CGS) Image Product Library (IPL) Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB) Joint Concentrator Architecture (JCA) and Track Management Services.  The DCGS-N system represents the integration of: 1) The processing and exploitation of tactical and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) and Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); 2) Precision target geopositioning mensuration and imagery dissemination capabilities; 3) Selected national IMINT requirements and processing capabilities from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA); and 4) Sharing of Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance and Targeting and Command and Control information via DIB DI2E and Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) standards with a wide range of customers (e.g. Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M)) Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) and many others).The DCGS-N Enterprise Node (DEN) which incorporates DIB and DI2E standards facilitates interoperability and data sharing among the DCGS FoS. DCGS-N will stay abreast of evolving requirements and ensure compliance with the DOD DCGS network architecture.  The Navy is focusing on establishing an ISR Enterprise way ahead that will emphasize a reach back strategy with a focus on providing intelligence products to support deployed ship and shore operations. The Navy will also initiate migration to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that requires the development integration and testing of ISR Enterprise capability (Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) to MOC to afloat) development and migration of ISR SOA applications and development and integration to leverage the Consolidated Afloat Network and Enterprise Services (CANES) strategy for a Common Computing Environment (CCE). Additionally DCGS-N will become the focal point for migration of Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) fusion and analysis (MFAS) tool applications for the Navy. The Navy's Integrated Imagery and Intelligence Applications (I3 Apps) are an integrated set of applications designed to support analyst workflows and tactical intelligence processing providing a useful integration framework to ensure joint intelligence interoperability across the GCCS and  DCGS enterprise. Development of I3 Apps includes end to end intelligence analysis applications that leverage the MIDB and integration with NGA-provided digital map and imagery systems. I3 imagery applications provide for archiving viewing and measurement of still and video images.  The Navy's I3 effort is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) managed by the Secretary of Defense through the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)).Joint Service Imagery Processing System - Navy (JSIPS-N) tech refresh and JSIPS-N Service Life Extension Program (JSLEP) upgrades provide shipboard digital imagery capability to receive exploit store and disseminate imagery products based on national theater and tactical sensors.  JSIPS-N service life extension is comprised of five subsystems: Joint Concentrator Architecture (JCA) Common Geo-positioning Service (CGS) Image Product Library (IPL) Imagery Exploitation Support System (IESS) and the Sharp Display System (SDS). JSIPS-N is the Navy's legacy imagery processing system. JSLEP will overcome JSIPS-N End-of-Life hardware challenges software obsolescence and improve systems reliability until DCGS-N fully replaces JSIPS-N ashore and afloat.DCGS-N Increment 2 will improve DCGS-N Increment 1 through the integration of multi-INT fusion and analytical capabilities; provide Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) capabilites; integrate Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) capabilities to improve the use and analysis of sensor and platform data; and share this information across commands services and agencies to promote shared situational awareness. DCGS-N Increment 2 consists of two releases. The first release provides an enhanced Navy ISR enterprise that converges and builds on the DCGS-N Increment 1 and Maritime Domain Awareness Enterprise Nodes; leverages the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) framework; federates ISR and Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) workflow and production improving throughput through automation; exploits new and evolving sensors; provides Multi-INT cross-queuing and provides modulat tools accessible via a web browser. The second release enhances afloat ISR capabilities by providing a set of software centric tools hosted on the Consolidated Afloat Network and Enterprise Services (CANES) providing Multi-INT fusion and analysis behavior prediction and intelligent knowledge management designed to operate in disconnected or denied comms environment.The FY13 DCGS-N Increment 1 effort will focus on completing its Development Testing and Operational Assessment (DT/OA) in preparation for the DCGS-N Block 2 Limited Deployment Decision (LDD) and Follow-On Test and Evaluation (FOT&E). The JSIPS-N/JSLEP Legacy capability will continue to be replaced by DCGS-N Increment 1.The FY13 DCGS-N Increment 2 effort begins with final preparation for a Build Decision at Milestone B (MS B). The Capability Development Document (CDD) is expected to complete Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) review the Service Cost Position (SCP) will be established and the independent cost estimate completed. DCGS-N Increment 2 will have a Build Decision/MS B review which will approve the release of the Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) Request For Proposal (RFP) which will lead to a contract award in FY2014.","Continuing","Continuing","",

Specific programs such as Distributed Common Ground System - Navy (DCGS-N) Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M) Naval Tactical Command Support System (NTCSS) and Undersea Warfare Decision Support System (USW-DSS) are dependent on the CANES Common Computing Environment (CCE) to field host and sustain their capability because they no longer provide their own hardware. CANES requires that Automated Digital Network System (ADNS)field prior to or concurrently with CANES due to architectural reliance between the two programs.    CANES will field on a rolling four year hardware baseline and a two year software baseline. CANES is based on the overarching concept of reducing the number of afloat networks and providing enhanced efficiency through a single engineering focus on integrated technical solutions. This will allow for streamlined acquisition contracting test events and significant lifecycle efficiencies through consolidation of multiple current configuration management baselines logistics and training efforts into a unified support structure.  CANES Military Intelligence Program (MIP) related funding under PE 0303238N investment ends in FY 2012.  MIP requirements transition to PE 0303138N beginning in FY 2013.","0.000","15.936","",

This effort also increases overall combat effectiveness by leveraging capabilities and information from all partners and reducing the possibility of fratricide.  These coalition information sharing systems are in direct support of the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) strategic goals to “Win our Nation’s Wars” and “Deter conflict and promote security”.  In addition they are aligned with DISA’s strategy to “accelerate operational effectiveness and efficiency” and “enable sharing of information while staunchly defending it.”  The MNIS program currently supports five Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with connectivity in 89 nations and North America Treaty Organization (NATO) 11 Bilateral agreements and 150 sites with in excess of 80000 users worldwide.  The MNIS also evaluates new technologies and develops tactics techniques and procedures that facilitate the transition of technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability enhancements.  This is accomplished through the Combined Federated Battle laboratory Network (CFBLNet) and is in direct support of both CENTRIXS and Pegasus.  As a planned improvement to the CENTRIXS coalition network Common Mission Network Transport (CMNT) will provide a distinct and permanent CMNT backbone capabilities; thus enabling NETOPS centers to manage individual networks more efficiently.  CMNT provides a common transport for encrypted traffic to meet mission partner communication requirements and establishes a “black core capable” network to facilitate the movement of Virtual Private Network traffic between segments.  This capability supports DoD instruction 8110.1 guidance of integrating CENTRIXS and other operational networks into existing DoD general service communications infrastructure as a separate network servicing all DoD MNIS requirements.

The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels regardless of service component to operate as one system.The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network robotic and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability lethality and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are:  (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible robust and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  The Maritime Systems project will identify develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Naval forces play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.","","","",

This program ensures that the Department of Defense (DoD) delivers innovative solutions to meet DoD and national security challenges.  NDEP addresses the DoD’s need for STEM talent and develops the current and future workforce to strengthen the Department’s scientific and technological capabilities.  NDEP’s focus is to develop a continuum of high quality experiential STEM engagements for DoD from K-12 students through world-class researchers. NDEP consists of three components: a) Science Mathematics and Research for Transformation (SMART); b) the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF); and c) K-12.SMART awards highly competitive scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 STEM disciplines and moves them directly into DoD's workforce following graduation.  Since its inception as a pilot program in 2005 SMART has supported ~1150 students from bachelor to doctoral levels and ~380 have transitioned into the workforce.  SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of newly educated and high caliber U.S. technical talent ready to fulfill its mission.  NSSEFF supports 29 world-class researchers (NSSEFF Fellows) in areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the proliferation of future and exceptional talent.  Approximately 100 undergraduate students ~200 graduate students and ~100 post-doctoral scholars at academic institutions work with the NSSEFF Fellows.  Three cohorts of NSSEFF Fellows with the first selected in 2008 have provided critical connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise.  Fellows’ work spans all seven DoD Science and Technology (S&T) priorities and the six high interest basic science areas often in cutting-edge areas at the intersection of these areas.NDEP K-12 leverages the DoD’s STEM expertise as one of its most valuable assets creating engagement opportunities for schools students teachers and public sector and industry partners with DoD subject matter experts (SMEs) especially in communities adjacent to DoD laboratories and bases.  Since 2007 NDEP K-12 has increased the number of DoD facilities that directly engage their local education communities to: 1) build student interest in STEM fields and disciplines and in careers specific to the Department 2) develop science engineering and mathematics skills important to the DoD and 3) fulfill DoD’s future demand for highly skilled STEM professionals.  Through after-school learning opportunities DoD STEM professionals teach key audiences about DoD’s current and future real-world S&T applications.  DoD STEM professionals also serve as role models mentors content experts and competition judges.","Continuing","Continuing","",

Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability readiness and safety and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD has been estimated at over 23 billion each year. The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010. (U) The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&L)) designated a Director Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies materials and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus technology development demonstration and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.  In FY 2009 the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities. (U) The Corrosion Prevention Control Integrated Product Team membership consists of both the equipment and infrastructure corrosion control experts from the Services the Joint Staff the Coast Guard and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  The Services are given project submission instructions evaluation procedures and selection criteria.  The CPC project selection board chaired by the Director Corrosion Policy and Oversight reviews the projects and makes recommendations to the USD(AT&L) for final approval.(U) The former DoD Corrosion Executive issued a policy letter that states: "Basic systems design materials and processes selection and intrinsic corrosion-prevention strategies establish the corrosion susceptibility of Defense material.  The early stages of acquisition provide our best opportunity to make effective trade-offs among the many competing design criteria. . ."  The Congress and former DoD Corrosion Executive made it clear that research and development into materials and methods to prevent or mitigate corrosion should receive high priority.  Since Congress has clearly established this program as one of its highest priorities and has reiterated its expectations regarding funding levels and methods our budget request is designed to reflect both fiscal realities of one or more on many proposed projects over the next five to ten years. These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of storage tanks and other mission support facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of electrical and avionics equipment.  Likewise an array of highly effective rapid cure coatings that are easy to apply and can forestall corrosion for many years on aircraft and ships are being developed.  Other vital projects being considered include sealants wash down systems sensors and prognostic technologies that have joint service applications and potential to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects over a wide range of systems.  The FY 2012 budget request will provide a critically needed resource to trigger even larger investment and cost avoidance.","Continuing","Continuing","",

JAWP often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine Organization Training Material Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.       JAWP resources underwrite a small dedicated staff of civilian military operation research analysts (currently hosted by the Institute for Defense Analysis - IDA).    Administered by the Joint Operations Support cell within OSD/AT&L the JAWP conducts an annual call for inputs from Combantant Command staffs elements  that formulate Capability Gap assessments and technology based initiatives .   Project selection is undertaken in consulatation  with the OSD staffs  serving AT&L and Policy and with lements of the Joint Staff. The balance of JWP resources are dedicated to direct support of  joint commands with analytic resources to translate capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements identification of candidate solutions via experimentation translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources dedicated to direct support joint commands provides analytic expertise not normally allocated via formal staffing billets.   In this activity JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.

Mid-air collisions are currently the #2 cause of fatalities in fighter/attack aircraft.The DSOC used a data-driven approach to identify and evaluate the most effective hardware and software technologies to be implemented to reduce preventable aviation mishaps. The DSOC task force surveyed existing programs and provided an assessment of the viability and advisability of future resource investments. These investments will fund hardware and software technology to prevent helicopters and fighter aircraft mishaps.Specifically this effort will develop and flight test an Automatic Air Collision Avoidance System (AACAS) suitable for use in the dynamic fighter air-to-air training environment.  This effort completes the design and flight test of an automatic air collision avoidance system in an F-16 test-bed with applicability to all modern fighters and potentially UASs.From FY 06 – FY 10 a team of automatic collision avoidance experts from AFRL NASA and Lockheed-Martin Aeronautics developed and flight tested the Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS).  Following a highly successful flight test this system is now undergoing operational integration in the F-16 F-22 and F-35 and is projected to prevent over 150 Class A mishaps over the lifespan of these aircraft saving the Department over $10B in replacement costs.  In FY 10 with funding directed by RMD 802 this same team began design work on the AACAS.   Design efforts are on track with simulation testing scheduled for early FY11. Collision avoidance was recommended for funding in FY 2010. The Secretary stated that we can not and should not tolerate the injuries costs and capability losses from preventable accidents.  In FY11 continuation of algorithm development and begin simulator testing.   In FY12 completion of simulator and flight testing.","Continuing","Continuing","R2Long",

The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) establishes a capabilities-based adaptive near real-time readiness information system for the DoD. This system is being designed to measure the readiness of military forces and supporting infrastructure to meet missions and goals assigned by the Secretary of Defense. DRRS also hosts information and applications used to support Joint Forces Command (JFCOM) Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and Strategic Command (STRATCOM) in their roles as the Joint Force Providers.The transformation of readiness reporting into a new comprehensive readiness system presents a number of significant challenges. First there are thousands of new potential reporting entities to include in DRRS such as Combatant Commands Joint Task Forces Services Active and Reserve component units installations depots ports and major elements of the industrial base. These entities must not only define and implement reporting based on specific readiness metrics but they must make their readiness status continuously available in near real time to DRRS. Second the current National Military Strategy (NMS) makes substantially more complex demands on readiness reporting. Instead of basing readiness on traditional MTW-based scenarios the NMS asks us to contemplate readiness for an entire range of operational forms and to design DRRS to assess global readiness impact based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements. Finally Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom sourcing challenges mean that force managers need applications that will query the entire Department for suitable available organizations to meet current needs. The need for these applications and the underlying data are a top priority for the DRRS project.The realization of DRRS requires integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that supports distributed collaborative and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment. The primary technical goal is the creation of a highly reliable and securely integrated readiness data environment to leverage and extend current readiness information systems. This system is based on intelligent agents dynamic databases semantic middleware and publish/subscribe concepts; providing a logically uniform view into the multiple databases and information sources that feed DRRS. Crucially through this type of advanced information environment we dramatically expand the range of readiness queries that DRRS can be able to handle. This environment supports a suite of analysis tools that allow users to explore the consequences of readiness deficiencies in terms of the ability to generate forces and assess transportation feasibility as it pertains to specific scenarios. These tools and tool suites harness the power of the information environment to make possible the kind of quick-turnaround excursion-driven readiness assessment that is at the heart of DRRS.","Continuing","Continuing","",

CWP projects accelerate the delivery of high-quality solutions to warfighter problems improve U.S. interoperability with its coalition partners and strengthen global partnerships.  Projects leverage foreign investments in technology and manpower to address Combatant Command (COCOM) requirements and support DoD RDT&E community undertakings.  CWP can also help program offices convert U.S.-only projects into coalition solutions with the expenses and benefits shared by the U.S. and international partners.  Current U.S. military strategy and the global security environment make coalition warfare and multinational operations fundamental features of the U.S. national security strategy.  Coalitions provide a broad-base of technological operational and logistical support for military operations and ease the U.S. financial and manpower burdens associated with meeting military goals and objectives.  In addition effective responses to global humanitarian disasters require broad international interagency civilian and non-governmental coordination.  As national defense budgets decline but threats to mutual security do not coalition operations will continue to grow in importance.  Despite decades of conducting multinational operations the United States and its partners continue to experience interoperability issues.  Shortcomings in areas such as C4ISR (command control communications and computers and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance) battlespace awareness and logistics reveal the complexities and challenges associated with multinational air land and sea campaigns and encumber warfighters’ abilities to effectively and safely complete missions.  Small investments in interoperability early in the research and development process can help avoid larger expenses related to adding coalition capability later in the development cycle.  Partner nations participate in CWP to the extent permitted by security considerations and when such partnering is advantageous to the U.S. government.","Continuing","Continuing","",

Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01 promulgate capabilities-based requirements and acquisition processes. The Joint System Architecture Development (JSAD) program enables collaborative efforts to achieve these goals. These efforts include providing support to conduct warfighting capability-based analysis; performing assessments of joint capability areas and joint integrating concepts; developing and supporting needed sets of system and system-related data; creating integrated roadmaps to support acquisition investment decisions; and performing assessments of major defense acquisition programs and major automated information systems in a capability area context.  Activities in the JSAD project are divided into three areas:  (1) capability-based analysis; (2) roadmaps; and (3) support tools and guidance. Capability-based analysis provides analysis of the different technology functionality and integration impacts of systems on warfighting capability.  Acquisition roadmaps guide systems development and associated investment plans.  JSAD support tools and guidance initiatives develop systems data and tools exploit modeling and simulation and architecture efforts to improve DoDs overall assessment capability.  These efforts guide the development and improve the testing and fielding of integrated systems of systems in order to achieve Joint mission capabilities.  The QDR also lays out the need for an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches. This means:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning  programming budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance management and execution levels.  To accomplish this direction there needs to be a focused  goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from systems acquisition to capabilities-based portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  Starting in FY 2008 this  program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above in order to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals.  The program is broken up into two  focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives) and consolidates work previously performed under various other Program Elements.","Continuing","Continuing","",

Due to the asymmetric nature of the threat environment it is increasingly imperative that the Nation take quick action to remain ahead of threats and progressively evolve our approach as those threats evolve.  In response to these needs  the AF and National Reconnaisance Office (NRO) formed a strategic partnership and leveraged a combination of Department of Defense (DoD) and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) resources in March 2008 to establish and execute the Space Protection Program (SPP); a joint enduring program to develop and execute an integrated protection approach for the Nation covering all defense intelligence civil commercial and allied space systems.  The SPP is a core protection competency that unifies and integrates AF NRO DoD and Intelligence Community (IC) activities to deliver strategic recommendations and options to senior leaders and inform their decisions on how best to protect our space systems and stay ahead of an increasingly sophisticated threat environment.The DoD/AF portion of this program is consolidated under a dedicated Program Element Code to: streamline DoD SPP activities under a single appropriation; clearly categorize/convey the DoD investment in SPP; and provide visibility/transparency to AF DoD Congress and other offices with equities in space protection.  A fully-functioning SPP effort allows for the active planning comprehensive analysis and timely delivery of products tools and recommendations to respond to threats against national security space effects and deliver independent and informed options to national leaders and system acquirers.  This includes the key element of providing Combatant Commanders (COCOM) a range of mitigation options which are cross-domain integrated and aimed at preserving space effects for warfighting missions.The FY13 President’s Budget request represents a minimum level required to operate and execute a synchronized and effective space protection effort for the Nation.  The FY13 request preserves the skill-set knowledge base and multi-organizational construct required to remain ahead of threats and to evolve programmatic direction and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) across multiple orbital regimes in a way that minimizes duplication and inefficiency.  To that end SPP will provide a central focus for unifying and integrating Title 10/50 roles and responsibilities (AF and NRO efforts) to deliver research analysis studies tools and capabilities necessary to identify prioritize and develop the most effective and economical recommendations for space protection options to preserve national space capabilities and guide/influence future requirements acquisitions Science and Technology (S&T) research and investment focus areas.  Specifically SPP’s FY13 efforts involve a diligent focus on identifying/defining threats determining National Security Space (NSS) vulnerabilities to clarify threat impacts and developing corresponding opportunities to reduce or altogether mitigate the threats.  This will involve dedicated protection program activities centered on Ops Engagement development/refinement of specific protection measures coming out of technical vulnerability assessments instituting key cyber initiatives for space protection completing the delivery/transition of the space capabilities and interdependencies database coordinating strategic space protection communication strategies and specific engagement in Indications & Warning (I&W) and Space Situational Awareness (SSA) architecture assessments/modeling.SPP's focus on Ops Engagement provides unique space protection analytic capabilities to support the COCOM's ability to prepare to operate in a degraded space environment; providing analyses of COCOM space dependencies vulnerabilities and consequence of loss and the ability to develop and test mitigation options for evaluation in COCOM exercises.  SPP will provide space protection subject matter experts and analysis to participate in all phases of crucial exercises and wargames; improving the validity of event and influencing future requirements acquisitions budgets and operations.  The program will then leverage the key conclusions and recommendations coming out of each of these events to develop recommended courses of action (COAs) such as those outlined in the WARNORD for Space Operations CONOPS Tactics Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) and strategic protection strategies (based on additional SPP research analysis and validation).  SPP intends to continue its efforts to deliver operational warfighting capabilities that attribute and defeat attacks on space systems through specific focused defense initiatives which maintain our inherent right of self defense in space and deny the benefit of attack to our adversaries.  The program also plans to expand its focus to include assessments of non-space related effects that would ensure the survivability of space assets and institute key defense initiatives to address vulnerabilities in multiple orbit regimes.  Cyber effects will become a larger focus of SPP and the program will focus on the delivery of tools and capabilities to the operational community within the DOD and the IC; further integrating cyberspace into the National Infrastructure Protection Framework.  SPP will make recommendations to improve and operationalize a limited set of cyber capabilities in 2013 and will continue to investigate other utilities and opportunities in the years that follow. SPP will continue to leverage resident space protection intelligence expertise to identify and anticipate threats to space systems.  Key efforts in this area include analysis and inputs to provide specific detailed direction to intelligence agencies on crucial intelligence data collection/analysis and providing comprehensive and accurate threat impact assessments.In coordination with NRO and AFSPC acquisition and requirements communities SPP will perform analyses and assessments to identify options to enhance the survivability and effectiveness of specific architectures.   SPP will work with the community to build integrated architectures for I&W and SSA in order to develop recommendations to support requirement development budget formulation and/or technical performance requirements across Title 10/50 organizations.This program is in Budget Activity 4 Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.","Continuing","Continuing","R2Long",

JPALS development includes an incremental approach employing a family of systems (FoS) to ensure joint allied coalition and Federal Aviation Administration/International Civil Aviation Organization interoperability.  On 16 March 2007 the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved the Capability Development Document (CDD) for the JPALS FoS and Increment 1 for the Sea-Based System and designated the Navy as the JPALS lead Department of Defense (DoD) Component.  On 19 January 2010 the JROC approved Increment 2 for the Land-Based System and designated the Air Force as the lead component for the Land-Based System.   JPALS is the next generation global positioning system (GPS)-based precision approach and landing system for the DoD.  It will replace several aging and obsolete aircraft landing systems with a FoS that will function in more operational environments and in a wide range of meteorological conditions.    Because a cornerstone of the JPALS implementation strategy is worldwide and civil interoperability JPALS must harmonize with US and International Civil Global Navigation Satellite Systems.  This is accomplished through participation in the development testing and implementation of international standards through the North American Treaty Organization (NATO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization.  Interoperability of the JPALS ground systems with all military and civil aircraft is a key aspect of the planned system.  Military aircraft must have worldwide access to civil and military airfields/air stations/operating locations in benign and hostile (GPS jamming) environments.  The JPALS Land-based Increment 2 system will provide a civil interoperable capability and also a military interoperable encrypted jam-resistant capability.  JPALS will close capability gaps identified in the Precision Approach and Landing Capability Initial Capabilities Document.  These gaps include: interoperability for naval aircraft landing at shore-based airfields operated by other services interoperability for Navy/Marine Corps and Army aircraft landing at civil airports and for the Civil Reserve Air Fleet landing at DoD airfields. FY13 efforts focus on MS B documentation preparation and source selection to support contract award.  A MS B is planned for May 2013 with source selection continuing through Jul 2013.  The Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract will be awarded in Aug 2013.

B-52 modernization is a comprehensive program to ensure B-52 viability to perform current and future wartime missions to include datalinks navigation sensors weapons and electronic warfare (EW) and training capabilities.  B-52 modernization (initiated in FY 2005) integrates and adds both tactical and global datalink communications for real time command and control targeting and intelligence.  It upgrades antiquated air traffic management (ATM) systems with those supported by three key functions using satellite technology:  Communications Navigation and Surveillance (CNS).  Modernization upgrades training devices to support aircrew and maintenance training with the latest B-52 capability.  In addition modernization improves conventional warfare capability with additional MIL-STD-1760 smart weapons and improved weapons carriage and fully integrates advanced targeting pods with the offensive avionics system.  B-52 modernization upgrades or replaces legacy defensive EW systems to include the radar warning receiver jammers chaff and flare dispensers and situational awareness displays as well as integration of offensive EW such as the Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) and MALD-Jammer (MALD-J).   Lastly B-52 Modernization replaces the current aging strategic radar capability with a state-of-the-art non-developmental radar.CONECT The B-52 Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) acquisition program supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with tactical datalink and voice communications capabilities along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. The CONECT upgrade includes new multi-functional color displays (MFCDs) and a digital interphone system which will survive and function through the nuclear environment to enhance crew interaction and situational awareness. To enable net centric operations the CONECT upgrade integrates:  on-board client/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions;  UHF Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability via ARC-210 Warrior radio to exchange J-Series messaging within theater; Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR); limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link supporting e-mail and file transfers; and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink to significantly enhance close air support (CAS) missions. This integrated suite will provide the B-52 fleet with a machine-to-machine data transfer capability supporting aircraft re-tasking and re-targeting of Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM) Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile/JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM/JASSM-ER) and other J-series weapons across the range of B-52 military operations and missions. In FY13 the CONECT program will be restructured and reduced to only replacing the current Multi-Function Displays (MFD’s) located at each of the crew stations making the temporary Evolutionary Data Link (EDL) modification permanent and demoding the CONECT test aircraft as required.  However the current CONECT development effort in FY12 will be completed as planned and the technical design/baseline will be maintained in support of future budget decisions.As the remaining requirement of the CONECT program restructure the Multi-Function Display (MFD) Replacement will develop wire-harnesses and installation tray configurations for the MFDs in each of the 76 B-52 aircraft.  The existing legacy displays at each crew station will be removed and replaced with stock listed MFDs.  This effort will replace the current MFDs due to long standing obsolescence issues.  This configuration WILL NOT provide additional capability beyond what is currently available but will retain growth potential for future upgrades.Evolutionary Data Link (EDL) was intended a bridge program to provide a secure voice/datalink capability between ground combat personnel and the B-52 weapon system providing situational awareness of where friendly forces are in relation to enemy forces during targeting efforts while using precision guided weapons in combat.  Originally fielded as a T1 Modification the EDL 3.1 program will be finalized as a permanent modification which entails procurement of sufficient Group B kits to modify the remainder of the fleet along with procurement of spares and a long-term maintenance strategy with sufficient cover through the end of the aircraft's life cycle.  Additional full-up kits will also be required to modify aircrew and ground maintenance trainers.  Technical orders operational procedure directives and drawings will need to be generated from existing temporary documents.  No additional certification testing (DT/OT) is anticipated as at the end of EDL 3.1 fielding the program office will consider this a fielded operational system.B-52 EHF The B-52 Extremely High Frequency (EHF) program integrates and installs the B-52 fleet with the equipment needed to provide secure survivable two-way EHF SATCOM link for Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) and report-backs to meet Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) nuclear protected Information Exchange Requirements (IERs). The B-52 EHF will install/integrate the Family of Advanced Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Terminal (FAB-T) Airborne Wideband Terminal system developed and procured by Space and Missile Center (SMC) through PE 0303601F or other equivalent terminals/solutions as necessary to meet user requirements.  The B-52 EHF will also integrate a high data rate BLOS communication link supporting IP-based Global Information Grid (GIG) interoperability into the B-52 architecture. The B-52 EHF program is planned to be accomplished in two increments. Increment 1 preserves the existing B-52 capability to receive EAMs and report-backs via SATCOM to include an Environmental Control System (ECS) modification required to support the additional communication equipment.  Increment 2 provides GIG and net-ready capability as well as full integration with other-B-52 systems.The B-52 EHF program will be terminated in FY13 for higher AF priorities. TRAINERS AND UPGRADES FOR CONECT EHF & SR2  In order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration the CONECT EHF & SR2 programs will update existing trainers or use computer-based training to add CONECT EHF & SR2 functionality to meet user-training requirements and establish a system integration laboratory (SIL) for updates of the Weapon System Trainers (WST).  The Trainer and upgrades for CONECT EHF and SR2 will be terminated in FY13 for higher AF priorities.SR2  The B-52 Strategic Radar Replacement (SR2) program replaces the current AN/APQ-166 Strategic Radar fielded in the 1960s and then upgraded in the 1970s and 1980s.  Although modified several times it has never been totally replaced and several parts of the system remain from the original design such as the antenna reflector feed and casting.  The legacy APQ-166 radar is becoming unsupportable with increasing signs of performance degradation and multiple DMS and materiel shortage issues. The SR2 program is a radar replacement program that may take advantage of the advanced capabilities of modern non-developmental radars maximizing commonality with other platforms.  The B-52 SR2 Program will integrate test and field a modern radar system which supports all weather targeting and navigation to support the requirements of keeping the B-52 combat capable for its extended service life.  Additionally the remaining two legacy MFCDs will be upgraded to take advantage of the replacement radar's full capability.The B-52 SR2 program will be terminated in FY13 for higher AF priorities.     ENGINEERING STUDIES & ANALYSIS AND TEST & EVALUATION  B-52 modernization funds test activities at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) engineering and planning studies for potential future weapon system enhancements (weapons sensors avionics and EW) and emerging requirement on current programs upgrades to the B-52 SIL AISF and WSTs and weapon system operational/safety supportability reliability and Total Ownership Cost (TOC) improvements.ARMS CONTROL ACTIVITIESArms Control Activities under the New START Treaty drives the need to modify a number of B-52s to a conventional only role by removing the Code Enable Switch and associated equipment.  This effort requires a complete design to remove the equipment from the aircraft and install metal plates prohibiting reinstallation of removed equipment to comply with treaty protocols.ADDITIONAL EFFORTS  B-52 modernization funds additional efforts that stem from the operation and maintenance of a 50-plus-year-old aircraft such as parts obsolescence DMS and emerging requirements to add to or maintain the existing capabilities.  Examples include but are not limited to upgrades to outdated avionics computers mission planning interfaces to JMPS Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS) and other mission planning systems (JMPS) upgrades to the EW suite and studies and analysis.  All B-52 development programs support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases.    This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","Continuing","Continuing","",

The modernization program addresses potential aircraft obsolescent issues due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and provides new and improved capabilities to the B-1B weapon system that require significant hardware and software development and testing. Vertical Situational Display Upgrade (VSDU) development effort is currently addressing reliability and maintainability issues with the primary flight displays which are quickly becoming unsupportable due to DMS for repair parts. B-1B improvement efforts include but are not limited to the development of the Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL) and Self Contained Standby Attitude Indicator (SCAI).  Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL) will provide Link 16 line of sight (LOS) and Joint Range Extension (JRE) beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) data link capability and supports machine-to-machine transfer of target data to the B-1.  SCAI is the backup to the primary flight instruments and provides indications of attitude airspeed mach altitude and vertical velocity. This development activity will replace the current obsolete legacy SCAI with a more reliable/supportable off-the-shelf display.  SCAI must be functional and reliable in the event of primary flight display failure and is a Mission-Essential Subsystem List (MESL) item required for flight.

TACP members deploy with Army maneuver units and provide a Command and Control (C2) link for Close Air Support (CAS) airlift and Air Force surveillance/reconnaissance missions.  TACP’s are equipped with various targeting and communication equipment which interfaces with ground maneuver forces CAS aircraft Joint Fires assets C2 aircraft/agencies and Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms/agencies.  Throughout the performance of their duties TACP’s detect targets and compute precision coordinates to aircraft to ensure pilots track the correct target in the employment of GPS aided weapons.  The actions performed by TACPs not only shorten the kill chain but also reduces the potential for fratricide and collateral damage in civilian-occupied areas.  The TACP-M program provides equipment modernization capabilities to TACP Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) and Tactical Operations Center (TOCs) personnel. The program supports the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and significantly increased the mission effectiveness of the TACPs and ASOCs during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New Dawn.  The TACP-M program continues to be instrumental in providing ground communications for TACPs during federal emergency relief operations and Homeland Defense initiatives.The purpose of the TACP-M program is to reduce reliance on voice transmission and replace analog equipment with the latest digital data link and streaming video (e.g. Streaming Video Receiver) technology.  Upgraded digital communications enable machine-to-machine interface between TACPs and Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft Army units and other TACP units.  Machine-to-machine communication provides reliable high speed digital communications ultimately supports joint and multinational interoperability improves battlefield Situational Awareness (SA) increases targeting accuracy reduces kill chain decision time improves data flows/information exchange and reduces potential fratricide. TACPs use Software Communication Architecture (SCA)-certified Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) software programmable radios and ancillary components for reliable voice & data UHF SATCOM and LOS UHF /VHF communications.  TACP-M is divided into three segments:  Software Dismounted and Mounted. The Mounted segement is further divided into Fixed and Mobile elements. The Software segment utilizes a common Close Air Support System Software(CASS) baseline across all TACP systems.  The CASS software major thrust provides cross-service interoperability with numerous aircraft (A-10 F-16 F/A-18 etc) helicopters unmanned air vehicles (Predator) land and naval artillery network enabled weapons command & control nodes and communications systems utilizing numerous messaging systems (such as Variable Message Format (VMF) Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) and Link-16 to provide maximum flexibility and capability to the TACP for the execution of joint fires support mission. FY13 funding associated with the software segement will support the CASS major thrust. The Dismounted segment consists of integrated man-portable systems procured via streamlined acquisition using non-developmental and off-the-shelf (OTS) components which is carried by dismounted airman. These include laser rangefinders thermal imagers laser designators man-pack and handheld radios ruggedized tactical computers streaming video receivers and other required equipment. The dismounted segment also incorporates the development of an advanced Target Location Designation System (TLDS) which is also being managed under the Army-led Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS) program.  TLDS will combine the capability of a laser marker designator and thermal imagers into a small lightweight system. FY13 funding will continue to support this major thrust and focus on the development of TLDS within the JETS program.The mounted (Fixed) segment integrates computer and communications equipment into re-locatable vehicle rack or transit case mounted systems for use in Tactical Operations Center (TOC) or Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) locations.  The TACP mounted (Fixed) segment includes the High Mobility Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV)-mounted Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) Gateway Gateway Lite and the Dismounted Communications Package (DCP).  The TACP Mounted (Mobile) segment integrates similar equipment into mobile tactical vehicles employed by the Army and provides on-the-move tactical voice and data capability.  Prior to FY12 the major thrust associated with the mounted segment of TACP-M was the Vehicular Communication System (VCS).  This thrust focused on placing a TACP equipment suite into a HMMWV. In September 2010 the AF decided not to pursue production of the large HMMWV-Mounted VCS system due to survivability issues related to the current theaters of operations and cancelled the program in early 2011.  However the requirement capability to conduct robust communications in both tactical operations center locations and on-the-move in tactical vehicles remains. The Air Force is now engaged in the JCIDS process and focused on a Capability Development Document to address these capability gaps.  FY13 the VCS thrust is renamed Moblie Communication Capability (MCC) and funding will be used to conduct studies and risk reduction activities for TACP mounted communications systems for fixed and vehicular platforms.Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipated production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","Continuing","Continuing","R2Long",

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises the combatant commands the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.This PE is organized into nine activities which are represented as seven Expeditionary Warfighting Capability Areas as well as Future Concepts Technology Assessment and Roadmapping and the Littoral Combat/Power Projection (LC/PP) FNC.  The primary objective of this PE is to develop and demonstrate the technologies needed to meet the Marine Corps' unique responsibility of training and equipping the Marine Air/Ground Task Force (MAGTF) for Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  In the post-September 11 world irregular warfare (IW) has emerged as the dominant form of warfare confronting the United States its allies and its partners; accordingly this PE has been structured to account for distributed long-duration operations including unconventional warfare counterterrorism counterinsurgency and stabilization and reconstruction operations.  IW emphasizes the use of indirect non-conventional methods and means to subvert attrite and exhaust an adversary or render irrelevant rather than defeat him through direct conventional military confrontation.   IW in now institutionalized in the Marine Corps' planning investment and capability development.  This PE provides the knowledge base to support Advanced Technology Development (6.3) and is the technology base for future expeditionary warfare capabilities.  This PE supports the Expeditionary Force Development System of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) and responds directly to the Marine Corps Science and Technology (S&T) process as well as supporting related Littoral and Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare capabilities developed by the Navy's Mission Capability Program.  The Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly.  The FNC program explores and demonstrates technologies that enable Sea Strike Sea Shield Sea Basing FORCEnet and Force Health Protection pillars Space Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and the Enterprise and Platform Enablers.  The FNC program is composed of Enabling Capabilities (ECs) which develop and deliver quantifiable products (i.e. prototype systems knowledge products and technology improvements) in response to validated requirements for insertion into acquisition programs of record after meeting agreed upon exit criteria within five years. The core 6.2 program also supports Discovery and Invention (D&I) and Innovation and Transformation (I&T).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap this investment will achieve key transformational capabilities required by the Sea Power 21 Pillars as well as enable Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM) Persistent Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).Due to the number of efforts in this PE the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.","Continuing","Continuing","",

An effective and robust integration of commercial and military technologies can reduce costs and improve naval capabilities by keeping pace with the fast moving changes in technologies and operational needs. The RTT program is comprised of three elements: The Rapid Technology Transition (RTT) program the Technology Insertion Program for Savings (TIPS) and the Rapid Development and Deployment (RDD) program. The RTT and TIPS programs are structured to bring transition deals to closure quickly and to provide execution year funding for a rapid start bridging the gap until the program of record can fund the completion of the technology insertion. The RDD program is structured to quickly develop a prototype solution that will be deployed in theater for Naval forces engaged in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).The mission of the RTT program is to increase the rate that new innovative and potentially disruptive technologies are inserted into Department of Navy (DON) acquisition programs and the hands of the warfighter. The mission of the TIPS program is to increase the rate that new cutting edge technologies are inserted into DON acquisition programs in order to significantly reduce operations and maintenance support costs.The RDD program provides for the rapid development and fielding of prototype solutions to meet urgent operational needs. The RDD process applies when existing DON processes cannot meet urgent operational needs. Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) have generated rapidly evolving military needs that require responsive materiel solutions. Rapid transition opportunities occur when a sufficiently mature technology is identified that can meet a particular need on a timetable which matches that of an acquisition program and is supported by a business case which justifies the associated cost and schedule risk. The combination of circumstances which create such opportunities can appear and disappear well inside the Program Objectives Memorandum (POM) cycle. These programs are designed to be proactive in identifying opportunities and to work with resource sponsors fleet and force users and Program Managers (PMs) in constructing viable technology transition deals one at a time. To ensure the widest possible awareness of emergent commercial technology opportunities these programs interact with the industry and coordinate closely with Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) to maintain awareness of insertion opportunities. Utilizing existing authorities RTT applies execution year funds where necessary to "jump-start" transitions so they can be inserted and validated by Sea Trial experiments leading directly to deployment and/or demonstrations of high risk/high payoff technologies. This Program Element is the only Navy program that addresses current urgent requirements that are required by the fleet within a 18-24 month period. As such planning and execution are accomplished within the same fiscal year which causes a non-traditional financial execution profile for the program. The program therefore does not meet traditional execution benchmarks.","Continuing","Continuing","",

PEMA is a portable device utilized by maintainers with the implementation of digital maintenance capabilities (digital publications Integrated Electronic Technical Manuals(IETMs) Internet Protocol (IP) based data uploads BInary digiT (BIT) data downloads automated diagnostics and planeside NALCOMIS).  PEMAs are a mandatory display device supporting modern day Automated Maintenance Environment (AME) implemented for weapon systems.  Marine Aviation Logistics Support Program II (MALSP II) Expeditionary Pack up Kit (EPUK):  Funding supports the evaluation development testing and integration of software and hardware solutions for expeditionary requisitioning and supply chain management across all US Marine Corp Aviation activities.  Marine Aviation Logistics is changing to MALSP II to meet current and future operational requirements - in support of the NAE Strategic Plan Marine Corps Vision & Strategy 2025 and the USMC Long War Concept.  MALSP II will allow aviation logisticians to decrease total infrastructure and resource inventories forward by moving the preponderance of the Maintenance and Supply workload to the CONUS Parent MALS and reducing the total forward Aviation Logistics footprint (personnel equipment facilities and spares).  EPUK as part of Marine Aviation Logistics Enterprise IT (MAL-EIT) system is an automated wireless hardware / software solution that is a key enabler in integrating US Marine Corp Aviation Combat Element (ACE) and Logistics Combat Element (LCE) logistics systems to make the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) more responsive agile flexible and lethal with the ability to support and sustain operations in austere expeditionary environments and across the Range of Military Operations (ROMO).3185 Joint Air Logistics Information System (JALIS) - A critical element of the DoD CONUS and OCONUS Air Logistics assets.  JALIS is an operational scheduling aircraft management and data analysis system that allows DoD organizations to submit airlift requirements for passengers and cargo; air logistics flying units to communicate their aircraft availability in a real time graphic display; and designated scheduling organizations to compare airlift requirements to available aircraft and create mission assignments.9406 Maintenance Data Warehouse/NAVAIR DECKPLATE - The development of the Decision Knowledge Programming for Logistics Analysis and Technical Evaluation (DECKPLATE) program is the next generation data warehouse for aircraft maintenance flight and usage data.  It provides a web-based interface to a single source of information currently being stored in multiple Naval Aviation Logistics Data Analysis (NALDA) systems.  Through the use of analysis query and reporting tools the user has the capabilities to effectively obtain readiness data in a near real-time environment as well as historical data for trend analysis and records reconstruction.  DECKPLATE supports the mission of the warfighter who requires a single source of near real-time aviation data in which to base critical readiness decisions.  This requires collecting data from authoritative sources into a data warehouse.  Because the warfighter only needs to access one database the time consuming task of collecting various pieces of data form various sources will be reduced and ultimately eliminated.  This improves data quality because it reduces the possibility of two systems providing identical data elements but slightly different data.  Data availability is improved through continuous near real-time feeds from the data sources giving the warfighter the most current information to base decisions.  In addition this also accomplishes a reduction in legacy systems mandated by OPNAV.","Continuing","Continuing","",

This PE also supports the Congressionally mandated Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E) program for new ship designs.Contract Design has traditionally been the engineering development of the technical and contractual definition of the ship design (including ship specifications and drawings) to a level of detail sufficient for shipbuilders to make a sound estimate of the construction cost and schedule. Additionally the contract design package developed under this PE has provided the technical baseline from which the Navy selects the shipbuilder who then develops the detail design package required to support the construction and eventual delivery of the ship. This PE also supports the development of design methodologies/tools which facilitate and optimize the transition from ship design documents to efficient production of new ships and ship conversions and supports engineering planning and ship affordability studies.Under Acquisition Reform for new design ships traditional distinct phasing of the design process has been replaced with a continuous concurrent engineering Integrated Product and Process Development (IPPD) process extending through and after contract award. This serves to maintain the focus of multi-discipline teams consisting of the governmentshipbuilder system programs and suppliers. Government/Industry Integrated Product Team(s) (IPTs) will utilize the IPPD process to develop the design in an Integrated Product and Data Environment (IPDE). The design approach is part of an acquisition strategy that is based on commercial practices and incorporates a phased technical definition.","Continuing","Continuing","",

JSOW will enhance aircraft survivability as compared to current interdiction weapon systems by providing the capability for launch aircraft to standoff outside the range of most target area surface-to-air threat systems.  The JSOW launch-and-leave capability will allow several target kills per aircraft sortie.  The JSOW program first developed a baseline weapon for use against fixed area targets.  JSOW is a Navy-led joint Navy/Air Force program.The JSOW Baseline (AGM-154A) variant includes a kinematically efficient airframe an integrated Inertial/Global Positioning System navigation capability and a BLU-97/B or BLU-111 payload. This weapon was designed up front for pre-planned product improvements.  Procurement of JSOW-A in the FYDP is deferred pending a fix to the Unexploded Ordnance  issue or a change in the inventory levels.  The JSOW BLU-108 (AGM-154B) variant incorporates the Sensor Fuze Weapon submunition (BLU-108) into the baseline vehicle.  Planned production of the JSOW/BLU-108 is deferred pending a change in the threat.  The JSOW Unitary (AGM-154C) variant has a terminal seeker Autonomous Target Acquisition capability and a Broach lethal package to enable the attack of blast/fragmentation and penetration type targets.  The JSOW Unitary provides increased accuracy and lethality and the capability for aimpoint selection.  Operational Testing of the JSOW-C was successfully completed in December 2004.  Approval for Milestone-III/Full Rate Production was granted on 20 December 2004.  JSOW-C Initial Operational Capability was achieved in February 2005.FY 2011-2013 includes funding for development integration qualification and follow-on developmental and operational test and evaluation of a Network Enabled Weapon moving maritime target capability into the JSOW Unitary weapon (AGM-154C-1). The moving maritime target capability is currently being integrated as an Engineering Change Proposal beginning with FY 2009 procured JSOW-C weapons.  The new AGM-154C-1 capability will enable the weapon to be integrated with the network and attack sea moving maritime targets via real-time pre-and post-launch targeting updates. JSOW will continue to conduct analysis and development of solutions to system integration challenges and continual enhancement of warfighter effectiveness in the employment of the JSOW weapon system. In addition FY 2011-2013 includes funding to integrate new functionality of the Common Unique Planning Component into the Joint Mission Planning Systems and Precision Guided Munitions Planning System.   JSOW utilizes a "common truck" for both AGM-154A and AGM-154C variants.  Through adherence to international standards for weapons interfaces weight and dimension considerations JSOW is compatible with Air Force and NATO aircraft.","3.000","30.276","",

DoD users of these services work in a diverse variety of science and technology areas including structural mechanics fluid dynamics material science chemistry biology electromagnetics and acoustics weather ocean modeling signal/image processing forces modeling and simulation environmental quality electronics/networking/systems/C4I and space and astrophysical sciences.  The computational expertise and resources (massively parallel networked multi-core computers advanced software applications and secure connectivity) provided by this Program enable DoD researchers and engineers to analyze complex problems and phenomena and develop novel solutions using state-of-the-art physics-based and discrete event simulations.  The combined capabilities of the HPC centers and the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) enable massive calculations to be completed more efficiently and at reduced cost than if each DoD research organization were to duplicate the necessary resources. For example DoD personnel use High Performance Modernization Program (HPCMP) resources to do such things as improve the performance of manned and unmanned aircraft validate design concepts and establish expected performance of new armor and penetrator designs speed the development of new ship designs and demonstrate the viability of weapons systems performance. The HPCMP supports the requirements of DoD scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) and support for software applications. Dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) augment the DSRCs to form the total HPCMP computational capability. In 2011 the HPCMP provided approximately 1.4 billion processor hours to a user community representing requirements from all three services and the agencies of the DoD. The bulk of this capability is provided via 14 supercomputers (including systems for classified processing) located in the 5 DSRCs across the country providing a total of approximately 180000 processors and 1.8 quadrillion floating point operations per second (1.8 petaFLOPS). DoD users store their results in 16 petabytes (16000000000000 bytes) of storage archival distributed across the centers and duplicated for backup (for a total storage capability of 32 petabytes). The DREN interconnects HPCMP resources and users nationwide via a research infrastructure that provides an aggregate network capacity of 25 billion bits per second to 36 user sites 5 DSRCs and 4 smaller affiliated resource centers (ARCs). Individual user site speeds range from 45 to 622 million bits per second ARC speeds range from 155 to 2488 million bits per second and DSRC speeds range from 622 to 3110 million bits per second. Mission-critical DoD applications across the spectrum of DoD activities are supported by the software component of the Program through training in advanced computational methods the development of productive application development environments tools and methodologies and through the direct provision of computational scientists and engineers to improve the performance accuracy and relevance of physics-based computational models.The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.The HPCMP transferred from the Office Secretary of Defense to the Department of the Army in FY12.","","","",

The AIAMD Program represents a shift from a traditional system-centric weapon systems acquisition to a component-based acquisition. This component-based acquisition will provide the most efficient way to acquire and integrate the components of the incremental AIAMD architecture. Unlike traditional acquisition programs that focus primarily on the development of a single system or platform the AIAMD Program is structured to enable the development of an overarching system-of-systems capability with participating Air and Missile Defense (AMD) components functioning interdependently to provide total operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems. The AIAMD Program achieves this objective by establishing the incremental AIAMD architecture and developing the following products:  the IBCS the Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) and the Plug & Fight (P&F) Interface kits. The IBCS provides common Army IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) Engagement Operations Center (EOC) that replaces seven current weapon system unique Battle Management Command Control Communications Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) components in an AMD Battalion.  The IFCN provides fire control connectivity and enabling distributed operations. A P&F Interface kit enables the multiple sensor and weapon components for netted operations. AIAMD has been designated as the Army's Pathfinder for the development of a Joint Track Management Capability. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) directed restructuring the AIAMD program to include AIAMD capability in the following systems: Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Air and Missile Defense Brigades (ADA Bde) Air and Missile Defense Commands (AAMDC) Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) within IFPC/Avenger Composite Battalions and Air Defense and Airspace Management (ADAM) cells. The restructured program will include two Product Improvements. Product Improvement 1 will include placing Phased Array Tracking to Intercept of Target (PATRIOT) components directly on the Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) and employing a common set of C2 tools across Air Defense Artillery (ADA) formations with a First Unit Equipped (FUE) in FY 2019. Product Improvement 2 will integrate THAAD on the IFCN. An IBCS Critical Design Review (CDR) is planned for second quarter FY 2012 along with the contributing programs CDRs. AIAMD CDR is scheduled for third quarter FY 2012. The IBCS prototype is scheduled for delivery to the Government System Integration Laboratory (GSIL) in February FY 2012.

This program element supports the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) of medical and non-medical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Projects within BA5 are structured to consolidate Joint and Service-unique tasks within four commodity areas: contamination avoidance individual and collective force protection decontamination and medical countermeasures.  This consolidation provides for development and operational testing of equipment for Joint Service use and for Service-unique requirements.  Contamination avoidance efforts under this system development program will provide U.S. forces with real-time hazard assessment capabilities.  They include multi-agent point and remove chemical detection for ground aircraft and shipboard applications; automated warning and reporting systems; integrated radiation detection and monitoring equipment; and enhanced battlefield reconnaissance capabilities.  Force protection efforts will increase protection levels while decreasing physical and psychological burdens imposed by protective equipment.  The DoD Biological Defense mission requires the detection of validated biological threat agents to provide early warning capabilities on mobile and fixed platforms.  This program element will provide theater protection through the development of point and stand-off detection systems.  The detection system concept will provide detection identification warning and sample collection for verification that a biological agent attack has occurred.  The Secretary of Defense is responsible for research development acquisition and deployment of medical countermeasure equipment and materiel to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD unlike those developed to support U.S. population must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasizes prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this SDD such as vaccines and chemical prophylaxis conserves fighting strength decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation and satisfy the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available efforts on this SDD support pre-hospitalization treatment en-route care hospital care and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include CB diagnostics and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic threats and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  DoD is the only Federal activity conducting SDD on these prophylactic therapeutic and rapid identification and diagnostic CB medical countermeasures.  The Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  This Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process ("One Portfolio").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research development acquisition and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces it also accelerate and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research development and acquisition because of its unique facilities testing capabilities and trained and experienced personnel.  The projects in this program element support efforts in the engineering and manufacturing phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 5.","Continuing","Continuing","",

The PTSS is designed to be an integrated part of the BMDS: one that receives cues from all acquisition sensors and provides outputs to the BMDS battle manager & missile systems. The program mitigates cost schedule and performance risk by: 1) simplifying the design by focusing on the BMDS mission 2) incorporating components and subsystems with high technology readiness levels and on-orbit pedigrees and 3) involving industry and the military services up front & early to inform the design for producibility operations and sustainment. The PTSS has inherent capability for other missions such as Space Situational Awareness. The agency expects that capability to be exploited by the joint warfighter when the PTSS is not engaged in a missile defense mission. The Combatant Commands and Services have a need for a persistent ability to provide fire-control quality tracking of a raid of ballistic missiles over their entire trajectory for both homeland and regional defense scenarios specifically improve birth-to-death tracking identification and targeting including the capability to detect track discriminate and counter large dense raids and structured attacks. Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) systems acquire and track the boost and early post-boost phases of a missile`s trajectory but the PTSS is required to continue to track ballistic missiles through their accent apogee and until they reenter into the earth`s atmosphere. Goals and objectives for the PTSS are: 	-Develop an operational missile tracking capability from space which will close the BMDS fire control loop specifically the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and Ground Based Interceptor weapon systems by way of the BMDS battle manager. 	-Reduce operational fire control risk by co-locating the national lab design teams for PTSS and Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and by embedding US Navy and US Air Force operations and sustainment experts in the PTSS hybrid program office. 	-Focus on tracking raids of regional Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missiles and Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles from today`s regional threats. 	-Develop and test the developmental satellite articles and the integrated ground system with the BMDS. 	-Ensure early industry involvement by awarding contracts to join the Integrated Systems Engineering Team (ISET) during the developmental satellite article design. Six Industry partners (Ball Boeing Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman Orbital and Raytheon) contribute to the national lab development effort to improve the Precision Tracking Space System design for manufacturability and reduce the production risk. 	-Use data from the on-orbit Space Tracking & Surveillance System (STSS) demonstration satellite testing events 	-Benchmark models and simulations. 	-Allocate requirements interface controls and evaluate operations concepts. 	-Leverage experience gained from STSS test events to demonstrate capability and insight into Command Control Communication Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance linkages and hand off to the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense fire control system. 	-Develop a government owned design to foster production competition over the life of the program.The Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS) contributes to defense of the U.S. Homeland and regional missile defense including large raid protection. MD40 consists of Program-Wide Support (PWS) non-headquarters management costs in support of MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).","Continuing","Continuing","",

These Joint C2 activities include GCCS-J Joint Planning and Execution Services (JPES) and the support to the development and sustainment of the Joint C2 architecture.  GCCS-J.  The GCCS-J suite of mission applications/systems provides critical joint warfighting C2 capabilities by presenting an integrated near real-time picture of the battle space for planning and execution of joint military and multinational operations.  GCCS-J is used by all nine combatant commands (COCOMs) at sites around the world supporting joint and coalition operations.  Additionally through the continued evolution of the GCCS Family of Systems (FoS) the Services are also utilizing components of the GCCS-J infrastructure to build their Service unique variants thus reducing the number of unique components.  Funding will be used to evolve existing capabilities within the GCCS-J operational baselines with the goal of reducing cost to the field through the use of enterprise hosting and increasing data sharing through the availability of common services while enhancing the existing functionality available to the user today.  GCCS-J entered into sustainment with the closeout of Block V in August 2009.JPES.  JPES is a set of capabilities that address components of the DoD's Adaptive Planning Roadmap (13 Dec 2005) and Adaptive Planning II (5 Mar 2008).  JPES produces enhancements to the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES) focused adaptive planning capabilities and provides a set of core infrastructure services necessary to provide the warfighter an interoperable environment where functionality can be easily added as mission needs dictate.Joint C2 Architecture.  The Joint C2 Architecture is a foundational element of the Joint C2 capabilities for the Department containing a set of net-centric tenets associated with data functional service and the C2 infrastructure that is based on a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) design pattern.  Each year the DISA architecture team produces a transitional architecture that documents the current state of C2 capabilities and anticipated changes/enhancements either in progress or planned by the C2 community.  The yearly updates document the use of enterprise services and standards in the development integration and implementation of Joint C2 capabilities across the Department.The GCCS-J Overseas Contingency Operations for Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (I3) provides operational enhancements to the existing GCCS-J I3/Common Operating Picture (COP) baseline in direct support of United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) identified requirements.  This includes access to additional data sources or tracks ensures visualization of this intelligence data on the COP and enhancements to capabilities unique to the USCENTCOM Area of Responsibility (AOR).","Continuing","Continuing","",

An important part of the DMEA mission is to research current and emerging microelectronics issues with a focus on warfighters’ needs.  To this end DMEA is integrally involved in the development of capabilities and resultant products based on technologies whose feasibility has been demonstrated but which have yet to be applied to real-world and military applications.DMEA resolves microelectronics technology issues in weapon systems by quickly developing and executing appropriate solutions to not only keep a system operational but elevate it to the next level of sophistication or to meet new threats.  DMEA provides critical microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the DoD is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides critical quick turn solutions for DoD intelligence special operations cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market.  DMEA’s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions—along with its unique technical perspective—allows it to develop manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability.  DMEA can then use these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele.  After many years of performing analogous efforts the technical experience mission knowledge and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are often incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects.Microelectronics technology is a vital and essential technology for all operations within the DoD.  DMEA operates the DoD’s only microelectronic foundry—a “flexible foundry”—with a unique business model that incorporates industry partnership to serve the DoD where industry alone has not.  A microelectronic foundry is the factory that takes raw silicon and produces an integrated circuit or “chip.”  The fabrication of an integrated circuit consists of multiple processing steps to form and connect many transistors and other circuit components to form the desired function.  Each type of chip requires a different “recipe” (process) in the foundry.  Semiconductor companies spend great amounts of time and resources developing proprietary recipes.  They abandon these and develop new recipes as new generations of smaller and more powerful microelectronic components are needed. The DMEA mission focuses on providing DoD systems with microelectronics components that are no longer provided by industry—called “legacy” components.  Most domestic semiconductor foundries will discontinue low-volume high-mix integrated circuits in as little as two years because by then there is little or no profit margin left; but the DoD requires an assured supply chain for its systems for 20 years or more.  Working alongside industry DMEA has created a model partnership that provides this capability for the DoD.  DMEA’s unique flexible foundry supports the DoD with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now assured to remain in one location for as long as they are needed.  To obtain these processes DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses.  These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed intellectual property (IP) and the related processes for DoD needs.  These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry’s first right of refusal.  DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components.  If not only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production.  A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners’ valuable IP and processes.  DMEA is Government owned and operated providing the structure and confidence that an industry partner’s IP is protected from potential competitors.  This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring installing and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the DoD. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems combat operations and support needs.  As such DMEA serves the DoD other US Agencies industry and Allied nations.","Continuing","Continuing","",

This PE is dedicated to Rapid Acquisition Incentives – Net Centricity (RAI-NC) which serve DoD by providing RDT&E proof-of-concept early implementation of key initiatives targeted at advancing and moving the Mission Areas of DoD towards Net Centricity.   For example a coherent and timely transition across DoD Enterprise networks and infrastructure to the next generation of the Internet Protocol ( IP) IP Version 6 (IPv6) is critical to leveraging the power of information by the business and warfighting mission areas through net-centric operations/warfare. The PE permits accelerating domain support processes thru rapid proof of concept development and early implementation.  RAI-NC provides funding for Net Centric initiatives that directly support and facilitate the transformation of the DoD enterprise.   This effort is consistent with the Department’s strategic goals to: enable net-centric operations and warfare reduce costs; improve efficiency; increase effectiveness by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of process redesign; business systems modernization; strategic sourcing; infrastructure reductions; and optimal-sized inventories.  The objective of RAI-NC is to accelerate DoD’s net centric transformation in support of the warfighter.  Fully achieving net-centricity requires the ubiquity mobility security and performance achievable through implementation of the value added features of IPv6.   The DoD IPv6 transition and implementation program has been incorporated into the DoD Unified Capabilities (UC) implementation program.  DoD UC is the integration of voice video and/or data services delivered ubiquitously across an interoperable secure and highly available IP network infrastructure independent of technology to provide increased mission effectiveness to the warfighter.  DoD UC integrates standards-based communication and collaboration services including but not limited to:  messaging; voice video and Web conferencing; and unified communication and collaboration applications or clients.  These standards-based UC services are integrated with available enterprise applications both business and warfighting.  As stated earlier DoD UC includes DoD IPv6 implementation.  The scope of Rapid Acquisition Incentives – Net Centricity encompasses defense policies processes people technologies and systems that guide perform or support aspects of warfighter support processes within the Department.  Each RAI-NC initiative provides proof of concept sustainability as well as the scalability necessary for Domain enterprise wide implementation that will allow end-to- end accessibility to net-centric based decision-making information.  Successful implementation will result in more reliable accurate and timely net- centric management information upon which managers can make more effective business decisions in a timely manner for the Department.  RAI-NC enables the acceleration of DoD efforts to implement network centric operational environments while providing a secure flexible reliable affordable integrated network to achieve high effectiveness in joint and combined operations.  This program employs RDT&E funds to plan develop prototype and oversee proof of concept initiatives.  Successful initiatives with supporting business cases demonstrating the achieved goals and outcomes and mission area support will be allowed to enter full deployment.  This program is funded under BA-6 Management Support because it includes studies and analyses in support of R&D efforts.","Continuing","Continuing","R2Long",

These programs will create a realistic battlespace environment in which to train as a Joint Warfighting force to meet emerging mission requirements including adapting to new and future realities.  These investments support the Secretary of Defense’s (SECDEF) Commanders Exercise and Engagement Training Transformation (CE2T2) initiative to enable and enhance Joint Warfighting readiness by training as we intend to fight.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)- Joint Simulation Systems (JSS)- Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC)- U.S. Forces Korea Training & Exercise Support (USFK)- Immersive Trainer - Air Force JNTC- Navy JNTCJNTC:  Established in 2003 JNTC continues to develop and integrate Advanced Training Technologies into a seamless Joint training environment.  JNTC establishes the overarching Joint framework and context necessary for COCOMs and Services to achieve a Joint training environment through an integrated network of training sites and nodes.  JNTC provides the common standards architecture and development processes required to link Joint training programs.  By leveraging existing training programs or initiating specific actions JNTC is developing credible opposing force capabilities and expanded access to assets from other Services and locations which are typically unavailable to the training audience by developing and integrating modeled and simulated representations of these capabilities. This furthers the integration of Joint training objectives into Service training events while capturing the objective data necessary to provide a complete and accurate after action review.  This program develops and enhances current and future Joint training enterprise capabilities.JSS:  This effort provides warfighters with Joint Simulations and Tools that enhance and enable Joint training across Services COCOMs Agencies and Coalition partners.  These Joint Simulations and Tools are part of an overall Joint Live Virtual and Constructive (JLVC) baseline of training capabilities resident in the Joint Force Trainer Toolkit (JFTT).  The JFTT is a set of training enablers and “certified systems” that are interoperable and acceptable for usage within the Joint training environment.  The Joint Simulations and Tools provided by JSS are critical enablers that support the delivery of trained capable and interoperable Joint Forces.  JKDDC:  Develop a Joint Individual Training Toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products and services.  Products and services are developed in response to JKDDC Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) Stakeholder (COCOMs Services and Combat Support Agencies) prioritized training requirements.  JKDDC JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum joint professional military education and tailored common training standards to Service members for tasks that are jointly executed resulting in trained capable and interoperable joint forces.  JKDDC JKO technology initiatives principally include Virtual Cultural Awareness Training (VCAT) web-based gaming Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) and mobile courseware training devices.  These capabilities facilitate the training and preparation of tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to COCOM theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets. Specifically VCAT supports one of the top  identified training shortcomings of returning warriors from United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) based C/JTFs (cultural awareness training). C/JTF ‘battle staffs’ will be adequately trained as individuals and the staffs collectively based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise. JKO mobile courseware training device development facilitates the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable hand-held platforms for joint warriors.  The future learning environment will provide training and learning to promote adaptability and agility in the workforce with the capability to tailor and adapt instructional material to fit the learner's strengths and weaknesses learning style and level of proficiency.      USFK:  This program will develop a Jointly Accredited and Supported Modeling & Simulation federation of constructive simulations capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations.  This simulation system is also interoperable with the Republic of Korea developed Korean Simulation System.  This solution will be capable of interoperating in a common battle space that realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences tactical to strategic in Korean theater exercises.  While supporting USFK’s specific requirements this solution will contain enhancements that will benefit all users of the JLVC.Immersive Trainer:  This program supports a broader national effort to advance and integrate emerging technologies to increase the effectiveness of training in dismounted small-unit operations in the contemporary operating environment.  Today’s dismounted forces when placed in a complex culturally rich  environment require a training capability that challenges their mental agility as they are required to rapidly adapt in a dynamic environment which ranges from  conventional battles to irregular warfare (IW).  In close coordination with the Services the Immersive Trainer imitative will create a realistic virtual environment to train small military units with the required level of complexity while creating sensory overload and decision-making under extreme stress.  Additionally the Immersive Trainer will capture detailed data during complex scenarios to facilitate in-depth debrief and capture lessons learned for training audiences.  To date this detailed debrief capability has been limited to operators of high-end platforms like fighter aircraft.  Now the infantry squad will be provided a comparable capability as aircraft crew to conduct mission rehearsals and after action reviews before and after critical missions. This capability for our dismounted general purpose and special operations forces is vital to saving lives and ensuring effective and ethical small unit operations in the future.  The immersive trainer also is a key component in development of small unit leaders by allowing them to train in a realistic environment which can be altered to stress different learning objectives.Air Force JNTC:  Supports the SECDEF's Transformation in Training/Joint National Training Capability (JNTC).  Develops capabilities that integrate live virtual and constructive elements into a seamless joint training environment.  Using a scientific and phased approach and focusing on modeling air and space capabilities researches new technologies and methods that provide a crucial technology-based foundation supporting all JNTC operations.Navy JNTC:  Supports SECDEF Transformation of DoD training and Joint National Training Capability. These funds enable Navy in developing unique maritime capabilities that integrate live virtual and constructive elements into a seamless joint training environment. Navy continues to develop and integrated joint training technologies that play a crucial role in its ability to address current and future joint operational training requirements. Navy program activities include conducting research development test and evaluation and cross-service architecture certification on all T2 capable systems developing cross-domain architectures for US and Coalition Forces as well as ensure sister service modeling/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a common unified standard.","Continuing","Continuing","",

The Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service Defense and other government agencies T&E needs maximize opportunities for joint efforts and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities.  CTEIP focuses investments on projects that will have high productivity returns on investment.  Projects under the CTEIP Program Element (PE) support two basic tasks: investments to improve the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Project (REP)).The JIM funds critically needed T&E investments in the major functional areas of: air combat; armament and munitions; Command Control Communication Computer and Intelligence (C4I) and networks; common range instrumentation; electronic combat; land combat; sea combat; space combat; target systems; and test environments.  Examples of project subject matter include: highly accurate time-space-position information network enhanced telemetry miniaturized flight safety systems realistic urban test environments ground testing for hypersonic systems and satellites and end-to-end testing of infrared countermeasure systems.  CTEIP continues as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and links between test and training ranges.CTEIP has provided special focus to institutionalize the use of modeling and simulation (M&S) as a practical test tool; to link ranges through internetting to enhance inter-range and inter-Service cooperation and resource sharing; and to ensure development and acquisition of common instrumentation necessary for a more efficient test infrastructure.Analyses of alternative solutions are conducted for each investment project to validate T&E requirements to define integrated support systems and to determine overall cost effectiveness of the proposed test investments.  The use of Department of Defense (DoD)-wide criteria for requirement validation prioritization and risk assessment ensures an effective test resource investment program.The REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major high priority defense acquisition programs.  These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness short timelines between system design maturity and scheduled OT and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) or system-of-systems testing.  Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning and ensures their availability and legacy for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.This Research Category 6.4 PE includes special studies analyses and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure and supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD component weapon system test requirements.","Continuing","Continuing","R2Long",

The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) provides cost effective tools the Department needs to address the most difficult defense problems.  These tools include modern high performance computing hardware parallel software wide area networking services and the expertise to use them.  The HPCMP helps enable DoD personnel to:-  Conduct basic research into areas such as materials fuels turbulence proteins electromagnetic fields signal image relationships structural response blast effects and combustion;  -  Conduct applied research into areas such as aerodynamics applied to fighter and transport manned and unmanned aircraft; automated target recognition; hydrodynamics applied to new hull forms structural performance of new armor and penetrator concepts; and explosives performance;-  Design elements of weapon systems such as the Hellfire missile F-35 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle C-17 the Javelin missile and directed energy weapons systems;-  Test and evaluate weapons system performance on systems such as F-16 F-22 F-35 C-17 FCS AIM-9X GBU-39 and Striker;-  Immediately support urgent operations for efforts such as counter Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) Hurricane Katrina related flood modeling and the 2010 Gulf oil spill migration modeling.High Performance Computing (HPC) has been identified as a key enabling technology essential to achieving the DoD's research development test and evaluation (RDT&E) objectives.  Validated requirements collected across the DoD reflect the needs of 4400 scientists and engineers located at hundreds of locations (DoD Laboratories Test Centers academic institutions and commercial businesses).  The integrated HPCMP consists of DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) and Software Application Support.  DSRCs are responsible for as much of DoD`s RDT&E computational workload as feasible.  DSRCs provide extensive capabilities to address user requirements for hardware software and programming environments.  Dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) augment the DSRCs to form the total HPCMP computational capability.  DHPIs address critical HPC requirements that cannot be met at DSRCs such as real-time and near real-time computing requirements and leverage significant HPC and mission expertise located at these remote sites.  All elements of the HPCMP are interconnected with all science and technology and test and evaluation user sites via the DREN.  DREN provides the flexible wide area network fabric needed by the RDT&E community to support technology demonstrations and distributed test and evaluation events in addition to providing access to the supercomputing centers.  The Software Application Support component develops critical common DoD applications programs that run efficiently on advanced HPC systems supports technology transition activities with academic and commercial institutions trains users and builds collaborative programming environments.

Reduced logistics footprint.3. Generated future cost reductions in total ownership cost.Individual Service Projects are complete efforts within themselves that yield complete developments/redesigns which the Services are committed to put into production and operation.  The initiatives optimized cost avoidance which ultimately reduce the operating and support costs for systems.  Each project was evaluated against a rigorous set of criteria to assess its viability and probability of success.  Individual projects addressed specific Service needs and high Operations and Support (O&S) cost areas.The Department set a FY 2010 R-TOC goal of reducing the total defense systems inflation increase in O&S cost by 30 percent between FY 2004 and FY 2010.  This PE provided a major portion of the program funding to achieve this goal.  The successful demonstration of the R-TOC program initiatives stimulated additional initiatives by the Services to achieve even greater cost avoidance.

JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons both U.S. and foreign for their lethalities against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.  The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD’s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Aeronautical Systems Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&E to improve military aircraft survivability develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&S) facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG) which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT) is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&E and is also an Executive Agent for the Survivability Vulnerability Information Analysis Center (SURVIAC) the repository for aircraft survivability information.The Joint Logistics Commanders Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME) was chartered more than 40 years ago to serve as DoD’s focal point for munitions effectiveness information.  This has taken the form of widely used Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) which address all major non-nuclear U.S. weapons.  JTCG/ME authenticates weapons effectiveness data for use in training systems acquisition weapon procurement and combat modeling and simulation.  JMEMs are used by the Armed Forces of the U.S. NATO and other allies to plan operational missions support training and tactics development and support force-level analyses.  JTCG/ME also develops and standardizes methodologies for evaluation of munitions effectiveness and maintains databases for target vulnerability munitions lethality and weapon system accuracy.  The JMEM requirements and development processes continues to be driven by operational lessons learned (Enduring Freedom Iraqi Freedom and Odyssey Dawn) and the needs of Combatant Commands Services Military Targeting Committee and Operational Users Working Groups input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. This program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&E programs.This program element is budgeted in Budget Activity 6 RDT&E Management Support to support LFT&E management activities for the oversight of RDT&E of new systems as well as RDT&E of fielded systems.","Continuing","Continuing","",

The T&E programs consist of five activities:  Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E); Threat Systems (TS); Center for Countermeasures (CCM); Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME); and Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP).  Starting in FY 2013 the JTCG/ME and JASP programs are realigned from the Operational Test Activities and Analyses program element (0605814OTE) to the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program element (0605131OTE).  Since the JTCG/ME and JASP programs focus on the survivability of currently fielded systems the two programs are more appropriately funded within the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program element.  Joint Test and Evaluation projects are test and evaluation activities conducted in a joint military environment that develop process improvements.  These multi-Service projects chartered by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and coordinated with the Joint Staff appropriate combatant commanders and the Services provide non-materiel solutions that improve:  joint interoperability of Service systems technical and operational concepts joint operational issues development and validation of joint test methodologies and test data for validating models simulations and test beds.  The JT&E projects address relevant joint war fighting issues in a joint test and evaluation environment by developing and providing new tactics techniques and procedures to improve joint test capabilities and methodologies.Threat Systems based on a memorandum of agreement between the Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) and the Defense Intelligence Agency provides DOT&E support in the areas of threat resource analysis intelligence support and threat systems investments.  Threat Systems provides threat resource analyses on the availability capabilities and limitations of threat representations (threat simulators targets models U.S. surrogates and foreign materiel) and analysis of test resources used for operational testing to support DOT&E’s assessment of the adequacy of testing for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&E and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Technology and Logistics (OUSD(AT&L)).  Threat Systems provides DOT&E assessment officers and other DOT&E activities with program specific threat intelligence support.  Threat Systems also funds management oversight and development of common-use threat specifications for threat simulators threat representative targets and digital threat models used for test and evaluation. The Center a Joint Service Countermeasure (CM) Test and Evaluation Center serves as DoD’s independent evaluator for electro-optical systems with emphasis on rotary wing survivability precision guided weapons (PGWs) CMs/ counter-countermeasures (CCMs) employment and warning devices.  The Center conducts tests analyzes test results and provides CM expertise that benefits the Services Joint activities T&E Agencies DoD Acquisition Community the Intelligence Community Homeland Defense and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  Data collected during Center test activities provides valuable information to OSD assessment officers for select oversight programs.

Numerous joint needs statements operational documents lessons learned and NATO requirements state the need for positive CID.  High confidence CID increases combat effectiveness prevents fratricide and reduces collateral damage.  It also enables combatant commanders to effectively command and control their forces in all weather day or night.  This program element focuses on the cooperative and non-cooperative technologies that have the capability to positively identify surface and air targets in both air-to-surface and air-to-air engagements.  In order to rapidly make available promising CID technologies for platform SDD decisions the program element funds design studies engineering analysis non-recurring engineering and other efforts associated with integration and modification of CID related technologies and systems on platforms.  It also supports the development testing and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint Allied and coalition interoperability.  Non-cooperative CID employs a number of sensing technologies and signal processing techniques.  The observations may be compared to a database of known objects to identify surface or air threats from air platforms.  These technologies include: (1) Laser Vision an Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) imaging system that significantly increases ID ranges and includes exploiting synergies between non-cooperative and cooperative identification systems (radio millimeter wave infrared and laser). The Laser Vision Program is working on performance improvements laser vibrometry development 3-dimensional laser detection and ranging laser radar Synthetic Aperture Laser (SAL) radar hyper spectral phenomenology exploitation aided/automatic target recognition image fusion and studies to support decisions on future EO/IR technologies; (2) Radar Vision an air-to-ground radar imaging technique to identify stationary and moving targets using their radar signatures; (3) Hydra Vision (formerly Fusion Vision) a balanced (robust) amalgamation of sensor data from multiple sources to provide warfighters with higher confidence CID results on surface or air targets potentially including fusion with intelligence sources  identification of non-traditional targets fusion to counter camouflage concealment and deception (CCD) and multi-phenomenology features for sustainable databases and (4) X-Patch a validated set of prediction codes and analysis tools that use the Shooting-and-Bouncing Ray (SBR) method to predict realistic far-field radar signatures from 3D target models in order to predict 1D and/or 2D data.  X-Patch is vital for development of radar signatures of potential high-threat weapons systems; it is a critical capability of database production centers which support Joint Sensors Signature Database (JSSD) pathfinders.  Cooperative CID employs technologies required to rapidly identify friendly platforms.  The program develops integrates and evaluates technologies that provide AF platforms with a means of positively identifing an air or ground platform as a friendly via active or passive cooperative ID capabilities.  Development funded by this program element ensures availability of a Mode 5 upgrade path for implementing ground and air platforms across the Air Force fleet.  Within the air-to-air domain programs funded to meet this intent include: (1) Mode 5 Technology Insertion Program (TIP): The program element funds preliminary RDT&E for Mark XIIA the next generation Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) standard for the DoD and NATO.  Mark XIIA represents a substantial enhancement to the Mark XII IFF system.  It is expected to achieve joint initial operational capability in 2014.  The "A" denotes the addition of Mode 5 (an encrypted challenge-and-reply mode) to the other Mark XII system modes (Modes 1 2 3/A C S and 4).  The Mode 5 secure IFF program is a DoD-wide Navy-led development and acquisition program.  The Mode 5 TIP specifically addresses implementing air platforms.  (2) Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)TIP:  This program element will fund preliminary RDT&E for integration of ADS-B architecture into the APX-119 Mark XIIA transponder. The ADS-B TIP will develop ADS-B "In" and "Out" capability which leverages synergies between ADS-B and Mode 5 Level 2 (M5L2) to achieve M5L2 "In" capability.  The ADS-B TIP specifically addresses implementing air platforms. (3) Digital IFF Control Panel: This program element is developing a Digital IFF Control Panel (DCP) to support Mode 5 and ADS-B insertion programs into Air Force platforms with an Aeronautics Research Incorporated (ARINC)  429 based avionics architecture.  The DCP will provide a standard control panel for AF aircraft with growth capability for ADS-B and beyond.  Within the air-to-ground domain development funded by this program element ensures development integration test and evaluation of friendly identification systems focused on reducing air-to-ground fratricide.  A potential program to meet this intent includes:  (1) Radio Based Combat Identification:  An active challenge reply system leveraging Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) capable ground and aircraft targeting pod mounted radios for air-to-ground friendly identification.  This program element also funds the Air Traffic Control Beacon Systems Identification Friend or Foe Mark XII/XIIA Systems (AIMS) Program Office.  The DoD International AIMS PO has system level interoperability management responsibilities for the present Mark XII system development and integration of Mark XIIA (Mode 5) and transition to Mark XIIA Mode S systems. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

To enable completion of these missions USSTRATCOM is modernizing the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as SWPS) developing information systems and techniques to counter and conduct Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) and establishing a unified national architecture integrating disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) systems into a single Internet Protocol (IP)-based system known as the Global Sensor Integrated Network (GSIN) to provide redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership.  When the ISPAN modernization is complete the system will support the warfighter in both deliberate and adaptive planning environments while allowing the National Command Authorities to employ the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons.  The ISPAN system will continue to evolve as weapon systems are matured new systems are developed and the threat changes particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).   Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) is a warfighting application of electronic warfare (EW) Information Operations (IO) and space control (SC) employing various techniques and technologies to negate or prevent hostile use of positioning navigation and timing (PNT) information and protect unimpeded use of PNT information by U.S. Allied and Coalition Forces while not unduly disrupting peaceful use outside an area of operation.  The Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) was established to integrate and coordinate NAVWAR PNT capabilities across the mission areas of intelligence surveillance reconnaissance information operations electronic warfare and space control.  The JNWC is also commissioned to integrate NAVWAR into space operations and assists the warfighter with subject matter expertise to “operationalize” NAVWAR encouraging the NAVWAR view that the Global Positioning System is a taskable weapons system in addition to being a worldwide PNT service.  The JNWC establishes and maintains the Department’s premier basis of NAVWAR expertise and provides subject matter expertise and knowledge support to warfighters Department decision makers the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure) and the coalition through testing and evaluation; modeling simulation and analysis; and exercise and training support.  The Nation's strategic C2 sensors and mission planning programs can not rapidly exchange information across multiple missions creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes.  GSIN establishes a unified national architecture integrating disparate MW/MD systems into a single IP-based system providing redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership.  GSIN nets together all sensors from tactical to strategic including the Nation's most modern and capable assets - taking advantage of their larger numbers improved algorithms mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts.  GSIN will permit an IP-based User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP)to augment voice conferencing and rapidly build a single unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time senior collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) and decision-making. This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","Continuing","Continuing","",

The system is designed to be modular and open-ended.  Mission-specific equipment is employed in a 'plug-and-play' mission kit concept allowing specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.  The MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is a single-engine turbo-prop remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) designed to operate over-the-horizon at medium-to-high altitude for long endurance sorties.  The aircraft is designed primarily to prosecute critical emerging Time-Sensitive-Targets (TSTs) as a radar Electro-optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and laser designator-based attack asset with on-board hard-kill capability (hunter-killer).  It also performs Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance and Target Acquisition (ISR TA).  In the hunter-killer role the aircraft employs fused multi-spectral sensors to find fix and track ground targets (Automatic Target Cueing (ATC) Target Location Accuracy (TLA) Metric Sensor and other capabilities) and assesses post-strike results.  The MQ-9 system is continuing to develop and field capability through incremental upgrades.  Future capabilities development activity includes increasing the maximum gross takeoff weight capability of the aircraft; automatic takeoff and landing capability (ATLC); enhancing aircraft systems to include integrated redundant avionics; modifying the system to include provisions for a Foreign Military Sale exportable version of the weapon system; Predator Primary Data Link (PPDL) communication system upgrades and communications upgrades to include data link encryption IP networking and Ka frequency migration; navigation system upgrades; electrical system upgrades; airframe and airframe system improvements such as incorporation of Elevated Temperature Wet (ETW) materials;  propulsion system improvements; secure voice and data communications including SATCOM upgrades; sensor/stores management computer improvement; MIL-STD-1760 advanced weapons data bus; Universal Armament Interface and Miniature Munitions/Store Interface; advanced sensor and weapon payloads; improved human-machine interface (HMI); integrating precision weapons (e.g. AGM-114 Hellfire missile GBU-12/38/49 guided bombs and Small Diameter Bomb variants); Mode 5 / Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) integration; hardware and software upgrades to the ground control station for MQ-9 operations; completing airworthiness certification; weapons system certification and accreditation; and producing applicable training devices that emulate weapon system functionality and capabilities.

The ATEA is responsible for implementing Anti-Tamper (AT) policy coordinating and providing financial support for AT technology development establishing and maintaining a data bank/library providing proper security mechanisms conducting effective validation and assessing AT implementations.  The purpose of developing AT techniques is to protect critical technologies in U.S. weapon systems that may be sold to foreign governments or that could possibly fall into enemy hands.  AT technology will permit the U.S. to preserve its critical weapons systems lead while also satisfying customer needs.  Furthermore AT will add longevity to critical technologies by deterring efforts to reverse engineer or develop weapon countermeasures against a system or system component.   As the DoD Anti-Tamper Executive Agent the Air Force will coordinate technology development and enhancement efforts among the Services DoD Agencies and laboratories and with industry.  The DoD ATEA will issue contracts for AT technology development as well as plus-up existing AT technology efforts to increase the technology readiness level.  Priorities will be given to technologies that benefit the majority of the AT community.  The Anti-Tamper technology development and enhancement efforts will occur in the following areas:  advanced sensor hardware generic electronic hardware signature control access detection & denial software and effectiveness.  The program management activities will coordinate the technology development and establish the Anti-Tamper data bank/library.  Anti-Tamper validation is a significant responsibility assigned to the Air Force.  All DoD acquisition programs Foreign Military Sales and Direct Commercial Sales with critical technology/critical information are required to have an Anti-Tamper plan with appropriate validation.  The resources required to review Anti-Tamper plans and conduct Anti-Tamper validation began to increase in late FY03.   Based on Anti-Tamper validation requirement projections the number of Anti-Tamper experts needs to expand.  Beginning in FY09 additional funding has been dedicated to the technical development of new AT capabilities. Emerging research in the areas of materials cryptography and electronic circuits has the potential to bring new AT capabilities that have reduced power needs a smaller form factor and less detectability by nation class adversary using state of the art reverse engineering tools.  The goal of the research is to mature promising technologies to the point that they can be transitioned to a program office or industry prime for implementation in our weapons systems.

When applicable this includes joint efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  FY13 funding focuses on three main efforts as follows: Deployable Instrument Landing System (D-ILS).  This effort develops a deployable version of the fixed base ILS.  D-ILS will be the standard precision approach and landing system for conducting Air Force contingency operations and humanitarian or domestic disaster restoral operations in adverse weather conditions.  The current Air Force mobile precision approach radar system (PAR) used to support operations at deployed locations were procured in the 1970s are manpower intensive and logistically unsupportable.  On average only 18% (three of 17 systems) of the mobile PAR systems are operational on a daily basis. Development and deployment of D-ILS will support increased operations in the area of responsibility allow phase out of the currently obsolete legacy systems and will provide interoperability with the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF).  FY13 funds continue engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) under the EMD contract awarded in Aug 11. Due to a contractor protest EMD execution was delayed until Dec 11.  EMD execution includes assembling two EMD units; as well as test and evaluation.  D-ILS Milestone C is now scheduled for FY14.  Related OPAF funds are in program element (PE) 0305114F.  Deployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON). D-RAPCON will replace the 40 year old AN/MPN-14K and AN/TPN-19 Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and Operations Shelter (OPS) subsystems with state of the art digital systems.  Modification and overhaul of the existing systems have proven to be ineffective due to diminishing manufacturing sources.  The D-RAPCON will be used to provide both a terminal and enroute surveillance capability.  The D-RAPCON will also be used with the D-ILS and a fixed or mobile control tower to provide a complete air traffic control capability.  The D-RAPCON will support tactical military and humanitarian operations and also provide a capability to support domestic disaster relief.  The primary surveillance radar coverage (non-cooperative targets) is out to 60 nautical miles (nm) and the secondary surveillance radar coverage (cooperative targets) is out to 120 nm.  FY13 funds will continue contract award efforts to include conducting the preliminary and critical design reviews and assembly of two pre-production units to support developmental test/operational test (DT/OT).  Related OPAF funds are in PE 0305114F.  Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen):  This is an interagency effort designed to enable the transition from a ground infrastructure dominated Air Traffic Management capability for the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) to a capability that leverages advances in Performance Based Navigation (PBN) non-radar based surveillance services transition from voice communications to digital data exchange as well as advances in weather forecast delivery systems.  The Air Force is the DoD lead Service for NextGen implementation and architecture development.  NextGen will be built on key elements from existing programs and technologies and on new systems under development.  FY13 efforts will continue integration studies and demonstrations leading to the implementation of Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA) RPA Pilot/Controller Communications surveillance radar and automation system upgrades and radar windfarm clutter mitigation technologies.  These efforts will improve the display of aircraft position to air traffic managers enhance flight safety and support the seamless integration of RPAs into the National Airspace System and the airspaces of other nations. FY13 funding will also continue support of the NextGen Air Force and DoD Architect offices and development of the DoD NextGen overarching architecture.  As these technologies and architectures mature ground system upgrades will be coordinated and fielded concurrently with aircraft avionics capabilities that are acquired and integrated into Air Force aircraft (manned and RPAs); these efforts will run in close parallel with the Communication Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) program in PE 0305099F.Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","Continuing","Continuing","R2Long",

The SLRS Contract (SLRSC) will continue to modernize several command telemetry and radar instrumentation sites and provide sustainment depot level maintenance and logistics support through early FY13 until the follow-on LTRS Integrated Support Contract (LISC) and other AF DoD and GSA contracts as described below take its place.  As a follow-on to SLRSC the AF will award LISC as a consolidated sustainment operations and maintenance contract in early FY13.  Additionally the AF will use other AF DoD and GSA contracts in FY13 to modernize the LTRS communication networks and flight termination systems in compliance with OSD policies and standards for net centricity global information grid interface information assurance digital encryption and test/training enabling architecture.  The separate Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) contract will continue in FY13 to provide independent systems engineering and integration support complementing SLRSC LISC and other AF DoD and GSA contracts.  These upgrades to fielded systems are categorized as Budget Activity 7 Operational Systems Development.","Continuing","Continuing","R2Long",

The PMOU went into effect in Sept 2009. The NATO AGS Program includes an air segment consisting of a Global Hawk Block 40-like air vehicle using elements of the USN BAMS command and control architecture and the U.S. Radar Technology Insertion Program (RTIP) radar; a unique configuration to allow export of system; a ground segment for data exploitation and distribution; establishment and operation of a management organization; development of operations and support concepts; and definition and establishment of an initial support capability. The program managed by NATO AGS Management Agency (NAGSMA) is composed of: design development and demonstration as well as initial in-service support (IISS). While the current program includes IISS the current contract does not include these tasks.In FY2012 OSD transferred the NATO AGS project funding to the USAF for management and execution.  The NATO AGS project funds the U.S. share of the cost for NATO to acquire an air-to-ground ground surveillance capability improvements to the radar and the U.S. support of NATO activities.   Operations and continuing support will be funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package funded within the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP).The AGS system will be a NATO-owned and operated airborne ground surveillance capability that provides continuous wide area surveillance information in all weather conditions for use at the strategic operational and tactical levels of command. Interoperable with other national assets AGS will provide NATO decision makers with near real time continuous information and situational awareness concerning friendly neutral and opposing ground forces to support mission planning and execution to include force protection and targeting. The NATO Staff Requirements (NSR) serving as the basis for the AGS acquisition was approved in 1997.  After a series of studies including options for a mid-sized fleet composed of manned and unmanned platforms a decision was reached to pursue the acquisition of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-only capability based on a Global Hawk (GH) Block 40 equipped with the RTIP sensor.  The AGS system will include five (5) NATO-developed air vehicles ground-based aircraft control equipment and fixed and deployable data exploitation elements.  In September 2009 fifteen nations including the United States signed the PMOU financially committing each participant to the procurement and delivery to the war fighter of the NATO Commander’s number one priority.  Denmark has withdrawn from the NATO AGS program support.  Canada gave intent to withdraw in August 2011.This funding is the U.S. cost share for the acquisition of the NATO airborne ground surveillance capability as well as the cost share associated with the IISS. In-Service Support (ISS) will be contracted under separate action.  It is anticipated that ISS costs will be commonly funded using the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP).  This funding also includes developmental activity for RTIP to include additional functionality and configuration requirements studies and analysis related to mission security and exportability and current and future program planning project execution engineering and program management support to NATO.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","Continuing","Continuing","R2Long",

The program was constructed to mature both technical and business model integration for C5I systems programs of record in an open architecture environment. The priority was incorporating the principles of modular design and design disclosure reusable application software interoperability and secure information exchange lifecycle affordability and encouraging competition and collaboration.Project Unit 0324: Funding is to maintain and update a repository environment to improve transparency of design disclosure and information exchange on past and current investments to support the principle of cross-program reuse and to provide the tools and leadership for assisting programs through the transition to Naval Open Architecture (OA).  The other elements of the OA transformation effort are being realized as management efficiencies within programs.  Those elements include ensuring that all naval systems families of systems and programs move to modular OA in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.1 dated 12 May 2003 which mandates that all DoD programs utilize open systems architectures to rapidly field affordable and interoperable systems.  By direction of the Navy Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) PEO IWS is assigned overall responsibility and authority to direct the Navy's OA effort.  That policy established a need to coordinate acquisition strategies develop guidance and tools and develop analysis of alternatives to determine OA software reuse practices within and across the Navy Communities of Interest (COI - Surface Subsurface Air Space C4I USMC and ONR).  This project facilitates a strategic shift in the acquisition business process to facilitate cooperative competition in cross-domain/COI business relationships.  This improves innovation and economies of scale throughout the Navy and Marine Corps.  This leadership effort has identified the business case and potential return on investment for moving the Navy towards an open systems approach supported the development of open systems technologies and integrated best business and technical practices for open systems development within Naval acquisition.  Naval OA ensures Navy-wide system architectures become extensible and scalable in function capacity and workload to meet Joint warfighting requirements.  This also includes the identification and development of common software components functions reuse methodologies and extensible product lines.  In summary this funding supports the management of a reuse repository and reuse information exchange portal and the evolving business systems engineering and cultural changes required across all Naval programs as they migrate to function in a Joint net-centric warfare environment.","Continuing","Continuing","",

Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) acts as management lead for Joint System Command (SYSCOM) system certification policy and guidance and certifies platforms for interoperability within the platform and throughout the enterprise in accordance with Commander US Fleet Forces Command/Commander Pacific Fleet (COMUSFLTFORCOM/COMPACFLT) Inst. 4720.3B (OCT 2008) C5ISR Modernization Policy.  COMUSFLTFORCOM/COMPACFLT Inst. 4720.3B also requires that NAVSEA act as administrative agent for COMNAVNETWARCOM Command and Control Communications Computers and Combat Systems Integration Modernization Process (C5IMP) and execution agent for Navy Command and Control Communications Computers and Combat Systems Integration (C5I) Modernization Conferences (NCMC).  This program conducts Interoperability Assessments that are required to certify Aircraft Carriers Amphibious Assault Ships and Surface Combatants in accordance with the Naval Warfare System Certification Policy (NWSCP) NAVSEAINST 9410.2 NAVAIR 5230.20 SPAWAR 5234.1.The SFI Program ensures overall strike force interoperability is characterized and assessed. NAVSEA is assigned central United States Navy (USN) responsibility for interoperability directing the development of policy and architecture for Strike Force warfare systems engineering and implementation of a common warfare systems engineering process. There are three priorities within the Strike Force Interoperability Program:  1) Support Fleet As-Is state which includes Navigation System Certification (NAVCERT) Interoperability Capabilities & Limitations and Interoperability Tactical Information Coordinator Technical Aids (TIC TECHAIDs); 2) Ship system modernization (non-HME) including warfighting capability & other C5I upgrades. This includes C5IMP Baseline Management and Non-Aegis Combat System Integration Testing; and 3) Ship Warfare System Certification & Force Level Assessments. This includes Warfare Certification Interoperability Certification and Force Level Interoperability Assessments.  In addition to these core efforts this program also aims to improve the efficiency of testing processes through the Automated Test and Retest (ATRT) program and engages in efforts designed to ensure the U.S. Navy is interoperable with Joint and Coalition forces through the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD).Budget exhibit has been updated to reflect recommendations findings and requirements of the Flag Certification Task Force conducted October - November 2010. Project 0164: Combat System Integration:This project consist of five key pillars executed within the SFI program beginning in FY13: 1) Command & Control Communications Computer Combat Systems and Intelligence Modernization Process (C5IMP) and Fleet Readiness. The C5IMP validates the introduction of new systems into the Fleet and ensures system maturity prior to installation thereby reducing risk and enhancing readiness and effectiveness of deploying ships and strike groups; 2) Warfare Systems Certification which is essential to validating the maturity and operational performance of warfare systems prior to fleet delivery and deployment; 3) Navigation Certification (NAVCERT) and Electronic Charting and Display System - Navy (ECDIS-N) certification which certifies ship electronic charting capability and certifies the accurate transmission of navigation data to combat and weapons systems; 4) Combat Systems Integration Testing (CSIT) formerly known as Warfare Systems Integration and Interoperability Testing (WSI2T) which is essential in the identification of critical integration and interoperability issues.  CSIT also provides Objective Quality Evidence (OQE) for warfare system certification decisions for installation and deployment; and 5) Interoperability Certification and Assessment the independent assessment of Strike Group Warfare Systems operational performance.  Interoperability Assessments examine force level engagement threads aircraft control air battle-space management and operational displays.  Assessments of deploying ships in Strike Force configurations are accomplished through the utilization of the Navy's Distributed Engineering Plant (DEP) which is the cornerstone for the Distributed Integration & Interoperability Assessment Capability (DIIAC) Concept.  It is a U.S. Fleet Forces Command and Commander In Chief U.S Pacific Fleet (CINCPACFLT) requirement that all Strike Forces undergo Interoperability Assessment testing in the DEP prior to deployment.  Interoperability Certification results are used to develop fleet tactical tools (Capabilities & Limitations (C&L) and Tactical Information Coordinator Technical Aids (TIC TECHAIDs)) which ensure that operators understand the interoperability capabilities and limitations of their combat systems.      Project 3312: Maritime Theater Missile Defense Forum (MTMD):This project funds participation in the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended in 2009).  Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) forum it promotes interoperability with the Navies of nine participating nations.  This project funds participation in several Project Arrangements and includes maritime contribution to the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project.The MTMD forum provides protection against the proliferation of short medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the creation of an interoperable sea-based defense capability among coalition nations.  This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats. MTMD supports USN participation in several MTMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:(1)  Battle Management Command Control Communications Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps.(2)  Modeling & Simulation (M&S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.(3)  Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.(4)  Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.(5)  Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.(6)  Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.(7)  Coalition Supersonic Sea-Skimming Targets (CSSST) to evaluate the conversion of excess TERRIER Missiles into low cost targets.

Project 0766 provides for Integrated Undersea Surveillance Systems (IUSS) Research and Development Projects under the Maritime Surveillance Systems (MSS) Program Office (PEO SUB PMS 485).  IUSS provides the Navy with its primary means of submarine detection both nuclear and diesel.  A portion of project 0766 (FSS) is classified with details available at a higher classification level. Project 0344 funds the Shallow Water Surveillance System (SWSS) project to develop and demonstrate a deployable medium endurance underwater sensor to detect and classify submarines specifically operating in shallow water areas. The IUSS Research and Development project (0766) funds SURTASS Passive and SURTASS Low Frequency Active (LFA) developments.  SURTASS provides the mobile tactical arm of the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System providing long range detection and cueing for tactical weapons platforms against both diesel and nuclear powered submarines.  SURTASS LFA provides an active adjunct capability for IUSS passive and tactical sensors to assist in countering the quieter diesel and nuclear threats of the 1990s and beyond.  The LFA tasks are directed at detection of slow quiet threats in harsh littoral waters.In order to continue with reductions in life cycle costs and continue with system-wide consolidation a short-term goal is to develop a common IUSS processor based on NAVSEA's Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (ARCI) program.  The IUSS Integrated Common Processor (ICP) will have the capability to process and display data from all fixed and mobile underwater systems.  The IUSS ICP will be used for all new system installations and replace the legacy systems as they reach end of life and require upgrading.  Additionally SURTASS has consolidated on the TB-29A Twin-line array a variant of the Submarine TB-29A Long line array.  This reduced the number of array variants employed by SURTASS from 3 to 1 and enabled development and logistics cost savings by leveraging off the submarine TB-29A program.The Shallow Water Surveillance System (SWSS) project (0344) funds the development and demonstration of technology to enable a deployable medium endurance underwater sensor to detect and classify submarines operating in shallow water areas of the world with sufficient timeliness and accuracy to permit re-acquisition of the submarine target using local tactical assets.","Continuing","Continuing","",

Fully aligned with 'A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower' it is intended to establish a consistent sense of urgency and guide the development of a comprehensive long-term strategy and attendant execution plans to achieve and sustain a strategic and operational advantage and maximize the potential for tactical advantage in future operationally-relevant environments. Our nation and maritime forces face an evolving submarine threat of increasing lethality. Evolving submarine technologies offer enhanced stealth speed endurance weapons and operational proficiency trends foretelling that the adversary submarine of the future will have a significantly larger sphere of influence while presenting less vulnerability to ASW forces. Furthermore the effective offensive engagement range of the adversary submarine of the future will continue to match or outrange individual U.S. and multinational platform sensors and weapons in many tactical environments. ASW forces must be effective in all operating environments ranging from the deep open ocean to the shallow coastal waters and littorals. The noisy undersea environment coupled with stealthier submarines challenges the ability of our sensors to detect localize and track threat submarines.The objective of this Program Element (PE) is to significantly improve existing Surface Ship Undersea Warfare (USW) sonar system capabilities through quick and affordable development/integration of emergent transformational technologies in support of Littoral ASW Theater ASW Mine Reconnaissance and overall Sea Shield efforts required to pace the threat. Detection and classification play uniquely vital roles in the success of any ASW campaign. To be effective against increasingly stealthy threats in an often ambiguous undersea environment future sensors must be environmentally adaptive have very low false alarm rates and exploit the full range of current and future submarine detection vulnerabilities.Project 1916's primary mission is to improve AN/SQQ-89(V) Measures Of Performance (MOP) by enhancing detection tracking classification passive active torpedo Detection Classification and Localization (DCL) and sonobuoy data processing and display capabilities and increasing acoustic sensor frequency bandwidth (Operational Requirements Document #667-76-05 titled 'AN/SQQ-89 Improvement Program' Test and Evaluation Master Plan 801 and 802-2 (TEMP 801 & TEMP 802-2)). Improvements to system simulation stimulation Information Assurance (IA) software and network architectures and safety are included.  This project takes advantage of the AN/SQQ-89(V) Open System Architecture (OSA) and Acoustic Rapid Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Insertion (ARCI) initiatives to integrate a torpedo DCL and ASW sonar combat system capability improvements. This COTS-based Surface Ship ASW combat system the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 is currently planned as a backfit program for both CG47 (CG59-73 Baseline 3 and 4) and DDG51 (All FLT I/II/IIA) class ships. The Open Architecture (OA) (level 3 compliant) of the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 system drives the Advanced Capability Build (ACB) spiral development process and provides budget flexibility to make COTS/OA technology solutions and ARCI-type initiatives affordable. This will be accomplished via the incorporation of select Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and emergent transformational ASW technologies delivered to the AN/SQQ-89(V) prime integrator every two years.  ASW technology implementation will take advantage of improvements developed under the submarine Advanced Processing Build (APB) program and will in turn share unique improvements developed under this program with the submarine and surveillance ASW communities. This project will also contribute to development of Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) ASW Mission Packages.Project 1916 also includes funding for the Surface Ship Enhanced Measurement Program (SSEMP) which will measure the performance of existing and new Surface Ship ASW combat systems and enables data-based assessment of the capabilities and shortfalls in the performance of these systems in realistic scenarios.Project 1916 also includes funding for the Surface ASW Synthetic Training (SAST) program (under the Surface Ship ASW Synthetic Signatures Generation and Training Acceleration Initiative) including the development of a high fidelity acoustic simulation of a surface ship sonar. This effort will accelerate the implementation and integration of the Submarine Multi-Mission Team Trainer (SMMTT) Navy Continuous Training Environment (NCTE) solution/baseline to the surface ship paradigm. The training skills and proficiency of all personnel supporting ASW operations must be approached in a coordinated concentrated and properly-resourced manner to overcome past deficiencies. The full spectrum of training must be addressed from synthetic to the experience gained from actual and exercise operations. Technology must be exploited fully to provide assistance to operators tacticians and commanders in order to improve and maintain their capability against the evolving threat.  Delivery of SAST capability will be provided via the ACB spiral development process.","Continuing","Continuing","",

CANES is the technical and infrastructure consolidation of existing separately managed afloat networks currently under PE 0204163N (LI 3050) Ship Communications Automation including Integrated Shipboard Network Systems (ISNS) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System - Maritime (CENTRIXS-M) Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Networks and Submarine Local Area Network (SubLAN). These legacy afloat network designs are End of Life starting in FY 2012 and CANES will replace these existing unaffordable and obsolete networks.   The fundamental goal of CANES is to bring Infrastructure and Platform as a Service (IaaS / PaaS) within which current and future iterations of Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) computing and storage capabilities will reside. CANES will provide complete infrastructure inclusive of hardware software processing storage and end user devices for Unclassified Coalition Secret and SCI for all basic network services (email web chat collaboration) to a wide variety of Navy surface combatants submarines Maritime Operations Centers and aircraft. In addition approximately 36 hosted applications and systems inclusive of Command and Control Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Information Operations Logistics and Business domains require the CANES infrastructure to operate in the tactical environment. Integrating these applications and systems is accomplished through Application Integration (AI) the engineering process used to evaluate and validate compatibility between the CANES IaaS / PaaS and the Navy-validated applications systems and services that will utilize the CANES infrastructure and services.  Specific programs such as Distributed Common Ground System - Navy (DCGS-N) Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M) Naval Tactical Command Support System (NTCSS) and Undersea Warfare Decision Support System (USW-DSS) are dependent on the CANES Common Computing Environment (CCE) to field host and sustain their capability because they no longer provide their own hardware. CANES requires that ADNS field prior to or concurrently with CANES due to architectural reliance between the two programs.   CANES will field on a rolling four year hardware baseline and a two year software baseline. CANES is based on the overarching concept of reducing the number of afloat networks and providing enhanced efficiency through a single engineering focus on integrated technical solutions. This will allow for streamlined acquisition contracting test events and significant lifecycle efficiencies through consolidation of multiple current configuration management baselines logistics and training efforts into a unified support structure.  In FY 2013 CANES RDT&E investment will continue to fund platform set 3 and 4 baseline development.

Tasks in this PE support research development and test efforts in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phases of these systems. Beginning in FY 2013 funding on this Program Element was split into Projects C97 Aircraft Avionics and VU3 Networking and Mission Planning. The JTRS is the transformational system that provides Army Aviation interoperability capability for Future Force and Joint Force operations. The JTRS integration effort provides for the non-recurring engineering required to integrate and qualify the JTRS compliant radios with Link 16 and/or other advanced networking waveforms into the AH-64D Armed Aerial Scout (AAS) and Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). Funding in FY 2013 will continue the Apache Block 3 Link 16 integration to support ground and flight testing. Additional activities for FY 2013 include continuing development of common radio control software for use on multiple platform integrations finalizing the qualification of JTRS antennas and conducting platform antenna co-site and link quality analysis. The Improved Data Modem (IDM) is the common solution for digitizing Army Aviation. It performs as an internet controller and gateway to the Tactical Internet and Fire Support internet for Army aircraft. With interfaces supporting a six channel transmit/receive terminal the IDM provides radio connectivity to the ARC-201D/231 ARC-186 ARC-164 and the Blue Force Tracker's MT-2011 and AVX-06/203 Transceivers. IDM provides a flexible software driven digital messaging system that is interoperable with existing Army and Joint forces battlefield operating systems. The IDM provides Situational Awareness and Variable Message Format messages capability to the cockpit. The Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) is a precision approach and landing system providing joint operational capability for U.S. forces assigned to conventional and special operations missions including those operating from fixed base ship tactical and special mission environments under a wide range of meteorological and jamming conditions. The Army plans to integrate JPALS capabilities as defined by the Navy (Shipboard operations) and the Air Force (Land-based operations) through the JPALS Army Risk Reduction (JARR) and the JPALS Common Avionics Technology Development (JCATD) efforts. JARR defined implementation alternatives for aircraft integration. JCATD continues the alternative analysis. The ASN-128D upgrade program conducts system engineering trade studies to reduce space weight and power with the introduction of new navigation support capabilities such as inertial sensor MIL-STD-1553 interface card and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) map display and prepares Engineering Change Proposals to the existing ASN-128D Line Replaceable Units as a result of those trade studies.  The effort also derives ASN-128D GATM compliance matrices for current and planned GATM capabilities for the upcoming decade.ARC-220 radio improvements are required to increase operational capability and resolve emerging obsolescence issues. Software improvements will provide a quick Automatic Linking Process which will reduce the time for the radio to establish a communication link by more than 50% improve secure voice reliability and add automatic position reporting capability. FY 2011 funds will complete ARC-220 software and test system changes.The Aviation Mission Planning System (AMPS) interfaces with Army Mission Command Systems and initializes communication navigation situational awareness and weapons systems on fleet aircraft.

ATC systems are required to achieve or maintain compliance with civil military domestic and international air traffic control and combat identification requirements and mandates.  Funding will be utilized to develop evaluate and integrate candidate technology mandates.  Funded in this program element is the development of the Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS) Web Based Architecture and Airspace Improvements Initiative Advanced Surveillance Air Traffic Navigation Integration and Coordination System (ATNAVICS) modernization Mobile Tower System (MOTS) Tactical Terminal Control System (TTCS) Up-Armor Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and Fixed Base Precision Approach Radar (FBPAR) PrePlanned Product Improvements (P3I).  ATNAVICS provides all weather instrument flight capabilities to include enroute terminal radar precision approach and landing services to all Army Joint and allied aircraft.  The MOTS is a tactical mobile tower designed to meet the deployability and communication requirements of the current to future force.  TAIS develops software and required hardware for airspace management web services to operate effectively in a dynamic net-centric interconnected environment.  TAIS also integrates advanced surveillance interfaces to further enhance airspace integration and dynamic management capabilities.  FBPAR is the Army's primary ground controlled precision approach capability to provide recovery operations for aircraft to fixed base airfields during adverse weather conditions.  TTCS provides enhanced Air Traffic Services (ATS) communications support to aviation assets conducting reconnaissance maneuver medical evacuation logistics and intelligence operations across the battlefield.Funded project improvements to ATC systems including the TAIS and ATNAVICS will align these programs with advanced networking communications and interoperability goals and provide compatibility with the Army Aviation aircraft and avionics upgrade programs including military (Global Air Traffic Management) and civil initiatives (Next Gen).   In a networked battlefield joint service systems and radars provide operational data to ATC missions assuming a communications infrastructure and data processing capability is embedded in ATC systems.  ATC systems control and maintain information relevant to higher level organizations or other external systems; advanced networks and communications allow such information to be transmitted to include aircraft positional information weather data landing surface conditions airspace density airspace control orders restricted airspace and flight plan data.  As the Department of Defense transitions military aircraft to positional self-reporting technologies these various technologies will be demonstrated and tested prior to integration into the ATC systems.  Advanced Surveillance integrates aircraft self-reporting technologies which include Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) Mode 5 and Mode S.  Initial testing and integration of these systems are foundational to Advanced Surveillance to increase ATC systems availability to detect manage and disseminate aircraft information.  ATNAVICS will network its advanced surveillance data (Mode 5 and Mode S) to aviation and joint network nodes starting with TAIS.  TAIS the Army's Program of Record for Enhanced Flight Traffic Management Services and Airspace Command and Control (AC2) requires the development and testing of web-based services. TAIS P3I include but are not limited to developing and testing improvements to the air picture including the addition of Blue Force Tracker (BFT) correlation and radar fusion capability.  To facilitate increased maintenance and system support a remote maintenance capability will be developed for robust maintenance and troubleshooting.  TTCS Up-Armor NRE includes approval of the final Analysis of Alternative (AoA) concept design award of a design contract based on this design and production of an Up-Armor TTCS prototype.","","","",

The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information and distribution of relevant red (threat) gray (non-aligned) and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning and targeting capability.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors other information sources all Warfighting Functions and the Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed and Mobile configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested annual software releases are integrated into Army Common/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process.FY13 Base funding in the amount of $40.876 million will be used for development of the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) as the Lead for PEO IEW&S.  As such DCGS-A is currently aligning its architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan.  This alignment is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision.DCGS-A software will be tailored by echelon and scalable to each unit's mission.  DCGS-A provides commanders and staffs the ability to maintain an accurate and up to date understanding of the operational environment.  DCGS-A's contributions to commanders' visualization and situational awareness rapid planning and the synchronization of all warfighting functions enable Army units to operate within the enemy's decision cycle.  This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from humanitarian to major combat operations.The DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a Cloud Processing Architecture.  Main Cloud nodes will be placed in data centers strategically located across the globe while tactical edge Cloud nodes will be integrated within select existing equipment currently on units Modified Tables of Organization & Equipment (MTOE).  The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers where the data is stored.  This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems.  The first DCGS-A Cloud node reached its initial operating capability in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in FY11. The design development and initial deployment of prototype tactical edge nodes will be in 4QFY11.  Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12/Full Deployment Decision in 4QFY12 DCGS-A Software Baseline (DSB) 1.0 capability will be deployed throughout the Army.DCGS-A consolidates enhances and modernizes the tasking processing exploitation and dissemination (TPED) capabilities formerly found in nine Army intelligence programs of record and two Quick Reaction Capabilities.  DCGS-A provides these technologically advanced PED capabilities in tailored and scalable mobile and fixed configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.

In support of Army operations Generating-Force functions and institutional processes M&S Cross-Command Collaboration and Integration addresses analytical efforts underlying decision making capability development and life-cycle costs by capitalizing on M&S technologies (accomplished through collaborative efforts of the training/operations and acquisition communities).  The RDTE component of M&SC3I encompasses efforts that (1) develop/improve new/existing models and simulations to reduce time resources and risks associated with operational/institutional decision making and the acquisition process and (2) advance the following disciplines: M&S research analysis and experimentation; simulation technology; and M&S tools and services.  M&SC3I applies to development of tactics and doctrine experimentation and exercises traditional weapon system development and assessment and transition of advanced technologies to operational capabilities.  The overarching goal of M&SC3I is to reduce the time and cost of providing improved capabilities to the war fighter.  Emerging information-age technologies continue to revolutionize the Army's ability to collaborate among all stakeholders using data descriptions digital representations and virtual prototypes to improve understanding of required capabilities shorten procurement time reduce procurement and sustainment costs and ultimately reduce total life-cycle cost.  M&SC3I advocates the use of advanced technologies to enable future capabilities through improved understanding of operational requirements collaborative analyses of emerging technologies and cross-domain participation in experiments and exercises.  The following are discussions of efforts under the three projects of PE 0605718.  Under the project "HQDA Decision Support Tools and Services HQDA and its agencies develop new analytical M&S tools and/or obtain commercially available analytical M&S tools and services that provide rapid and reliable decision support to Army staff and field operating agencies assigned to Headquarters Department of the Army. " Under the project "Analysis M&S Tools and Services" the Army develops M&S tools and services (e.g. hardware software infrastructure) for the Army's analysis community.  The primary users of these tools and services are the Training and Doctrine Command Analysis Center (TRAC) the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA) and the Center for Army Analysis (CAA).  Efforts focus on (1) development of analysis tools that will enable assessment of emerging technologies during concept exploration and (2) development of infrastructure and enabling technologies to support the Current and Future Force.  These critical efforts are required for 1) analysis-of-futures work to justify Army requirements 2) assessment of alternative approaches to satisfy those requirements 3) development of current and emerging war fighting doctrine from the tactical to the operational levels of warfare and 4) the closing of closing capability gaps in the areas of irregular warfare M&S data and standards cyberspace operations army network modeling and non-lethal weapons.  Under the project "Army Simulation Technology (SIMTECH)" the Army enhances force effectiveness by inducing research organizations on a short-term basis to conduct high-priority promising simulation research initiatives that are outside the scope of Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) and Army Science and Technology (S&T) programs.

This program element supports the Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) of medical and non-medical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) medical and non-medical CB Defense initiatives.  DoD missions for civil support operations have recently expanded and have resulted in providing focus to develop technologies to support CB counterterrorism initiatives.  Projects within BA4 are structured to consolidate Joint and Service-unique tasks within four commodity areas: contamination avoidance individual and collective force protection decontamination and medical countermeasures.  ADC&P is conducted for an array of chemical biological and toxin detection and warning systems providing early warning collector concentrators generic detection improved reagents and decontamination systems using solutions that will remove and/or detoxify contaminated materiel without damaging combat equipment personnel or the environment.  CB sensors and diagnostics enhance the Departments environmental and medical surveillance efforts by improving the monitoring and surveillance of threats and forces preparing for and engaged in military operations.  These efforts are required to enable military commanders and the Military Health System to prevent treat and mitigate threats to individual Service Members and military units.  Integration of CB sensor and diagnostic data from the programs in this ACD&P will also be usable within the homeland security and Federal public health common operating pictures.  The Secretary of Defense is responsible for research development acquisition and deployment of medical countermeasures to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD unlike those developed to support U.S. population must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasizes prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this ACD&P such as vaccines against the most likely biological threat agents and traditional / non-traditional chemical agent prophylaxis conserves fighting strength decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation and satisfies the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available efforts on this ACD&P support pre-hospitalization treatment en-route care hospital care and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include improvements to CB diagnostics and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic agents and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  DoD is the only Federal activity conducting ACD&P on these prophylactic diagnostic and therapeutic CB medical countermeasures.  The Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  This Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process ("One Portfolio").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research development acquisition and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces it also accelerate and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research development and acquisition because of its unique facilities testing capabilities and trained and experienced personnel.  ACD&P also supports the Product Director Test Equipment Strategy and Support (PD TESS) providing for the development of updated test capabilities to evaluate Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Defense systems.  Also included is the Techbase Technology Transition effort which validates high-risk/high-payoff technologies that could significantly improve Warfighter capabilities.  The projects in this program element support efforts in the technology development phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 4.","Continuing","Continuing","",

Efforts have included: development of mission essential tasks; design development and implementation of performance metrics data and methodologies for the Joint Assessment and Enabling Capability to guide Training Transformation and support the Department’s balanced scorecard and Defense Readiness Reporting System; identified and defined joint urban training requirements identified methods to conduct effective joint training and determined best means to develop simulations military construction and other urban training facilities that meet Service joint and fiscal demands and requirements; developed joint training regimen requirements and investments ranging from the joint strategic level down to the joint tactical level for joint asymmetric warfare; and developed a joint stability and support operations training roadmap and investment plan for operations other than war including peace enforcement peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance.    Project 2:  The Defense Training Resources Analysis. This project supports DHRA and DoD training managers (OSD Joint Staff Unified Commands and the Services) in promoting more efficient and effective use of training resources increasing the effectiveness of military training and enhancing the readiness and performance of the military forces. Projects analyze the contributions to readiness of various training techniques and programs and use the results to expedite new training concepts and procedures that increase unit effectiveness or decrease costs. Emphasis is placed on developing analytical tools and systematic methodologies to improve training resource allocations.Project 3:  DoD Enlistment Processing and Testing. The project administers testing programs which enable the Armed Services to select highly qualified military recruits. The DoD uses a single test the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) to determine eligibility of military applicants and to report recruit quality data to Congress. High quality recruits are obtained from administering the ASVAB annually to approximately 600000 applicants for Military Service as part of the DoD Enlistment Testing program and to 1 million students in the DoD Student Testing program. Each Service also uses ASVAB test forms developed in this program as part of their in-service testing programs. New ASVAB test forms and related support materials are implemented approximately every four years. This allows DoD tomake measurement improvements as well as decrease the likelihood of test compromise. Ongoing RDT&E efforts include development and evaluation of procedures which (1) reduce or eliminate threats to the validity of the ASVAB test scores generated; (2) improve the efficiency of the test development calibration and validation process; and (3) improve selection and classification decisions made by each Service through more effective use of test score information. In addition periodic assessments are required to provide DoD manpower planners and Congress with information on aptitude trends in the population from which recruits are drawn.Project 4:   Federal Voting Assistance Program.  Given the agile planning and deployment flexibilities required in as dynamic a RDT&E environment as internet voting the FY 2013 execution plan will be significantly influenced by the results of the FY2011 and FY2012 research development and evaluation results.  However current plans are to initiate the first two phases of the internet voting demonstration competition challenge:o	Phase I of Internet Voting Competition Challenge:  In the first phase submissions will focus on defining security reliability usability and accountability requirements for internet voting systems. Submissions will be open to the public and will be open to public critique. FVAP will review those submissions and critiques and then consolidate them into a single set of requirements for Phase II. o	Phase II of Internet Voting Competition Challenge:  In this phase submission will provide high level designs and detailed hardware and software architectures along with procedures necessary for secure operation. Submissions will be sufficiently detailed so that a reasonably skilled information technologist could implement the system to allow for broader peer review.  However many details such as user interfaces and database layouts will be likely be undefined. As with the first phase submissions will be open for critique. In this phase critiques will focus on identifying areas where designs do not meet the requirements defined in the first phase. The result may be modification of architectures to incorporate ideas from several teams. At the conclusion of this phase the Department will narrow down the set of acceptable architectures. o	Conformance Testing to EAC Pilot Program Requirements for Kiosk Systems Used in a 2014 Election: To support the testing of internet voting systems from monitored kiosk test platform (where the ballots of record are printed out and delivered to jurisdictions like other absentee ballots but the same ballot is delivered electronically to the election jurisdiction for comparison to the paper ballot of record) the Department will test conformance of selected systems to the EAC Pilot Program Testing Requirements.  Again in 2014 the pilot effort will be limited to military voters at domestic US locations.  Project 5: Civilian HR automation enhancements planned for FY 2012 and FY 2013 are focused on software development to support the Department’s civilian workforce including readiness requirements for the development of automation for an expeditionary civilian workforce; an SES-focused performance management system; development of interfaces with the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) and other civilian HR systems to fully expand the Enterprise Staffing Solution; development of DCPDS interfaces with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) initiative mandates for HR Line of Business (LoB) electronic Official Personnel Folder Retirement Systems Modernization implementation and HR Line of Business. DoD is one of five designated Shared Service Centers in the federalgovernment focused on providing standard services across agency lines gaining potential significant business and cost-saving benefits. DoD is considered a leader in this initiative. Continues the conversion of employees back to other personnel systems as mandated in NDAA 2010 and designs new flexibilities to include but not limited to the establishment of policies and procedures for a new Performance Management System a redesigned hiring process adhering to veterans’ preference requirements a “Department of Defense Civilian Workforce Incentive fund” and a Mandatory Training and Retraining Program for Supervisors. DCPDS is the Department’s enterprise civilian HR system that has provided the savings originally projected in the achievement of full operational capability in 2002 and which has continued to operate as the DoD system serving over 800000 employee records. Additional initiatives to sustain the Department’s lead in automated systems to include expansion of employee self service functionality and systems to support civilian HR requirements of the intelligence and National Guardcommunities. All enhancements will support the Department’s focus on the further consolidation of civilian HR operations to a single operational site with linkage to Component operations worldwide.Project 6:  The integrated DoD SAPR Data Collection and Reporting System (Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database (DSAID)) must accommodate a variety of uses including the tracking of sexual assault victim support services support SAPR program administration program reporting requirements and data analysis. In order to facilitate analysis at the OSD level the System should be able to easily export data for analysis in computerized statistical applications such as Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Service field-level users may use the system to track support to victims of sexual assault throughout the lifecycle of that support requirement and to facilitate sexual assault case transfer between SARCs and Services. Service headquarters-level users will use the system to support program planning analysis and management. DoD SAPR Office (SAPRO) users and Service headquarters-level users will access the system to produce mandated and requested reports monitor program effectiveness and support cohort and trend analysis. The Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database (DSAID) will support SAPR programs for all active duty and Reserve personnel including National Guard (NG) Service members when on active duty or when performing active service and inactive duty training (as defined in Section (101)(d)(3) of Chapter 47 of title 10 United States Code) with the ability to expand to cover other DoD personnel as required. Additionally system implementation at the state level will provide a new capability to manage SAPR programs for National Guard personnel under Title 32 USC.  Implementation of this capability will be based on a state NG structure grouped according to state and subdivided into sexual assaults from the separate Army and Air National Guard.  Full Deployment and Delivery (FDD) is scheduled for Q4 FY2012 as a result additional RDT&E funding will not be required after FY2012.Project 7:  Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) acts as the authoritative source for identity and personnel information for the DoD Net Centric Enterprise Computing vision of the Department of Defense’s Global Information Grid (GIG 2.0). Based on the DEERS identities DMDC provides the key attribute service for the Department of Defense (DoD) Identity and Access Management (IdAM) Capability. The Enterprise Identity Attribute Service (EIAS) supports IdAM through the distribution of DoD person and personnel attributes to applications and services in a controlled consistent and secure manner to support ABAC decisions. The controlled authoritative information provided via EIAS can be used to confirm an individual’s identity affiliation to the DoD clearance pay grade/rank organization and occupation series for an authorization decision. A key attribute for decision makers is organization. The Global Force Management Data Initiative (GFM_DI) provides the unique organization identifier (OUID) in the EIAS payload. To meet the DoD demand for the OUID DMDC working with J8 and the Service/Agencies has to 1) establish the linkage between a person (EDI_PI) and the OUID 2) provide the OUID attribute in the EIAS payload for access decisions and 3) standardize the organizational attributes required to make access decisions. Project 8:  The Neo Tracking System (NTS) / Emergency Tracking Accountability System (ETAS) is a certified and accredited DoD automated system that accounts for and sustains visibility of noncombatant evacuees during a NEO under the authority of DODD 1000.25 DoD Personnel Identity Protection (PIP) Program. NTS is currently being used in the USAFRICOM USCENTCOM USEUCOM USSOUTHCOM and USPACOM AORs. The ETAS component is the CONUS domestic version of NTS and is for use by USNORTHCOM during disasters in the CONUS whether natural accidental or acts of terrorism. The primary purpose of the NTS/ETAS is to provide individual accountability of the evacuee by creating and maintaining a database of evacuees assembled during an evacuation operation and subsequently tracking the evacuees' movement throughout the evacuation process.Project 9:  The Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker Enterprise Suite (SPOT-ES) is the Department of Defense (DoD) system of record for accountability and visibility of contracts and contractor personnel authorized to operate in a contingency operation.  SPOT-ES provides web based tracking and visibility into contract services personnel and equipment locations; provides a common operational picture for Combatant Commanders; enhances the analytical tools to accurately plan for the quantity of contracted support required for future contingency operations; and collects accurate data for the OMB-directed quarterly census of all contractors supporting contingency operations.","Continuing","Continuing","",

It provides the necessary infrastructure and support services through a mission execution platform for MDA elements/components and designated Combatant Commanders` Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) operations executing missions at the MDIOC. The Integration Center is the organization responsible for providing a single integrated set of skilled personnel matrixed from across MDA to manage this mission. The MDIOC mission facilities consists of a highly secure research and development complex and a mission support module (area) located within a military installation (Schriever Air Force Base) that is adjacent to North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM). The MDA Integration Center provides mission critical system technical capabilities and subject matter expertise in a dedicated and adaptable environment that enables developers testers and operators to evolve assess and deliver the capabilities for layered missile defense execution for homeland defense and theater/regional support. The Missile Defense Integration and Operations Center (MDIOC) interfaces with the Information Technology/Information Assurance Enterprise to provide high availability access to worldwide secure communications network health and status monitoring mission critical restoral capability and technical expertise for all MDA directed activities and events. The MDIOC functions as the mission control for BMDS distributed ground test and system wide flight tests. The mission and test directors for these key tests control both main and associated test operations using secure voice test and mission network hubs at the MDIOC. The MDIOC also functions (within MDA`s capabilities-based acquisition strategy) as the only system-level integration and interoperability mission execution platform for BMDS fire control; and it provides the physical interface between the developers and the Combatant Command warfighters. MDIOC mission facilities contribute to the BMDS by directly supporting the concept of Concurrent Test Training and Operations (CTTO) for the BMDS. The MDIOC accomplishes this by providing engineering integration resource scheduling configuration management and implementation development support for MDA and BMDS-level test training and operational mission execution. The Integration Center provides engineering and operational integration by: 	-Implementing the technical event architectures for the models and simulations used to support missile defense planning seminarswargames exercises and analyses 	-Supporting the planning and execution of the only end-to-end operator-in-the-loop/element-in-the-loop missile defense wargames 	-Supporting BMDS Critical Engagement Conditions (CEC) testing and analysis by operating the Test Execution Control (TEC) for distributed BMDS ground tests (i.e. GTX GTI and GTD) and ensuring the integrity of their technical system architecture 	-Providing network operations and information assurance for all on-site integration activities 	-Integrating and sustaining the enabling infrastructure services and processes that support the operation of designated elements of the BMDS and resident Combatant Command operations and/or support centers 	-Providing technical support for the BMDS Watch Officers BMDS Safety Officers and Information Assurance Officers in their efforts to monitor and assess the health and status of the networks and elements that impact BMDS test and operations 	-Operating the Joint Early Warning Laboratory for anomaly resolution 	-Supporting the Intelligence Support Center for critical situational awareness intelligence on worldwide ballistic missile developments that could affect the development and/or operation of the BMDSMissile Defense Integration and Operations Center (MDIOC) Major Program Goals 	-Provide the capabilities and services necessary to support engineering integration resource scheduling for ground and flight tests configuration management and implementation development support of on-site activities 	-Ensure around the clock support and restoral of designated BMDS operational activities 	-Improve interface with designated Combatant Command missile defense activities; host/support the headquarters and operations center for United States Strategic Command Joint Functional Component Command - Integrated Missile Defense 	-Continue to achieve cost effectiveness and efficiencies through the leveraging of existing Missile Defense Integration and Operations Center infrastructure services processes and expertise to support assigned missions 	-Maintain and improve as designated the reliability availability and maintainability of mission critical systems MD40 consists of Program-Wide Support non-headquarters management costs in support of MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System .","Continuing","Continuing","",

Systemic software issues are significant contributors to poor program execution and reliance on software-intensive mobile and net-based products and systems has been increasing (e.g. Joint Tactical Radio System DDG-1000 Joint Strike Fighter F-22 and Army Modernization).  As stated in the 2010 National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences report entitled Critical Code “It is dangerous to conclude that we are reaching a plateau in capability and technology for software producibility.”  The report notes that software is “…unconstrained by traditional physical engineering limitations…” and what we can accomplish is derived “…from [the] human intellectual capacity to conceptualize and understand systems…”  With growing global parity in software engineering the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Program Element (PE) addresses the critical need to research develop and rapidly transition state-of-the-art technology and best practices to improve the engineering management fielding evolution and acquisition of software-intensive DoD systems.  The SEI PE’s program of work seeks to coordinate across the Department and the Services and leverages expertise in industry and academia to enable the development of Joint capabilities.Software is more pervasive than ever and computer programs are growing in size and complexity.  Designing managing and securing integrated complex and large-scale mission-critical systems are abilities that the DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) have not yet been mastered.  P781 of this PE funds the SEI Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  The SEI FFRDC is an institute which enables the exploitation of emerging software technology by bringing engineering management and security discipline to software acquisition development and evolution focusing on software technology areas judged to be of the highest payoff in meeting defense needs.Private sector investment has created rapid advances in information technologies but the pace of transition to DoD applications is often very slow or the commercial applications do not meet DoD-unique needs (e.g. high assurance software or large scale integrated systems). The DoD needs to create opportunities to discover emerging technologies to evaluate their potential to fit DoD needs and where appropriate conduct critical tests of the technologies under DoD conditions.  P783 of this PE includes the Software Producibility Initiative and Technology from Non-Traditional Sources (TNTS) Initiative.  The Software Producibility Initiative seeks to research and transition software science and tools to model and evaluate the performance and control complexities of software-intensive systems.  It also seeks to improve the design and sustainment of those systems.  The TNTS Initiative seeks to facilitate early interactions between innovative companies and DoD users to accelerate the application of emerging technical solutions addressing DoD needs reduce development costs avoid technological surprise and understand how commercial developments impact DoD programs.","Continuing","Continuing","",

The program increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is attributable to two major factors. In FY 2013 $16.000 million has been allocated to two new focal areas within P828 related to Combatant Commanders DoD and other Government Agencies concerns and requirements. The new focal area “Biometrics and Forensics” has been allocated $11.000 million to resource emerging technologies as DoD seeks to attribute enemy activity to specific individuals. The new focal area “Urban Characterization” has been allocated $5.000 million to resource development of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) electronic warfare kinetic and other capabilities needed for future military operations in a wide range of urban areas. The remaining factor relative to the FY 2012 to FY 2013 increase reflects the restoral to baseline of a FY 2012 budget reduction and DoD's continued emphasis on QRSP's proven ability to expedite development and transition of new technologies to the warfighter.","The QRSP Program supports five separate projects that provide rapid funding to expedite development and transition of new technologies to the warfighter.  The projects that are part of the QRSP are the Quick Reaction Fund (QRF) the Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) the RDT&E Architecture and Integration (RAI) program Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support and Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) support.  QRSP provides the flexibility to respond to emergent DoD issues and address technology surprises and needs within the years of execution outside the two-year budget cycle. P826:    Projects supported by Quick Reaction Funds (QRF) focus on responding to emergent conventional warfare needs during the execution years that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies.  Examples of the types of projects that are envisioned include:  force protection projects to enhance anti-access and area denial capabilities and broad electronic warfare capabilities.  QRF focuses on maturing technologies critically needed for the combatant commands and produces prototypes or demonstrates capabilities for evaluation within 12 months. P828:    The Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) objectives are to leverage the DoD science and technology base and those of the other federal departments; stimulate interagency coordination and cooperation; accelerate the fielding of capabilities and concepts to counter emerging threats; and provide feedback to the S&T community to guide long term developmental strategies.  The RRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  RRTO works to anticipate adversaries' exploitation of new technologies and advanced capabilities and develop counters to those capabilities.  Additionally the office works to leverage technology developed outside of DOD in the commercial sector academia international arenas and small non-traditional businesses to expose them to specific DoD needs areas as identified by Combatant Commanders Military Service organizations and other Defense Agencies and interagency organizations. The typical length of an RRTO program falls within a six to twelve month range in order to more effectively aid the warfighter. RRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 30 percent for demonstration programs (DOD Strategic Objective 4-3).  P830:    The RDT&E Architecture and Integration program objectives are to enhance and expand Yuma Proving Grounds rapid technology assessment capability in general and to enhance the Joint Experimentation Range Complexes (JERCs) venue in particular.  This include:  improving the broad-spectrum of evaluations to include analysis of a cohesive Forward Operating Base (FOB) defensive architecture; emerging homemade explosives (HME); future Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs); counter IED capability development; and characterization of evolving electro-magnetic environments.  These focal align under the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) focal area “Institutionalizing Rapid Acquisition Capability” and its third tenant “Assessing Alternatives and Executing a Solution (Acquisition).”P831:  The Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) objectives are focused on responding to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) that have been submitted by Combatant Commanders and validated by the Joint Staff.  The JRAC’s objective is to manage the delivery of capability as requested by the Combatant Command (COCOM) in a time frame acceptable to the COCOM.  The JRAC manages the overall effort to fulfill JUONS.  Efforts in most instances are conducted outside of the processes described for the Defense Acquisition System in DoD Directive 5000.1 and utilize contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.P833:  The objective of the Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) Cell is to support all COCOMs Joint Force Commanders and all other government agencies by assessing complex operational/technical challenges which require multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the United States Government academia and the private sector the SMA cell develops solution options to COCOM generated challenging problems and informs the command’s senior leadership.  Each SMA effort is initiated at the request of senior COCOM leadership.  Products are typically produced within six months and directly contribute to the decision making process of COCOM’s senior leaders.","Continuing","Continuing","",

The JCTD BA-4 PE and DAE BA-5 Pilot Program PEs ended.Today's operations require even faster delivery of new capabilities.  Therefore the JCTD Program was revised to accelerate project selection encourage capability demonstration of more short projects (one year or less) and fewer long projects (two to three years) and increase the delivery rate of new capabilities.  This new process includes: streamlined project approval and initiation; clear one-year deliverables and decision points for projects greater than a year in duration; and annual reviews of ongoing JCTDs to assess deliverables and continuation of the project.","The Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) Program directly addresses Joint Coalition and/or Interagency capability needs expressed by Combatant Commands (COCOMs).  Due to significant successes since inception of the program (initially the Advanced Capability Technology Demonstration (ACTD) Program) the JCTD Program is now viewed by COCOMs as a primary means to rapidly develop assess and transition needed capabilities into operations.  Through partnering with other solution providers and resource sponsors the JCTD Program typically leverages $2 in partner funding for every $1 in the JCTD budget.  Thus the value and impact of JCTDs to the COCOMs is significantly greater than a typical Research and Development program.Key values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:- The program has a long history of providing enduring capabilities.  To date over 90 percent of completed JCTDs have successfully transitioned capabilities to warfighters.  70 percent of completed ACTD projects successfully transitioned their products.  (See “Section D.  Acquisition Strategy” for transition discussion).- The program delivers capabilities rapidly.  Projects execute within the Department of Defense (DoD) Planning Programming Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.  In other words when a new capability need is identified a JCTD project can be started and completed before funding can start in the traditional PPBE cycle.  The result is that 74 JCTD/ACTD projects delivered capabilities used in Operation Iraqi Freedom and 57 projects delivered capabilities to Operation ENDURING FREEDOM.  Most of those capabilities would not have been delivered - or would have been significantly delayed – without the JCTD program.  A recent example is the Persistent Ground Surveillance System (PGSS) JCTD which quickly (several months) demonstrated and assessed aerostat and integrated sensor technologies to provide wide area surveillance for forward operating bases.  Success has led to procurement of over 30 PGSS systems providing 24 hour protection to bases in Afghanistan.- The program enables Coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources.  More than one quarter of JCTD projects involve some coalition participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom Canada Australia the Republic of Korea and the Republic of Singapore.- The program enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects such as projects with the Department of Homeland Security Department of State and Department of Transportation.  Recent examples are interdepartmental collaborations for maritime awareness air domain information sharing tunnel detection and characterization and Arctic awareness.- The program enables rapid response to new DoD priorities before Service PPBE cycles can respond.  For example the Department has recently established priorities for Building Partner Capacity understanding human terrain and nuclear forensics.  The JCTD Program quickly responded and is providing initial capabilities that are transitioning to Service efforts.MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  Metrics include: all JCTDs will have deliverables within 12 months to enable assessment for project continuation; 50 percent of JCTDs will provide an operationally-relevant prototype within 12 months; and 75 percent will complete final demonstration within 24 months of receiving funding.  JCTDs will spiral products and deliverables during the demonstration.  At least 75 percent of JCTD projects will transition products to a Program of Record (POR) residual operations or availability for procurement from the General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule.Transition Achievement:  The JCTD program has been achieving actual transition rates in excess of the stated goal.  The JCTD Program defines transition as a project’s product(s) going to new or existing POR providing residual capabilities sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations or commodity-type capabilities entered onto GSA schedule for procurement by Department users.  14 of 18 completions in FY 2011 successfully transitioned.","Continuing","Continuing","",

The C2BMC enables the BMDS to manage complex threats -- near simultaneous enemy missile shots aimed at theater regional or homeland assets. The systems linked through C2BMC include Phased Array Tracking Radar Intercept on Target (PATRIOT) Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Ground Based Midcourse Defense (GMD); and sensors such as the Army Navy/Ground Transportable Radar Surveillance model 2 (AN/TPY-2) radar Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX) Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and (BMDS) Overhead Persistent Infra-Red (OPIR) Architecture (BOA). The C2BMC Program will ship a C2BMC Deployable Interface Node (CDIN) with a forward based AN/TPY-2 identified for a future BMDS deployment. The C2BMC program will also upgrade existing suite to Spiral 6.4 suite for Central Command (CENTCOM) install communications support hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) integration testing provide operations and distrainment and add a training suite in CENTCOM. Based on the Missile Defense Agency`s defined architectures and system specifications the C2BMC program will provide the warfighter the capability to plan the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) fight while concurrently tracking all potential ballistic missile threats and pairing any sensor with any shooter to defeat ballistic missile threats at any range in any phase in all theaters. C2BMC battle management via the Global Engagement Manager (GEM) will deliver full X-Band radar sensor control and capabilities for Improved threat object correlation which calculates a common threat track from multiple sensors through data fusion with sufficient data accuracy and timeliness for BMDS weapon Elements to enable successful engagements via Link-16 and Extremely High Frequency (EHF) satellite communications. The C2BMC program will also work to increase coalition partners` capabilities. The C2BMC Program will expand defense of the United States allies and deployed forces by continuing work which has focused on limited Iranian long-range threats by enabling a coordinated defense against short- to intermediate-range threats in two regions/theaters. One of the best ways to dissuade deter and defeat ballistic missile threats is through integrated ballistic missile defense capabilities: weapons; sensors; and command and control battle management and communications. A potential or actual attack may cross regions and may fly higher and faster than stand-alone autonomous capabilities operated by a single Military Service can defend against. Integrated Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities draw on space- land- and sea-based assets operated by multiple Services to provide the best sensor information about the enemy missiles location and track a more diverse and effective set of weapon options to be used by the Combatant Commander to defeat the attack; with all connected by a unifying Command and Control Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) system. As a result an effort funded in a program element may be critical to the success of efforts in other program elements. These connections are referred to as interdependencies.","Continuing","Continuing","",

Based on the Systems Engineering assessments of realistic threat scenarios test events demonstrate capability of the evolving integrated layered missile defense system in a simultaneous test and operations environment. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) employs a systematic review of BMDS testing that establishes a convention for setting test objectives that go beyond simply exercising newly delivered elements of the system. The BMDS Test Program establishes and documents in the Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP) the test requirements for the BMDS with specific focus on collecting the data needed for the verification validation and accreditation (VV&A) of the BMDS models and simulations (M&S). The BMDS performance evaluation strategy is to develop M&S of the BMDS and compare predictions to empirical data collected through comprehensive flight and ground testing to validate accuracy. Critical Engagement Conditions (CECs) and Empirical Measurement Events (EMEs) are the conditions and events which define or describe the data to be obtained from flight and ground tests in order to anchor M&S. CECs and EMEs are utilized to design a test to further advance the understanding and confidence of the M&S tool set that will be used to evaluate all possible engagements. MDA testing is based on an integrated developmental and operational test program. The MDA Test Program is based on a commitment to deploy technology that is proven cost-effective and adaptable to an evolving security environment. MDA in full collaboration with its IMTP stakeholders: Combatant Commands; Service Operational Test Agencies (OTAs); Director Operational Test & Evaluation; and Director Developmental Test and Evaluation develops and approves the IMTP which aligns the BMDS Test Program to the PAA phases for proven capability delivery. This PE provides consolidated MDA-wide capabilities and resources for the planning design execution provision of infrastructure and management of BMDS testing. This PE also provides funding to the Operational Test Agencies (OTA) which are active in all phases of test planning execution and post-test analysis to include the development of the IMTP. Also including in this PE is funding to the Targets and Countermeasures (TC) program office for the development and procurements of ballistic missile targets and countermeasures for the BMDS in support of the MDA flight test program. Targets are representative of feasible future threats and flight test requirements are derived from the CECs and EMEs and are documented in the Agency`s IMTP. The Test and Targets PE is grouped into two major areas: Test and Evaluation; Targets and Countermeasures. This PE also includes the test related program content: Concurrent Test Training and Operations (CTTO); Engineering Test Analysis; Facilities Siting and Environmental Management; and Fielding and Integration. BMDS Test Program Functions: -Directs the testing required to verify validate and accredit (VV&A) MDA`s models and simulation (M&S).-Plans tests according to BMDS and Element objectives.-Develops MDA test policy. -Executes BMDS ground and flight tests. -Ensures appropriate data is collected at the necessary fidelity. -Collects data for BMDS analysis and manages MDA data centers. -Provides BMDS and Element performance results for IMTP stakeholders. -Provides final target system integration target mission logistics and launch execution for BMDS test target systems.-Provides test resources to support flight and ground tests. Major Test Program Goals: -Direct planning execution analyses and reporting of BMD system test events to support system verification.-Improve test execution and discipline for on-time successful testing. -Integrate Element test processes into BMDS processes. -Develop Element Lessons Learned and Best Practices to support BMDS test design. -Provide required infrastructure and environmental compliance for robust BMDS testing. -Ensure test readiness realism and accuracy and improve test execution quality. Targets and Countermeasures element level testing is funded as part of a developmental program and reflected in this Program Element (PE) submission. This PE also provides Targets and Countermeasures participation in the consolidated MDA-wide System Test Program and the resources for the planning design execution and management of Targets and Countermeasures in BMD System testing in accordance with the BMDS Test Policy. This applies to all Flight Integrated Ground and Distributed Ground Tests and Post-Test Analysis and reconstructions listed in the IMTP. BMDS Targets and Countermeasures Functions: The Targets and Countermeasures (TC) program office is responsible for executing the development and procurement of targets to support testing of the BMDS. The multiple targets (3 types) provided by TC are across four target classes: Short Range Ballistic Missiles (SRBM) Medium Range Ballistic Missiles (MRBM) Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBM) and Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM). It provides targets representative of feasible future threats for use in BMDS testing to verify models and simulations as well as to verify BMDS performance across a broad range of operational conditions. TC has realized past and future savings by centralized competition and management of targets and countermeasures using efficient procurement and lot buys resulting in economies of scale and cost savings. Targets and Countermeasures Contribution to the BMDS: -Type-1 Targets are simple baseline configurations-Type-2 Targets have increased capability or complexity-Type-3 Targets have a unique configuration and are procured in low unit quantities -Provides the BMDS risk reduction through measurements of flight testing to include technology demonstration algorithms model validation and threat and countermeasures characterization.-Collects and provides test data in order to support effectiveness suitability and interoperability assessments.

The JCD&E Enterprise includes the combatant commands the military services the National Guard Bureau the Joint Staff the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and several Defense agencies.  Intra-government agencies and coalition partners often participate in JCD&E processes and projects.  The Joint Staff J7 executes the JE program and leads the JCD&E Enterprise.  To ensure the program focuses on needs of the warfighters joint experiments originate from an annual call for nominations from combatant commands and Services and from assessment of combatant command identified critical warfighting capability gaps articulated in combatant command Integrated Priority Lists and Joint Urgent Needs documents submitted to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS).  JE nominations undergo preliminary analysis by the JCD&E Enterprise to confirm suitability for experimentation alignment to strategic guidance and where feasible to associate closely related subjects for economy of effort.  The resultant list is termed Warfighter Challenges (WFCs) and constitutes experimentation efforts eligible for design and execution.  These efforts are prioritized and approved by the combatant command and Service members of the Executive Council.  Experimentation plans are developed in consultation with JE partners and consolidated into an annual program of joint experimentation known as the JCD&E Campaign Plan.  The Executive Council meets regularly to review and approve the progress of the efforts in the campaign plan.  The JCD&E Campaign Plan allows the Department to synchronize experimentation efforts over multiple years to avoid duplication of effort and to create synergy among the defense experimentation entities.    JE experiments and activities examine potential solutions for combatant command operational needs through targeted Doctrine Organizational Training Materiel Leadership Personnel Facilities and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) improvements.  JE tackles joint concept and capability issues demanding sophisticated analysis innovative design and complex execution.  JE addresses topics that would prove difficult for individual combatant commands and Services to capture in the context of their immediate operational and force generation responsibilities.  Experiments and efforts produce a range of outcomes inclusive of fundamental joint doctrine inputs to major policy documents such as the Quadrennial Defense Review and the Defense Planning and Programming Guidance (DPPG). In partnership with the combatant commands and Services JE mitigates operational risk by establishing procedural models to conduct emergent concepts like Irregular Warfare Integrated Financial Operations and Joint Operational Access that are not yet instantiated in conventional force generation.  The results are briefed to Functional Capability Boards who integrate solutions into their functional investment plans.","Continuing","Continuing","R2Long",

This strategy will also integrate the lessons learned from the ORS program office’s accomplishments into existing space programs of record.

Stores are carried in countless different loading combinations determined by operational and training scenarios missions tactics and weapon development programs. Aircraft stores combinations change as operational plans and tactics change and as new stores are developed and fielded. Before operational training or test use the Air Force must certify these configurations for safe loading carriage and separation (jettison and normal release); as well as verify ballistics accuracy under the user-certified carriage and employment parameters. The Air Force SEEK EAGLE program completes certification recommendations and recommended flight clearances through any combination of engineering analysis wind tunnel testing modeling and simulation and ground/flight test and evaluation. In support of certification the program recommends about 1000 aircraft/store combinations for flight each year with analysis and testing requiring from weeks to years depending on the complexity. Integrated solutions for combat aircrew weapon delivery planning problems are developed and provided to combat forces via Combat Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS).  SEEK EAGLE works in coordination with the Air Force Safety Center to provide Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) analysis and certification recommendations of ordnance systems containing electro-explosive devices. The program is also responsible for inserting new and emerging technologies into the SEEK EAGLE process as well as providing resources for the sustainment of a viable Air Force aircraft/store certification capability.SEEK EAGLE funds are currently budgeted to support certification testing and analysis for new and inventory stores including but not limited to: Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) Laser Joint Direct Attack Munitions (LJDAM) Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) Air Intercept Missile (AIM-9X) Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AIM-120AMRAAM) Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) BRU-57 (Smart Bomb Rack) BRU-61 (SDB Bomb Rack) low collateral damage warhead (BLU-129) Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD) Sniper Targeting Pod with video data link LITENING Targeting Pod with video data link laser guided bombs laser guided Maverick (AGM-65L) F-22 supersonic tank practice bomb (BDU-50) and Aircraft Instrumentation Pod (AN/ASQ-T50).

AWACS provides a real-time picture of friendly neutral and hostile air activity. Its capabilities include all-altitude/all-weather surveillance of the battle space; early warning of enemy actions; a real-time ability to find fix track and assess airborne or maritime threats; and detection location and identification of electronic emitters.This program element funds three areas in support of the AWACS program:  1. AWACS Modernization 2. AWACS Infrastructure and Support Systems and 3. Material Solutions Development and Analysis. Each of the three areas includes studies and analysis to support both current planning and execution as well as future program planning.1. AWACS Modernization (RDT&E AF):a. Block 40/45 is replacing AWACS 1970's vintage mission systems that are experiencing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues are difficult and expensive to upgrade and limit overall AWACS system performance. The Block 40/45 upgrade will improve integration quality and timeliness of sensor data to the shooter improve Combat Identification (CID) improve AWACS contribution to Time Critical Targeting via Data Link Infrastructure (DLI) improve electronic support measures processing and enable more effective faster upgrades via an open-system Ethernet-based architecture. The upgrade will also update the ground support infrastructure including training systems.b. The Next Generation Identification Friend or Foe (NGIFF) Program provides AWACS with enhanced IFF interrogator operation to add a more secure Mode 5 capability. NSA declared IFF Mode 4 unsecure and obsolete on 5 Nov 2003. Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo 047-07 requires IFF Mode 5 interrogation capability by FY14. The new Mode 5 interrogation capability extends the effective range of the AWACS interrogator while helping discriminate against closely spaced cooperative targets. NGIFF developed and integrated a basic Mode 5 capability on Block 30/35 starting in FY09 and began developing a full Mode 5 on Block 40/45 in FY11. Hardware will be common between the platforms. NGIFF will also integrate Mode S a civilian air traffic control capability residing in the NGIFF hardware as funding allows.c. Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) Replacement of Avionics for Global Operations and Navigation (DRAGON) completes the FAA/International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)/ EUROCONTROL air traffic control mandated safety of flight capabilities. This program will provide the E-3 fleet with the flight instruments and other avionics for the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) and the surveillance and communication capabilities necessary to maintain continued critical unrestricted access to global airspace. Non-compliance will result in airspace restrictions and denials that will impact AWACS ability to support worldwide responses to situations requiring immediate on-scene command and control (C2) battle management. The DRAGON modifications replace the existing DMS Global Positioning System (GPS) Integrated Navigation System (GINS) with a modern Flight Management System (FMS) that will accommodate new capabilities including Mode 5 IFF and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). Also included as part of the modification is the addition of data link communications voice and data link digital radios and improved visual displays. Emphasis on employment of COTS avionics is expected to lower cost reduce the tech refresh cycle and enhance life cycle management. Replacement of critical avionics subsystems that became unsustainable beginning in 2010 is included in the DRAGON program. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of DRAGON is being executed cooperatively between the US and NATO.d. The Flight Performance Software (FPS) program automates calculations currently performed manually by the pilot and flight engineer in accordance with the E-3B and C flight manual.  Phase I automates the Takeoff and Landing (TOLD) calculations; Phase II automates the high speed calculation.  Automated calculations using the original source data used to create the flight manual charts increases safety improves on time departure/arrival improves crew efficiency and reduces tanker support.2.  AWACS Infrastructure and Support Systems (RDT&E AF): These efforts synchronize modernization requirements and infrastructure support across the entire weapon system from depot and field test equipment to maintenance trainers to simulators to integration labs to the TS-3 Developmental Test and Evaluation Aircraft.a. Test System-3/AWACS Development Integration Test Support (ADITS): The E-3 AWACS Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) aircraft Test System 3 (TS-3 tail number 73-1674) is a government owned/contractor managed maintained and operated system level DT&E asset. Together TS-3 and ADITS provide test-ready assets to support AWACS modernization with already imbedded test points to support sub-system and system level developmental testing per Boeing's TS-3 design specifications. This level of DT&E testing supports both advanced and sustainment projects which allow AWACS to participate in live-fly exercises (e.g. Joint Expeditionary Force Experiment/JEFX; Empire Challenge/EC) and ground-based interoperability testing. These assets also support multiple international Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) projects on a fee basis including projects for France Saudi Arabia United Kingdom Japan and NATO AEW&C efforts.TS-3 one of the first AWACS production aircraft is qualified to Boeing manufacturer design specifications unlike fleet aircraft which are qualified to technical orders.  In FY12 the Air Force divested TS-3. Beginning in FY13 the ADITS activity will be covered in the Training Support and Infrastructure (TSI) effort.  b. The Training Support and Infrastructure (TSI) programs cover required cross-cutting programs and activities in support of AWACS modernization and enhancement efforts. These include managing the AWACS developmental infrastructure support for equipment concurrency modernization planning/analysis trainer/simulator integration and concurrency as well as the Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL). The E-3 Radar Systems Integration Lab/Software Development Facility (SIL/SDF) is maintained operated and supported by contract to provide customers with a functioning E-3 radar configuration in support of AWACS US FMS and International radar development production and sustainment programs. New support equipment technologies and test strategies need to be analyzed to ensure concurrent capability to sustain existing modified and upgraded E-3 equipment. Trainer/simulator concurrency analysis and requirements definition is necessary to ensure trainers and simulators are kept current with the AWACS baseline. Associate contractor agreements are used to integrate the planning and execution between the prime integrator and training service providers.  In FY13 TSI will continue the remaining ADITS activity which includes the Avionics Integration Laboratory.3.  Material Solutions Development & Analysis (RDT&E AF): These efforts look toward the future by investigating enhanced capabilities and exploring new mission areas through C2ISR System Development while advancing the capabilities of the current weapon system through Support The War Fighter (STWF).a. Command & Control Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) system improvements investigate and develop future capabilities of the AWACS weapon system or next C2ISR platform. These efforts also include investigation analysis and development to ensure that AWACS successfully integrates with joint and coalition forces in a net-centric environment. C2ISR primarily supports Pre-Systems Acquisition in the areas of Material Solution Analysis and Technology Development. This is accomplished by prototyping and demonstrating capabilities required by the warfighter but also includes developing an E-3 Modernization & Sustainment Roadmap that projects user capability needs as well as material solutions for the user needs. Examples of supporting activities include but are not limited to:      (1) Evaluating emerging operational needs concepts and technologies to enable integration of AWACS' capabilities to align with integrated C2ISR network architectures as defined in Joint Vision 2020 C2 Constellation Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and Air Force CONOPS.     (2) Improving sensors and identifying new sensor technologies and netted sensor architectures to meet evolving threats; communications including development of communication roadmaps and assessing related technologies e.g.: all forms of Internet Protocol (IP) communications and multi-sensor integration such as the ability to send receive and fuse the air (and ground) picture via data link to fighter aircraft through rapid prototyping modeling simulation and participation in Joint exercises (e.g. JEFX and EC).     (3) Improving the timeliness and accuracy of information passed to/from fighter aircraft in the engagement zone by providing consistent and re-playable post-mission data to provide quicker reaction capabilities to support the air war.     (4) Exploring concepts investigating emerging and developing technologies and demonstrating efforts that  support continuous improvements and self-protection for C2ISR capabilities of manned & unmanned platforms space data links and advanced Battle Management decision tools.b. Support the War Fighter (STWF): STWF efforts support AWACS capability to create and sustain the force. Examples of these activities include but are not limited to:  Designing developing and modernizing equipment and systems to ensure AWACS can respond to urgent wartime/contingency acquisition requirements (e.g. Urgent Operational Needs (UONs) and Wartime Urgent & Compelling Needs (WUCNs)). Upgrading key capabilities to meet contingency needs modernizing test systems integrating battle management and data link enhancements and supporting Reliability Maintainability and Availability (RM&A) initiatives which:     (1) Improve the Mission Capable (MC) rate through RM&A analysis and development projects to provide system improvements that help meet or exceed the required MC rate. These efforts focus on increasing reliability of the air vehicle command and control systems voice and data communications systems computer sensor systems and infrastructure improvements.     (2) Solve DMS logistics problems.     (3) Insert new technologies with the aim of reducing maintenance man-hours along with programmed depot maintenance (PDM) improvements to increase aircraft availability.c. Electronic Protection (EP): In FY13 EP is a new effort.  The E-3 interim radar upgrade will design and develop capability improvements to the AWACS radar that provide enhanced war fighter capability in a subset of modes identified under the Radar Modernization Program (RMP) study.  The enhanced capability will be available to the airborne radar technician and to the AWACS operators.Budget Justification: This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational Systems Development these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","Continuing","Continuing","R2Long",

The Minuteman Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) Program Upgrade (MMPU) modernizes existing Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Launch Control Center (LCC) Extremely High Frequency (EHF) communications to provide an Advanced EHF (AEHF) capability and a capability for Missile Combat Crew Members to have operator control of the terminal in the LCC to switch rapidly among various satellite constellations.  This upgrade will be compatible with AEHF satellite and the supporting key management infrastructure (crypto interoperability).  AEHF is an Extended Data Rate (XDR) waveform that provides more secure transmit/receive at higher data rate frequencies than the low data rate frequencies currently used on MILSTAR satellites. The AEHF terminal will provide both receive and report-back capability.  These modifications comply with USSTRATCOM requirement for strategic terminals to communicate at higher data rates.Ground Element MEECN System (GEMS) contract was terminated for convenience by the government on 16 Jun 2011.  Program has been replaced by Global ASNT.Nuclear Command Control and Communications (NC3) Long Term Solution (LTS) was a FY12 New Start but was cancelled during the FY13 budget development due to higher Air Force priorities.Global Aircrew Strategic Network Terminal (Global ASNT) provides secure survivable inter-site intra-site and mobile VLF and Advanced EHF communication to bomber tanker reconnaissance units and mobile support teams with strategic responsibilities. This program is in Budget Activity 07 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","Continuing","Continuing","",

The purpose is to help test organizations improve and develop their test infrastructure and capabilities to keep pace with improvements in weapon system technologies.  The improvement and modernization (I&M) requirements are defined through the AF Test Investment Planning & Programming (TIPP) Process.  Also all projects have been reviewed through the Tri-Service Reliance process (to communicate AF efforts to the other Services and avoid unwarranted duplication of effort) and are documented in Reliance Area Capability Summaries (RACS).  Further each project has its own planning development equipment acquisition equipment installation and checkout phases which often require significant differences in funding from one year to the next.  As such the changes in category funding from year to year do not necessarily indicate program growth but rather a planned phasing of improvement and modernization efforts.  The test capabilities at these locations enable testing through all phases of weapon system acquisition from system concept exploration through component and full scale integrated weapon system testing to operational testing.  These test organizations are a part of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) operated and maintained by the Air Force for DoD test and evaluation.  These national test assets are available to others requiring their unique capabilities.The 46TW at Eglin AFB FL conducts and supports developmental test and evaluation (DT&E) of non-nuclear air armaments; Command Control Communications Computers Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems; target acquisition and weapon delivery systems; navigation systems; provides a climatic simulation capability; and determines target/test item spectral signatures.  The 46TG at Holloman AFB NM provides independent test and evaluation of inertial Global Positioning System and integrated systems used for aircraft navigation and missile guidance systems including vulnerability to electronic interference; provides the liaison function for coordinating and scheduling all US Air Force test operations at White Sands Missile Range; provides subsonic through hypersonic ground testing of aircraft and missiles in a flight-representative environment under highly instrumented conditions; and executes flight test and test support for advanced avionics and weapons development of joint international and commercial test programs.AEDC at Arnold AFB TN provides pre-flight and reliability ground environmental test support for DoD aeropropulsion flight systems and space and missile programs.  The center has 53 test facilities providing: aerodynamic testing of scale model aircraft missiles and space systems; testing of large and full-scale satellites sensors and space vehicles in a simulated space environment; altitude environmental testing for aircraft missile and spacecraft propulsion systems; and testing of large-scale models such as space boosters together with their propulsion systems.AFFTC at Edwards AFB CA conducts and supports DT&E and Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) of aircraft and aircraft systems aerospace research vehicles unmanned aerial vehicles cruise missiles parachute delivery/recovery/systems and cargo handling systems.I&M efforts within this PE are identified in four mission area categories:  Airframe/Propulsion/Avionics (APA); Armament/Munitions (A/M); Command Control Communications Computers Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (C4ISR); and Space.  These categories describe general types of effort that will be conducted in this PE.  APA provides planning improvements and modernization needed for test capabilities to conduct and support DT&E and OT&E of aircraft and aircraft systems aerospace research vehicles unmanned aerial vehicles cruise missiles parachute delivery/recovery systems cargo handling systems and turbine engines.  APA focuses on evaluation of the vehicle airframe propulsion system and avionics systems as well as overall systems integration testing.  It encompasses both ground test facilities and open-air range infrastructure including instrumentation and data processing.  A/M provides planning improvements and modernization to conduct DT&E of air-to-ground and air-to-air armaments and munitions which include gun chaff and flare systems as well as aerial decoy and target systems.  The A/M category encompasses the full range of DT&E from digital modeling and simulation to precision measurement testing to hardware-in-the-loop and installed systems testing to open-air range testing.  Elements of A/M DT&E include environmental warhead effectiveness arena blast/fragmentation guidance navigation and control aerodynamics propulsion electromagnetic interference and compatibility mass properties seeker and signature measurement survivability lethality integration reliability net-centric and terminal effects testing.  A/M also involves the design and development of systems needed to support A/M DT&E including the design and development sleds targets range support systems and various instrumentation and measurement systems.  C4ISR provides planning improvements and modernization to conduct DT&E of systems that support C2 functions which range from air campaign planning at the theater level to wing level C2 operations to planning individual missions to putting weapons on target using concepts such as machine to machine targeting.  C4ISR includes ground and flight performance testing of airborne C2 networks and tactical data links air operation centers mission planning systems multi-level security systems radio and communication systems ISR systems information assurance systems and radar systems such as those used by JSTARS and air traffic control systems.  C4ISR conducts DT&E on a full range of systems covering the sensor (detection) to the shooter (weapon) including functional and environmental testing of these systems.  Space provides planning improvements and modernization needed for Space test capabilities to perform developmental and operational testing for space and launch acquisition and sustainment programs.  Test capabilities include launch vehicle satellite missile sensor thermal protection system signature hardness and interface testing.  The capabilities are resident at Vandenberg Kirtland Arnold Patrick Schriever Peterson Holloman Air Force Bases and others.  Infrastructure includes launch sites mobile control units thermal vacuum chambers sled track arc heated wind tunnels ballistic test ranges signature collection and the requisite personnel.

WRAP supports the specific DoD goal of significantly shortening the acquisition response time and acquisition cycle times.  This process is expected to shorten the project decision/initiation time by 2-5 years for selected projects due to the integrated headquarters review and immediate availability of transition funding.  The WRAP process is specifically designed to deal with initiatives throughout the fiscal year as they arise resulting in a sequential distribution of WRAP funding over the course of that entire execution year.  The WRAP process allows the Air Force the flexibility to acquire innovative concepts and initiatives and transition them to the warfighter annually in a manner that coincides with Air Forces' development of the President's Budget.  Candidate projects will compete for WRAP approval and funds based on business case analyses actual or potential operational impacts cost savings project development production lifecycle costs project risk and cost of delay.  The Air Force through appropriate program offices will manage the acquisition and development process for the integration and fielding of WRAP-approved projects.  Each project will have a complete acquisition plan defined and approved as a criterion for project selection and subsequent funding.  Each sponsoring Major Command/Agency must to commit full project funding in the subsequent programming cycle.  Congress will be notified when all projects have been approved by the end of the current fiscal year via Congressional Notification Letters.This effort is Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because the program provides a vehicle for developing operational concepts and new technologies for enhancing capabilities of the 21st century aerospace force.","Continuing","Continuing","R2Long",

The program flies an optimally selected number of DoD sponsored experiments consistent with priority opportunity and funding.   STP missions are the most cost-effective way to flight test new space system technologies concepts and designs providing an inexpensive way to:   - Support the space acquisition block development approach- Demonstrate and develop responsive research and development (R&D) space capabilities - Provide early operational capabilities to quickly react to new developments - Perform operational risk reduction through direct flight test of prototype components - Improve operational design by characterizing the space environment event or sensor physics proposed for an operational system/system upgrade - Develop test and acquire advanced payload support hardware for small and medium expendable launch vehicles (LV) and unmanned spaceflight vehicles  The Deputy Secretary of Defense Space Test Program Management & Funding Policy issued in Jul 2002 reaffirmed STP as the primary provider of spaceflight for the DoD space research community.  The Jul 2002 policy statement also reaffirms STP's role as the single manager for all DoD payloads on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station.  In FY11 STP provided launch services to 24 SERB-approved experiments including seven long-duration experiments on the ISS.  FY11 also saw the launch of an additional 13 experiments on the Shuttle or other man-rated systems with additional integration to the ISS.  It also provided operations support for free-flyer experiments and long-duration external experiments on the ISS.  The DoD Space Experiments Review Board (SERB) approved and prioritized 63 experiments in 2011 as candidates for launch services.Beginning in FY13 new STP efforts are terminated.  FY13 efforts support program closeout and termination.  STP-2 integration and mission will be continued in FY13-FY15 via existing funding in PE 0603401F Advanced Spacecraft Technology RDT&E AF.  STP-2 is a dedicated research and development launch mission that also supports the commercial new entrant launch strategy.STP is in Budget Activity 6 RDT&E Management Support because it supports RDT&E satellite launches.","Continuing","Continuing","R2Long",

Tri-Service coordination and cooperative efforts are focused in four principal medical areas: Combat Casualty Care Military Operational Medicine Militarily Relevant Infectious Diseases and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine.  Promising medical technologies are refined and validated through extensive testing which is closely monitored by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as part of their processes for licensing new medical products.  The FDA requires medical products to undergo extensive preclinical testing in animals and/or other models to obtain preliminary efficacy and toxicity information before they can be tested in humans (clinical trials).  Clinical trials are conducted in three phases to prove the safety of a drug vaccine or device for the targeted disease or medical condition starting in Phase 1 with a small number of healthy volunteers.  Each successive phase includes larger numbers of human subjects and requires FDA cognizance prior to proceeding.  Work conducted in this PE primarily focuses on late stages of technology maturation activities required to conduct Phase 2 human expanded safety and efficacy clinical trials. Some high risk technologies may require additional maturation with FDA guidance prior to initiating these clinical trials.  Such things as proof of product stability and purity are necessary to meet FDA standards before entering later stages of testing and prior to transitioning into a formal acquisition program and conducting Phase 3 trials for licensure.  Activities in the PE may include completion of preclinical animal studies and Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies involving human volunteers according to the FDA and EPA requirements.  Promising medical technologies that are not regulated by the FDA are modeled prototyped and tested in relevant environments.Blast research efforts in this PE are fully coordinated with the United States Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center.  This coordination enables improved body armor design and rations for Soldiers.  Additionally the activities funded in this PE are externally peer reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee.  The ASBREM Committee serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within DoD?s biomedical research and development community as well as their associated enabling research areas.Project 810 matures and demonstrates US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated medical countermeasures such as drugs vaccines and diagnostic systems to naturally occurring infectious diseases and wound infections of military importance as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis.  The project also supports testing of personal protective measures such as repellents and insecticides regulated by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.Project 840 validates studies on safety and effectiveness of drugs biologics (products derived from living organisms) medical devices and medical procedures intended to minimize immediate and long-term effects from battlefield injuries; advanced technology development and clinical studies for treatment of ocular and visual system traumatic injury; and restoration of function and appearance by regenerating skin muscle and bone tissue in battle-injured casualties.  Additionally this project develops and realistically tests improved occupant protection systems through medical research to characterize mechanisms of injuries sustained by occupants of ground-combat vehicles subjected to underbody blast events determine human tolerance limits to underbody blast forces and develop tools to predict injuries to ground-combat vehicle occupants exposed to underbody blast forces.Project FH4 matures validates and supports enhanced Force Health Protection of Soldiers against threats in military operations and training.  Health-monitoring tools are matured to rapidly identify deployment stressors that affect the health of Joint Forces.  These databases and systems enhance the Department of Defense's (DoD's) ability to monitor and protect against adverse changes in health especially mental health effects caused by changes in brain function.

These revisions reduced estimated program costs and also delayed the planned contract awards by approximately seven months (to 3QFY2011). Delays related to the source selection and milestone review processes resulted in a further three month slip to the contract awards. In addition two (versus the planned three) contracts were awarded for the TD phase. Finally a protest caused a stop work order shortly after award of the contracts. All of these factors contributed to the congressional reduction (Other Adjustment 1) and rescission (Other Adjustment 2) in FY2011.FY2012: Based on the factors discussed above the Army provided revised FY2012 funding requirements to the congressional committees 4QFY2011. As a result Congressional action as part of the final FY2012 appropriation/authorization process reduced funding to the level reflected in this exhibit (Other Adjustment 1).  FY2013: The FY2013 requested funding reflects adjustments (Other Adjustment 3) due to all the factors discussed above.","The Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program is based on an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) that was approved 10 December 2009 and a draft Capabilities Development Document (CDD) developed by the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC).  The accomplishments and funding reflected in this justification are based on these documents and on program milestone decision memoranda. A Milestone A Defense Acquisition Board was conducted on 21 July 2011. An Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was signed 17 August 2011. It granted the Project Management Office approval to enter the Technology Development (TD) phase. Although the Army had originally planned to award up to three TD contracts the source selection process resulted in only two being awarded on 18 August 2011. One contract was awarded to BAE Systems Land & Armaments L.P. and one was awarded to General Dynamics Land Systems Inc. Following GAO receipt of a protest stop work orders were issued on 29 August 2011. The Government Accountability Office denied the protest on 5 December 2011 and work resumed 6 December 2011. The following funding requirements/justifications reflect the impact of the 100 day delay caused by the protest. This delay also means that full contract baselines were not available for use in preparing these justifications. Accordingly these funding requirements are largely based on program office estimates. 		The Army requires an Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) capability to rapidly deploy an overmatching infantry squad anywhere on the battlefield.  The GCV IFV will provide the infantry squad with a highly mobile protected transport to the decisive locations on the battlefield. The GCV IFV will provide both destructive fires against threat armored vehicles and direct fire support for the squad during dismounted assaults. It will increase the Infantry's tactical mobility survivability and lethality against light and heavy armored threats across a variety of missions. 	The GCV program is using an incremental approach with the GCV IFV as the first increment (future increments have not yet been defined). The GCV IFV program will utilize competitive development and a 3-phased approach that started with MS A in 4QFY2011.  Due to the aforementioned protest the 24 month Technology Development phase (with 2 competing contractors) began 6 December 2011. Following Milestone B currently planned for 1Q2014 the program is planning to award up to two competitively selected 48 month contracts for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. During EMD each contractor will continue to refine designs and deliver prototypes to support engineering development risk mitigation and technical and operational tests. Milestone C is planned for 1QFY2018 and will immediately be followed with award of a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract to one contractor.	For the TD phase the Army will mature its requirements by using four key program imperatives to shape trade space and to ensure convergence on an affordable and achievable set of requirements: 1) Providing requisite force protection to the Squad and crew in the vehicle 2) Capable of carrying a full nine-Soldier squad 3) using a modular open architecture and sufficient margin to support full spectrum operations and changing threats over time and 4) deliver the first production vehicle approximately seven years after award of the TD phase contracts. In support of these key requirements as well as affordability targets the TD phase contracts allow contractors to trade selected capability to support the path to an affordable set of requirements and to reduce program cost and risk. In addition to the effort related to the TD contracts PM GCV will conduct assessments of selected non-developmental vehicles and will support a dynamic update to the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). This "three pronged effort" (TD contracts vehicle assessments and dynamic AoA update) will generate data that will ensure a well informed Milestone B. Information generated from the TD phase will inform the requirements generation/maturation process and will lead to a Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved CDD prior to Milestone B.During the TD phase the contractors will focus on integration leading to the completion of Preliminary Design Reviews (PDR). In support of the PDRs each contractor will be required to develop fabricate integrate and test two different subsystem prototypes: Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) Protection Subsystem prototype and Mine Blast Subsystem prototype. Additional subsystem prototypes may be defined by contactors to support development. Prototype subsystem testing will be conducted by the Government.The combined fiscal impacts of the protest delay and the selection of only two TD contractors are: 1) larger than planned FY2011 carry-over dollars and 2) adjustments to funding requirements for FY2012 and beyond. The FY2012 funding was adjusted as","","","",

International participation will be offered during this phase.  The JLTV goal is a FoV with companion trailers capable of performing multiple mission roles that will be designed to provide protected sustained networked mobility for personnel and payloads across the full Range of Military Operations (RoMO).  JLTV objectives include increased protection and performance over the current fleet; minimizing ownership costs by maximizing commonality fuel efficiency and other means; and maintaining effective competition throughout the lifecycle.  Commonality of components maintenance procedures training etc. between vehicles and trailers is expected to be inherent in FoV solutions within and across sub-configurations to minimize FoV total ownership cost.  Unique service requirements have been minimized.  This is a continuation of the JLTV program which was initiated for the Technology Development Phase.

Project DU8; Systems Under Evaluation Analysis and Integration provides funding for the Industry and government programs that meet or exceed known technological gaps and funds their platform and network integration into the Army's Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) Events. Project DV1; BCT Equipment Integration and Experimentation provides funds for development of the NIE architecture systems integration engineering A-Kit development coordination of the events risk reduction activities and troubleshooting and fixing integration and network problems in support of the Network Integration Evaluation events. Project DU9; System of Systems Engineering provides for development of the Army's standards and validation and verification of systems against these standards. The software will result in a common operating environment and the total architecture will support the NIE by becoming the framework for the detail analysis for NIE. The FY13 funding supports all of the efforts to plan and execute NIE 13.2 and 14.1. The specific evaluation requirements for these NIEs will be derived from the gaps identified by the users in the Afghanistan Theater and the lessons learned from NIEs 12.2 and 13.1In FY11 the Army initiated the new paradigm for SoS Engineering and Brigade and Network Integration called the Agile Process. To support this paradigm the Army stood down PEO I on 1 October 2011 and established System of Systems Integration Directorate (SoSI) which is ASAALT's lead for all aspects of the Army Agile Network Integration process.  The SoSI coordinates synchronizes and integrates existing and emerging technologies into the tactical network at Ft Bliss TX and tests this new integrated brigade capability at White Sands Missile Range NM. Operational test requirements for unique systems / programs are included within the brigade testing to minimize the cost of a formal operational test for each system thus eliminating duplicative infrastructure and test costs. As part of the Agile process the Army has also formed the Brigade Modernization Command (BMC) at Ft Bliss with a unit dedicated solely to testing and evaluating Capability Packages and the associated integrated Network. The Army has also created a TRIAD consisting of the SoSI BMC and Army Test & Evaluation Command (ATEC) to manage the Agile process.The Agile Process consists of the following phases which are coordinated and executed by SoSI BMC and ATEC. In Phase 0 Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) will define near-term gaps in current operational capabilities using existing Operational Needs Statements and relevant assessments from ongoing and past analyses. This analysis will be the basis for requirement sets for future Capability Packages. Network test and evaluation will focus on improving and integrating emerging and existing technologies to minimize existing operational gaps. During Phase I the Director SoS Integration solicits for potential solutions from existing Army programs tech base programs and industry. Also during this phase ASAALT working through the SoSI team obtains buy-in from stakeholders funding and support establishes initial objectives solidifies architecture objectives and establishes the viable candidate list for Network Integration Evaluation (NIE). During Phase II ASAALT through the SoSI team compiles the list of potential solutions that could meet the identified gaps and begins to develop the integration and testing concepts for the next capability package. Phase III includes the coordinated efforts between BMC ATEC and SoSI to finalize the brigade architecture integration and test plans training materials and combat mission evaluations. Phase III also includes the initial integration phase where industry and DOD hardware and software are integrated and initially evaluated for follow-on consideration at a government integration and test facility (executed at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG)). The results of this initial evaluation will determine which industry and DOD System Under Evaluation (SUE) will continue in the NIE process. During Phase IV SoSI develops detailed plans and executes the integration of all hardware and software into the brigade network. The integration is validated and verified through the NIE process. And in Phase V SoSI executes the in-depth NIE. The results of the NIE will address and answer senior Army leadership's questions about force makeup and effectiveness and provides Army leadership recommendations for improving operational requirements and enhancing technical specifications.  As a result of Phase V during Phase VI the Army will determine which systems to procure and field to improve the Army's Network.  FY13 w","","","",

As part of this mission AMSAA develops and certifies systems performance data used in Army studies and develops systems performance methodology and Models and Simulations (M&S).  AMSAA is the Army's center for item/system level performance analysis and certified data.  In support of its materiel systems analysis mission AMSAA analyzes the performance and combat effectiveness of conceptual developmental and fielded systems.  Unique models and methodologies have been developed to predict critical performance variables such as weapon accuracy target acquisition rate of fire probability of inflicting catastrophic damage survivability mobility and system reliability.  AMSAA generates performance and effectiveness measures and ensures their standard use across major Army and Joint studies.  AMSAA conducts and supports various systems analysis efforts across the entire materiel system life cycle such as:  Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs); system cost/performance tradeoffs and early technology trade-offs to inform system and acquisition program risk assessments; weapons/systems mix analyses; business case analyses and cost benefit analyses; requirements analyses; technology insertion studies; reliability growth studies; Physics of Failure (PoF) analyses; and analytical support for Test and Evaluation.  AMSAA also maintains pursuant to Army Acquisition Executive direction the Center for Army Acquisition Lessons Learned.  These analyses are used by the Army Research Development and Engineering Command; Army Materiel Command; Training and Doctrine Command; Army Test and Evaluation Command; Program Executive Officers/Project Managers; Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) (both Army Staff and Assistant Secretaries in the HQDA Secretariat); and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD)/Department of Defense (DoD) Leadership.  AMSAA analyses and data are used by these organizations in making acquisition procurement and logistics decisions in order to provide quality equipment and procedures to the Soldier. AMSAA's M&S capabilities support the development linkage and accreditation of live virtual and constructive simulations and provide unique tools that support systems analysis of individual systems and the combined-arms environment.  AMSAA maintains a significant number of models and simulations most of which were developed in-house to address specific analytical requirements.  This M&S infrastructure provides a hierarchical modeling process that is unique to AMSAA and allows for a comprehensive performance and effectiveness prediction capability that can be utilized to make trade-off and investment decisions prior to extensive and expensive hardware testing of proposed systems/technologies for Current and Future Force efforts.  AMSAA is the Army's executive agent for the verification validation and accreditation of item/system level performance models.  In this role AMSAA assists model developers with the development and execution of verification and validation plans to ensure new models and simulations provide credible information/results for decision making.As the Army's Executive Agent for reliability and maintainability standardization improvement AMSAA develops and implements reliability and maintainability acquisition reform initiatives.  AMSAA develops and applies engineering approaches that assess the reliability of Army materiel and also provides recommendations on ways to improve reliability thereby reducing the logistics footprint reducing life cycle costs and extending failure-free periods for deployed equipment.  AMSAA's electronic and mechanical Physics of Failure (PoF) program pioneered the Army's involvement in utilizing computer-aided engineering tools in the analysis of root-cause failure mechanisms at the component level during the system design process.  AMSAA's reliability engineering and PoF tools/analyses have been used extensively to support the design improvement of developmental and fielded systems used in Current Operations resulting in improved reliability reduced Operational and Support costs and reduced logistics expenditures and footprint.

The Aegis BMD element of the BMDS capitalizes upon and evolves from the existing U.S. Navy Aegis Weapons System (AWS) and Standard Missile (SM) infrastructures. Aegis BMD provides a forward-deployable mobile capability to detect and track Ballistic Missiles of all ranges and the ability to destroy Short-Range Ballistic Missiles (SRBM) Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles (MRBM) and Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBM) in the midcourse phase of flight ICBMs in early phase of flight and shorter range missile in terminal phase. Aegis BMD also provides a Long Range Surveillance and Track (LRS&T) capability to the BMDS. Upgrades to both the Aegis BMD Weapon System and the STANDARD MISSILE-3 (SM-3) configuration enable Aegis BMD to provide effective supportable defensive capability against longer range more sophisticated threats and an enduring Aegis Ashore defensive capability. Aegis BMD provides/ will provide several capabilities in support of the objective to defend allies and deployed forces from intermediate threats in one region or theater: Deployed Now 	-Aegis BMD 3.6.1: Delivers an engagement capability with an SM-3 Block IA against SRBM MRBM and IRBM class threats. Delivers a Near Term Sea Based Terminal (NTSBT) capability against SRBM with a modified SM-2 Block IV. Delivers an LRS&T capability against ballistic missile threats of all ranges. Aegis BMD 3.6.1 has demonstrated launch on remote operations in FY 2011 and has the ability to receive live fire information from the Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) to support fire control operations. Assessed operationally suitable and effective in 2008. Aegis BMD 4.0.1 	-Aegis BMD 4.0.1 and the SM-3 Block IB missile improve Aegis BMD`s ability to engage longer range more sophisticated ballistic missiles that may deploy countermeasures and are launched in larger raid sizes. Aegis BMD`s sensor improvements include the (AN/SPY)-1 radar`s signal processor and the SM-3 Block IB kinetic warhead`s (KW) two-color infra-red (IR) seeker. The Aegis BMD Signal Processor provides a real-time identification capability. The two-color seeker with an Advanced Signal Processor improves sensitivity for longer range targets high speed processing for multiple targets and improved performance against more sophisticated threats. Besides the two-color IR seeker the SM-3 Block IB Kinetic warhead (KW) divert engine system has been upgraded over the SM-3 Block IA. The new divert engine the Throttleable Divert and Attitude Control System (TDACS) provides more flexible divert to maneuver the kill Vehicle (KV) to intercept. Deploying FY 2014 	-Aegis BMD 5.0 - Integrates Aegis BMD 4.0.1 capability into the Navy-developed Open Architecture (OA) computing environment. This change is necessary for Aegis BMD to remain compatible with Navy as ship modernization plans are executed. Improves human-systems interface through display enhancements; eliminates the need for a separate computing system specific to the BMD mission; enables more ships to serve as candidates for the BMD mission; supports the BMDS Integrated Build D; and provides the basis for Aegis Ashore. Deploying in the Future 	-Conducting SM-3 Block IIB product development source selection and subsequent program management of product development. 	-Aegis BMD 5.0. Capability upgrade (CU) - Enhances Aegis BMD 5.0 by restoring the terminal defense layer increasing raid size and expanding the threat set. 	-Aegis BMD computer program baseline and missile system modifications necessary to place Aegis BMD capability on land (Aegis Ashore). 	-SM-3 Block IIA - Aegis BMD and the Japan Ministry of Defense (JMOD) have undertaken an SM-3 Cooperative Development (SCD) program which consists of a spiral upgrade to a 21-inch diameter SM-3 missile (SM-3 Blk IIA). Missile development will be covered under the SCD project prior to the SM-3 Blk IIA incorporation into the Aegis BMD 5.1 upgrade to the Aegis BMD system. 	-Aegis BMD 5.1/5.1.X - Integrates the SM-3 Blk IIA missile and future missiles with an improved terminal defense capability and Open Architecture (OA) environment. The addition of the SM-3 Blk IIA missile will expand available battlespace to include Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) and selected longer-range threats and when combined with additional weapon system modifications will enable an Engage-on-Remote (EoR) capability. That capability will further extend Aegis BMD by capitalizing on globally-deployed BMDS sensor assets. BMD Systems Engineering MDA Engineering integrates element development test (IMTP) work to optimize the capability of the BMDS. Modeling and simulation (M&S) activities support all phases of Aegis BMD`s development including development of Aegis Weapon System (AWS) and SM-3 variants flight test missions ground tests war games exercises and performance assessment. Models and simulations are tailored to the specific need of a component in its current phase of development ranging from low-to-medium fidelity analysis supporting concept definition studies to high-fidelity models used to support engineering development or testing and are integrated into the BMD Digital Simulations Architecture. Proving Missile Defense: Working with the Services` Operational Test Agencies (OTA) with the support of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) MDA has developed a test program to improve confidence in missile defense capabilities under development and ensure the capabilities transferred to the war fighter are operationally effective suitable and survivable. As part of the Agency`s rigorous test program System Pre-Flight predictions provide confidence in test execution by predicting element performance and exercising element interfaces. System Post Flight Reconstruction replicates the Ballistic Missile Defense System configuration and actual environmental conditions and target dynamics observed in flight to anchor modeling and simulation results. Testing includes SM-3 intercept using Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) as a remote sensor. The Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP) is event-oriented and extends until the collection of all identified data is completed to ensure adequate test investments. The bottom line is that MDA is focused on conducting meaningful ballistic missile testing that demonstrates the capabilities of the BMDS. MD40 consists of Program-Wide Support (PWS) non-headquarters management costs in support of MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).","Continuing","Continuing","",

At that time the MDSEC was renamed to the Missile Defense Space Development Center (MDSDC). MDA will continue to assess the health/utility of the Near Field Infrared Experiment (NFIRE) satellite on an annual basis to determine whether to continue NFIRE operations and testing.","Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) With the successful launch of two (STSS) demonstration satellites in 2009 the agency has on-orbit capability to validate remote sensor and fire control integration to inform the design and operation of the Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS) to characterize contribution of space data into the BMDS architecture and to provide sensor measurements and background data supporting trade studies and analyses for PTSS and Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) IIB development. Lessons learned from the two STSS demonstration satellites are guiding decisions on the development of a fiscally sustainable continuously available operational PTSS constellation and ground communications/processing system. Beginning FY 2013 funding in this element is provided for STSS on-orbit operations which includes contractor operation of the STSS Demonstration Satellites and software maintenance Government costs BMDS Level Testing Data Collection and Analysis activities and the NFIRE satellites tests and experiments. Funding availability for NFIRE will be determined as the health and utility of the satellite is assessed for FY 2013. STSS is providing risk reduction for PTSS models algorithms sensors and spacecraft development by providing background and clutter scene characterization complex target signatures interface definition communications architectures and performance across acquisition tracking and discrimination. STSS is also providing definition to BMDS Concept of Operations timelines and performance requirements for sensor cuing and weapons engagement such as Aegis Launch On/Engage On from remote space sensors. STSS will emphasize continued research and development to address the more sophisticated threats we expect to encounter in the far term. The greatest protection against missile defense threats of all ranges remains a highly available early missile tracking capability from space. Space sensors provide the most cost effective and operationally suitable means of providing global persistent surveillance and engagement directly addressing the number one missile defense priority need for Combatant Commanders. STSS is a capability development activity for the demonstration of technologies to support development and future capability delivery of the BMDS space layer PTSS. For example during Aegis Intercept Flight Test (FTM-15) STSS demonstrated the capability to receive an external cue and transmit that cue to the out-of-view STSS satellite resulting in stereo midcourse tracking. This provided significant risk reduction for PTSS by closely emulating a communication cuing and track reporting chain for an operational engagement. In addition the STSS Demonstration Satellites have demonstrated the ability of a space sensor to provide high precision real time tracking of missiles and midcourse objects thus enabling simultaneous regional theater and strategic missile defense systems to be cued to track well beyond their organic detection capability. Data from on-going Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) testing has validated the ability to track cold midcourse objects from space and close the fire control loop with BMDS interceptors. During several MDA Flight Tests STSS has provided data in real-time that has met the Aegis Missile Defense Systems Quality of Service (QoS) data requirements for Remote Engagement Authorized (REA). In FY 2013 STSS will provide real-time data to Aegis during a live fire test that will culminate in an actual Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) launching against the target using STSS data to initiate the engagement. Finally STSS provides a new infrared sensor phenomenology for the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) that will demonstrate the benefit of the Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS) when combined with radars that will provide robustness against current and advanced countermeasures. MDA has developed and is testing two STSS Demonstration Satellites to demonstrate key functions of space sensors in support of PTSS risk reduction. STSS Element Level testing is funded as part of a capabilities development program and reflected in the Program Element submission. Element testing is based on an integrated comprehensive and phased test program. Element systems subsystems and components were tested early in development and this testing was necessary prior to conducting BMD level testing. Key data from the STSS Demonstration Satellites efforts continue to provide lessons learned as MDA pursues longer term space sensor needs with PTSS. - Space sensors extend BMDS sensor coverage to a global level. The STSS has demonstrated the capability of satellites to track ballistic missiles and the ability to provide accurate tracking information to the BMDS battle manager to close the fire control loop with BMDS interceptors thus extending the effective range of BMDS interceptors and other sensors. - Space-based sensors are not limited by basing rights issues or deployment decisions and will allow cost effective coverage of countries and large areas not accessible from ground based sensors. - Space based visible and Infrared (IR) sensors will complement radars and contribute to a sensor architecture more robust to countermeasures - Space-based sensors will enable near continuous threat observation and tracking from launch to intercept covering threats by augmenting the coverage of the BMDS radars and providing state vectors to Command and Control Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) to enable interceptor fire control via multiple BMDS assets (Aegis Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)) Goals for STSS - Risk reduction for PTSS - Risk reduction for SM-3 IIB interceptor sensor trades - Demonstrate C2BMC interfaces sensor registration communication chains and latencies to support PTSS concept of operation development Near Field Infrared Experiment (NFIRE) The NFIRE technology project was designed to collect near field phenomenology data for use in plume to hard body handover algorithms for boost phase interceptor programs. MDA used this data to validate the models and simulations that are fundamental to developing the guidance and endgame homing algorithms. NFIRE is now focused on PTSS and SM-3 IIB development support by collecting background clutter and target signatures for modeling and algorithm development and validation. A secondary objective of the experiment has been to collect hyper-temporal short wave infrared and visible data for assessing early launch detection and tracking capability. The experiment includes three plume signature mission types: targets of opportunity dedicated fly-bys and ground observations. The dedicated fly-by experiments have been accomplished. The NFIRE satellite also carries a Laser Communication Terminal which has been and continues to be used to conduct communication experiments with the German Terra SAR-X satellite. These experiments test low earth orbit satellite-to-ground and satellite-to-satellite capabilities of the terminal for potential incorporation into the BMDS. Data products are utilized by multiple programs to improve missile engagement performance. Goals for Near Field Infrared Experiment (NFIRE) - Conduct multiple data collection missions from the Missile Defense Space Development Center (MDSDC) against ground air space and ballistic missile targets of opportunity - Conduct low earth orbit satellite-to-satellite and satellite-to-ground laser communication experiments - Provide data to validate models and simulations that are fundamental to developing the navigation guidance and control and endgame homing algorithms as well as laser communication proof of concept MD40 consists of Program-Wide Support (PWS) non-headquarters management costs in support of MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).","Continuing","Continuing","",

The suite of remote ground-based sensors provide early warning midcourse and terminal ballistic missile defense threat data enabling layered detection and tracking of ballistic missile targets providing fire-control quality position velocity and discrimination data through Command and Control Battle Management Communications (C2BMC). Overlapping sensor coverage of geographically diverse sensors provides improved threat track data as well as reducing the loss of any one sensor and reducing the potential impact of countermeasures. The extended coverage and accuracy provided by a network of layered sensors increases the defensive footprint and reduces the number of target engagements required thereby conserving interceptor inventory and ensuring a high probability of successful engagement. Networked forward-based sensors enables C2BMC to pair the best sensor coverage with the best available weapon system to provide the most effective defense against ballistic missile threats. The BMD Sensors Program contributes to regional missile defense through the following activities: -Development delivery and deployment of remote forward based Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance and Control (AN/TPY-2) radars to provide early warning track and discrimination data through all phases of ballistic missile flight. Through the BMDS C2BMC and coalition datalinks the AN/TPY-2 provides fire control data to enable remote SM-3 engagements by Aegis BMD to allow earlier engagement by the Arrow Weapon System and to cue deployed THAAD and U.S. and partner Patriot batteries. The operation and sustainment of AN/TPY-2 software is maintained across the fleet of AN/TPY-2 radars to include radars in Japan Israel and Turkey. Lessons learned from each radar are addressed in new software builds that are developed tested and subsequently installed at each radar. AN/TPY-2 radars can be configured to operate either as a THAAD Fire Unit Radar (terminal mode) or Forward-Based Radar. These radars are transportable adding flexibility to respond to geographical changes in threats. Under this Program Element seven AN/TPY-2 radars have completed manufacturing. The AN/TPY-2 used in a forward-based role provides detection and tracking during the boost phase. This significantly reduces the uncertainty in target discrimination and reaction time increasing the probability of a successful BMDS engagement. In forward-based mode the AN/TPY-2 also provides acquisition and track data via the Ballistic Missile Defense System Command Control Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) and Link 16 to the Aegis missile defense system for cueing. The AN/TPY-2 used in terminal mode is an integral component of the THAAD Battery. The THAAD battery radar is capable of tracking multiple threats and multiple interceptors during engagements in the terminal phase. It provides surveillance acquisition track discrimination interceptor communications and hit assessment data collection for the fire control. The current and planned utilization of the AN/TPY-2 radars supports GMD THAAD and the Aegis Weapon System via C2BMC. The BMDS network of sensors also includes the Cobra Dane Radar at Eareckson Air Force Station in Alaska Upgraded Early Warning Radars at Beale Air Force Base Fylingdales RAF Station UK and at Thule Air Force Station in Greenland. These Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Early Warning Radars have been upgraded to include missile defense functionality. This capability expands defense of the U.S. to include defense against limited long-range threats. The Clear EWR located at Clear Air Force Station AK is also being upgraded to include missile defense functionality. Upgrade activities will begin in FY 2012 and be completed in FY 2016. The addition of the Clear UEWR into the BMDS sensor architecture will improve BMDS sensor coverage and provide new engagement options against long-range missile threats and reduce reliance on the Cobra Dane asset. The BMDS Sensors Program also contributes to the testing and proving of the U.S. missile defense systems through the following activities: -Participation in BMDS flight and ground test campaigns -Modeling and simulation efforts to include: enhanced sensor models development of radio frequency (RF) scene generators integration of digital simulations into the BMDS modeling and simulation architecture and verification validation and accreditation (VV&A) of radar models.","Continuing","Continuing","",

It provides high-throughput multi-band and multi-media telecommunications services for deployed forces.  The system provides centralized integration capabilities contingency capacity and the necessary interfaces to access the Defense Information System Network (DISN) in a seamless interoperable and economical manner.  The Teleport system is an upgrade of satellite telecommunication capabilities at selected DoD gateways indentified as Standardized Tactical Entry Point (STEP) sites.  Each Teleport investment increases the warfighters’ ability to communicate with a worldwide interconnected set of information capabilities which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.The Teleport program began fielding system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational evolutionary development approach.

A Full Deployment was recommended by DISA on 23 December 2010. A Teleport Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) dated March 2 2010 approved the Materiel Development Decision (MDD) for the next increment of Teleport Generation 3.  The current Teleport Generation 3 Production APB was signed 13 September 2010.  The baseline is based on the three Gen 3 phases satellite availability and user availability for testing.Phase 1:  Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) [Extended Data Rate (XDR)] terminals.  This enhancement provides the President Secretary of Defense and Combatant Commanders with survivable anti-jam communications through all peacetime and combat operations.  Phase 2:  Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM X/Ka-band terminals.  This enhancement provides deployed commanders with sufficient bandwidth to rapidly transmit the largest video and data products to the battlefield warfighter including Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) streaming video digital imagery intelligence and mapping and weather products and services.Phase 3:  Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy ultra high frequency systems interoperability.  This enhancement allows tactical warfighters using the most capable and cost effective narrowband capabilities to communicate with users possessing outdated technology until those legacy systems are replaced.Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) Legacy Gateway Component (MLGC):  The MLGC program will provide the capability to interconnect all services between legacy UHF satellite systems and the MUOS.  To sustain the current UHF SATCOM constellation capabilities the MUOS satellites will also offer a legacy UHF communications payload that will provide capabilities to existing deployed UHF terminals.  This will provide the warfighter the voice and data communications bridging between these satellite systems supporting maritime airborne and ground mobile tactical operations.  Mobile User Objective System to Defense Switched Network (DSN):  The MUOS to DSN project will allow MUOS users the ability to place secure but unclassified calls within the DSN network.  Currently MUOS users can only place secure classified calls to DSN users which only make up approximately 3% of the DSN users.  The MUOS to DSN project will enable the Warfighter to place a secure but unclassified call to any DSN user.  A reduction in funding would impact design and development efforts.  Without this capability warfighters in the field environment will have limited communication ability with the DSN network.  Specifically warfighters using the MUOS radio will be limited to placing calls to DSN users with auto secure cryptographic telephones.  Generic Discovery Server Enclave:  The purpose of the Generic Discovery Server (GDS) Enclave effort is to provide a dynamic discovery service capability for non-secret security enclaves (Cipher Text and Plain Text addresses).  Presently dynamic discovery services are only being provided for Secret-US only enclave.  A decrease in funding will impact project initiation and procurement of required hardware and software.  Without the GDS capability the warfighters ability to communicate will be impacted.  Specifically a significant burden will be placed on communication planners and limit the flexibility of swapping terminals with users in the field.  Static address tables will have to be used for thousands of unclassified users reducing the flexibly to reach a user in a dynamic environment.","Continuing","Continuing","",

These products provide the Department of Defense (DoD) and National Senior Leaders (e.g. the President of the United States (POTUS) Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Combatant Commands (COCOMs)) as well as inter-agency participants with critical focus on the long-term collaboration planning and information sharing operations by bringing together technology security cooperation and education.  The program components support preparation for future joint and coalition initiatives through development and integration of a full range of data services and advanced IT applications to support practical aspects of approved cooperative activities of the United States and its coalition partners.  These emergent capabilities are technologies that can be rapidly infused into existing tools.  Program investments in advanced technology benefit strategic and tactical users in the intelligence warfighting and business domains by providing them with reliable persistent collaboration and networking technologies including computing-on-demand to reduce the need to replicate data or services at the point of consumption.  Investments also provide support for virtual end-user environments and semantic search capabilities which enhance the decision-making process.  The goal of the AITS-JPO is to provide the warfighter with technical superiority and to achieve interoperability and integration while working in concert with joint allied and coalition forces to effectively counter terrorism and enhance homeland security defense through the confluence of technology security cooperation and education.The program uses three key mechanisms to streamline the process of fielding emergent requirements:  (1) Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTD) with Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) /COCOM/Service/Agency teaming; (2) Joint Ventures with Combatant Commanders/Program of Record (POR) teaming; and (3) Risk Mitigation Pilots with POR/Community of Interest (COI) teaming.  The JCTD process aligns with the revised Joint Capability Integration and Development System (JCIDS) process developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff by adapting technology and concept solutions to meet pressing warfighter needs.  OSD approves new JCTDs annually and on a rolling start basis.  DISA participates in both an operational and transition manager role.  The JCTDs along with the Joint ventures and risk mitigation pilots feature teaming with appropriate offices so that funds and skill sets are leveraged across all participants.  The costs are shared thus reducing the risk to individual organizations.  The program is further divided into major subprogram areas:  Command and Control (C2) and Combat Support (CS) Information Sharing (IS) Network Infrastructure (NI) Network Operations (NetOps) Cyber Threat Discovery and Program Management Support.If funds are not provided in FY 2013 DISA will not be able to rapidly deliver high-value capabilities and expose them to the enterprise and warfighter.","Continuing","Continuing","R2Long",

There are three primary reasons why DCMA is pursuing this direction. First Web-based applications dramatically reduce the costs associated with fielding new software mission capabilities.  (Only a limited handful of central servers need to be updated rather than thousands of employees’ desktop computers.)  Second Web-basing and Web Services make DCMA’s software applications much more adaptable to the ongoing and future changes in the Department’s procurement and financial management systems that are being implemented in accordance with the Department’s Business Enterprise Architecture. Third DCMA has found that Web-based application development is substantially less expensive than traditional client/server or mainframe-based application development.  One of the reasons why Web-based development is less expensive is that Web-basing applications allows DCMA to productively adapt large amounts of open source software packages with minimal or even zero acquisition and support costs.  Also this allows Military Services to achieve their desired real-time supply chain information “Reachback” capabilities that will extend all the way onto the factory floors where parts components and systems are being produced.  All metrics tied to the funds in this exhibit have achieved a "green" status.FY 2011 Actual:  In FY 2011 ($11.826) DCMA tested new DCMA-unique automated information application modules that will support:  Defense Supply Chain “Reachback” via-the-Web capabilities; Public Key Infrastructure-enabled Web application modules; and improved (more accurate and timely) reimbursable earnings reporting. Also funding included the continued testing and improving of DCMA’s portals functionality for external and internal customers and continued development and implementation of Web Services software technologies (e.g. Simple Object Access Protocol Universal Discovery and Description Integration Web Services Description Language).FY 2012 - 2013 Plan:  In FY 2012 ($12.228) and FY 2013 ($12.699) DCMA will continue to test new DCMA-unique automated information application modules that will support:  Defense Supply Chain “Reachback” via-the-Web capabilities; Public Key Infrastructure-enabled Web application modules; and “anywhere anytime” access for DCMA personnel worldwide.  Also funding includes the continuation of testing and improving DCMA’s accessibility and functionality for external customers and the continuation of developing and implementing Web Services software technologies (e.g. Simple Object Access Protocol Universal Discovery and Description Integration Web Services Description Language) and supporting the agency’s Performance Management Initiative.","Continuing","Continuing","",

Such devices provide terrorists and foreign military units the novel means to rapidly construct a wide range of weapons capable of disruptive actions against civilian and military forces alike.  The US must be ready to counter such weapons on short notice.The asymmetric nature of such devices is already well understood by terrorists.  ManPADS and mortars have been used to attack both air and ground forces and pose a threat in any region due to their portability.  Digital processors analog-to-digital converters and digital optical sensors give terrorists the means to deploy unexpected threats on short notice.  Conventional kinetic defenses against these devices can be impractical in urban settings.  Because the speed of appearance of these disruptive devices can be short such threats are asymmetric in comparison with the long development cycles that are typical of US military defensive systems.  Together these asymmetries highlight the need to rapidly evolve alternative Electronic Warfare Information Operations and Counter Terrorism capabilities suitable for neutralizing such threats in a timescale that is commensurate with their appearance.  This program element investigates novel means to detect and neutralize asymmetric threats as well as special mission and other methods to employ asymmetric principles against our adversaries.This program seeks to identify rapidly deployable solutions (outside of service programs of record) that can effectively mitigate asymmetric threats by integrating advanced commercial or military off-the-shelf technology in innovative ways that augment and/or reduce risk when inserted into service programs of record.","Continuing","Continuing","",

Though military basic infrastructure capabilities follow the mainstream commercial internet for many reasons (security mobility and robustness) commercial telecommunications especially commercial wireless (tactical edge) communications are not well-matched with the requirements of today’s warfighter.  These trends will continue as the military data load becomes more diverse and heavy.  The National Research Council’s Network Science Report (2005) and Army Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) JASONS Report (January 2006) state that the type of networking projected to meet military tactical requirements is not supported by network theory network design nor analysis tools.  These tactical edge technology challenges cut across all warfare domains (space air ground and sea).  In response to recognized technical problems today as well as anticipated problems in the future this research will focus on two key problems in networked technologies: 1) the need for expanded wireless reach where no communications infrastructure exists and 2) the need to create ways to manage diverse wireless communications load and heterogeneous network types.  Airborne Network Gateway will expand the wireless communications and networking reach for the tactical force in the form of an airborne network gateway capability.  Network Communications Analysis will establish the scientific foundations for military tactical mobile networking with a specific emphasis on the integrated network management of tactical networks.  This research will provide the technical basis to standardize the implementation of military network communications capabilities in the areas of airborne network gateways and network communications analysis across the military services Joint Staff Office of the Secretary of Defense and defense agencies.","Continuing","Continuing","",

The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by Program Managers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective thus insuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with 1) coordinating establishing and maintaining five ten and fifteen year technology development plans and roadmaps 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate Program Executive Officers (PEOs) for insertion in their Insensitive Munitions (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy laboratory representatives and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight policy direction and priorities during its annual meeting.The IM effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with requirements established in United States Code Title 10 Chapter 141 Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.Under the JIMTP investments are focused on five Munition Areas:  High Performance Rocket Propulsion Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion Blast and Fragmentation Warheads (BFW) Anti-Armor Warheads (AAW) and Large Caliber Gun Propulsion (LCGP).  MATGs under tri-service leadership have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies alone or in combination will be incorporated in hardware simulating real-world munitions to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.The Enabling Fuze Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force (GDF) the Secretary of Defense Memorandum DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&T) communities.  In this way promising multi-point initiation architectures high reliability fuze architectures survivable components modular fuze packaging and components produced based on ease of manufacturing can be integrated into a munition configuration and its ability to address required capability needs can be validated.  Mature fuze technology can be transitioned thereby decreasing program costs and schedule risk and facilitating their spin-off into other munitions within their portfolios.Under the Joint Fuze Technology Program investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and will be validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service S&T communities. These four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing 3) High Reliability Fuzing 4) and Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.","Continuing","Continuing","",

On 17 September 2009 the President announced an overarching plan to provide regional missile defense to U.S. deployed forces allies and partners in Europe called the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA). The United States will also pursue phased adaptive approaches in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East by building on current efforts. The PAA envisions tailoring U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense capabilities to specific theater needs to enhance integrated regional missile defenses to protect defended assets against medium intermediate and ultimately intercontinental range ballistic missiles. Within this policy a European PAA specifically addresses a timeline to deploy a mix of afloat and land-based BMD capabilities. Aegis Ashore represents one of these land-based capabilities. Phase I OF EPAA (2011 timeframe): Focuses on the protection against short and medium-range ballistic missiles. As part of phase 1 which is already underway the United States has deployed multi-mission Aegis ships with BMD capability and the SM-3 Block IA missile. Phase I also included establishing a separate forward-based AN/TPY-2 radar in Turkey to provide a cue to multi-mission Aegis ships with BMD capability and to future Aegis Ashore sites for launch on remote engagements. Phase II OF EPAA (2015 timeframe): Deploys the first land-based BMD configuration (Aegis Ashore) in Romania and deploys the SM-3 Block IB on land at the Aegis Ashore site and at sea on multi-mission Aegis ships with BMD capability. Phase III OF EPAA (2018 timeframe): Deploys a second land based Aegis Ashore in Poland and introduces an upgraded Standard Missile the SM-3 Block IIA. This missile brings improved coverage against medium and intermediate range ballistic threats and extends coverage to the bulk of the European continent. Phase IV OF EPAA (2020 timeframe): Deploys another upgraded missile the SM-3 Block IIB to provide region-wide coverage as well as limited capabilities against a potential ICBM threat from the Middle East.Aegis Ashore is a key component of Phases II and III in the European PAA and will provide Aegis Missile Defense capability against short and medium range ballistic missiles in an ashore configuration. It will be similar to the Aegis At-Sea BMD capability inherent in the DDG-113 series of the Arleigh Burke Class Destroyers to facilitate training and logistical support by the lead service Navy. Aegis Ashore essentially re-hosts the required BMD components of a Navy Destroyer in an ashore configuration to include SPY RADAR Vertical Launch System computing infrastructure C4I systems and operator consoles. It will provide sophisticated engagement strategies. Aegis Ashore can adapt to the threat and can be deployed/redeployed worldwide to areas needed to provide persistent coverage for the Geographic Combatant Commanders. The initial Aegis Ashore Missile Defense System (AAMDS) will be deployed to Romania in 2015. A second AAMDS will be deployed to Poland in 2018 as part of the EPAA. MDA approved the acquisition strategy in FY 2010. MD40 consists of Program-Wide Support (PWS) non-headquarters management costs in support of MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).","Continuing","Continuing","",

This revised program builds on the FY 2010 and FY 2011 accomplishments with increased objectives and technology development goals critical to on-going operations. This Data to Decisions program focuses on information management architecture needs located at the seams between ongoing Service research efforts.","A critical element in nearly all defense missions is the Decision Support System which manages the accumulation of important data and provides tools to help commanders and other operational leaders make relevant decisions. These “Data-to-Decision” systems have become increasingly more important as our operations have shifted from large-scale force-on-force engagements to asymmetric conflicts. Terrorists and insurgents are deeply buried within local populations and employ operational concepts that blend in with urban clutter. Subsequently finding these asymmetric targets has driven an explosion in sensing capabilities and modalities. This exponential growth in sensing volume has so stressed our current technologies that the majority of data now collected is thrown away.  Additionally because the targets are diffuse and rapidly adapt to countermeasures there has been a rapid proliferation of decision support systems. At last count the Research & Engineering Database had over 388 references to Decision Support programs.The goal of this program is to develop an Information Open System Architecture (IOSA) that provides a common platform for rapidly developing and integrating new Data-to-Decisions systems. This IOSA will be based on a canonical decision support architecture and support a physical infrastructure for multi-source data management as well as user-driven innovation tools for analytics. The data management infrastructure will provide easy access and management of current and emergent data sources through plug-and-play modules. Data will be contextualized indexed conditioned and intelligently stored with approved formats to allow rapid search and retrieval of tactically relevant data sets. The effort will integrate existing analytics tools and develop applicable new ones where gaps exist. A library of analytic tools will be built and research into end user programming methods will support new innovation models that mimic commercially successful products. The program consists of both applied research and technology development efforts focused on solving challenge problems each year with spiral developments to a prototype system.","Continuing","Continuing","",

In accordance with DoD Instruction 5200.39 integrated circuits in critical/essential systems need to be procured from trusted sources in order to avoid counterfeit tampered or sabotaged parts.  Worldwide competition from foreign state-subsidized manufacturing facilities (foundries) is making fabless semiconductor companies the norm in the United States.  Sophisticated off-shore design and manufacturing facilities with engineering labor rates vastly less than U.S. engineering rates have resulted in outsourcing of electronics components and integrated circuits.  These trends threaten the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic on-shore suppliers and reducing access to trusted fabrication sources for advanced technology.  These trends are of acute concern to the defense and intelligence community.  Secure communications and cryptographic applications depend heavily upon high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement can translate into a significant force multiplier and capability advantage.  Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size weight power and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors.The Trusted Foundry program provides DoD and NSA with trusted state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities necessary to meet the performance and delivery needs of their customers.  The program will also provide the Services with a competitive cadre of trusted suppliers that will meet the needs of their mission critical/essential systems for trusted integrated circuit components.  NSA in their role as the Trusted Access Program Office has successfully looked to commercial sources to satisfy their requirements.

The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the DoD’s “Testing in a Joint Environment Roadmap” to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to “test like we fight.”  JMETC provides a persistent distributed test and evaluation (T&E) capability that otherwise would not be readily available to Service/Component acquisition programs.  This program is funded within the RDT&E Management Support Budget Activity because it is intended to provide test capability in support of RDT&E programs. 	JMETC creates a common corporate capability to link live systems with virtual and constructive representations in order to generate a realistic joint mission test environment for the system(s) being tested.  JMETC is a widely applicable persistent service provider for the Department’s acquisition and net-centric programs.  Key JMETC products include readily available connectivity over existing networks standardized data transport solutions tools and utilities for planning and conducting distributed integrations DoD corporate distributed testing expertise and a reuse repository.  This common integration capability through the use of the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) provides compatibility between JMETC and the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) streamlining reuse of technical resources across the test and training communities.  In turn this integration capability enables combined test and training exercises.	By linking distributed facilities JMETC allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  This enables a customer-defined joint mission test environment for systems engineering and testing extensible to training and experimentation in a timely and cost effective manner.       JMETC’s institutional funding builds maintains and operates the JMETC infrastructure and pays for persistent availability of national connectivity for testing; data communications middleware; identification and development of interface standards; common software tools and components; and a reuse repository.  It also funds JMETC program management facilities equipment operating costs and special studies and analysis related to distributed test capabilities and infrastructure.  Key attributes of the JMETC include:  persistency; interoperability; reuse; various combinations of distributed capabilities (reconfigurable infrastructure to meet customer requirements); modeling and simulation (M&S) linkage; Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) test resource integration; and distributed test support to satisfy both Service and Joint needs.  System engineering training and experimentation all benefit from a corporate JMETC developed for T&E.

AEHF satellites will replenish the existing EHF system (Milstar) providing much higher capacity and data rate (5x increase over Milstar II) capabilities.  AEHF is a cooperative program that includes International Partners (Canada the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of the Netherlands).    Space Vehicle-1 (SV-1) launched on 14 August 2010.  SV-1 experienced a propulsion anomaly and was raised to its geostationary orbit using alternative orbit raising techniques.  The original plan was to begin SV-1 on-orbit checkout in FY11 but in order to conserve fuel SV-1 arrived at its on-orbit checkout location on 24 October 2011.  SV-2 has an April 2012 projected launch.        With SV-1 launched and SV-2 scheduled to launch in April 2012 the AEHF program has nearly completed its development phase and is now addressing obsolescence production continuity supplier stability and industrial base issues.  Future AEHF satellites will be procured using the Department of Defense (DoD) Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) concept formerly known as Evolutionary Acquisition for Space Efficiency (EASE).  The ESP concept is a procurement approach which seeks stable production and efficient sub-contractor product management through the block buy of two space vehicles at one time (please see Advanced EHF MILSATCOM P-40 Exhibit).  In addition the ESP concept includes use of RDT&E funding for a MILSATCOM Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) formerly known as the Capability and Affordability Insertion Program (CAIP) to fund engineering activities to reduce future production costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements improve capabilities through insertion of new technologies and replace obsolete parts crypto and materials.  The SMI efforts will provide opportunities for competition to develop potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for future satellites of the current or any follow-on system.  SMI efforts will include obsolescence management and mitigation efforts technology maturation qualification of new components subsystem and component prototyping architecture and system concept studies (to include hosted payloads) and pathfinder efforts to address MILSATCOM capability gaps identified in the Joint Space Communications Layer (JSCL) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and the forthcoming "Resilient Basis for SATCOM in Joint Operations" study.The FY13 request funds efforts such as SV-2 on-orbit test & operations support incremental Mission Control Segment (MCS) development including ground mobile command and control test/fielding and support and studies/analyses as required.  The FY13 request funds Interim Contractor Support (ICS).  As SV-2 completes on-orbit test and incrementally developed MCS becomes operational ICS sustains the AEHF system until Initial Operational Capability (IOC) declaration projected late FY14.  Additionally the FY13 request funds preliminary design for the transition of the AEHF Key Management Architecture from the Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) to the Key Management Infrastructure (KMI).  The EKMS and KMI are cryptography key management systems that enable transmission and communications security for the Protected SATCOM enterprise.  The FY13 request also funds continued parts obsolescence studies and redesign and risk reduction on MILSATCOM technologies.  This program is in Budget Activity 4 Advanced Component Development and Prototypes since it funds Advanced EHF technology validation and modeling.","Continuing","Continuing","",

Through FY05 Polar Satellite Communications had funded three low data rate (LDR) Milstar packages on three classified host satellites as an expedited interim solution for protected connectivity requirements in the north polar region (i.e. Interim Polar System (IPS)).  Two satellites with hosted packages are required to provide the necessary 24-hour coverage.  The third package went into operations in November 2008 to sustain the 24-hour coverage.  In FY06 the DoD began funding the next generation Polar Satellite Communications capability with two more polar packages via the same type host vehicle (i.e. Enhanced Polar System (EPS)).  The host spacecraft and the polar communications packages require design modifications to replace obsolete components and take advantage of the more capable Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) technology including the eXtended Data Rate (XDR) waveform.  The EPS Capability Development Document (CDD) Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved in September 2006 is based on a two-package hosted XDR program with operational availability in CY15 and CY17.  The EPS system is intended to be comprised of four segments: Payload Ground Control Gateway and Terminal (acquired by each Service's Terminal Program Office).  In FY11 the EPS CDD was updated to provide a stand-alone ground capability that was no longer fully integrated with AEHF.  The restructured program will deliver “IPS-like” capability with the XDR waveform and a connection to the defense network.  An EPS system-level Preliminary Design Review (PDR) will be held 3QFY2013 and a Milestone B review will be held 4QFY2013. FY13 funds will continue integration of the two EPS packages (payloads) onto the host satellites.  Following award of the ground Control and Planning Segment (CAPS) in late FY12 the program office will begin development of the ground CAPS.  The program office will conduct a PDR of the ground CAPS.  Additionally the program office will conduct a Critical Design Review (CDR) of the Navy-developed ground Gateway segment.The Polar MILSATCOM program is in Budget Activity 4 Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.","Continuing","Continuing","R2Long",

It directly supports Air Force Joint Coalition composite training and rehearsal concept development and acquisition and testing through model and simulation development as well as the integration of these across and within Live Virtual and Constructive (LVC) environments.  This program focuses on support of Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2) acquisition excellence initiatives and foundational capabilities needed for interoperability accessibility reuse and scalability.  It allows the authoritative portrayal of new and emerging Air Force capabilities within Army Navy Marines OSD interagency and coalition LVC environments; as well as reciprocating their capabilities within our Air Force LVC environments.  LVC environments today are used as the most cost effective means to meet mission needs the most practical means and sometimes the only way.  In support of the DoD T2 initiative USAF M&S program thrust areas develop and modernize models and simulations that are the constructive backbone of Air Force and joint training and rehearsal.  Once these models and simulations are developed they are integrated across training LVC environments for use by Major and Combatant Commands.  This development and integration is imperative to ensure that air space and cyberspace training and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic interoperable and readily available tools data and services.  These in turn enable joint coalition and interagency training required to prepare forces for combat by generating the air and space picture for the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) and Joint Force Commander in combat exercises; training over 30000 personnel per year in exercises (e.g. Ulchi Freedom Guardian Red & Blue Flags Unified Endeavor etc).  These programs also provide the current foundational environment that enables warfighters to interact with high-fidelity tactical cockpit simulators like 5th Generation (5th Gen) and beyond which replicate high demand/low density platforms that are often unavailable for training due to real-world operations; while simultaneously linking it to warfighters using their current command and control systems 1000 miles away and the constructive simulations being run from key operational wargaming and simulation centers worldwide. USAF M&S is integral to inter-agency Homeland Defense (HLD) exercises chartered to train combat units tasked to protect the Homeland including the National Capital Region (exercise Amalgam Arrow); generates equipment and manpower efficiencies by using simulations which reduce fuel consumption aircraft wear and tear and manpower costs.  In support of the DoD drive to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its enterprise-wide acquisition business processes the USAF M&S Program Element develops and supports enhancements to models simulations tools and the LVC infrastructure to provide for system-of-systems M&S capabilities across the lifecycle reduce developmental costs and minimize risks. These capabilities support the acquisition process from concept development through test and evaluation.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapons cargo passenger and/or fuel delivery calculate fuel requirements and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review print and brief the mission plan; and download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics. The Mission Planning Systems (MPS) program is a collaborative program with the Army and Navy to leverage technical solutions and business practices for all Department of Defense (DoD) platforms.  It provides automated mission planning tools and support for fixed and rotary wing aircraft and guided munitions.  It will replace two closed architecture legacy mission planning systems (Unix-based MPS (Unix-MPS) and the PC-based Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS)) with a single multi-service open architecture system more commonly referred to as the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).  MPS will compress the mission planning cycle by providing an improved integrated planning environment reducing the time required to respond to changing situations and urgent needs such as striking time sensitive/critical targets and conducting combat search and rescue.  The MPS development program will migrate a variety of Air Force aircraft weapons and airdrop payload systems from legacy mission planners to MPS.  These systems include but are not limited to the: A-10 B-1B C-5 C-17 C-130 E-3 E-8 F-15 F-16 F-22A RC-135 HH-60 and their associated weapons (e.g. Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Munitions (JASSM) etc.) and airdrop payloads.  In addition basic MPS products have the potential to support all DoD fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft and will be shared with other AF programs as well as the Army and Navy.  MPS will deliver significant benefits to command and control performance by enhancing information superiority for the warfighter and by providing unique capabilities in support of both precision engagement and dominant maneuver.  Additionally elements of Mission Planning Systems will be utilized to continue the development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) in conjunction with the Army.The JPADS System of Systems (SoS) capability provides a planning and execution capability for DoD airdrop requirements. It is the primary airdrop mission planning and execution system for all ballistic airdrop mission as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and/or standoff precision delivery.  JPADS enables high-altitude precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces mitigating surface-to-air threats reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) & insurgent attack on ground convoys. JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather terrain aircraft capabilities threat etc. to accurately deliver payloads to keep the warfighter supplied and in the fight.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","Continuing","Continuing","",

It is a fixed-wing high performance single-engine fighter aircraft.  In its 33-year history the F-16 has proven itself in combat in a variety of air-to-air and air-to-surface missions such as offensive and defensive counter-air close air support forward air control air interdiction (day/night and all-weather) and suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD)/destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD).  Also during these years the aircraft has evolved in its capabilities to exploit the advances made in computer avionics systems engine and structures technologies.  The F-16 has been selected by more than 20 air forces around the world and foreign military sales production continues in the 21st century. ASC/WWM (The F-16 System Program Office) develops integrates and qualifies systems to enhance the overall performance of the F-16 mission.  Enhancements which are being or will be developed during the Five Year Defense Plan (FYDP) include:  a. Operational Flight Program (OFP) Development:  Blk 40-52 OFP (M-tapes) are updated continually to integrate new precision weapons advanced targeting pods improved avionics and other hardware (HW) Group B subsystems.  Major tapes (e.g. M6/6+) are released every three years and a minor tape (e.g. M6.2+) is released 1 year after each major tape.  The European Participating Air Forces (EPAF) countries participate in the development of M-tapes and share the cost of developing common capabilities and totally fund development of their unique capabilities.  Generally three major or minor tapes are under development/testing at any one time.  Extensive ground and flight testing is required to field each M-tape.  Advanced weapons integration includes joint air-to-surface stand-off Missile (JASSM) and joint direct attack munitions (JDAM Laser JDAM) small diameter bomb (SDB and SDB II) advanced medium range air-to-air missile (AMRAAM) AIM-9X AIM-9X Block II and updates to existing weapons. Weapons integration also includes tasks such as performing risk reduction activities on advanced weapon integration developing and integrating advanced racks pylons adapters and the universal armament interface (UAI) and ensuring nuclear surety safety and compatibility. ALR-56M software updates allow for incorporation of latest updates for changing threat environment reducing war fighter vulnerabilities.  Link 16 provides the F-16s with a secure jam resistant high-capacity data communications link with other combat aircraft airborne control aircraft and ground control centers.  Major new capabilities currently being integrated via M-tapes include GPS inertial navigation set (GPS/INS) updates to improve targeting accuracy and GPS security EGBU-12 (laser/GPS guided bomb) Mode 5 identification friend or foe (IFF) SDB with UAI AIM-120D joint mission planning system (JMPS) and Alpha II Lite.  As part of OFP Transition and M6.5/M7+ OFP upgrade Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (LM Aero) and Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC) will split responsibility for software development.  LM Aero will produce the common core software tape that will field as M6.5 with the EPAF nations and serve as the baseline for the USAF M7+ OFP.  OO-ALC will have software development responsibility for the M7+ software/ hardware candidates being incorporated on USAF jets with M7+ Phase III OFP development scheduled to start in FY12.  b. F-16 Blk 40-52 Legacy SLEP Structures: Structural-SLEP includes full scale durability test (FSDT) which requires a test fixture and structural analysis to begin structural testing.

The DCGS program is developing a family of systems capable of supporting all levels of conflict interoperable with reconnaissance platforms and sensors and integrated into the Joint Command Control Communication Computer and Intelligence (C4I) environment.  The program integrates architectures and standards from DCGS Imagery architecture for Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) Joint Airborne SIGINT Architecture (JASA) for Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Joint Airborne Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) Architecture (JAMA) for MASINT and all-source analyses to Combat Air Forces and Combatant Commanders.  AF DCGS provides the capability to task intelligence sensors and receive process exploit and disseminate data from airborne and national reconnaissance platforms and commercial sources.  AF DCGS is a 'system of systems' interconnected by a robust communications structure to provide data sharing capabilities between intelligence collectors exploiters producers disseminators and users.  AF DCGS has multiple core locations CONUS and OCONUS based.  Several other AF DCGS systems are distributed among Air Force operational units at Numbered Air Force and Air National Guard locations to support Joint Task Force commanders and Air Operations Centers (AOC).  The CONUS based systems are capable of reach back operations via data link relay and satellite relay connectivity to forward operating sensors.   AF DCGS provides critical data and significant support for Time Sensitive Targeting (TST) operations.  This support will be enhanced with the integration of software tools and data interfaces to process and exploit data from new/upgraded sensors by the demonstration and integration of enhanced fusion/exploitation aid technologies and by the transformation of AF DCGS to a net centric service oriented architecture construct.  By converting from a stovepipe system of systems to a web based integrated net centric Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) management capability  AF DCGS will provide the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) the capability to:  1) dynamically visualize and command ISR assets and the information in the AOC 2) quickly and effectively synchronize AF DCGS ISR operations collection capabilities and information with the AOC's combat objectives to improve the TST process and reduce timelines.  AF DCGS will modernize through sustainment by integrating the necessary technologies and tools to provide increased capabilities and meet emerging and urgent user operational needs.  These efforts will also integrate commercial and government fact-of-life version upgrades to provide current technologies and achieve necessary application and services.  The next series of upgrades will meet the operational need to integrate new and/or improved sensor capabilities and enhance interoperability by migrating to a service oriented architecture and improving data sharing ability in compliance with DoD direction.  AF DCGS will continue to modernize its network management and interface capabilities by upgrading and migrating its network to a standardized interface configuration which is easy to expand and adapt to new technologies while growing capacity requirements.  Efforts will also focus on network management systems and the ability to manage critical bandwidths to meet operational surges and distributed ops requirements. The program will also provide a capability to efficiently compress and decompress airborne ISR sensor data and transmit real/near-real time over existing data/communications links to tactical users. The Air Force has been charged by DoD with developing upgrading and managing the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) for all the Services to provide common DCGS enterprise services and interoperability at the data level. Using the DIB AF DCGS modernization will transform AF DCGS from its existing proprietary system to a net-centric service oriented architecture.The DCGS Imagery (DCGS-I) Testbed is an integration and test environment which is used by the Services and Agency program offices to conduct integration of DCGS components and test interoperability interfaces with new sensors applications and net centric operations.  This testbed also supports the integration and testing of DoD DCGS components prior to introduction into the operational environment.   Upgrades to the DCGS-I Testbed will ensure it maintains current with DCGS standards and architecture.  AF DCGS also participates in the development testing and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint allied and coalition interoperability. The Common Imagery Processor (CIP) is a major interoperability initiative to develop a common sensor processing element within DCGS-Imagery architecture. The function of the CIP is to accept airborne imagery data process it into an exploitable image and output the image to other elements within DCGS-I. Efforts are underway to augment the CIP baseline to process data from upgraded/new sensors.Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","Continuing","Continuing","",

The Department of Navy (DON) component responds to S&T directions of the Naval S&T Strategic Plan for long term Navy and Marine Corps improvements and is in consonance with future warfighting concepts and doctrine developed at the Naval Warfare Development Command and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command.  It enables technologies to significantly improve the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Future Joint Warfighting Capabilities.  The In-house Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program also adds increased emphasis to the revitalization of the scientist and engineer workforce component at the Navy's Warfare Centers and Laboratories by attracting superior candidates and retaining our best members through the provision of exciting and meaningful work.This PE addresses DON Basic Research which includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national-security related aspects of physical engineering environmental and life sciences; and is the core of Discovery and Invention.  Basic research projects are developed managed and related to more advanced aspects of research in some hundred-plus technology and capability-related 'thrusts' which are consolidated in thirteen research focus areas: Power and Energy; Operational Environments; Maritime Domain Awareness; Asymmetric and Irregular Warfare; Information Analysis and Communication; Power Projection; Assure Access and Hold at Risk; Distributed Operations; Naval Warfighter Performance and Protection; Survivability and Self-Defense; Platform Mobility; Fleet/Force Sustainment; Affordability Maintainability and Reliability.  This portion of the DON Basic Research Program provides participating Naval Warfare Centers and Laboratories with funding for: basic research to support the execution of their assigned missions; developing and maintaining a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems; promoting hiring and development of new scientists; and encouragement of collaboration with universities private industry and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories.  ILIR efforts are selected by Naval Warfare Centers/Lab Commanding Officers and Technical Directors near the start of each Fiscal Year through internal competition.  Efforts typically last three years and are generally designed to assess the promise of new lines of research.  Successful efforts attract external competitively awarded funding.  Because the Warfare Centers and Labs encompass the full range of naval technology interests the scope of ILIR topics roughly parallels that of PE 0601153N Defense Research Science.Due to the number of efforts in this PE the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.","Continuing","Continuing","",

The Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT) program develops a canisterized Anti-Torpedo Torpedo (ATT) as an ACAT II program.  The Torpedo Warning System (TWS) develops the required ship systems as an ACAT III program.  Additionally the program will require fielding of the AN/SLQ-25X (NIXIE) (Previously identified as AN/SLQ-25D) system as a tow point for the TWS towed sensors.  This requires interfacing NIXIE power and data transfer with the TWS. The program will focus on first providing torpedo defense capability to High Value Units (HVU). The SSTD system will be installed on one CVN and one Combat Logistics Force (CLF) ship (both HVUs) with initial operational capability (IOC) in FY 2018.Additionally the program will develop and field six surface ship torpedo defense prototype systems (TWS/CAT) on CVNs. Each prototype consists of one TWS and 10 CATs. The 6 systems are required to be accelerated due to the lack of torpedo defense on HVUs which has been exacerbated by recent real-world events and evolving threats. The systems provide a hard-kill torpedo defense capability in advance of the IOC as part of the program of record. To accomplish this effort the department reprogrammed $9.9 million of FY 2010 funds and received a prior approval reprogramming for an additional $7.9 million of FY 2010 funds. The first two prototypes are expected to deliver in FY14 two systems in FY15 and two systems in FY16.Finally the program will deliver one hybrid prototype system in FY 13. This is in addition to the six prototype systems discussed above. The system will deliver some capability to a forward deployed CVN asset before the first prototype system is available.At-sea demonstrations of the Torpedo Detection Classification and Localization (TDCL) systems conducted in FY06 through FY09 led to a CRUDES TDCL draft system specification in FY09 which is being modified to accommodate installation of a system for HVUs.  Additionally in 2nd Qtr FY10 prototype TDCL systems were tested at sea to collect data to characterize the ability of towed active and passive sonar arrays to detect and track threat targets both actively and passively in adverse conditions.  System manufacturing readiness levels indicate FY18 as most acceptable risk for delivery.  Successful at-sea testing of the Anti-Torpedo Torpedo Engineering Development Model (EDM-1) in FY06 through FY09 facilitates completion of the ATT EDM-2 design in early FY12.  The EDM-2 design will be the ATT included in the six fielded prototype systems.","Continuing","Continuing","",

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises the combatant commands the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.This program supports the development and demonstration of field medical equipment diagnostic capabilities and treatments; technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions; and systems to prevent occupational injury and disease in hazardous deployment environments.  Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies.  For example civilian emergency medicine does not address casualty stabilization during long transit times to definitive care.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) focuses on the basic science of disease processes and not product development.  Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation Management (ASBREM) Committee to prevent duplication of effort.  This project funds the Force Health Protection program a Future Naval Capability (FNC) that will provide technology options for future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities and supports the "Sea Warrior" component of the Naval Transformation Roadmap medical logistics aspects of "Sea Basing" and expeditionary force medical support associated with "Sea Strike".Due to the number of efforts in this PE the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.","Continuing","Continuing","",

ISSP activities address the risk management of cyberspace defined in "The National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dec 2006 and of defensive Information Operations (IO) defined in Joint Publication 3-13; including the capabilities to protect detect restore and respond. ISSP supports the entire Naval cyberspace domain from the mobile forward-deployed subscriber through the ashore supporting critical information infrastructure and the interconnection with other cyberspace domains. The interconnectivity of naval and joint networks connections to allied and coalition partners connections to the public information infrastructure and their use in naval and joint war fighting means that Navy cyberspace is a higher value and  more vulnerable target. Navy cyber systems face advanced attacks involving malicious changes to critical  information changes to the functionality of critical systems denial of service (including jamming) and the destruction of systems and networks. Since many Naval cyber systems are  based on commercially available technologies an adversary often has access to the technologies they want to exploit. Rapid changes in the underlying commercial and government cyber infrastructures makes cyber security an increasingly complex and dynamic problem. ISSP provides the Navy's war fighter the essential information trust characteristics of availability confidentiality integrity authentication and non-repudiation. Information Assurance (IA) a key supporting cyber security activity must evolve quickly to meet the rapidly evolving threats and vulnerabilities. Implementing ISSP requires rapid acquisition approaches to stay ahead of nation-states terrorists and criminal organization adversaries among others. The ISSP program provides the Navy with the following cyber security elements: (1) defense of NSSI; (2) assured separation of information levels and user communities including allied coalition non-Governmental Defense Industrial Base and other public partners; (3) technologies supporting the Navy's Computer Network Defense Service Providers (CNDSP) operations; (4) assurance use of the Navy's telecommunications infrastructure and the wireless spectrum; (5) assurance of joint user cyberspace domains using a defense-in-depth architecture; (6) assurance of the critical computing base and information store; and (7) supporting assurance technologies including a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The ISSP program must be rapid predictive adaptive and tightly coupled to cyberspace technology. Through modeling and simulation of Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial cyberspace systems evolution the ISSP program provides architectures products and services based on mission impacts information criticality threats vulnerabilities and required defensive countermeasure capabilities.All ISSP RDT&E efforts comply with the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-113) as implemented through Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-119 of February 10 1998 DoD Instruction 4120.24 Defense Standardization Program (DSP) and DoD Instruction 4120.3-M Defense Standardization Program Policies and Procedures. The predominant commercial standards bodies in ISSP-related matters include International Organization for Standardization American National Standards Institute Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Internet Engineering Task Force World Wide Web Consortium and National Institute of Standards and Technologies. The joint interoperability required in today's telecommunications systems makes standards compliance a must and the ISSP RDT&E program complies with the joint technical architecture. The FORCEnet architecture and standards documents reflect this emphasis on interoperable standards. The connection of FORCEnet with the DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) requires all ISSP RDT&E activities to adopt a minimum standard of "best commercial IA practices." The ISSP program examines commercial technologies to determine their fit within Navy architectures provides feedback to vendors about what the Navy requires and participates in the standards bodies themselves. When necessary to protect mission critical systems specified in the Clinger/Cohen Act ISSP RDT&E develops or tailors commercial and government technologies standards and processes to meet Navy-unique requirements; prototypes systems or portions of systems and examines their utility in operational Navy settings; and provides Information Assurance (IA) expertise and engineering to Navy and joint information system developments. All ISSP technology development efforts endeavor to solve specific Navy and joint IA problems using techniques that speed transition to procurement as soon as possible.

AMF JTRS will operate with legacy radios and waveforms used by civilian and military airborne surface subsurface and fixed station platforms.  AMF JTRS is intended to provide new radio networking capability as well as replace existing radio systems which are facing long-term sustainment issues.  AMF JTRS capabilities will be incrementally developed with each increment building on the technological achievements of its predecessor while providing expanded capabilities. MIDS - Low Volume Terminal (LVT) is a jam-resistant secure digital (voice and data) information distribution system enabling rapid integrated communications navigation and identification for tactical and command and control operations. The technical objective of the MIDS JTRS program is to transform the MIDS-LVT into a four-channel Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant JTRS while maintaining current Link-16 and tactical air navigation system (TACAN) functionality.  MIDS JTRS is designed to be plug-and-play interchangeable for U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force platforms that use MIDS-LVT while accommodating future technologies and capabilities.  Improvements such as Link-16 enhanced throughput Link-16 frequency remapping and programmable crypto are realized in the MIDS JTRS design.  The MIDS JTRS core terminal includes three 2 MHz to 2 GHz programmable channels that allow the warfighter to use multiple waveforms in development by JNED.  Total core terminal program requirements include: terminal development F/A-18 Level 0 integration software hosting (operating environment/waveforms) and production transition.  MIDS JTRS will also provide Concurrent Multi-Netting-4 (CMN-4) and Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT).  These capabilities provide Joint Airborne Network-Tactical Edge (JAN-TE) functionality to run advanced mission applications in a cross-platform/cross-domain tactical network enterprise and the ability to simultaneously participate in four Link-16 Nets.  GMR following a critical Nunn McCurdy breach the USD AT&L conducted a reassessment of the GMR program. Conclusions of the reassessment did not support certification of the program thereby cancelling the program. In accordance with the ADM dated 14 October 2011 the GMR program office is directed to conduct an orderly shutdown of the existing GMR System Development and Demonstration contract which expires on 30 March 2012.    HMS provides the JTRS capability to meet Joint Ground Mounted Dismounted & Embedded Radio Requirements.

NCW also includes 14 Inshore Boat Units (IBU) comprised of 6 small craft (boats) each on which are installed C4I systems. The Mobile Inshore Undersea Warfare - System Upgrade (MIUW-SU) the primary system used by the NCW MIUW Units is the only land-based and rapidly deployable mobile Navy system with the ability to conduct surface and subsurface surveillance in coastal and littoral areas. The system provides detailed contact information via various C4I systems to the tactical area commander based on radar visual thermal electronic and underwater acoustic sensor information. Missions supported with the MIUW-SU's are: OCONUS and INCONUS Force Protection protecting port areas high value assets and surveilling the near shore areas. The MAST III is the C4ISR hub for the NCW Commander. MAST IIIs deploy to support Force Protection/Force Security Officer for Commander Amphibious Group in its Harbor Defense and Coastal Sea Control missions.In the aftermath of the attack on USS COLE and particularly post 11 SEP the role structure and utilization for the NCW program has changed appreciably and continues to evolve in the face of developing world events. However the core competencies resident in expeditionary NCW forces to conduct surveillance C4I and patrol/interdiction have not changed.NCW remains a specialized force constituted to accomplish specific tasks under specific conditions but also agile enough to fill emergent and non-traditional roles. Post 11 SEP NCW Groups and Units have been mobilized to perform force protection missions at different levels in all CinC area of responsibility (AOR)'s and within the continental United States in support of Maritime Homeland Security. This RDT&E exhibit supports the future direction of Naval Coastal Warfare as it is being determined externally by world events and internally by the progress of DoD initiatives to replace Cold War forces and capabilities with 21st century transformational forces and capabilities. NCW forces currently field legacy systems designed to counter more traditional military threats in a two Major Theater War scenario. Future NCW forces will develop into a highly effective relatively low cost transformational force capable of operating anywhere in the world to perform a spectrum of force protection missions ranging from full scale port security/harbor defense operations during wartime to short duration point defense of high value units or facilities in operations other than war. This transformational force will be agile tailorable and scalable and will use applied technology to quickly detect deter or interdict potential threats to DON Assets in the littoral environment. Next generation surface and subsurface surveillance systems as well as enhanced C4I capabilities are required to meet these operational objectives. These capabilities must be interoperable with higher and adjacent echelons of command (to include coalition allies) as well as with supporting elements to include joint forces.Sea Eagle is an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) with USN as lead service and USSOCOM as the Combatant Command sponsor. Sea Eagle will provide integrated and enhanced technologies in order to provide persistent clandestine and unattended monitoring of denied and sensitive maritime littoral and harbor areas. These sensors andsystems will be deliverable by Special Operational Forces (SOF) and networked in a multi-media (sea air land) system of systems approach. Sea Eagle will focus on close access networking both wireless through air and underwater to support networked tactical sensors. The special operations warfighter will tactically emplace Sea Eagle systems to provide targeted tactical information that complements national and theater intelligence assets to enable a layered intelligence collection strategy.Riverine Force will integrate and employ a variety of surface and air assets special vehicles weapons and appropriately trained personnel. Mission assets needed to support the operational capabilities will vary widely dependant on the Host Nations involved. The Riverine Squadron will deploy with inherent but limited force protection capabilities. The Modular Unmanned Scouting Craft Littoral (MUSCL) is man-portable "X-Class" Unmanned Surface Vehicle providing enhanced surveillance and reconnaissance capability to Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) Riverine forces.Regional Maritime Awareness Capability (RMAC) - support GWOT by providing other USG Agencies with maritime traffic information that is not currently available. RMAC also provides enhanced regional security safety economic stability and environmental protection through shared maritime domain awareness (MDA).Naval Irregular Warfare Office (NIWO) will provide for the identification and assessment of available technologies to confront irregular challenges (CIC) urgent and unfulfilled needs of the warfighter.  It provides for the validation and combat demonstration of identified technologies and/or packages of technologies to meet Oversea Contingency Operation (OCO) goals.  It also provides funding necessary to attract additional investment and sustainment.  The goal of the NIWO office is to identify those requirements necessary to meet the immediate warfighter needs; integrate those existing unique and/or related capabilities that can best meet those warfighter needs; test those integrated capabilities; and then demonstrate in real time and/or during planned deployments all within an 8 month period.  Those areas of capability to be investigated by the Navy IW office include any or all of the following:- Persistent Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR)- Close-in expeditionary ISR - Conventional forces support to SOF- Rotary wing support to SOF - All source intelligence fusion - Littoral precision strike capability","Continuing","Continuing","",

Key radar technologies are Space-Time Adaptive Processing Electronically Scanning Array solid state transmitter high dynamic range digital receivers and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF)/radar aperture integration. The resultant detection system will provide a substantially improved overland performance by correcting current sensor shortfalls and enhancing all current required mission areas while simultaneously contributing to the emerging TAMD mission requirements.   Mode 5/S is an upgrade to the existing IFF System providing the warfighter positive secure and reliable identification of friendly aircraft surface and sub-surface platforms.  Mode 5/S replaces the National Security Administration de-certified Mode 4 IFF capability which is no longer effective or suitable for modern military operations.  Mode 5/S will support the Joint Initial Operational Capability (IOC) as defined by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council.The E-2D program is currently in developmental test through FY12 utilizing four System Development and Demonstration test aircraft based at NAS Patuxent River Maryland and one Operational Test aircraft assigned to the E-2/C-2 Fleet Replacement Squadron (VAW-120) at Norfolk Virginia. Milestone C approval received in June 2009 granting the program the authority to enter the Production and Deployment phase and procure Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Lots 1 and 2 (total of five aircraft) which are on contract to deliver thru FY13.  The E-2D program proceeded to a Defense Acquisition Board with USD(AT&L) in March 2011 at which time the program received authorization to let contracts for LRIP Lots 3 and 4 as well as Advance Acquisition Contract for Full Rate Production (FRP) Lot 1.  Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) is planned in FY12 and the Full Rate Production Decision Review is planned in 1QFY13 with subsequent FRP 1 contract award.  IOC is planned for 1QFY15.  An In-Flight Refueling (IFR) capability will allow the E-2D AHE to receive fuel from various organic and non-organic tanker aircraft.  It provides Expanded Battle Space Surveillance and Targeting through significantly enhanced persistence and increased flexibility (range & endurance).  IFR will better enable the E-2D AHE to fully support current Carrier Strike Group /Joint 24/7 Theater Operations by providing more versatile stationing and/or forward basing options.  Previous domestic E-2 concept demonstration effort successfully established the feasibility of tanking behind the F/A-18E/F and KC-130 aircraft under E-2 Squadrons PE 0204152N.Link-16 Crypto Modernization and frequency remap are required to satisfy the National Security Agency and Federal Aviation Administration mandates.  E-2D AHE uses Link-16 to exchange and provide tactical information with other tactical units.  The Link-16 Crypto Modernization and frequency remap effort requires the integration of a modified Multifunctional Information Distribution System - Low Volume Terminal (1) terminal and software modification to the E-2D AHE mission computer operational flight program.The Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Guard Radio allows the aircrew to monitor the emergency UHF Guard frequency without having to dedicate a specific radio freeing that radio up for use in the tactical mission.  Because of the UHF Tunable Filter Amplifiers the ARC-210 radios cannot provide continuous UHF guard monitoring although the internal guard receiver is operational. A separate Ultra High Frequency (UHF) guard receiver is provided for monitoring the UHF guard (243 MHz) frequency. It is powered by the Guard switch located on the Communication/Control Display Unit Power Panel.FY2013 starts a Counter Electronic Attack (CEA) capability which will allow the E-2D radar system to maintain performance in an advanced hostile intentional electromagnetic interference environment. The E-2D CEA program will ensure E-2D effectiveness is maintained in an Electronic Attack environment supporting the Naval Integrated Fire Control - Counter Air (NIFC-CA) capability and overall Navy and Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense strategy.FY2014 starts an E-2D Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) chat program.  The SIPR-chat capability will support integration of current collaboration tools including tactical "chat" (text) communications real-time tasking and Air Tasking Order distribution.  Recent real world operations have demonstrated a migration of Command and Control communications from voice to Internet protocol based networks.","28.700","933.811","",

Currently two Type Model Series aircraft are used by HMX-1 for the Presidential support mission - the VH-3D and the VH-60N. The VH-71 program was the replacement helicopter for the VH-3D and VH-60N. In order for the VH-71 to be available to most effectively assume Presidential vertical lift mission by FY10 two Increments were to be developed. Increment 1 was to provide an initial limited capability to fulfill the immediate need Presidential lift requirement. Three (3) test article aircraft System Design and Development efforts (SDD) maintenance trainers and associated logistics were initiated in 2005 for Increment 1. Included in the SDD contract were five (5) Increment 1 pilot production aircraft to support Initial Operational Capability. Increment 2 was to be developed to complete all of the Presidential support requirements. Two test articles were to be procured in FY09 to accommodate air vehicle structural differences between Increment 1 and 2 (main gear box drive train engines tail unit and main rotor blades). The second test vehicle was to be procured instead of pursuing the planned modifications to one of the Increment 1 test vehicles due to the extent of the air vehicle structural differences. Due to increased cost and schedule growth the Secretary of Defense and Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology and Logistics)'s USD (AT&L) directed cancellation of the VH-71 program.

Analysis and demonstration have established that surface SSD based on single-sensor detection point-to-point control architecture performs marginally against current and projected Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats.  The supersonic seaskimming ASCM reduces the effective battle space to the horizon and the available reaction time-line to less than 30 seconds from first opportunity to detect until the ASCM impacts its target ship.  Against such a threat multi-sensor integration is required for effective detection and parallel processing is essential to reduce reaction time to acceptable levels and to provide vital coordination/integration of hardkill and softkill assets. These SSD projects address and coordinate the detect and control functions necessary to meet the rigorous SSD requirements within a development structure dedicated to systems engineering. DETECTION: Improvements in coordinated sensor performance to increase the probability of detecting low altitude low observable targets are to be achieved through the synergism gained from the integration of dissimilar sensor sources.  Multi-sensor integration is being addressed through the efforts of Quick Reaction Combat Capability (QRCC) (2178) while sensor improvements were addressed through the SPS Improvements (0166).  These provide improvements to both active and passive detection. CONTROL: Multi-sensor integration parallel processing and the coordination of hardkill/softkill capabilities in an automated doctrine-based response to the ASCM threats are the cornerstones of Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) being developed through QRCC (2178) efforts.  In addition that project provides for the central system engineering management of SSD developments including efforts required to integrate SSDS with the Advanced Combat Direction System (ACDS) functionality for those ships having a CDS with the Open Architecture Computing Environment and with advanced sensor weapon and C4I upgrades.Shipboard Protection System (SPS) develops an integrated shipboard suite of systems designed to detect identify and engage asymmetric surface threats.Integrated Swimmer Defense (ISD) scope is to provide the Navy Expeditionary security forces with capabilities of a portable marine integrated swimmer defense system (ISDS) to engage combat swimmers/divers or unknown individuals underwater once they have been detected.Non-Lethal Weapons provides a long range laser warning and dazzle systems for use in the maritime environment.  Optical warning and distraction has been identified by the services as a possible technology solution to mitigate and/or address several known joint non-lethal capability gaps.","Continuing","Continuing","",

The Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) is the worldwide Department of Defense (DoD) standard network for transmitting time-sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence and targeting data to all echelons of Joint Service operational users. The JPO's role is to consolidate and replace existing IBS terminal functionality and capability and to expedite execution of the IBS Technical Transition Plan (TTP). The JTT family of systems currently consists of the JTT-Senior and JTT-IBS. The TTP is a comprehensive refresh effort of the entire IBS network focused on rearchitecting the broadcast from its current multi-broadcast multi-data format structure to a single broadcast (Common Interactive Broadcast - CIB) and single data format (Common Message Format - CMF). The JTT family of systems is a critical component of the TTP as these systems are the only IBS receiver/transceiver devices in the DoD being modernized to support both the new consolidated broadcast architecture and the National Security Agency's (NSA) crypto modernization mandate. The JTT upgrades must execute the over-the-air broadcast portion of the TTP in the near term to avoid a complete cessation of IBS data flow via the existing over-the-air IBS broadcast networks. The JTT will be the official IBS producer system ensuring continued IBS interoperability to a variety of tactical receivers across DoD and the services throughout the TTP implementation period and beyond. This program funds the integration and evaluation of JTT hardware and software modules as well as implementing performance enhancements to the family of JTT equipment. This is necessary to ensure crypto modernization compliance and to facilitate migration to a rearchitected CIB and CMF-based IBS broadcast structure.  FY13 Funds of $.096 million support the final testing of the Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) waveform migration to the IBS Intelligence Data Enterprise.  The JTT technical insertion transitions to sustainment by the end of FY12. During the November 2010 POM brief a zero-sum request was submitted to shift $1.5 million of FY13 Base Research Development Testing and Evaluation dollars to FY13 Base Procurement dollars to sustain support for DoD customers.","","","",

The Improved Sentinel system is used with the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) element and is a key component to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense architecture via the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) to provide critical air surveillance of the forward areas.Improved Sentinel (AN/MPQ-64A1) consists of a radar-based sensor with its prime mover/power Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) and Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) Command Control and Intelligence (C2I) interfaces.  The radar is deployed in both an air defense role and a force protection role for Counter-Rocket Artillery and Mortar (C-RAM) missions.  The sensor is an advanced three-dimensional battlefield X-Band air defense phased-array radar with an instrumented range of 75 km.  The Improved Sentinel is capable of operating day or night in adverse weather conditions in the battlefield environments of dust smoke aerosols and enemy countermeasures.  It provides 360-degree azimuth coverage for acquisition tracking.  The Improved Sentinel contributes to the digital battlefield by automatically detecting classifying identifying and reporting targets (cruise missiles unmanned aerial vehicles rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft).  Improved Sentinel acquires targets sufficiently forward of the battle area to allow weapons reaction time and engagement at optimum ranges.  The Improved Sentinel's integrated IFF reduces the potential for fratricide of US and Coalition aircraft.  The Research and Development funding supports Sentinel modernization/upgrades hardware/software issue resolution resolution of obsolescence issues engineering studies and cost reduction initiatives.  The funding for FY 2012 through FY 2017 development activities addresses the following obsolescence issues and Sentinel system capability gaps identified by the User:  1) Target Detection gap; 2) Target Tracking gap; 3) Net Readiness; and 4) Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) gap. Battle Space Improvement addresses the Target Detection gap that currently exists with the Sentinel system.  This development effort modifies the radar signal processor algorithms to reduce system processing losses.  The modified algorithms will increase target acquisition and tracking range capability by a minimum of 12 percent against the threat set within the instrumented range band.  This effort also develops modifications to the radar hardware by adding a common signal processing card to the radar signal processor to provide a common hardware and software processing configuration across the Sentinel radar fleet.Stop Stare and Track addresses the Target Tracking gap.  This development effort provides direct Fire Control Radar (FCR) support to a suitable Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) and/or Rockets Artillery and Mortars (RAM) capability such as the Tamir missile.  In addition this provides significantly improved Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) timeline and performance against all targets.  It also enables rapid classification of cued RAM as well as very accurate Point of Origin (POO) and Point of Impact (POI) and enables a robust Kill Assessment capability of engaged targets.Cross Domain Solution (CDS) Network Interface addresses net readiness and system security concerns. This effort develops a CDS interface to isolate the Improved Sentinel from connected networks of lower classification levels.Electronic Counter Counter Measures (ECCM) addresses the ECM gap.  This effort conducts additional testing to verify initial ECCM results and updates the database with more extensive ECCM signatures of evolving threats.Signal Data Processor (SDP)/North Finding Module (NFM) addresses the Target Detection Target Tracking and ECM capability gaps and funds the mitigation of the SDP and NFM obsolescence issues.

CATT enables units from crew to the battalion task force level to conduct a wide variety of combat tasks on a realistic interactive synthetic battlefield.  CATT's combination of manned simulators and staff officer workstations enables units to train as a combined arms team in a cost effective manner.  The primary CATT system is the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) which provides the underlying baseline architecture and After Action Review (AAR) for CATT expansions Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and system enhancements.  The Reconfigurable Vehicle Simulator (RVS) and Dismounted Soldier Training System (DSTS) variants support combat convoy operations and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) tasks.  Synthetic Environment (SE) Core provides for the expansion of the synthetic environment baseline to include enhanced interoperability and the products and infrastructure to support current and future combat operations and mission rehearsal required for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and Decisive Operations.  The first synthetic environments expanded were in the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and the CCTT for both the Active and Reserve components.  Gaming Technology provides an application to train and rehearse convoy-operations platoon level mounted infantry tactics dismounted operations rules-of-engagement training cross-cultural communications training IED defeat training route clearance ground-air coordination Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) integration and other small unit and individual training and mission rehearsal requirements.  Soldiers can train in a common environment on geotypical or geospecific terrain.  It is also possible to link Gaming technology to actual communication command control computer and intelligence (C4I) systems and other CATT simulation systems to increase the utility and realism of the training.  By practicing skills in CATT units are able to effectively prepare for costly live fire and maneuver exercises as well as train tasks deemed too hazardous to conduct in a live training environment.  Fielded in both fixed site and mobile versions CATT enables both Active and Reserve component units to prepare for real world contingency missions.  By being able to use a wide array of training terrain databases and modify the behavior of the computer generated opposing forces CATT offers an unlimited array of training options to support the Army's many regional combat missions.  The combination of tough field and live fire training and realistic simulation training in CATT is the formula to prepare Soldiers and their Leaders for the uncertainties they face in current combat operations in Afghanistan and their transition to Decisive Operations.FY 2013 Project 571 core funding of $4.252 million for CCTT enables the P3I for the CCTT Dismounted Soldier Training System (DSTS) system in support of Infantry Brigade Combat Teams Stryker Brigade Combat Teams Airborne Ranger Special Forces units and Heavy Brigade Combat Teams. FY 2013 Project 577 core funding of $1.348 million for Games for Training will integrate OneSAF and new commercial and government technology products into the current gaming system. FY 2013 Project 582 core funding of $9.616 million for SE Core will provide for common terrain databases to be generated by the Terrain Database Center (TDC).

Products result from investigating analyzing assessing and reporting on the survivability of Soldiers and on the survivability lethality and vulnerability (SLV) of the highest priority Army systems whether those systems are employed during stability support defensive or offensive missions.  Developed through measurement experiment test support and modeling and simulation (M&S) the products funded by this project are used in many ways to make the Army force more survivable.  The project provides quantitative lethality and survivability analyses and data for fielded and developmental systems as the Army makes the required choices to decisively transform into a modular Brigade Combat Team (BCT) based organization.  Specific survivability analysis products include assessments of systems such as WIN-T Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Stryker Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) Army fire support systems direct fire munitions; Army air defense and missile defense systems; Army aviation systems including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; network communications and other network enabled battle command systems communication systems; and selected joint services systems particularly relevant to the Army's joint and expeditionary role.  Products also include analysis and data concerning individual Soldier items including protective equipment such as helmets and vests.  These survivability products are leveraged into rapid-equipping initiatives and other technical support for operational forces involved in the current fight.  Continued development of these products also guarantees preservation of the Army's vitally needed technical corporate memory for expert survivability advice.Survivability analyses funded by this project are conducted across the spectrum of battlefield threats to include guns missiles mines and other methods of inflicting physical damage; jammers countermeasures and other electronic warfare techniques; information assurance and computer network operations; and directed energy weapons.  This survivability information enables developers users and decision makers to perform credible survivability tradeoffs for both Soldiers and materiel.  These technical survivability details enable properly informed decisions concerning systems and tactics that maximize both the combat power and survivability of Army forces.  Survivability data and analysis results funded by this project are efficiently leveraged for many different Army uses reducing total cost to the Army by eliminating the need for duplicative capabilities funded by individual system developers.  Central funding of this mission assures the Army accurate and consistent treatment of survivability across all classes of systems across all formal system Evaluations and across the Army's AR 5-5 studies process.  Work program is prioritized principally by the ATEC/AEC and is used by them in the Army's formal Evaluation process in such a way that ATEC can comply with its legally mandated responsibility to assess system survivability along with effectiveness and suitability.  Program Managers (PM) and the Program Executive Officers (PEO) use the survivability analyses and data funded by this project to make design decisions that are optimized for survivability to direct specific weapon system development efforts that are needed for survivability enhancement and to structure product improvement programs. Soldier survivability data and analysis is leveraged to support the survivability portion of the HQDA G1 MANPRINT program.  TRADOC combat developers exploit the survivability products funded by this project to initiate and improve survivability/lethality requirements and to develop and refine doctrine and tactics.  Also the quantitative analytical results funded by the project are leveraged as core inputs to formal AR 5-5 studies and other studies as directed by Army leaders.  While the Army is at war analytical results funded by this project are also directly leveraged for survivability support to current operations.  Finally for particularly urgent or controversial survivability issues data and analysis funded by this project are used directly by senior Army decision makers to assure technically sound program/production decisions.    This project also supports highly technical specialized information assurance and computer network defense survivability analysis of Army battle command/networked systems as well as Army network architectures and technology.
