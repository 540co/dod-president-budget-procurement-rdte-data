These instruments are used on all Navy Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command vessels and at every Navy shore installation in order to ensure the safety of personnel continuity of operations in radiological contingencies and protection of the environment.Justification:  Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 20 (10 CFR 20) requires RADIAC instruments be used to ensure the safety of personnel who work with or are exposed to radioactive materials in their work.  Additionally the Navy's mission requires personnel and ships to have the ability to operate in radiological environments and the ability to identify and interdict radiological Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  Navy programs that require RADIAC instruments for Occupational Safety & Health (OSH) reasons under the provisions of 10 CFR 20 include Naval Nuclear Propulsion Nuclear Weapons Medical and Radiological Affairs Support.  Non-OSH programs include Radiological Defense Consequence Management Training Technical (RADIAC calibration shielding evaluation research etc.) and Radiological Search (maritime interdiction and radiological search missions to locate or intercept WMD).This budget item develops tests and evaluates new highly reliable more easily calibrated easy to care and maintain light weight and modern RADIAC instruments in order to improve the effectiveness of radiation safety to make instruments simpler to use and to reduce life cycle costs.  The ultimate goal is to replace old bulky costly to maintain and repair unreliable and obsolete instrumentation with multifunction equipment that can be automatically calibrated at greatly reduced cost.This budget item also provides for improvement to nuclear weapons intrinsic radiation (gamma and neutron) shielding calculations mixed field (neutron and gamma) dosimetry and in neutron measurement.  The objective is to develop less costly and more effective integral shielding for better personnel protection and safety.  Improvement in personnel dosimetry and neutron measurement is also a major emphasis.","","","","","",

CEC distributes sensor data from each USMC Command Control Unit USA Aerostat US Navy Ship and US Navy Aircraft or cooperating unit (CU) to all other CUs in the battle force through a real-time line of sight high data rate sensor and engagement data distribution network. CEC is highly resistant to jamming and provides accurate gridlocking between CUs. Each CU independently employs high capacity parallel processing and advanced algorithms to combine all distributed sensor data into a fire control quality track picture which is the same for all CUs. CEC data is presented as a superset of the best AAW sensor capabilities from each CU all of which are integrated into a single input to each CU's combat weapons system. CEC significantly improves our Battle Force defense in depth including both local area and ship defense capabilities against current and future AAW threats. Moreover CEC provides critical connectivity and integration of over-land air defense systems capable of countering emerging air threats including land attack cruise missiles in a complex littoral environment.Each military Service funds CEC development for their combat systems.  The CEC Program Office oversees CEC development for all services.CEC consists of the Data Distribution System (DDS) the Cooperative Engagement Processor (CEP) and interface with Combat Systems and sensors. The DDS encodes and distributes own-ship sensor and engagement data and is a high capacity jam resistant directive system providing a precision gridlocking and high throughput of data. The CEP is a high capacity distributed processor that processes force levels of data in near real-time. The data is passed to the ship's combat system as high quality data for which the ship can cue its onboard sensors or use the data to engage targets without actually tracking them. The Navy implemented a Signal Data Processor (SDP) approach to modify the current equipment to meet reduced size weight cost power and cooling objectives. This SDP approach also supports continuity for interoperability improvements and program protection as well as supporting open architecture initiatives and comms independence. The SDP hardware complies with Category 3 Open Architecture Computing Environment (OACE) standards.  The SDP-S is being fielded fleet-wide to all US Navy USMC US Army and FMS CEC units.A family of antennas approach will be used to satisfy CEC requirements with lower life cycle costs (procurement installation and maintenance) and reduced weight (on mast and below deck).  These antennas enable future capability as well as providing a solution extensible to additional platforms.  This effort for development and production of Common Array Block (CAB) antennas was competitively awarded in late FY2013.In support of Interoperability CEC will continue to work collaboratively with other Combat Systems programs (AWS E-2C E-2D SSDS CDLMS C2P and SGS/AC) to develop the software and implement design corrections and system changes. CEC will analyze the interactions of interoperability issues and impacts and provide collaboration for development of CEC and other system changes develop the long term solutions including the engineering process to validate small parts of developmental software ideas and utilize M&S to validate design approaches in the systems engineering realm.","","","582","","",

It includes the Advanced Tactical Data Link Systems (ATDLS) Integration Programs specifically Link 16 Network Command and Control Processor (C2P) and Link Monitoring and Management Tool (LMMT); and Network Tactical Common Data Link (NTCDL) Program which provides the ability to transmit/receive real-time Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) data simultaneously from multiple sources (surface air sub-surface man-portable) and exchange command and control information (voice data imagery and Full Motion Video (FMV)) across dissimilar Joint Service Coalition and civil networks. The Program Element also develops and tests tactical data link capability to distribute other data types to new and existing platforms.JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under Operational Systems Development because it encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for upgrade of existing operational systems.Network Tactical Common Data Link (NTCDL) provides the ability to transmit/receive real-time Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) data simultaneously from multiple sources (surface airborne sub-surface man-portable) and exchange command and control information (voice data imagery and Full Motion Video) across dissimilar Joint Service Coalition and civil networks. NTCDL provides warfighters with the capability to support multiple simultaneous networked operations with currently fielded Common Data Link (CDL)-equipped platforms (e.g. F/ A-18 P-3 and MH-60R) in addition to next generation manned and unmanned platforms (e.g. P-8 Triton UCLASS and Fire Scout). NTCDL is an incremental capability (surface airborne sub-surface man-portable) providing a modular scalable multiple-link networked communications. NTCDL benefits the fleet by providing horizon extension for line-of-sight sensor systems for use in time critical strike missions. NTCDL counters Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) through its relay capability and supports Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation Dissemination (TCPED) through its ISR networking capability.  Additionally NTCDL supports Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR) efforts through its ability to share ISR data across dissimilar Joint Service Coalition and Civil organizations.Joint Aerial Layer Network-Maritime (JALN-M) is the Navy implementation of the JALN architecture which provides assured communications in any environment especially A2/AD. With disruption or loss of Space tier communications JALN-M establishes and/or restores connectivity with the High Capacity Backbone (HCB) tier the Distribution Access Range Extension (DARE) tier and the Transition tier in accordance with the JALN-M Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and the JALN-M Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Final Report. JALN-M is a robust assured communications capability providing joint connectivity via the HCB and Navy platform connectivity via a pseudo satellite DARE capability. JALN-M will use the Extended Data Rate (XDR) waveform (Navy Multiband Terminal (NMT)) for intra-battle group DARE communications a CDL waveform for the HCB cross-link capability and will leverage enhanced Ultra High Frequency/High Frequency (UHF/HF) waveforms for coalition connectivity. Furthermore Positioning Navigation and Timing (PNT) efforts related to the JALN-M Pod will develop a prototype PNT subsystem that will be integrated into the JALN-M Pod and will provide position and timing data to other Pod subsystems both with and without Global Positioning System (GPS) connectivity.  Because the Pod is being designed to operate in an A2/AD environment the Pod HCB and XDR (i.e. NMT) subsystems need to be provided with PNT data in the absence of GPS and the assured PNT subsystem will provide that data.Link 16 Network Program provides high power shipboard and shore integrated Link 16 capability through the fielding of Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) on Ships (MOS) and MOS Modernization (MOS Mod) including transmit and receive antennas and High Power Amplifiers (HPA).  JTIDS MOS and MOS Mod utilizes the JTIDS MIDS Low Volume Terminal (LVT) and  MIDS Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) terminals respectively integrates the HPA and interfaces to the shipboard  antenna and Command and Control Processor (C2P) . MIDS-LVT and MIDS JTRS terminals are developed by the MIDS Program Office. JTIDS terminal is no longer in production but is undergoing product improvement to maintain interoperability and security with MIDS-LVT and MIDS JTRS. As part of the product improvement all shipboard link 16 terminals are required to have Dynamic Network Management (DNM) Crypto Modernization (CM) and Frequency Remapping (FR). MIDS Program Office is developing additional improvements to the MIDS-LVT and MIDS JTRS terminals. The MIDS-LVT will have Link 16 Enhanced Throughput (ET) and the MIDS JTRS will have the added capability of four net Concurrent Multi-Netting (CMN) with Current Contention Receive (CCR) and Tactical Targeting Networking Technology (TTNT).The Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) program consists of two (2) products MIDS Low Volume Terminal (LVT) and MIDS Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). MIDS-LVT provides Link 16 capability to platforms that were unable to employ Joint Tactical Information Distribution System due to space and weight constraints. The MIDS-LVT effort is multinational (U.S. France Germany Italy and Spain) with joint Service participation (Navy Army and Air Force). The Department of Defense (DoD) established the program to design develop and deliver low volume lightweight tactical information system terminals for U.S. and Allied fighter aircraft bombers helicopters ships and ground sites. MIDS-LVT provides interoperability with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) users significantly increasing force effectiveness and minimizing hostile actions and friend-on-friend engagements. The terminal design is smaller lighter highly reliable interoperable with JTIDS Class 2 terminal compatible with all the participants' designated platforms affordable and re-configurable to individual user needs and budgets.MIDS JTRS designed as a Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) and executed as an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to the production MIDS-LVT configuration completed qualification in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. It facilitated the JTRS incremental approach for fielding advanced JTRS transformational networking capability and transformed the MIDS-LVT into a 4-channel Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant Joint Tactical Radio. A form-fit-function replacement to MIDS-LVT MIDS JTRS also adds three programmable 2 Megahertz (MHz) to 2 Gigahertz (GHz) channels capable of hosting the JTRS legacy and networking waveforms. In addition to the Link 16 Tactical Air Navigation and voice functionality found in MIDS-LVT MIDS JTRS has four channels and adds capabilities such as Link 16 Enhanced Throughput Link 16 Frequency Re-mapping software programmability Cryptographic Modernization and Four Net Concurrent Multi-Netting with Concurrent Contention Receive(CMN-4). With CMN-4 MIDS JTRS also utilizes Tactical Targeting Network Technology for MIDS JTRS Naval Integrated Fire Control Counter Air and From the Air Advanced Tactical Data Links.  These capabilities provide Joint Airborne Network-Tactical Edge functionality to run advanced mission applications in a cross-platform/cross-domain tactical network enterprise and the ability to simultaneously participate in four Link 16 Nets.","","","","","",

The Department of Defense (DoD) has defined a DCGS architecture that will be compatible and interoperable across all of the Services' Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems and operations. DCGS accesses and ingests data from space borne airborne subsurface and surface ISR collection assets intelligence databases and intelligence producers. This collected data is shared across a Joint enterprise using the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) and in time the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) to enhance access and sharing of ISR information across Joint forces through the use of common enterprise standards and services. DCGS FoS supports Joint Task Force (JTF)-level and below combat operations with critical intelligence for battle management and information dominance across the full spectrum of operations including peace conflict war and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). DCGS is a cooperative effort between the services agencies and DoD to provide systems capable of receiving processing exploiting and disseminating data from airborne and national reconnaissance platforms. DCGS-N core components include the Analyst Work Station from the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) - Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (I3) Generic Area Limitation Environment (GALE) Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Common Geo-positioning Services (CGS) Image Product Library (IPL) Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB) Joint Concentrator Architecture (JCA) and Track Management Services. The DCGS-N system represents the integration of 1) The processing and exploitation of tactical and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) and Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); 2) Precision target geopositioning mensuration and imagery dissemination capabilities; 3) Selected national IMINT requirements and processing capabilities from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA); and 4) Sharing of Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance and Targeting and Command and Control information via DIB DI2E and Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) standards with a wide range of customers (e.g. Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M)) Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) and many others. The DCGS-N Enterprise Node (DEN) which incorporates current DIB standards and DI2E policy facilitates interoperability and data sharing among the DCGS FoS. DCGS-N ensures compliance with the DoD DCGS network architecture.  The Navy is establishing an ISR Enterprise way ahead that will emphasize a reach back strategy to provide intelligence products to support deployed ship and shore operations. The Navy will also migrate to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that requires the development integration and testing of a Maritime ISR Enterprise capability development and migration of ISR SOA applications and development and integration to leverage a Common Computing Environment (CCE). Additionally DCGS-N will become the focal point for migration of Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) fusion and analysis (MFAS) tool applications for the Navy. DCGS-N Increment 2 addresses a critical shortfall in Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) capability and capacity to support operational tactical planning and execution across the full range of joint military operations. Existing TCPED shortfalls will be exacerbated by planned Navy Joint and Allied fielding of new Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms. Currently fielded systems provide localized processing capabilities that will be overwhelmed in future years without a significant change in the way the Navy processes exploits and disseminates intelligence data. DCGS-N Increment 2 will deliver all source fusion and analytical capabilities; provide Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) capabilities and integrate Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) capabilities to improve the use and analysis of sensor and platform data. Distributed Common Ground System- Navy (DCGS-N) Increment 2 will be based on an enterprise solution to share this information across commands services and agencies to promote shared situational awareness. DCGS-N Increment 2 consists of multiple releases. The first release provides an enhanced Navy Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) enterprise that converges and builds on the DCGS-N Increment 1 and Maritime Domain Awareness Enterprise Nodes; leverages the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E); is compliant with the Common Computing Environment (CCE); federates ISR and TCPED workflow and production improving throughput through automation; exploits new and evolving unmanned systems sensor data; provides Multi-Intelligence (Multi-INT) cross-queuing and modular tools. The second release enhances afloat ISR capabilities by providing a set of software centric tools providing Multi-INT fusion and analysis behavior prediction and intelligent knowledge management designed to operate in disconnected or denied communications environment. Follow-on releases will be developed based on Fleet requirements.Intelligence Carry-On Program (ICOP) is a suite of multi-source intelligence and analytical capabilities which includes an integrated Three-Dimensional (3-D) operational picture displaying intelligence and other data sources to provide a richer and more complete picture of the battle space on Unit Level platforms. The system supports a full motion video capability that receives processes exploits and disseminates organic and non-organic data as well as the ability to process and correlate Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) and external Communications Intelligence (COMINT Externals). It integrates mature Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) applications with shared storage and communication paths to reach back to the DCGS-N Enterprise Node (DEN) and it provides data sharing to the Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) and national ISR systems making tactical users a part of the larger ISR enterprise.  In FY16 DCGS-N Increment 1 will support development integration and regression testing required to align with emerging national imagery standards.    In FY16  DCGS-N Increment 2 will deliver Fleet Capability Release-0 (FCR-0) in support of the Program Executive Officer Command Control Communications Computers and Intelligence (PEO C4I) prototype effort. Increment 2 will begin development of Fleet Capability Release (FCR) 1.","","","","","",

Operational uses of core technologies can include but are not limited to Signals Intelligence to Signals Intelligence (SIGINT-SIGINT) correlation and Ground Moving Target Indicator to Signals Intelligence (GMTI-SIGINT) correlation.  Operational uses of sub-nodal analysis tools can include but are not limited to determining which nodes of the adversary's Command Control Communications Computers Intelligence (C4I) network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects and modeling execution plans to determine the need to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points in order to redirect activities based on changing battlefield conditions.  NCCT software applications employ Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate sensor cross-cues and collection activities.  NCCT correlation and fusion services ingest collection data to produce a single composite track (geo-location and identification) for high-value targets.  NCCT research and development funding supports evolutionary development of the NCCT message set and network management systems for example Operations Interfaces Network Controllers Fusion Engines Data Guards Interface to Command & Control and Interface to Overhead Intelligence Operations (OIO) the migration of the NCCT technologies to emerging network centric technologies such as Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) global web-enabled services and satisfying DoD standards and Information Assurance requirements.   NCCT Core Technology develops the hardware and software to horizontally integrate dissimilar Joint and Coalition Battle Management Command & Control (BMC2) and ISR assets and systems into integrated target tracks shared across networked platforms.  NCCT Core Technology includes but is not limited to network management software operator interfaces standard network messages and formats correlation software and data rules of interaction NCCT multi-level security hardware and software items and platform specific Platform Interface Modules (PIMs).  Current NCCT-enabled systems include but are not limited to the RC-135V/W/S/U RIVET JOINT COBRA BALL COMBAT SENT  EC-130H COMPASS CALL Distributive Common Ground System (DCGS) SIGINT components Falconer Aerospace Operations Centers (AOC) Forward Processing/Exploitation/Dissemination (FPED) Gorgon Stare (GS) OIO and multiple airborne coalition partner platforms.  Prospective Coalition Joint or Service systems are required to fund their respective integration unique core technology improvements/upgrades to support system integration.  The SUTER Program System (SPS) develops concepts Tactics/Techniques/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network.  SPS's planning execution and assessment capability is implemented in a virtual architecture available to all AOCs taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR non-kinetic and/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets.  This virtualized Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) utilizes software applications which employ machine-to-machine interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) communications to impact these target sets by "attacking" or influencing/shaping links nodes or end points in the network to include: RF and terrestrial links switches routers hubs servers IP addresses cell phones antennas radars microwave relays SATCOM receivers transceivers etc. The three main pieces of the SPS CONOPS include: first the use of SPS's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second the SPS's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs JIOWC etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third via SPS's combined network Graphical User Interface (GUI) all involved "players" monitor the plan's execution provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities provide continuous assessment/updates of the execution of the plan and within authorities (Rules of Engagement/ROEs) re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions.  SPS is the technology that assists COCOMs and Components to exercise synchronized dynamic Command and Control (C2) of ISR kinetic and non-kinetic Joint operations against conventional and terrorist threat networks. SPS provides decision makers and operators supporting airborne ship-borne cyber and land-based C2ISR platforms and at supporting locations continuous Predictive Battle-space Awareness (PBA) of the information superiority fight.

The FAAD C2 system provides alerting data to air defense gunners airspace battle management and up-linking of mission operations thereby enhancing force protection against air and missile attack.  Situational awareness and targeting data is provided on threat aircraft cruise missiles and unmanned aerial systems (UAS).  FAAD C2 software is a key component of the Air Defense and Airspace Management (ADAM) Cell that is being fielded to Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) Multi-Functional Support Brigades and Division Headquarters as part of the Army's modularity concept.  FAAD C2 is also a principal air defense system within the Homeland Defense Program. Soldiers from activated Army National Guard AMD battalions operate the FAAD C2 systems in the National Capital Region and other locations.The Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control System (AMDPCS) is an Army Objective Force System that provides integration of AMD operations at all echelons. AMDPCS systems are deployed with Air Defense Artillery (ADA) brigades Army Air and Missile Defense Commands (AAMDCs) and ADAM Cells at the Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) Multi Functional Support Brigades and Divisions/Corps. AMDPCS systems also provide air defense capabilities to Homeland Defense systems.  ADAM Cells provide the Commander at BCTs Brigades and Divisions with air defense situational awareness and airspace management capabilities. They also provide the interoperability link with Joint multinational and coalition forces.  AMDPCS components are vital in the transformation of ADA units and the activation of the AMD Battalions. AMDPCS has three major components: (1) the Air and Missile Defense Workstation (AMDWS) is an automated defense and staff planning tool that displays the common tactical and operational 3-dimentional air picture; (2) the Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI) is a communications data link processor and display system that provides near-real time 3-dimensional joint airspace situational awareness and fire direction command and control for AMD forces; (3) the Army Air Defense shelter configurations use automated data processing equipment tactical communications Common Hardware Systems standard vehicles and tactical power to provide AMD unit commanders and staffs with the capabilities to plan missions direct forces and control the airspace. Counter-Rocket Artillery Mortar (C-RAM) is an evolutionary non-developmental program initiated by the Army Chief of Staff in response to the indirect fire (IDF) threat and a validated Operational Needs Statement (ONS).  The primary mission of the C-RAM program is to develop procure field and maintain a system-of-systems (SoS) that can detect RAM launches; provide localized warning to the defended area with sufficient time for personnel to take appropriate action; intercept rounds in flight thus preventing damage to ground forces or facilities; and enhance response to and defeat of enemy forces.  The C-RAM capability is comprised of a combination of multi-service fielded and non-developmental item (NDI) sensors command and control (C2) systems warning systems and a modified U.S. Navy intercept system (Land-based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS)) with a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) wireless local area network.  The C-RAM SoS capability is currently deployed at multiple sites in Afghanistan providing correlated air and ground pictures linking units to the Army Mission Command and the Joint Defense Network and using various forms of communications to provide situational awareness and exchange of timely and accurate information in order to synchronize and optimize automated Shape Sense Warn Intercept Respond and Protect decisions.Multiple acquisition efforts are associated with the C-RAM program including C-RAM Intercept which fields existing LPWS guns to two Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC)/Avenger composite Battalions and RAM Warn a horizontal technology insertion using current C-RAM warning capability to provide early localized warning to all Maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCT).","","FY14 RDTE reflects an adjustment in the amount of $20.683 million for C-RAM software improvements to enhance intercept capabilities.

CATT enables units from crew to the battalion task force level to conduct a wide variety of combat tasks on a realistic interactive synthetic battlefield.  CATT's combination of manned simulators and staff officer workstations enables units to train as a combined arms team in a cost effective manner.  The primary CATT system is the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) which provides the underlying baseline architecture and After Action Review (AAR) for CATT expansions Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and system enhancements.  The Reconfigurable Vehicle Simulator (RVS) and the Dismounted Soldier Training System (DSTS) variants support combat convoy operations and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) tasks.  Synthetic Environment (SE) Core provides for the expansion of the synthetic environment baseline to include enhanced interoperability and the products and infrastructure to support current and future combat operations and mission rehearsal required for Unified Land Operations.  The first synthetic environments expanded were in the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and the CCTT for both the Active and Reserve components.  Gaming Technology provides an application to train and rehearse convoy-operations platoon level mounted infantry tactics dismounted operations rules-of-engagement training cross-cultural communications training IED defeat training route clearance ground-air coordination Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) integration and other small unit and individual training and mission rehearsal requirements.  Soldiers can train in a common environment on geotypical or geospecific virtual terrain.  It is also possible to link Gaming technology to actual communication command control computer and intelligence (C4I) systems and other CATT simulation systems to increase the utility and realism of the training.  By practicing skills in CATT units are able to effectively prepare for costly live fire and maneuver exercises as well as training tasks deemed too hazardous to conduct in a live training environment.  Fielded in both fixed site and mobile versions CATT enables both Active and Reserve component units to prepare for real world contingency missions.  By being able to use a wide array of training terrain databases and modify the behavior of the computer generated opposing forces CATT offers an unlimited array of training options to support the Army's many regional combat missions.  The combination of tough field and live fire training and realistic simulation training in CATT is the formula to prepare Soldiers and their Leaders for the uncertainties they face in combat operations.FY 2016 core funding of $.749 million for CCTT enables gaming technology and visualization for maneuver training and the P3I for the CCTT to include virtualization and other Better Buying Power in order to reduce life cycle costs.FY 2016 base funding of $2.999 million for Games for Training will provide for modifications to the Games for Training (GFT) system to ensure compliance with the Live Virtual Constructive/Integrated Training Environment (LVC-ITE) in support of Unified Land Operations.  It will also integrate new commercial and Government technology products into the current gaming system. FY 2016 base funding of $16.658 million will continue the efforts of providing expanded development of the capability to produce common terrain databases.  FY 2016 funds will modify the Terrain Development process to include constructive terrain databases continue to enhance OneSAF in the SE Core Architecture and generate databases for constructive simulation and gaming.  Maintaining OneSAF for virtual simulations enables interoperability with the Live Virtual Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC ITE) and is a cost avoidance for individual virtual simulators in that they that do not develop and maintain separate Semi-Automated Forces (SAFs). SE Core will continue to upgrade integrate and refine the Common Virtual Components and continue to develop common visual models and transportation networks.  FY 2016 base funding of $1.216 million will complete the development and testing the Voice Communication System capability. The required software will allow Army Aviators to properly communicate to internal and external entities in support of Aviation Collective Training Tasks.","","Change Summary Explanation: Synthetic Environment (SE) Core is required to generate Terrain Databases for constructive simulation and gaming requirements in support of Army training.

Efforts funded include the Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS) Web Based Architecture and Airspace Improvements Initiative Air Traffic Navigation Integration and Coordination System (ATNAVICS) Modernization Advanced Surveillance the development of an ATC Tactical Network the Mobile Tower System (MOTS) Airfield Lighting System (ALS) and Tactical Terminal Control System (TTCS) modernization. TAIS the Airspace Management System of the Army Mission Command System requires the development and testing of web-based services for Airspace Control and integration of these new web-based services into the TAIS common Army Mission Command hardware Air Traffic Services (ATS) and Airspace Integration Improvement Initiatives.  Additional capabilities will be provided through advanced surveillance interfaces mission planning interfaces and TAIS dynamic airspace updates to the cockpit.  TAIS efforts also include developing and testing improvements to the air picture including the addition of Blue Force Tracker correlation and radar fusion capability.  TAIS develops software and required hardware for airspace management web services to operate effectively in a dynamic net-centric interconnected environment.  TAIS also integrates advanced surveillance capabilities to further enhance airspace integration and dynamic management capabilities.  ATNAVICS provides all weather instrument flight capabilities to include terminal radar precision approach and landing services to all Army Joint and Allied aircraft.  ATNAVICS will integrate Mode S capabilities required to control aircraft both OCONUS and CONUS.  ATNAVICS will network its radar picture and interogator data (Mode S) to aviation and joint network nodes through TAIS. ATNAVICS will undergo an effort to increase the range of the primary radar to 60 nautical miles. As the Department of Defense transitions military aircraft to positional self-reporting technologies these various technologies will be incorporated in the Advanced Surveillance program.  Advanced Surveillance allows ATC reception of aircraft self-reporting data which includes the Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B).  Advanced Surveillance integrates local radar feeds and self-reporting aircraft positional data into a correlated air situational awareness picture.  ATC Tactical Networking supports the non recurring engineering test and evaluation tasks necessary for the integration of the radios control stations and transmitter/receivers and software that will provide all ATC tactical systems an airfield network node capability.  This will enable each ATC system to send voice and data between ATC platforms including connectivity to an external network for long range flight-following and data exchange.  ATC Networking is required to meet the Net Ready Key Performance Parameter for ATC tactical systems.  MOTS provides the Joint Force Commander or Combatant Commander a highly mobile self-contained integrated and reliable information system platform for visual and procedural aircraft deconfliction and aircrew force protection in unified action terminal airspace environments.  The Airfield Lighting System (ALS) is a component of the MOTS and can operate solar powered or by generator power.  The ALS improvements include a Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) and an ALS trailer charging system.  The TTCS provides initial Air Traffic Services at remote landing sites and drop zones.  TTCS includes secure communications equipment for aircraft separation and ground control meteorological measuring system for basic weather information and precision location capability.","","FY 2016:  POMBES16-20 increased the FY 2016 by $4108K to fund the Mobile Tower System (MOTS) Airfield Lighting System (ALS) and the ATC Tactical Network nonrecurring engineering test and evaluation.","","","",

The objective of the Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Development project is to improve Radio Frequency (RF) ASE for Army aviation. The APR-39 Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) detects categorizes and prioritizes Radio Frequency (RF) emitters and provides a visual / aural alert to aircrew members warning them of targeting by RF-guided weapons. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved Phases 1 and 2 of a 3-phased path forward. Phase 1 serves as an obsolescence / sustainment upgrade to the Processor Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) of the AN/APR-39A(V) Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) implemented to ensure that the currently fielded system remains viable until affordable improved RF ASE capability can be pursued in Phases 2 and 3. Phase 2 RWR Modernization adopts the ongoing United States Navy Class I RWR Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) commonly referred to as the APR-39D(V)2 system. APR-39D(V)2 will significantly improve the near-spherical RF threat coverage automatic detection and identification of threat types bearing and lethality. Under Phase 2 the Army will develop enhancements to the APR-39D(V)2 including integrated suite control functionality threat correlation and off-boarding capability and hardware upgrades needed to keep the APR-39D(V)2 technically relevant and address emerging Low Probability Intercept (LPI) and frequency agile threats. Phase 3 adds active Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) jamming capability for selected aircraft; Materiel Development Decision (MDD) for this ECM jamming capability phase is not expected until later in the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).EE4: FY16 funds have moved to ER8 PE 0605051A (Aircraft Survivability Development). The US Army operational requirements concept for Aviation Infrared (IR) countermeasure systems is known as the Suite of Integrated Infrared Countermeasures (SIIRCM). SIIRCM is an integrated warning and countermeasure system to enhance aircraft survivability against IR-guided threat missile systems. The Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) is a core element of the SIIRCM concept. CMWS is an integrated ultraviolet (UV) missile warning system with an Improved Countermeasure Dispenser (ICMD) serving as a subsystem to a host aircraft. The CMWS program is a UV missile warning system that cues both flare and laser-based countermeasures to defeat incoming IR-seeking missiles and will alert aircrews to the presence of certain incoming unguided munitions. The B-Kit consists of the components which perform the missile detection and aircrew notification unguided munitions detection and aircrew notification false alarm rejection and countermeasure employment/cueing functions of the system. The CMWS Electronic Control Unit (ECU) receives UV missile detection data from Electro-Optic Missile Sensors (EOMS) and sends a missile alert signal to warn aircrews via on-board avionics. Tier 1 threat missiles detected and tracked by the CMWS are subsequently defeated by a combination of missile seeker countermeasures including decoy flares and IR Laser Jamming (currently ATIRCM-equipped CH-47 platform only). In addition the CMWS ECU receives from the EOMS unguided munitions detection data which it also passes to the aircrew through aural and visual alerts. The aircrew then applies the appropriate Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to break contact or engage the enemy with own-ship ordnance. The CMWS Generation 3 (Gen 3) ECU in conjunction with ongoing software development efforts will address outstanding material release conditions to achieve a Full Material Release (FMR) for CMWS and ensure protection against emerging IR-guided missile threats. The A-Kit for CMWS includes mounting hardware wiring harnesses cables and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft. The A-Kit ensures the mission kit is functionally and physically operational with a specific host aircraft type.EB4:The Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) is an infrared (IR) countermeasure system that interfaces with a Missile Warning System (MWS) to provide near spherical protection of the host platform in order to defeat IR threat missiles.  The CIRCM will provide the sole acquisition of future laser-based IR countermeasure systems for all rotary-wing tilt-rotor and small fixed-wing aircraft across the Department of Defense.  The US Army's concept of CIRCM is part of the Suite of Integrated Infrared Countermeasures (SIIRCM).  The core components of the SIIRCM concept are: a Missile Warning System (MWS) IR expendables countermeasures (flares) and a laser-based IRCM.  The SIIRCM detects declares and initiates IRCM against IR-guided Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM) or Air-to-Air Missiles (AAM).  The CIRCM is the next generation of the laser-based IRCM component and will interface with both the Army's Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) and the Navy's future missile warning system.  CIRCM was approved to be funded to the Director Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation Independent Cost Estimate (CAPE ICE) through Milestone B (MS B) per Defense Acquisition Executive Acquisition Decision Memorandum (DAE) (ADM) December 28 2011.The A-Kit for CIRCM includes mounting hardware wiring harnesses cables and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft.  The A-Kit ensures the mission kit is functionally and physically operational with a specific host aircraft type.  The CIRCM B-Kit is the mission kit (laser pointer tracker and controller) required to achieve near spherical coverage for an aircraft.EB4 justification:Fiscal Year 2016 Base RDT&E in the amount of $77.570 million supports the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase to include twelve A-Kit prototypes platform integration and integration with other Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) systems.","","","","","",

Lessons learned from the two STSS satellites are guiding decisions on the development of a fiscally sustainable continuously available future operational constellation and ground communications/processing system. STSS is providing risk reduction for future MDA space-layer options models algorithms sensors and spacecraft development by providing complex target signatures interface definition communications architectures and performance across threat object acquisition tracking and discrimination. STSS also informs the BMDS Concept of Operations timelines and performance requirements for remote space sensor cuing for ballistic missile engagements expanding battle space for weapon systems such as Aegis BMD. The goal for STSS satellites is to demonstrate spacebased capabilities including persistent tracking and integrated BMDS discrimination improvements for Homeland Defense.Early missile tracking capability from space provides a cost effective and operationally suitable means of providing global persistent surveillance and engagement directly addressing the number one missile defense priority need for Combatant Commanders. STSS will emphasize continued research and development to address the more sophisticated threats the Agency expects in the far term by demonstrating technologies that support development and capability delivery of future MDA space-layer options.  The STSS satellites demonstrate the ability of a space sensor to provide high precision real time tracking of missiles and midcourse objects thus enabling simultaneous regional theater and strategic missile defense systems to be cued to track well beyond their organic detection capability. Data from on-going STSS testing has validated the ability to track cold midcourse objects from space and close the fire control loop with BMDS interceptors. During several MDA flight tests STSS has provided data in real-time that met the Aegis Missile Defense Systems' Quality of Service data requirements for Remote Engagement Authorized. Finally STSS provides the means to demonstrate the benefit of future MDA space-layer capabilities which when combined with radars will provide robustness against current and advanced countermeasures. The Missile Defense Agency developed and is using two STSS satellites to demonstrate key functions of space sensors to reduce risk for future MDA space-layer options. STSS testing is funded as part of a capabilities development program and reflected in the Program Element submission. The wealth of data and lessons learned from the STSS satellites efforts continue to provide insights as MDA pursues longer term space sensor needs. Near Field Infrared Experiment (NFIRE) The NFIRE technology project was designed to collect near field phenomenology data for use in developing plume to hard body handover algorithms for boost phase interceptor programs. The NFIRE satellite carries a Laser Communication Terminal which has been and continues to be used to conduct communication experiments with the German Terra SAR-X satellite. These experiments test low earth orbit satellite-to-ground and satellite-to-satellite capabilities of the terminal for potential incorporation into the Ballistic Missile Defense System. Data products are utilized by multiple programs to improve missile engagement performance. The NFIRE program has an option to execute satellite End-of-Life plans by the end of FY 2015 and initiate safe satellite de-orbit.MD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).","","N/A","362","","",

The WIN-T Inc 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Inc 1 and by leveraging proven government and commercial technologies adds greater network throughput and automated  Network Management to optimize planning (to include spectrum use) initialization monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Inc 2 employs Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) OTM to extend the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) to Company level for the first time.  Using equipment mounted on combat platforms WIN-T Increment 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows key leaders to move on the battlefield while retaining Situational Awareness and Mission Command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio (HNR) with the Highband Networking Waveform (HNW) and high performance antennas the WIN-T Inc 2 Line-of-Sight (LoS) network offers an adaptive 30 Megabit per second (Mbps) aggregate throughput to key leaders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Inc 2 network is self-forming which means that it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing meaning that the paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or loses connectivity.  This offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks.   WIN-T Inc 2 introduces the network management capability needed to keep the mobile and dispersed forces networked together through automated planning initialization monitoring and troubleshooting.  Finally WIN-T adopts "Colorless Core" technology that encrypts both classified and unclassified user information in the network and minimizes the number of users on the "core" of the network.  The Colorless Core allows commanders to utilize the tactical network without fear of the enemy intercepting information. Colorless Core is a technical insertion in the WIN-T Inc 1b network which enables efficient information sharing between Inc 1b and Inc 2. WIN-T Inc 3 mature Network Operations (NetOps) technologies will be inserted into WIN-T Increment 2 units.FY16 funds support Operational Testing (NIE 16.2) and tech insertion of NetOps Build 5 and upgrade to NetCentric Waveform (NCW) 10.x.","","","","","",

With cross-domain challenges in areas such as cyber electronic warfare space and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) outlined in Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for the 21st Century Defense.  The S&T analytic assessments performed under this budget item will include the following activities:-  Threat envelope assessments beyond intelligence community products for identifying gaps in U.S. capability for critical threats (Red teaming).-  Independent assessment of critical capability and technology development (Red teaming).-  Architecture development and evaluation to develop new U.S. capability (Blue teaming).-  Experimentation campaigns to demonstrate relevant technologies in preparation for rapidly transitioning the capability either directly to warfighters or to acquisition programs (Blue teaming).Due to the complexity of these capability gaps the process for developing and executing these analytic assessments will span fiscal years and may have multiple phases.  The emerging nature of the problem sets makes identification of studies beyond the budget year unlikely.  Typically the distribution of effort for studies experiments and prototypes and testing and integration will be roughly 30/40/30 percent.  The first step in the process is to study problems or gaps identified by threat assessments and develop possible solutions; the second step develops those possible solutions into plans for experiments and prototypes; and finally selected experiments or prototypes may be pursued to more fully develop the solution(s) for operational testing and integration.

This program element supports the Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) of medical and non-medical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) medical and non-medical CB Defense initiatives.  DoD missions for civil support operations have recently expanded and have resulted in providing focus to develop technologies to support CB counterterrorism initiatives.  ADC&P is conducted for an array of chemical biological and toxin detection and warning systems providing early warning collector concentrators generic detection improved reagents and decontamination systems using solutions that will remove and/or detoxify contaminated materiel without damaging combat equipment personnel or the environment.  CB sensors and diagnostics enhance the Departments environmental and medical surveillance efforts by improving the monitoring and surveillance of threats and forces preparing for and engaged in military operations.  These efforts are required to enable military commanders and the Military Health System to prevent treat and mitigate threats to individual Service Members and military units.  Integration of CB sensor and diagnostic data from the programs in this ACD&P will also be usable within the homeland security and Federal public health common operating pictures.  The Department of Defense is responsible for research development acquisition and deployment of medical countermeasures to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD unlike those developed to support U.S. population must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasizes prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this ACD&P such as vaccines against the most likely biological threat agents and traditional / non-traditional chemical agent prophylaxis conserves fighting strength decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation and satisfies the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available efforts on this ACD&P support pre-hospitalization treatment en-route care hospital care and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include improvements to CB diagnostics and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic agents and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  DoD is the only Federal activity conducting ACD&P on these prophylactic diagnostic and therapeutic CB medical countermeasures.  The Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  The Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process ("One Portfolio").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research development acquisition and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research development and acquisition because of its unique facilities testing capabilities and trained and experienced personnel.  ACD&P also supports the development of updated test capabilities to evaluate Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Defense systems.  Also included is the Techbase Technology Transition effort which validates high-risk/high-payoff technologies that could significantly improve Warfighter capabilities.  The projects in this program element support efforts in the technology development phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 4.FY 2015 funding includes $163.2 million of base funding and $17.3 million of Ebola emergency funding.","","","","","",

QRSP efforts support the Department’s goal to provide a hedge against technical uncertainty by supporting the development of potentially game-changing capabilities and by fostering collaboration among other government agencies DoD laboratories academia and the commercial sector.  QRSP enables the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&L)) to respond to emergent DoD issues and time-sensitive threats by selecting projects within the year of execution.  These efforts field new capabilities at low cost in short time-frames inform the requirements process and inject innovative technologies into programs of record.  The QRSP Program supports four major project codes that expedite development and transition of new capabilities to the warfighter.  These projects are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF); 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF); 3) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support; and 4) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) support.  Focus areas align to DoD science and technology priorities including counter anti-access/area denial; counter weapons of mass destruction; low-cost precision engagement; counter-electronic warfare; and autonomous systems.The QRF Program objectives are to develop prototypes in response to emergent conventional warfare needs that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies.  The QRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  Examples of the types of projects that are envisioned include:  force protection projects to enhance anti-access and area denial capabilities undersea offensive capabilities and broad electronic warfare capabilities.  The QRF initiates projects during the execution year and focuses on maturing technologies critically needed for the COCOMs.  QRF projects are typically 12 months in duration and produce prototypes for demonstration and evaluation.  The QRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 40 percent for demonstration programs (DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D). The RRF program objectives executed by the RRTO are to develop prototypes to counter emerging irregular warfare threats anticipate adversaries’ exploitation of new technologies and accelerate the delivery of effective and affordable capabilities to the warfighter.  RRF initiatives support the DoD Research and Engineering Enterprise mission to develop demonstrate assess and rapidly field innovative concepts and technologies that supply critical capabilities to meet time-sensitive operational needs.  RRTO leverages technology developed outside of the DoD in the commercial sector academia international arenas as well as small businesses and non-traditional sources to address DoD needs as identified by COCOM Military Service organizations other Defense organizations and interagency partners.  Typical RRF programs are six to 18 months in duration and aim to mature a capability to demonstration.  The RRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 40 percent for demonstration programs (DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D).       The JRAC Program objectives focus on responding to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) and Joint Emerging Operational Needs (JEONS) that have been submitted by COCOMs and validated by the Joint Staff.  In addition the JRAC’s objectives are to manage the delivery of capabilities as requested by the COCOM in a time frame acceptable to the COCOM.  Efforts in most instances utilize contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.The SMA cell’s objective is to support all COCOMs Joint Force Commanders and other government agencies by assessing complex operational/technical challenges which require multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the United States Government academia and the private sector the SMA cell develops solution options to Joint Staff/COCOM-generated challenging problems and informs senior leadership.  Each assessment is initiated at the request of COCOM senior leadership.  Priorities for SMA Cell programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy for Operations.  Products are typically generated within six months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the Joint Staff/COCOM’s senior leadership.","","The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP) Program Element has been recast with a focus on producing risk-reducing prototypes designed to address priority Combatant Command (COCOM) threats.  QRSP efforts will support the Department’s goal to provide a hedge against technical uncertainty by leveraging insights gained through mission-focused efforts and by fostering collaboration among government laboratories academia and commercial research.  The QRSP portfolio will develop technology that anticipates adversaries’ capabilities through short-term innovative science and engineering initiatives.","","","",

DLA’s Research and Development (R&D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are available in order to accomplish the Agency’s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure using the best commercial and government sources and applying most effective business processes.  The Logistics R&D program develops and demonstrates high risk high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at lower costs than would be otherwise attainable.  The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits.  In December 2013 the DLA Director called for greater flexibility within the R&D program in support of the Agency’s efforts to achieve its’ mission.  As a result the R&D program is evolving from single supply chain efforts to   Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs) that will support DLA’s efforts to achieve the improvements needed to maintain mission readiness and continue fiscal stewardship while supporting the Department’s transition to peacetime operations.","","","","","",

The DoD Teleport program has fielded system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational approach with Generation 1 and 2 Full Deployment authorized by DoD Chief Information Officer on February 18 2011. DoD Teleport Generation 3 consists of three phases; Phases 1 and 2 are in Production and Deployment while Phase 3 is in Engineering and Manufacturing Development. Each DoD Teleport investment increases the warfighter’s ability to communicate with a world-wide net-centric set of information capabilities which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.Currently the Teleport system operates as an upgrade of satellite communication capabilities at selected DoD satellite communications gateways. This system provides deployed warfighters with seamless worldwide multi-band SATCOM connectivity to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Service Delivery Nodes and legacy tactical command control communications computers and intelligence systems. It also provides centralized integration capabilities contingency capacity and common interfaces to access the DISN.DoD Teleport's goal is to provide secure seamless interoperable and economical upgrades to DoD SATCOM Gateways and meet the growing throughput requirements of the deployed warfighter.The primary beneficiaries of the DoD Teleport investment are the DoD Combatant Commanders Military Departments Defense Agencies and the warfighter. DoD Teleport Generation 3 is designed to meet the growing demands of the warfighter through the execution of the following phases:Phase 1: Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency [Extended Data Rate] terminals provides tactical users with a 350% bandwidth increase in survivable antijam communications through all peacetime and combat operations by installing Navy Multiband Terminals (NMT) at select Teleport sites. In addition to enhanced throughput the NMT maintains compatibility with legacy waveforms and current tactical terminals.Phase 2: Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM X/Ka-band terminals provides enhanced Wideband Global System (WGS) X/Ka capability to warfighters worldwide by installing terminals from the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal (MET) program at DoD Teleport and other gateway sites. This gateway enhancement allows Teleport to replace end-of-life Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) terminals while remaining interoperable with tactical WGS X/Ka-band users. The MET enhancement provides a 300% Ka-band capacity increase and an 1100% X-band capacity increase to current enterprise terminal X/Ka capabilities. Additionally it enables the DoD Teleport system to maintain operational availability consistent with Generation 2 requirements and reduce the overall life-cycle cost of X/Ka capabilities across the DoD.Phase 3: Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy Ultra High Frequency (UHF) systems interoperability will provide interoperability between MUOS users and legacy UHF users by installing MUOS-to-Legacy UHF SATCOM Gateway Component (MLGC) suites of equipment at DoD Teleport sites. MUOS is the next generation DoD UHF SATCOM system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services utilizing the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band. MLGC suites will provide critical continuity and interoperability as DoD tactical satellite users transition from legacy waveforms and radios to the Joint Tactical Radio System.","","","","","",

This PE includes application of R&D to expedite prototype development and mission support efforts to sustain and/or modernize operations required for general RDT&E.Project 1:  DoD Enlistment Processing and Testing. The project administers testing programs which enable the Armed Services to select highly qualified military recruits. The DoD uses a single test the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) to determine eligibility of military applicants and to report recruit quality data to Congress. High quality recruits are obtained from administering the ASVAB annually to approximately 600000 applicants for Military Service as part of the DoD Enlistment Testing program and to 1 million students in the DoD Student Testing program. Each Service also uses ASVAB test forms developed in this program as part of their in-service testing programs. New ASVAB test forms and related support materials are implemented approximately every four years. This allows DoD to make measurement improvements as well as decrease the likelihood of test compromise. Ongoing RDT&E efforts include development and evaluation of procedures which (1) reduce or eliminate threats to the validity of the ASVAB test scores generated; (2) improve the efficiency of the test development calibration and validation process; and (3) improve selection and classification decisions made by each Service through more effective use of test score information. In addition periodic assessments are required to provide DoD manpower planners and Congress with information on aptitude trends in the population from which recruits are drawn.Project 2:  Human Resources Automation Enhancements.  DCPDS is the Department’s enterprise civilian human resources (HR) transactional system supporting 800000 employees representing approximately one-third of the federal government’s civilian work force. DCPDS has proven its business case avoiding costs for the Department of over $200M/year when compared to the multiple DoD Component operational costs prior to establishment of the enterprise system.  The consolidation of all instances of DCPDS at the DDC completed in 2014 has resulted in substantial component savings.  In FY 15/16 additional data center consolidation will include additional HRIT Enterprise systems moving to the DDC.Network and system operations span worldwide with 24/7 operations that support 19 Regional Service Centers and over 300 Customer Support Units. DCPDS completed its upgrade to the Hewlett Packard Blade architecture for all database servers in 2014. The current focus of DCPDS is the expansion of these efficiencies through the consolidation of DCPDS operations to a single data center where DCPDS enterprise operations and all DoD customer regional operations will be located at the Lockheed Martin Denver Data Center.. (Army and Air Force relocated in FY14 and focus has now turned to .) Other DCPAS programs supporting the civilian workforce include minimizing involuntary separations assisting laid-off workers maintaining workforce balance and reducing the costs of DoD's workers and unemployment compensation via the Defense Injury and Unemployment Compensation System (DIUCS). DHRA/DCPAS supports the development issuance and maintenance of uniform DoD-wide civilian personnel policy; provides program guidance and technical interpretation for both appropriated and non-appropriated funded civilian HR programs ; manages DoD's Civilian Assistance and Re-Employment (CARE) program including the Priority Placement Program (PPP); investigates and mediates discrimination complaints; conducts grievance investigations; and manages the operation of the enterprise civilian HR information system DCPDS. These programs are supported by an aggressive data automation program to include a communications capability computing equipment and an automation software link to standardize these divergent functions. These funds continue to support these processes.Project 3: NEO Tracking System.  The Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO)Tracking System (NTS) / Emergency Tracking Accountability System (ETAS) is a certified and accredited DoD automated system that accounts for and sustains visibility of noncombatant evacuees during a NEO under the authority of DODD 1000.25 DoD Personnel Identity Protection (PIP) Program. NTS is currently being used in the USAFRICOM USCENTCOM USEUCOM USSOUTHCOM and USPACOM Area of Responsibility. The ETAS component is the CONUS domestic version of NTS and is for use by USNORTHCOM during disasters in the CONUS whether natural accidental or acts of terrorism. The primary purpose of the NTS/ETAS is to provide individual accountability of the evacuee by creating and maintaining a database of evacuees assembled during an evacuation operation and subsequently tracking the evacuees' movement throughout the evacuation process.  Minor growth from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is attributed to research and development supporting the integration of the Enterprise Identity Attribute Service and the Organization Unique Identifiers in this family of systems that provides secure attribute based access control.Project 4:  Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker Enterprise Suite (SPOT-ES).  SPOT-ES is the Department of Defense (DoD) system of record for accountability and visibility of contracts and contractor personnel authorized to operate in a contingency operation.  SPOT-ES provides web based tracking and visibility into contract services personnel and equipment locations; provides a common operational picture for Combatant Commanders; enhances the analytical tools to accurately plan for the quantity of contracted support required for future contingency operations; and collects accurate data for the Office of Management and Budget-directed quarterly census of all contractors supporting contingency operations.  Minor growth from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is attributed to development and integration of more rugged and transportable Automatic Identification Technologies that facilitates person accountability and property tracking and accountability of the NTS.Project 5:  ESGR Awards & Activty Tracking (AATR) Tool.  Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) requires a comprehensive web-based application (Awards and Activity Tracking and Reporting) to track ESGR Activities to include briefings and recognition of civilian employers and briefings of National Guard and Reserve that will track against organizational goals vs. costs and the hours donated by Volunteers.  The application will replace several manual processes that use Microsoft Excel spreadsheets across 54 State Committees and through contractor support.  This will also place all critical data in a DoD Data Center.  Development of a web-based application would immensely improve data collection and analysis while allowing field staff and volunteers to better focus on operations and mission accomplishment.  The application would be an addition to ESGR’s current Portal that contains ESGR’s member management inquiry and case management and freedom award nomination systems.","","","","","",

The strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions DoD EOD S&T with Joint EOD missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.This PE primarily develops and demonstrates prototype Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Expeditionary Warfare and Joint EOD system components that support capabilities enabling Naval and Joint EOD Forces to influence operations ashore.  Adversarial nations have the capability to procure stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics throughout the littorals. They also have the capability to develop or modify explosive devices such as mines and unexploded ordnance to construct Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) for the purpose of targeting Joint Forces.  Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat.  Current operations have also demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the threat from explosive hazards and IEDs during DoD operations.  Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types from deep water to the inland objective.  Advanced technologies must enable Joint EOD forces to detect/locate gain access diagnose render safe neutralize recover exploit and dispose of a broad spectrum of explosive hazards including unexploded ordnance and IEDs.  This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors processing warheads and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities. It supports the advanced development and integration of sensors and tools for standoff capabilities such as detection and location of IEDs (particularly in dismounted operations) dismounted diagnosis of buried munitions and other explosive hazards precision render safe and neutralization of surface munitions and other explosive hazards and enhanced access to IEDs.  It supports the MCM-related FNC Enabling Capabilities (ECs).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap this investment will achieve one of three key transformational capabilities required by Sea Shield as well as technically enable the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within Sea Strike.Due to the number of efforts in this PE the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.","","","","","",

Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) acts as management lead for Joint System Command (SYSCOM) system certification policy and guidance and certifies platforms for interoperability within the platform and throughout the enterprise in accordance with Commander US Fleet Forces Command/Commander Pacific Fleet (COMUSFLTFORCOM/COMPACFLT) Inst. 4720.3B (OCT 2008) C5ISR Modernization Policy.  COMUSFLTFORCOM/COMPACFLT Inst. 4720.3B also requires that NAVSEA act as administrative agent for COMNAVNETWARCOM Command and Control Communications Computers and Combat Systems IntegrationModernization Process (C5IMP) and execution agent for Navy Command and Control Communications Computers and Combat Systems Integration (C5I) Modernization Conferences (NCMC).  This program conducts Interoperability Assessments that are required to certify Aircraft Carriers Amphibious Assault Ships and Surface Combatants in accordance with the Naval Warfare System Certification Policy (NWSCP) NAVSEAINST 9410.2A NAVAIR 5230.20 SPAWAR 5234.1.The SFI Program ensures overall strike force interoperability is characterized and assessed. NAVSEA is assigned central United States Navy (USN) responsibility for interoperability directing the development of policy and architecture for Strike Force warfare systems engineering and implementation of common warfare systems engineering processes. There are three priorities within the Strike Force Interoperability Program:  1) Support Fleet "as-is" state which includes Navigation System Certification (NAVCERT) Interoperability Capabilities & Limitations and Interoperability Tactical Information Coordinator Technical Aids (TIC TECHAIDs); 2) Ship's system modernization (non-HME) including warfighting capability & other C5I upgrades including C5IMP Baseline Management; and 3) Ship Warfare System Certification & Force Level Assessments. This includes Warfare Systems Certification Interoperability Certification Force Level Interoperability Analysis & Assessments Cybersecurity Assessments and recommendations for improvements to the program offices for implementation at the systems level.In addition to these core efforts this program also engages in efforts designed to ensure the U.S. Navy is interoperable with Joint and Coalition forces through the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) and other bilateral/multilateral maritime integrated air and missile defense related efforts.Project 0164 Combat System Integration:This project consists of five key pillars executed within the SFI program: 1) Command & Control Communications Computer Combat Systems and Intelligence Modernization Process (C5IMP) and Fleet Readiness. The C5IMP validates the introduction of new systems into the Fleet and ensures system maturity prior to installation thereby reducing risk and enhancing readiness and effectiveness of deploying ship and strike groups; 2) Warfare Systems Certification which is essential to validating the maturity and operational performance of warfare systems prior to fleet delivery and deployment; 3) Navigation Certification (NAVCERT) and Electronic Charting and Display System - Navy (ECDIS-N) certification which certifies ship electronic charting and certifies ship electronic charting capability and certifies the accurate transmission of navigation data to combat and weapons systems; and 4) Interoperability Certification and Assessment the independent assessment of Strike Group Warfare Systems operational performance. Interoperability Assessment examine force level engagement threads aircraft control air battle management and operational displays. Assessments of deploying ships in Strike Force configurations are accomplished through the utilization of the Navy's Distributed Integration & Interoperability Assessment Capability (DIIAC) Concept which will support the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (DASN) shift to the left policy by providing early interoperability testing in the acquisition lifecycle. It is a U.S. Fleet Forces Command and Commander in Chief U.S. Pacific Fleet (COMPACFLT) requirement that all Strike Forces undergo Interoperability Assessment testing in the DEP prior to deployment. Interoperability Certification results are used to develop fleet tactical tools (Capabilities & Limitations (C&L) and Tactical Information Coordinator Technical Aids (TIC TECHAIDs)) which ensure that operators understand the interoperability capabilities and limitations of their combat systems and have the watch station tools necessary for the performance of their tactical responsibilities; 5) Cybersecurity assessment the assessment of cybersecurity at the Warfare Systems System of Systems (SoS) level.Project 3312 Maritime Theater Missile Defense Forum (MTMD):This project funds participation in Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense projects with other nations.  Included is participation in the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended 2009).  Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) forum it promotes interoperability with the Navies of nine participating nations (Australia Canada France Germany Italy Netherlands Spain United Kingdom and the United States).  This project funds participation in several Project Arrangements and includes maritime contribution to the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European Pacific and Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations.  Specifically the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with "Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.The MTMD forum provides protection against the proliferation of short medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the creation of an interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations.  This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats.This project supports USN participation in several Maritime IAMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:(1)  Battle Management Command Control Communications Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to addresscoalition capability gaps.(2)  Modeling & Simulation (M&S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.(3)  Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.(4)  Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.(5)  Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.(6)  Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructssurrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.(7)  Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities agreements with other nations to support Maritime IAMD and MTMD related demonstrations.","","","","","",

OASuW will be a vital component of the Joint Force Anti-Surface Warfare capability and incorporate new and emergent technologies to support an increased offensive strike capability. Due to emerging threats the fleet issued an Urgent Operational Needs Statement (UONS) that identified a capability gap for a long-range anti-ship missile to be filled by 2018. Directly supporting this UONS and significantly reducing Joint Force warfighting risks the U.S. Navy initiated OASuW Increment 1 which leverages the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA)/Office of Naval Research Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) demonstration program to deliver an Early Operational Capability (EOC) in the required timeframe. LRASM fills the most urgent air-launched capability gap to compliment existing ASuW weapon systems and positions the Department of Defense to address evolving surface warfare threats. Longer term OASuW requirements will be addressed in the future by OASuW Increment II.Budget Item Justification: OASuW (Increment I)Funding supports the delivery of an EOC of OASuW Increment I's LRASM weapon system including the transition of the LRASM demonstration design into a fielded air-launched weapon system using an accelerated acquisition approach with streamlined governance. The program is leveraging DoDI 5000.02i Model 4 to structure the acquisition strategy which includes a highly integrated and concurrent transition design integration and developmental / operational test program to meet the EOC schedule required by the UONS. To manage the accelerated timeline and resulting concurrency the program uses a structured Knowledge Point review process that support decisions regarding significant program events such as transition from design to integration phase and contract awards. These reviews also provide senior DoD leadership the opportunity to provide focused support and active management of technical and acquisition risk and are chaired by the Service Acquisition Executive ASN(RDA) and the Deputy Director of DARPA. The knowledge points are similar to acquisition milestone reviews but occur more frequently and are tailored to program-specific milestone events. Of note the OASuW Increment I knowledge points are defined differently than GAO defines the same term and are tailored to program-specific milestone events. The program intends to meet the statutory requirements associated with Milestone B at Knowledge Point 3. In addition to the Knowledge Point reviews Executive Steering Board reviews chaired by the MDA are held at least monthly. Supporting these reviews the associated engineering approach is designed to mitigate resulting risk by implementing a rolling-wave engineering progression based on the NAVAIR Systems Engineering Technical Review (SETR) process to enable detailed planning and decisions as the system matures. This process includes capstone SETR events that are tailored reviews using standard design review criteria. SETR 2.0 in FY15 provided a Production Design Review level review of the system and supported the Knowledge Point 2 decision to continue toward the Integration and Test phase. The Technology Maturation effort in FY15 and FY16 culminates in a system Critical Design Review (CDR) level review at SETR 4.0. SETR 3.0 in late 2015 provides a CDR-level review and supports the Knowledge Point 3 decision to initiate the Integration and Test phase for the all-up-round components. In FY16 engineering design to transition the DARPA demonstration design to a weaponized configuration continues at an accelerated pace during the Technology Maturation phase and the Integration and Test phase will be initiated. The Technology Maturation phase will conduct two major design reviews in FY16 completing this phase and solidifying the design required for Integration and Test phase. As the Integration and Test phase begins test articles will be procured to support system integration ground test and flight test. This creates a compressed concurrent schedule in FY16 which is required to meet the fleet fielding requirement specified in the UONS that drives the need for increased funding levels in FY16.This program is funded under ADVANCED COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND PROTOTYPES because it includes all efforts necessary to evaluate integrated technologies representative models or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment","","","","","",

This multi-phase plan called Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) is intended to increase the air traffic capacity while at the same time improving safety and efficiency.  In part NextGen implements a capability called Performance Based Navigation (PBN) in which the aircraft's navigation performance capability will be a determining factor as to whether or not it can fly within specific airspace certain air traffic routes or instrument procedures.  Also NextGen transforms the NAS from a radar based system with aircraft interrogation to a satellite based system utilizing Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B Out) communication in order to transmit the aircraft's own position to the controllers and other ADS-B in capable aircraft.  PBN is an enabler for ADS-B functionality.On May 28th 2010 the FAA released DoT/FAA 14 CFR Part 91: Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out Performance Requirements To Support Air Traffic Control (ATC) Service Final Rule.  This mandate stipulated that all aircraft required to have unrestricted access to operate in Classes A B and C airspace certain Class E airspace and other specified airspace requiring ADS-B Out must be in compliance with this regulation by January 1 2020.","","","",

Within this vision Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) remains a Navy core competency in a dynamic and uncertain maritime environment.  U.S. adversaries continue to develop asymmetric capabilities and capacities to deter disrupt or delay the entry of U.S. and allied naval forces and pose a constant challenge as we implement the Maritime Strategy.  Evolving submarine technologies offer enhanced stealth speed endurance weapons and operational proficiency trends foretelling that the adversary submarine of the future will have a significantly larger sphere of influence while presenting less vulnerability to ASW forces.  The effective offensive engagement range of the adversary submarine of the future will continue to match or outrange individual U.S. and multinational platform sensors and weapons in many tactical environments.  Submarines are an increasing threat to all Naval and Allied ships particularly modern diesel subs and faster torpedoes.  Not only can the presence of potential hostile submarines delay naval combatant action until they are located and neutralized submarines can also disrupt all seaborne logistics supply for any ground campaign as well as maritime commerce.  ASW forces must be effective in all operating environments ranging from the deep open ocean to the littorals and are key to countering adversarial anti-access and area denial strategies.The objective of this Program Element (PE) is to significantly improve existing Surface Ship Undersea Warfare (USW) sonar system capabilities through quick and affordable development/integration of emergent transformational technologies in support of Littoral ASW Theater ASW Mine Reconnaissance and overall Sea Shield efforts required to pace the threat.  Detection and classification play uniquely vital roles in the success of any ASW campaign.  To be effective against increasingly stealthy threats in an often ambiguous undersea environment future sensors must be environmentally adaptive have very low false alarm rates and exploit the full range of current and future submarine detection vulnerabilities.Project 1916's primary mission is to improve AN/SQQ-89(V) Measures Of Performance (MOP) by enhancing passive and active detection tracking classification and localization and torpedo Detection Classification and Localization (DCL) sonobuoy data processing and display capabilities and increasing acoustic sensor frequency bandwidth (Operational Requirements Document #667-76-05 titled 'AN/SQQ-89 Improvement Program' Test and Evaluation Master Plan 802-2 (TEMP 802-2)). Improvements to system simulation stimulation Information Assurance (IA) software and network architectures and safety are included.  This project takes advantage of the AN/SQQ-89(V) Open System Architecture (OSA) and Acoustic Rapid Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Insertion (ARCI) initiatives to integrate a torpedo DCL and ASW sonar combat system capability improvements.  This COTS-based Surface Ship ASW combat system the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 is currently planned as a backfit program for both CG47 (select CG59-73 Baseline 3 and 4 ships) and DDG51 (All DDG and follow FLT I/II/IIA) class ships.  The Open Architecture (OA) (level 3 compliant) of the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 system drives the Advanced Capability Build (ACB) spiral development process and provides budget flexibility to make COTS/OA technology solutions and ARCI-type initiatives affordable.  This will be accomplished via the incorporation of select Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and emergent transformational ASW technologies delivered to the AN/SQQ-89(V) prime integrator every two years.  ASW technology implementation will take advantage of improvements developed under the submarine Advanced Processing Build (APB) and Advanced Surveillance Build (ASB) programs and will in turn share unique improvements developed under this program with the submarine and surveillance ASW communities.  This project will also contribute to the development of Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) ASW Mission Packages.Project 1916 also includes funding for the Surface Ship Engineering Measurement Program (SSEMP) which will measure the performance of existing and new Surface Ship ASW combat systems and enables data-based assessment of the capabilities and shortfalls in the performance of these systems in realistic scenarios.","","","","","",

The budget enables Acquisition Category (ACAT) III development to address Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) defined capability-based requirements and mission needs. This program is tied to development programs that leverage a joint United States/Australia Armaments Cooperative Project (ACP) to develop MK48 ADCAP CBASS; and Future Naval Capability (FNC) technologies developed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR).Countermeasure (CM) sophistication and availability on the open market directly affects ADCAP kill probability and its ability to counter rapidly evolving threats. The focus of the MK-48 ADCAP torpedo program from FY 2001 and out shifted from being primarily concentrated on software block upgrade efforts towards coordinated hardware upgrades rapid Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) insertion and APBs to rapidly upgrade the ADCAP to counter evolving threats and maintain robust performance. The CBASS program developed and fielded a broadband sonar capable of identifying CMs and discriminating them from the target. CBASS Phase I achieved IOC in FY 2006 and Phase II was achieved in 2013.  The Commonwealth of Australia Royal Navy (RAN) is jointly participating to develop CBASS APB5 to improve shallow water performance under a signed Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) extension November 2009.  The MOA extension expires Nov 2019.The MK48 ADCAP torpedo program focuses on two specific areas near term; torpedo APBs and hardware tech insertions. The CNO continues to stress shallow water (less than 600 feet) as a critical operating area to counter third world diesel electric submarines. Torpedo testing in shallow water has demonstrated that in-service ADCAP has less than full capability in this difficult environment. However this testing in conjunction with laboratory simulation efforts has shown that significant performance improvements can be made by implementing changes to weapon tactics and software algorithms. Development implementation and testing of these changes is being accomplished under the torpedo APB program. The APB program also leverages the RAN joint torpedo program and FNC technologies developed by the ONR in the areas of torpedo broadband signal processing tactics processing and alertment. The torpedo tech insertion program will leverage the MK54 Lightweight Torpedo (LWT) algorithms. Further hardware investment involves development of Guidance & Control (G&C) replacement required to support ordinance requirements and development of automated test equipment replacement to improve comprehensive system testing of full up CBASS torpedoes.The torpedo technology insertion program will provide for evolutionary torpedo improvements and upgrades (including the transition and testing of advanced technologies from the Science and Technology community).  This approach will incorporate developmental testing of the FNC transitioning technologies for ADCAP upgrades in the areas of torpedo sensors weapon/platform connectivity warhead lethality speed and endurance. These efforts will continue torpedo development investment at a lower cost and shorter term than traditional torpedo programs.APB5 software upgrades are currently in process for MK-48 ADCAP torpedoes.  Both FNC technologies and MK-54 LWT developments will be transitioned into ADCAP through APBs and technology insertion packages. Priorities for APBs and technology insertion are: (1) improved torpedo effectiveness through advanced processing algorithms (2) advanced counter-countermeasure capability and (3) a new array to improve torpedo effectiveness.","","","","","",

AEHF satellites will replenish the existing EHF system (Milstar) providing much higher capacity and data rate (5x increase over Milstar II) capabilities.  AEHF is a cooperative program that includes International Partners (Canada the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of the Netherlands).    Space Vehicle-1 (SV-1) launched on 14 August 2010.  SV-1 experienced a propulsion anomaly and was raised to its geostationary orbit using alternative orbit raising techniques.  SV-1 completed on-orbit test and transitioned to operations in March 2012.  SV-2 launched on 4 May 2012 successfully completed on-orbit testing in October 2012 and is under operational control as of 7 November 2012.    With SV-1 and SV-2 launched and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) expected in 2015 the AEHF program has nearly completed its development phase and is now addressing obsolescence production continuity supplier stability and industrial base issues.  AEHF SV 5-6 are being procured using the Department of Defense (DoD) Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) concept.  The ESP concept is a procurement approach which seeks stable production and efficient sub-contractor product management through the block buy of two space vehicles at one time (as described in Advanced EHF MILSATCOM P-40 Exhibit).  In addition the ESP concept includes use of RDT&E funding for a MILSATCOM Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) to fund engineering activities to reduce future production costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements improve capabilities through insertion of new technologies and replace obsolete parts crypto and materials.  The SV-6 crypto redesign funding is reported in the AEHF (SV 5-6 Subprogram) Acquisition Program Baseline; the remaining SMI efforts are not part of the AEHF Major Defense Acquisition Program.  The SMI efforts will provide opportunities for competition to develop potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for future satellites of the current or any follow-on system.

The three variants are the F-35A Conventional Takeoff and Landing (CTOL); F-35B Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (STOVL); and the F-35C Carrier Variant (CV). Maximum commonality among the variants consistent with National Disclosure Policy will minimize life cycle costs.F-35 Follow-on Development (FoD) provides continuing incremental upgrades of the three F-35 variants and associated ground equipment. The FoD acquisition strategy is based upon incremental block development of capabilities with each increment consisting of two development cycles. FoD will provide capability enhancements required systems upgrades and cost improvements through an incremental acquisition approach. FoD capability planning includes an efficient transition from F-35 System Development and Demonstration (SDD) to FoD. As SDD development activities ramp down the FoD program will assume responsibility for new development and the maintenance of associated developmental infrastructure.  FoD capability planning includes Block 4A and 4B Engineering and Manufacturing Development efforts from FY16 through FY20 followed by DT and OT testing in 2020/2021 with IOC of capabilities in 2022.Additionally the F-35 JSF ORD calls for the F-35A (CTOL) Variant Air Vehicle to have the capabilities and provisions for Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA) operations in the first post SDD block upgrade.  DCA refers to the capability to carry and deliver conventional and non-conventional weapons.  DCA operation for the F-35A is internal carriage of two B-61s.  Due to extensive certification requirements the DCA capability planning and design will begin in Block 4A and continue through testing and certification in Block 4B.The United Kingdom other International Partner nations and Foreign Military Sales customers are also participants in the JSF program. The program shown here reflects USN USMC USAF and International Partner funding.Funding at the accomplishment/planned program level is reported as the total of all services and partners as these activities support all aircraft variants.The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $1.65 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","","198","0.000","",

Tasks in this Program Element support research development and test efforts in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phases of these systems.The Airborne Maritime Fixed - Aviation (AMF-A) is the transformational system that provides Army Aviation interoperability capability for Future Force and Joint Force operations. The AMF-A integration effort provides for the non-recurring engineering required to integrate and qualify the AMF-A certified radios with Link 16 and/or other advanced networking waveforms into the AH-64E and Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). Funding in FY 2016 continues integration activities to install and qualify AMF-A certified networking radios on the AH-64E and Shadow UAS platforms and also supports continued development of common radio control software and qualified airborne AMF-A antennas for use on multiple platforms.  The Shadow UAS solution will be incorporated into the Shadow Communications Relay Payload mission equipment package.  The Doppler Global Positioning System Navigation System (DGNS) Upgrade program completes system engineering trade studies to reduce space weight and power with the introduction of new navigation support capabilities such as inertial sensor MIL-STD-1553 interface card and Instrument Flight Rules map display. It also prepares Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) to the existing DGNS ASN-128D Line Replaceable Units (LRU) as a result of those trade studies. The effort also derives DGNS compliance matrices for current and planned Global Air Traffic Management capabilities for the upcoming decade.  The DGNS upgrade continues with execution of Non-Recurring Engineering for Computer Display Unit and Signal Data Converter LRU ECP packages. The ASN-128D CDU Upgrade replaces the current CDU faceplate with a touch screen display provides a moving navigation map capability and optimized pilot interface to augment existing Instrument Flight Rules capability and promote safer flight operations.The Aviation Data Exploitation Capability (ADEC) is an Army aviation automated information system program providing specific capabilities needed at the aviation unit level to implement and support improvements within aviation operations safety and training to increase operational effectiveness and situational awareness at all command echelons.  ADEC provides a common and interoperable capability required to implement the DoD mandated Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance processes. ADEC will standardize flight scheduling/management risk management mission approval and flight data analysis and visualization. ADEC provides interfaces to Centralized Aviation Flight Records System and Aviation Logistics Enterprise- Platform to reduce data entry and the information technology footprint while enabling disconnected and split based operations. The Aircraft Notebook (ACN) is an Army aviation automated information system program required to streamline the completion of aviation maintenance activities and the documentation required to maintain airworthiness for all Army aircraft. ACN implements The Army Maintenance Management System - Aviation digital logbook functionality and integrates with CAFRS and ALE-P to reduce manual entries and increase data accuracy. ACN reduces the information technology footprint within an aviation unit by integrating multiple software applications such as platform software applications interactive electronic technical manuals and condition based maintenance plus tools onto one hardware platform.The Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) is required to reduce personnel and rotorcraft losses while conducting both tactical and training missions in environments that restrict or severely reduce the aircrew's visibility due to atmospheric obscurants. DVE will improve safety reduce risk and add flexibility to aviation units by enhancing situational awareness through real-time detection and warning of terrain obstacles and hazards.  DVE will consist of integrated rotorcraft pilotage augmentation systems sensor(s) software software related hardware and pilot to system interfaces and cueing devices.  DVE will fuse a synthetic vision avionics backbone with aircraft state data and obscurant penetrating sensor(s) to provide a single rotorcraft capability for ground taxi hover takeoff and landing modes of flight. The Aviation Logistics Enterprise Platform (ALE-P) is the single logistics information system for all of Army aviation and serves as an extension to Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army). ALE-P replaces the Unit Level Logistics System-Aviation (Enhanced) and the Unmanned Aviation Systems-Initiative systems. ALE-P provides necessary interfaces to GCSS-Army and other enterprise systems at Logistics Support Activity Aviation and Missile Command and Program Executive Office Aviation. ALE-P interfaces with the ACN and ADEC at the unit level to maintain continuous airworthiness and aircraft historical records and provides the maintenance/readiness posture to the commander.","","FY2014:  -$9659K Below Threshold Reprogramming ActionsFY2015:  +$4000K Multiple Congressional Marks. +$20000K Degraded Visual Environment UH-60L demonstration; -$15000K JTRS integration delays; -$1000K DGNS upgrade forward financing.FY2016:  +$9270K Aviation Logistics Enterprise-Platform; +$1811K Aircraft Notebook; -$12K miscellaneous budget reduction.","","","",

Products result from investigating analyzing assessing and reporting on the survivability of Soldiers and on the survivability lethality and vulnerability (SLV) of the highest priority Army systems whether those systems are employed during stability support defensive or offensive missions.  Developed through measurement experiment test support and modeling and simulation (M&S) the products funded by this project are used in many ways to make the Army force more survivable.  The project provides quantitative lethality and survivability analyses and data for fielded and developmental systems as the Army makes the required choices to decisively transform into a modular Brigade Combat Team (BCT) based organization.  Products concern Army fire support systems direct fire munitions; Army air defense and missile defense systems; Army aviation systems including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; network communications and other network enabled battle command and communication systems; and selected joint services systems particularly relevant to the Army's joint and expeditionary role.  Products also include analysis and data concerning individual Soldier items including protective equipment such as helmets and vests.  These survivability products are leveraged into rapid-equipping initiatives and other technical support for operational forces involved in the current fight.  Continued development of these products also guarantees preservation of the Army's vitally needed technical corporate memory for expert survivability advice.Survivability analyses funded by this project are conducted across the spectrum of battlefield threats to include guns missiles mines and other methods of inflicting physical damage; jammers countermeasures and other electronic warfare techniques; cybersecurity and computer network operations; and directed energy weapons.  This survivability information enables developers users and decision makers to perform credible survivability tradeoffs for both Soldiers and materiel.  These technical survivability details enable properly informed decisions concerning systems and tactics that maximize both the combat power and survivability of Army forces.  Survivability data and analysis results funded by this project are efficiently leveraged for many different Army uses reducing total cost to the Army by eliminating the need for duplicative capabilities funded by individual system developers.  Central funding of this mission assures the Army accurate and consistent treatment of survivability across all classes of systems across all formal system Evaluations and across the Army's AR 5-5 studies process.  Work program is prioritized principally by the ATEC/AEC and is used by them in the Army's formal Evaluation process in such a way that ATEC can comply with its legally mandated responsibility to assess system survivability along with effectiveness and suitability.  Program Managers (PM) and the Program Executive Officers (PEO) use the survivability analyses and data funded by this project to make design decisions that are optimized for survivability to direct specific weapon system development efforts that are needed for survivability enhancement and to structure product improvement programs. Soldier survivability data and analysis is leveraged to support the survivability portion of the HQDA G1 MANPRINT program.  TRADOC combat developers exploit the survivability products funded by this project to initiate and improve survivability/lethality requirements and to develop and refine doctrine and tactics.  Also the quantitative analytical results funded by the project are leveraged as core inputs to formal AR 5-5 studies and other studies as directed by Army leaders.  While the Army is at war analytical results funded by this project are also directly leveraged for survivability support to current operations.  Finally for particularly urgent or controversial survivability issues data and analysis funded by this project are used directly by senior Army decision makers to assure technically sound program/production decisions.    This project also supports cybersecurity survivability analysis of Army battle command/networked systems as well as Army network architectures and technology.  Supports ATEC and other electronic warfare vulnerability testers and evaluators by developing and providing highly technical specialized field countermeasure environments that threat forces may employ against Army communications networks air defense and other systems.  In conjunction with PMs and Army intelligence agencies analyzes technical vulnerabilities of foreign weapons network related systems and intelligence Electronic Warfare (EW) systems to U.S. Army EW systems.  Without the survivability products funded by this project ATEC would not have a technically credible account of survivability issues at milestone decision points and systems could be fielded with unknown vulnerabilities leading to unnecessary US casualties.  PMs would make design choices that failed to properly optimize survivability TRADOC would generate requirements that were not technically credible and the Army studies process would rest on an inaccurate and inconsistent basis.","","FY 2016 increase attributed to realignment of funding for higher priority programs.","","","",

Small Tactical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) Synthetic Aperture Radar/Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR/GMTI)is a lightweight high performance all weather multi-functional radar system for the Gray Eagle UAS. The STARLite system provides wide area near real time Reconnaissance Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capabilities. It operates throughout the UAS flight mission profile in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants. The SAR mode generates quality images for the battlefield commander for detection classification and location of stationary commercial wheeled vehicle-size targets. The GMTI mode detects moving ground targets to include man-sized detection and provides location information and performs cross-cue with the Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors.  STARLite is increasing its software capabilities based on Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) results which will increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) to align with the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirement to enable Sensor Processing and Exploitation (SPE).  The SPE software enhancements will improve performance reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness.

It is the EO/IR/LD sensor for Gray Eagle UAS which supports force applications battlespace awareness force protection and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area near real time RSTA capabilities.  Additional initiatives will continue to focus on the transition of technologies directly supporting emerging requirements and the Army's Current and Future Force.  CSP is being procured for the Gray Eagle UAS program and has potential application to other platforms.   Project 11B:   The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology and as the adversaries use of technology changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs).  The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals standard military signals and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection recognition identification direction finding and high confidence geo-location.

These threats range from improvised devices being employed by terrorists that are constructed from commercially available electronic and industrial components to dedicated military systems that could be used in ways that diminish our technological advantage in conflicts with nation-states.  The rate at which these threats are appearing is accelerating and new threats are appearing quicker than traditional Department of Defense (DoD) requirements and acquisition processes can respond. The use of asymmetric devices is well understood by both nation-states and terrorists.  Using man portable air defense systems mortars and improvised explosive devices employing commercial electronic components terrorists have attacked both air and ground forces posing threats in any region due to their easy transportability.  Unmanned aircraft systems employing advanced commercial electronic components are proliferating and pose threats as both military capabilities and as potential weapons delivery mechanisms.  The extreme consequences of technological surprise and the accelerating rate of appearance of new threats highlight the need to rapidly develop and field innovative Electronic Warfare (EW) Information Operations and EW/Cyber Convergence capabilities that can neutralize threats in fiscally and temporally responsive ways.  We must concurrently develop innovative technologies and approaches that will give us asymmetric advantages over potential adversaries.  To proactively address the accelerating threat environment and restore the United States’ technological overmatch capabilities the Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) program’s overarching philosophy focuses on innovation to accelerate the pace of EW capabilities development.  This program element investigates means to rapidly mitigate new threats by integrating advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in innovative ways and rapidly demonstrate innovative technological capabilities that can be inserted into the Services’ Programs of Record with reduced risk.  JEAT efforts are based on three pillars: 1) Experimentation/Demonstration 2) Advanced Technology Development/Verification and 3) Innovative Technology Exploration.  In FY 2016 two efforts were added by the Department to accelerate the fielding of vitally needed EW warfighting capabilities:  the Advanced EW Technology Maturation Project and the EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation Project.The Advanced EW Technology Maturation Project is a one-year effort to demonstrate modular distributed configurable EW technologies and systems designs that address requirements identified by the United States Marine Corps (USMC) and U.S. Army.  Additionally technologies demonstrated in this effort will be transitioned to the USMC to enable an earlier transition of vital warfighting capabilities within the Intrepid Tiger II (IT2) FY 2017 Program of Record.  This effort will specifically mature counter-radar building blocks to provide new vitally-needed EW capabilities for U.S. Army and USMC air and ground assets while mitigating blue-on-blue and co-site interference impacts. The EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation Project is a four-year effort to (1) accelerate the development of innovative countermeasures to new classes of advanced threats that are being developed and fielded by potential adversaries and (2) provide innovative capabilities to counter anti-access/area denial threats posed by countries possessing modern advanced integrated air defense systems.  Work area in (1) will enable direct technology transitions to the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy in ongoing Programs of Record.  Research in area (2) will enable earlier fielding and will explore a variety of non-kinetic technologies tools and techniques to include converged EW/Cyber approaches and battle management optimization and visualization technologies.  Five work units are included in this project:  Advanced Airborne Countermeasures Development Advanced Defensive Countermeasures Development Non-Kinetic Battle Management and Visualization Technology Development Advanced EW and EW/Cyber Exploration and Development and Ultra Wideband Receiver Development.","","","","","",

Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01 promulgate capabilities-based requirements and acquisition processes. The JSAD program enables collaborative efforts to achieve these goals with a focus on Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs). These efforts include warfighting capability-based analyses; assessments of joint capability areas and joint integrating concepts; development of system-related data; integrated roadmaps to support acquisition investment decisions; and assessments of MDAPs in a capability area context.  Activities in the JSAD project are divided into three areas:  (1) capability-based analysis; (2) roadmaps; and (3) support tools and guidance. Capability-based analysis provides analysis of the different technology functionality and integration impacts of systems on warfighting capability.  Acquisition roadmaps guide systems development and associated investment plans.  JSAD support tools and guidance initiatives develop systems data and tools exploit modeling and simulation and architecture efforts to improve DoD’s overall assessment capability.  These efforts guide the development and improve the testing and fielding of integrated systems of systems in order to achieve Joint mission capabilities.  The Department has also undergone an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches. This means:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning programming budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance management and execution levels.  To accomplish this direction there needs to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from systems acquisition to capabilities-based portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above in order to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals.  The program is broken up into two focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives).","","The FY 2016 funding request was reduced by $0.600 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.","","","",

DTIC a DoD Field Activity is the DoD’s singular executive agent and designated source for DoD-funded scientific technical engineering and industry-related information.  Over the past several years DTIC has evolved to an information delivery house that through use of the internet can deliver technical information nearly instantaneously to all DoD users.  DTIC also operates DoD Information Analysis Centers (IACs) focused on Defense Systems Cyber Security and Information Systems and Homeland Defense and Security.  DTIC captures preserves protects shares research and development (R&D) information assets and encourages collaboration to connect user communities.  DTIC seeks to provide a department level mapping of R&D activity.  This activity and its results advance research by providing researchers warfighters research and engineering (R&E) management and decision makers with insight into current and past research conducted highlighting progress made and by whom and just as important where research leads to dead ends.  As new capability needs are identified technical challenges arise--rather than starting anew--work can pick up from the point of most recent results.  Through the preservation and sharing of the results of billions of dollars of past DoD investment DTIC increases the return on past investments and accelerates current efforts.  Through its collaboration tools and outreach to the R&E community DTIC works to connect researchers across the lab enterprise to include research and engineering warfighters and DoD’s industry partners.  DTIC operations focus on five key areas:1) Document and preserve what works what has promise (for reuse and additional investments).2) Provide results that identify dead-ends that do not merit additional investment (avoid waste).3) Facilitate and encourage engagement among cross-cutting communities of interest (bring together experts across the acquisition enterprise to meet warfighter needs).4) Present overarching picture of research investment that enables decision-makers to link multiple efforts with integrated capabilities (employ resources to highest priority efforts and coordinate efforts across Services).5) Protect intellectual property (IP) and industry proprietary data assets entrusted to DTIC’s stewardship (protect information access).DTIC recognizes the need to accomplish its mission while increasing the value of the services and products we provide in an environment of Department-wide budget reductions.  DTIC has reduced its physical footprint civilian personnel and contract support; restructured the IAC program; and continues to consolidate its data center.  At the same time DTIC has taken on additional programs to include its new role in leading the Department in efforts to provide public access to DoD-funded journal articles and research data and increased outreach to industry through the Defense Innovation Marketplace.DTIC continues to ensure its activities are efficient and effective meet users’ expectations and employ industry best practices and standards while protecting from cyber threats.  DoD’s $120 Billion annual investment in research development and procurement support current and future capabilities.  The results of these efforts are a national asset that DTIC must preserve for reuse across the acquisition enterprise.  Approximately 23 percent of the four million records in DTIC’s information holdings are sensitive DoD only federal government only and industry proprietary.  DTIC is the only enterprise source for both publicly accessible and DoD sensitive material in a single location.DTIC’s Information Analysis Center (IAC) Program Office provides core funding management and oversight of its three IACs.  The IACs are chartered by DoD to collect analyze and disseminate worldwide scientific and technical information in specialized fields.  The IAC program just completed a multi-year restructuring from ten IACs to the current three reducing customer costs and incorporating new DoD technical interest areas.  The new structure will focus on three technology groupings to include Cyber Security and Information Systems Homeland Defense and Security and Defense Systems.  As part of the Department’s Better Buying Power initiative new multi-award contracts have been put into place improving competition small-business presence and reducing government costs.  The restructured IAC Program will improve affordability productivity and standardization within defense acquisition programs.  Providing the acquisition enterprise access to thousands of industry subject matter experts DTIC’s IACs perform nearly $2.0 Billion of customer funded research and prototyping support annually.  The results of the work are a rich source of material in DTIC’s information asset collections and are available to users across the Department (and other federal agencies e.g. Department of Energy Department of Homeland Security).  This Program Element (PE) supports DTIC mission operations.  DTIC focuses on core mission and buys space human resources (HR) financial management contracting IT security and communications and civilian payroll services from expert and efficient DoD providers:  funding provides for salaries and benefits of government civilian personnel assigned to DTIC; training professional development and travel for DTIC personnel; support agreements for Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) facility-related services; Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) financial activities and HR services; Defense Information Services Agency (DISA) communications and IT security services; annual maintenance and licensing requirements; supplies equipment hardware/software; and support contracts for information technology services Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI) system integration and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliance efforts in concert with the Department’s Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) program.

The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) uniquely accomplishes this mission for the Department by providing both a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics parts that are no longer available from or bid by commercial sources but are essential to combat operations. This is a critical capability in an atmosphere of increasing worldwide supply chain risks with threats to defense microelectronics. The threats include risks such as counterfeiting Trojan horses unreliability and rapid obsolescence coming from an unpredictable and unsecured supply chain. As fiscal pressures force the Department to maintain its weapon systems longer than originally planned and their extended combat use increases attrition the need for DMEA’s unique capabilities increases.Microelectronics is a crucial technology and central for all operations within the Department. Yet as vital as this technology is to Department operations the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market. The Department frequently requires legacy microelectronics long after commercial foundries have moved on to advanced technology levels. As such the semiconductor industry does not respond to the Department’s particular needs of ultra-low volumes long availability time frames or its high-level security concerns. In these cases DMEA procures a license to produce technologies in-house that are no longer commercially manufactured or are unavailable due to no-bids owing to low volume requirements. These licenses enable DMEA to be the Department’s microelectronics supplier of last resort providing the Department with a long-term trusted and assured source.DMEA provides increasingly rare microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides decisive quick turn solutions for defense intelligence special operations cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market. DMEA’s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions—along with its unique technical perspective—allows it to develop manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability. DMEA then uses these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele. After many years of performing analogous efforts the technical experience mission knowledge and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are often incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key tool in the intelligent and rapid development and application of advanced technologies to identified military needs.Working alongside industry DMEA has created a model partnership that provides this capability for the Department. DMEA’s uniquely flexible foundry supports the Department with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now assured to remain in one location for as long as they are needed. To obtain these processes DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses. These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed intellectual property (IP) and the related processes for Department needs. These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry’s right to bid first on resulting production volumes. DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components. If not only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production. A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners’ valuable IP and processes. DMEA is Government owned and operated providing the structure and confidence that an industry partner’s IP is protected from potential competitors. This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring installing and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems combat operations and support needs. As such DMEA serves the Department other US Agencies industry and Allied nations.DMEA assists hundreds of Department programs every year. DMEA has provided its specialized engineering assistance and capabilities to older systems current systems and even to programs not yet in the production phase. This includes the F-18 Super Hornet F-22 Raptor F-35 RQ-4 Global Hawk MQ-9 Reaper AEGIS Advanced Surface Missile System Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) among many other programs. DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Ops Cyber Intelligence and the Radiation-Hard communities.","","","","","",

This mission directly aligns with several national and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance/vision documents.  For Research Development Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) these documents include the National Security Strategy Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense) 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review National Strategy for Combating Terrorism National Strategy to Combat WMD Defense Planning Guidance Guidance for Employment of the Force 2014 DoD Strategy for Countering WMD National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism and Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex).  To achieve this mission the DTRA has established strategies and tasks to meet the principal objectives of the above referenced documents.  These objectives are: 1) Ensure a safe secure and effective nuclear deterrent; 2) Anticipate emerging WMD threats; 3) Provide Combating WMD situational awareness; 4) Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities; 5) Prevent proliferation and use of WMD; 6) Defend against WMD threats; 7) Defeat WMD threats; 8) Recover from WMD consequences; and 9) Synchronize countering WMD activities. The Basic Research Initiative provides for the discovery and development of fundamental knowledge and understanding by research performers comprised from academia and world-class research institutions in Government and industry.  This leverages the DoD's $2 billion plus annual investment in basic research by ensuring a motivation within the scientific community to conduct research benefiting WMD-related defense missions and by improving knowledge of research efforts that benefit nonproliferation counter proliferation and consequence management efforts.  These efforts are closely coordinated with DTRA’s Chemical and Biological Technologies Department which executes a chemical/biological basic research program under DoD’s Chemical and Biological Defense Program.  DTRA’s research interests are coordinated with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Services’ basic research programs through the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group.  DTRA reviews research interests annually to focus on technological areas which are not clearly addressed by other basic research efforts.DTRA’s Basic Research portfolio supports several National and DoD initiatives directly related to Countering WMD (CWMD) including: Office of Science and Technology Policy Nuclear Defense Research and Development Roadmap FY 2013-2017; Defense Budget Priorities and Choices for FY 2014;  Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Science and Technology Priority Steering Council Roadmap;  2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense) and the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review.  In general these documents direct capability enhancements projects and science and technology (S&T) investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers. Specifically they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities values intent and decision making of potential foes whether they are states networks or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based or inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science technology and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements.

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises the combatant commands the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. This PE also directly supports Expeditionary Force 21 (EF 21) which  is now the Marine Corps' capstone concept that establishes  the vision and goals for USMC S&T over the next 10 years and provides a plan for guiding the design and development of the future force.  One third of the Marine Corps operating forces will be forward  deployed.  These forces will be task-organized into a greater variety of formations capable of operating from a more diverse array of ships dispersed over wider areas in order to meet the Combatant Commanders' security cooperation and partner engagement requirements.  In the event of crises those forces will be able to composite these distributed formations into larger cohesive naval formations.  This presents both challenges and opportunities for USMC S&T. Expeditionary Force 21 will inform future decisions regarding how the Marine Corps will adjust organizational structure to exploit the value of regionally focused forces.  A fixed geographic orientation will facilitate Marine Commanders and their staffs with more frequent interactions with theater- and component-level organizations establishing professional bonds and a shared sense of the area's challenges and opportunities.  Expeditionary Force 21 provides the basis for future Navy and Marine Corps capability development to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.  The vision for Expeditionary Force 21 is to provide guidance for how the Marine Corps will be postured organized trained and equipped to fulfill the responsibilities and missions required around the world.  Through Expeditionary Force 21 the Marine Corps intends to operate from the sea and provide the right sized force in the right place at the right time.This PE is organized into nine activities which are represented as seven Expeditionary Warfighting Capability Areas as well as Future Concepts Technology Assessment and Roadmapping and the Littoral Combat/Power Projection (LC/PP) FNC.  The primary objective of this PE is to develop and demonstrate the technologies needed to meet the Marine Corps unique responsibility of training and equipping the Marine Air/Ground Task Force (MAGTF) for Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  In the post-September 11 world irregular warfare (IW) has emerged as the dominant form of warfare confronting the United States its allies and its partners; accordingly this PE has been structured to account for distributed long-duration operations including unconventional warfare counterterrorism counterinsurgency and stabilization and reconstruction operations.  IW emphasizes the use of indirect non-conventional methods and means to subvert attrite and exhaust an adversary or render irrelevant rather than defeat him through direct conventional military confrontation.   IW is now institutionalized in Marine Corps planning investment and capability development.  This PE provides the knowledge base to support Advanced Technology Development (6.3) and is the technology base for future expeditionary warfare capabilities.  This PE supports the Expeditionary Force Development System of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) and responds directly to the Marine Corps Science and Technology (S&T) process as well as supporting related Littoral and Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare capabilities developed by the Navy's Mission Capability Program.  The Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly.  The FNC program explores and demonstrates technologies that enable Sea Strike Sea Shield Sea Basing FORCEnet and Force Health Protection pillars Space Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and the Enterprise and Platform Enablers.  The FNC program comprises Enabling Capabilities (ECs) which develop and deliver quantifiable products (i.e. prototype systems knowledge products and technology improvements) in response to validated requirements for insertion into acquisition programs of record after meeting agreed upon exit criteria within five years. The core 6.2 program also supports Discovery and Invention (D&I) and Innovation and Transformation (I&T).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap this investment will achieve key transformational capabilities required by the Sea Power 21 Pillars as well as enable Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM) Persistent Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  The Marine Corps Service Campaign Plan (MCSCP) is the lens through which USMC S&T priorities are acted upon to guide the future development of the Total Force.Due to the number of efforts in this PE the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.","","","","","",

It enables technologies that significantly improve the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Future Joint Warfighting Capabilities. The In-house Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program also adds increased emphasis to the revitalization of the scientist and engineer workforce component at the Navy's Warfare Centers and Laboratories by attracting superior candidates and retaining our best members through the provision of exciting and meaningful work.This PE addresses DON Basic Research which includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national-security related aspects of physical engineering environmental and life sciences and is the core of Discovery and Invention. Basic research projects are developed managed and related to more advanced aspects of research in some hundred-plus technology and capability-related 'thrusts' which are consolidated in thirteen research focus areas: Power and Energy; Operational Environments; Maritime Domain Awareness; Asymmetric and Irregular Warfare; Information Analysis and Communication; Power Projection; Assure Access and Hold at Risk; Distributed Operations; Naval Warfighter Performance and Protection; Survivability and Self-Defense; Platform Mobility; Fleet/Force Sustainment; Affordability Maintainability and Reliability.This portion of the DON Basic Research Program provides participating Naval Warfare Centers and Laboratories with funding for: basic research to support the execution of their assigned missions; developing and maintaining a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems; promoting hiring and development of new scientists; and encouragement of collaboration with universities private industry and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories.ILIR efforts are selected by Naval Warfare Centers/Lab Commanding Officers and Technical Directors near the start of each Fiscal Year through internal competition. Efforts typically last three years and are generally designed to assess the promise of new lines of research. Successful efforts attract external competitively awarded funding. Because the Warfare Centers and Labs encompass the full range of naval technology interests the scope of ILIR topics roughly parallels that of PE 0601153N Defense Research Science.In FY15 the ILIR PE 06011652N was simplified from seven Naval technology interests (advanced materials electronics sensor sciences energy sciences human performance sciences information sciences naval platform design sciences and ocean/space sciences) into one encompassing ILIR program.  It is still possible to report which naval technology interest each project falls under.

That policy established a need to coordinate acquisition strategies develop guidance and tools and develop analysis of alternatives to determine OA software reuse practices within and across the Navy Communities of Interest (COI - Surface Subsurface Air Space C4I USMC and ONR).  This project facilitates a strategic shift in the acquisition business process to facilitate cooperative competition in cross-domain/COI business relationships.  This improves innovation and economies of scale throughout the Navy and Marine Corps.  This leadership effort has identified the business case and potential return on investment for moving the Navy towards an open systems approach supported the development of open systems technologies and integrated best business and technical practices for open systems development within Naval acquisition.  Naval OA ensures Navy-wide system architectures become extensible and scalable in function capacity and workload to meet Joint warfighting requirements.  This also includes the identification and development of common software components functions reuse methodologies and extensible product lines.  In summary this funding supports the management of a reuse repository and reuse information exchange portal and the evolving business systems engineering and cultural changes required across all Naval programs as they migrate to function in a Joint net-centric warfare environment.","","","180","","",

The popular name Triton was approved for the MQ-4C UAS in June 2012 designating the RQ-4 Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) UAS as the MQ-4C Triton. The MQ-4C Triton is a high altitude-long endurance UAS designed to provide Fleet and combatant commanders with persistent maritime Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) of nearly all the world's high-density sea-lanes littorals and areas of national interest. Teamed with its manned-capability counterpart the P-8A Triton will be a key component of the Navy's family of systems to achieve maritime domain awareness.  MQ-4C Triton will seek to leverage Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force manpower training and maintenance efficiencies.The MQ-4C Triton features sensors designed to provide near worldwide coverage through a network of five orbits inside and outside continental United States with sufficient air vehicles to remain airborne for 24 hours a day 7 days a week out to ranges of 2000 nautical miles. Onboard sensors will provide detection classification tracking and identification of maritime targets and include maritime radar electro-optical/infra-red and Electronic Support Measures systems. Additionally the MQ-4C will have a communications relay capability designed to link dispersed forces in the theater of operations and serve as a node in the Navy's FORCEnet strategy. Tactical-level data analysis will occur in real-time at shore-based mission control sites connected to the air vehicle via satellite communications. Further intelligence exploitation can be conducted at Fleet shore-based sites or aboard aircraft carriers and other ships.The MQ-4C Triton UAS will implement phased capability upgrades within the ongoing acquisition program to pace capability with rapidly evolving technologies and threats to ensure the Navy maintains persistent ISR dominance through the system's lifecycle and to support the OPNAV N2/N6 Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance and Targeting transition plan.  System upgrades will include Multi-Intelligence capabilities Counter Electronic Attack upgrades a more robust electronic support capability and continue improvements to baseline mission system payloads.  MQ-4C will play a significant role in the Sea Shield and FORCEnet pillars of Sea Power 21. In its Sea Shield role the system will rely on its key attribute of persistence to provide the supported combatant command or fleet commander with unparalleled situational awareness of the maritime battle space as it develops and sustains the common operational tactical picture. The system will also serve as a Fleet response plan enabler while acting as a trip wire for intelligence preparation of the environment. Additionally Triton Unmanned Air System will be a FORCEnet enabler and relay platform directly connected to both the Global Information Grid and the Distributed Common Ground System-Navy information backbone.","","MQ-4C Triton RDTE funding for modernization has been segregated into a new program element (from PE 0305220N to PE 0305421N) in order to satisfy Congressional direction for increased transparency.  In the FY2015 Appropriations Act Congress limited the amount of FY2015 funding in the modernization line (PE 0305421N) to $5M until a review of the capability development document is completed by the Joint Requirements Oversights Council (JROC).  In concert with completion of the JROC review the Navy will request a reprogramming from Congress to move the remaining required FY15 funding from PE 0305220N into PE 0305421N in order to maintain the Triton Multi-Intelligence phased capability upgrade schedule.","373","","",

GPS supports both civil and military users in air space sea and land operations.  GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide.  GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position velocity and time.  GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC) sec 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 51 USC sec 50112 which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.This Program Element (PE) funds the Research & Development (R&D) for the GPS next generation operational control system (OCX) and the GPS Enterprise Integrator (EI).  This includes advanced concept development systems analysis modernized control segment development mission planning development training simulators integrated logistics support products test resources systems engineering required to meet the government's obligations to the international military and civil communities and system requirements verification.  OCX acquisition was established to 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites 2) incorporate situational awareness to support Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) and signal monitoring 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support warfighter effects-based approach to operations and 4) integrate DoD information assurance and cyber security controls and capabilities.  GPS Enterprise Integrator is responsible for architecture and system definition (the analysis and definition management maintenance and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents) as well as for the planning execution and fielding of the GPS Enterprise.OCX funds will support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses architectural engineering studies trade studies technology needs forecasting modernization initiatives systems engineering system development test and evaluation efforts and mission operations. These activities support upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to enable efforts to protect U.S. military and allies' use of GPS.  Additionally funds will ensure OCX efforts meet current and future Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved required capabilities.GPS benefits both military and civil users in air space sea and land operations. The GPS Enterprise consists of Space Ground Control Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) and User Equipment Segments.  The government is responsible for the integration of the GPS Segments such that they provide worldwide GPS capability to support the warfighter and over a billion national security civil allied and commercial GPS users.  The GPS Enterprise Integrator project includes the efforts associated with the Government's prime contract tasks necessary to accomplish this critical integrating function with the entire GPS user community.  The Enterprise Integrator maintains the GPS current architecture and system definition controls and validates interfaces ensures compatibility of Generation II and III systems and develops/manages plans for execution and fielding of the GPS Enterprise.  Further the Enterprise Integrator provides modeling simulation and technical analyses of impacts for Government-directed enterprise-level trades among the GPS segments leading to definition management maintenance and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents to build and ensure the integrity of the enterprise technical baseline and perform system requirements verification.In addition the GPS Enterprise Integrator project funds the technical evolution risk reduction enterprise-level testing and delivery of all GPS Enterprise capabilities.  Examples for Generation II include electronic protection and additional civil signals; for Generation III additional anti-jamming protection.  To accomplish this the GPS Enterprise Integrator delivers Test and Verification capabilities Requirements and Interface Management and Systems Integration support across the Space Control and User Segments.  In this capacity the Enterprise Integrator is responsible for managing this cross-program work to provide these and other capabilities.  GPS Enterprise Integrator's analyses guide government decisions to ensure efficient and effective synchronization and execution across all Generation II and III GPS programs.  For Enterprise-wide integration to be successful the Integrator: works with the GPS and NDS prime contractor teams to develop plans for early risk reduction System Integration Demonstrations to ensure system interfaces and functionality meet user and system requirements; ensures all equipment and documentation is ready when needed; integrates and analyzes enterprise schedules conducts formal test and verification including Requirement Verification Plans and System Test Plans and Procedures.  GPS Enterprise Integrator performs all these efforts across all GPS programs in all acquisition phases.  The government owns the Enterprise system requirements and integration and highly leverages the Enterprise Integrator team to eliminate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions.  This enhances government control oversight and program accountability.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that were fielded or received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","","456","0.000","",

It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapons cargo passenger and/or fuel delivery calculate fuel requirements and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review print and brief the mission plan; and download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics. The Mission Planning Systems (MPS) program is a collaborative program with the Army and Navy to leverage technical solutions and business practices for all Department of Defense (DoD) platforms.  It provides automated mission planning tools and support for fixed and rotary wing aircraft and guided munitions.  It replaces two closed architecture legacy mission planning systems (UNIX-based MPS (UNIX-MPS) and the PC-based Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS)) with a single multi-service open architecture system more commonly referred to as the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).  MPS will compress the mission planning cycle by providing an improved integrated planning environment reducing the time required to respond to changing situations and urgent needs such as striking time sensitive/critical targets and conducting combat search and rescue.  MPS products have the potential to support all DoD fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft and will be shared with other AF programs as well as the Army and Navy.  MPS will deliver significant benefits to command and control performance by enhancing information superiority for the warfighter and by providing unique capabilities in support of both precision engagement and dominant maneuver.  The Mobility Air Force Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS) component of MPS will provide a centralized net-centric global mobility mission flight planning capability.  This capability will provide significant fuel savings through automated flight route optimization utilizing aircraft performance air traffic management weather and other data. In addition to the above elements of Mission Planning Systems will be utilized to continue development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System - Mission Planning(JPADS-MP) in conjunction with the Army.  The JPADS  capability provides a planning and execution capability for DoD airdrop requirements.  It is the primary airdrop mission planning and execution system for all ballistic airdrop mission as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and/or standoff precision delivery.  JPADS-MP enables high-altitude precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces mitigating surface-to-air threats reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and insurgent attack on ground convoys.  JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather terrain aircraft capabilities threat etc. to accurately deliver payloads to keep the warfighter supplied and in the fight.FY16 funding will continue the MPS software development program.  It will develop pre and in-flight mission planning capabilities for Air Force aircraft and weapons migrating from legacy mission planning systems to the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) as well as continuing to update Air Force weapon systems that have already migrated to JMPS.   These weapon systems include but are not limited to the: A-10 B-1B C-5 C-17 C-130 HC-130 EC-130 E-3 E-8 F-15 F-16 F-22A RC-135 HH-60 and their associated weapons (e.g. Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Munitions (JASSM) etc.).  FY16 funding will also continue the development of MAFPS to realize fuel savings and other efficiencies.  Additionally it will continue the development of JPADS-MP airdrop software (and other system components) to provide a precision airdrop capability for the C-17 C-130 and other selected platforms as necessary.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","","N35","0.000","0.660",

It directly supports Air Force Joint Coalition composite training and rehearsal concept development and acquisition and testing through modeling and simulation development as well as the integration of these across and within Live Virtual and Constructive (LVC) environments.  This program focuses on support of Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2) acquisition excellence initiatives and foundational capabilities needed for interoperability accessibility reuse and scalability.  It allows the authoritative portrayal of new and emerging Air Force capabilities within DoD and coalition LVC environments; as well as reciprocating capabilities within Air Force LVC environments.  LVC environments today are used as the most cost effective and practical means to meet mission needs.  In support of the DoD T2 initiative USAF M&S program thrust areas develop and modernize models and simulations that are the constructive backbone of Air Force and joint training and rehearsal.  Once these models and simulations are developed they are integrated across training LVC environments for use by Major and Combatant Commands.  This development and integration is imperative to ensure that air space and cyberspace training and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic interoperable and readily available tools data and services.  These in turn enable joint coalition and interagency training required to prepare forces for combat by generating the air and space picture for the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) and Joint Force Commander in combat exercises; training over 100000 personnel per year in exercises (e.g. Ulchi Freedom Guardian Red & Blue Flags Unified Endeavor etc).  These programs also provide the current foundational environment that enables warfighters to interact with high-fidelity tactical cockpit simulators which replicate high demand/low density platforms that are often unavailable for training due to real-world operations; while simultaneously linking it to warfighters using their current command and control systems 1000 miles away and the constructive simulations being run from key operational wargaming and simulation centers worldwide. USAF M&S is integral to inter-agency Homeland Defense (HLD) exercises chartered to train combat units tasked to protect the Homeland including the National Capital Region (exercise Amalgam Arrow); this generates equipment and manpower efficiencies by using simulations which reduce fuel consumption aircraft wear and tear and manpower costs.  In support of the DoD drive to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its enterprise-wide acquisition business processes the USAF M&S Program Element develops and supports enhancements to models simulations tools and the LVC infrastructure to provide for system-of-systems M&S capabilities across the lifecycle reduce developmental costs and minimize risks.  These capabilities support the acquisition process from concept development through test and evaluation.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","In FY 2016 Project Number 674567 M&S Foundations includes new start efforts.","","0.000","",

Historically aircraft systems change missions tactics and environments (including new fuels) to meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the engines through actual use and Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these field problems.  Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types/maturity of engines not by the total engine quantity.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory engines operational.  Engine CIP through "Lead the Fleet" operational use and accelerated mission testing identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts.  Engine CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when manufacturers incorporate Engine CIP improvements into production engines.  Engine CIP ensures continued improvements in engine R&M which reduce out year support costs.  Historically R&M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&M) and spares costs.  Without Engine CIP out year support funding would have to be significantly increased.

The Air Force is applying the lessons learned from the Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS) Acquisition Incident Review (AIR) in development of a hybrid approach of core logistics system remediation / modification and transformation to include transitioning to a common IT hosting environment.Financial Improvement Audit Readiness (FIAR) and Software UpgradesThe remediation and modification of core logistics systems is necessary for the Air Force to meet statutory Financial Improvement Audit Readiness (FIAR) by 2017 and align with the Joint Chiefs of Staff J-4 Concept for Logistics and the Air Force Logistics Board's approved Enterprise Logistics Strategy (ELS).  The Air Force planned for ECSS to subsume most of the Service's core logistics systems upon fielding and therefore placed them in barebones reduced maintenance status during the ECSS program.  Due to the cancellation of ECSS the Air Force must sustain and modernize these systems through both FIAR Remediation to address the most immediate gaps in meeting FIAR by the 2017 statutory deadline and Software Upgrades to reduce high operating costs implement previously deferred statutory compliance requirements and improve near term system performance.  Systems contained in these business areas include but are not limited to the Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS) Combat Ammunitions System (CAS) Enhanced Maintenance Operations Center (EMOC) Aircraft Structural Integrity Management Information System (ASIMIS) Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S) Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS) Stock Control System (SCS) Purchase Request Process System (PRPS) Automated Logistics Management Support System (ALMSS) Depot Maintenance Accounting and Production System (DMAPS) Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS) and Weapon System Management Information System (WSMIS).Transformation The Air Force must transform its logistics business processes and transition away from using numerous stovepipe systems and process flows that execute the same tasks.  Eliminating process redundancies across the logistics enterprise will enable the Air Force to execute more efficient cost-effective and integrated logistics in the long term.  The objective of Transformation is to conduct business process reengineering (BPR) to identify and eliminate overlaps in our current processes and where appropriate implement the use of new information technology systems.  The Air Force Service Development and Delivery Process (SDDP) is being applied as part of this BPR effort to apply discipline and focus to the task of process reengineering and requirements development in order to reduce risk and successfully transform logistics IT systems.  In the SDDP the requirements definition architecture and design for an IT capability is a government-owned process.  The SDDP ensures the AF end user and Sponsor consider all possible doctrine organization training material leadership personnel and facility (DOTMLPF) solutions to the end user's need/problem before a materiel solution is sought.  The SDDP is a six-step process each step with its own specific product outcomes that serve as the basis for downstream activities in the SDDP and facilitating enterprise-level analysis to maximize reuse of existing capabilities.  Maximizing reuse will eliminate duplicate implementation actions across the Air Force and assure individual user problems or needs are not solved at the cost of overall enterprise benefits.  The outcome of using the SDDP is a well-described requirement which may include a materiel solution in which case the SDDP details the acquisition and implementation activities to support delivery of the capability.  Alternatively success may be demonstrated by the resolution of the user's problem without a materiel solution.  The Air Force logistics enterprise is comprised of multiple overarching functional areas to include maintenance repair and overhaul end-to-end supply chain support base supply inventories and predictive analysis and forecasting.  The Air Force will standardize its business processes within each major logistics functional area through Transformation Capability Initiatives (CI).  Transformation CIs include but are not limited to: Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MROi) Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM).-MROi will create an integrated capability that plans schedules and executes organic depot maintenance support functions critical to agile planning optimized workload assignment resource allocation and throughput thereby increasing depot maintenance support to the warfighter.  -SCM includes Supply Item Master and Government Furnished Materiel (GFM) initiatives.-SCM Supply encompasses centralized planning and management of items and equipment such as: repairables consumables Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel (NWRM) and cryptographic items and comprises business operations and inventory for the Air Force Base Supply community. -SCM Item Master provides the capability to manage comprehensive accurate reliable item master data (e.g. accurate identification and authorization of owners and users of items).-SCM GFM will provide AF accountability for contractor managed government material and reporting of logistics and financial data.  AF will be able to track end-to-end logistics and financial transactions provide total asset visibility (TAV) and report equipment and material inventory values.  -PLM enables Air Force engineering/logistics communities to define track protect and manage product data for Air Force weapon systems and equipment.  The Air Force requires the ability to control configuration of the product throughout the life of the asset. Standardized configuration control will ensure validity accuracy and reliability currency and security of the product information which will increase weapon system readiness by decreasing costs to manage protect store and deliver product information.  -BA 7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes developmental efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","","","0.000","655.115",

The AF and the DoD require the capability to secure collect process store and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information while denying an adversary the ability to intercept collect destroy interpret or manipulate our information flows. Secure communication allows the DoD to achieve and maintain decision superiority; the key to successful application of the military instrument of national power. AF COMSEC equipment protects information such as warfighter positions mission planning target strikes commanders' orders intelligence force strength and force readiness. This COMSEC program ensures adversaries cannot interpret manipulate or destroy information. When an adversary is capable of interpretation manipulation or destruction of the information used by the warfighter DoD military forces will suffer significant and/or devastating mission degradation that can result in loss of life and resources and/or cede information that could be used against the United States in a public forum.The overall focus of the Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) efforts within this program is to transform electronic key delivery and cryptographic devices to meet the next generation warfighting requirements. These efforts are driven by the National Security Agency's (NSA) tenets calling for (1) a totally "man-out-of-the-loop" electronic crypto key distribution system from the actual generation of the key in the key processor all the way into the using End Crypto Unit (ECU) (eliminates the current key vulnerability to compromise/interruption by individuals transporting or loading the key); and (2) an inventory of cryptographic devices that are more robust modular scalable capable net-centric and durable (allows more effective and efficient performance including reduced inventory expanded data rates simplified upgrades and ensured global information grid-compatibility).

Cross DoD coordinated and cooperative efforts are focused in four principal medical areas: Combat Casualty Care Military Operational Medicine Militarily Relevant Infectious Diseases and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine.  Promising medical technologies are refined and validated through extensive testing which is closely monitored by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as part of their processes for licensing and/or approving new medical products. The FDA requires medical products to undergo extensive preclinical testing in animals and/or other models to obtain preliminary effectiveness and safety information before they can be tested in human clinical trials. Clinical trials are conducted in three phases to prove the safety of a drug vaccine or device for the targeted disease or medical condition starting in Phase 1 with a small number of healthy volunteers. Following Phase 1 Phase 2 clinical trials to provide expanded safety data and evaluate the effectiveness of a drug vaccine or medical device in a larger population of patients having the targeted disease or medical condition. Each successive phase includes larger numbers of human subjects and requires FDA cognizance prior to proceeding. Work conducted in this PE primarily focuses on late stages of technology maturation activities required to conduct Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Some high-risk technologies may require additional maturation with FDA guidance prior to initiating these clinical trials. Such things as proof of product stability and purity are necessary to meet FDA standards before entering later stages of testing and prior to transitioning into a formal acquisition program where large Phase 3 pivotal trials will be conducted for licensure. Activities in this PE may include completion of preclinical animal studies and Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies involving human subjects according to FDA and EPA requirements. Promising medical technologies that are not regulated by the FDA are modeled prototyped and tested in relevant environments.Blast research and research into maturing field rations in this PE are fully coordinated with the United States Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center.  This coordination enables improved body armor design and rations for Soldiers. Additionally the activities funded in this PE are externally peer reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI).  The ASBREM COI formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defense's biomedical research and development community as well as its associated enabling research areas.Project 810 maturates and demonstrates FDA-regulated medical countermeasures such as drugs vaccines and diagnostic systems to naturally occurring infectious diseases and wound infections of military importance as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis.  The project also supports testing of personal protective measures such as repellents and insecticides regulated by the EPA. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.Project 840 validates studies on safety and effectiveness of drugs biologics (products derived from living organisms) medical devices and medical procedures intended to minimize immediate and long-term effects from battlefield injuries; advanced technology development and clinical studies for treatment of ocular ( and visual system traumatic injury; and restoration of function and appearance by regenerating skin muscle and bone tissue in battle-injured casualties. Additionally this project develops and realistically tests improved occupant protection systems through medical research to characterize mechanisms of injuries sustained by occupants of ground-combat vehicles subjected to underbody blast events determine human tolerance limits to underbody blast forces and develop tools to predict injuries to ground-combat vehicle occupants exposed to underbody blast forces.Project FH4 maturates validates and supports enhanced Force Health Protection of Soldiers against threats in military operations and training. Health-monitoring tools are matured to rapidly identify deployment stressors that affect the health of Joint Forces. These databases and systems enhance the DoDs ability to monitor and protect against adverse changes in health especially mental health effects caused by changes in brain function. Force Health Protection work is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The program is maturing the development of global health monitoring (e.g. development of neuropsychological evaluation methodologies) validating clinical signs and symptoms correlating to medical records diagnosed diseases and mortality rates. The key databases supporting this program are the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow for the examination of interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.Project MM3 supports the Medical and Survivability technology areas with laboratory validation studies and field demonstrations of biomedical products designed to counteract myriad environmental and physiological stressors as well as materiel hazards encountered in training and operational environments to protect sustain and enhance Soldier performance. The key efforts are to demonstrate and transition technologies as well as validate tools associated with Soldier survivability injury assessment and prediction assessments for post-concussive syndrome and enhancing performance during continuous operations. The three main thrust areas are (1) Physiological Health and Environmental Protection (2) Injury Prevention and Reduction and (3) Psychological Health and Resilience. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services.Work funded in this project PE is fully coordinated with efforts undertaken in PE 0602787A and the Defense Health Program.

The Sentinel system is used with the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) element and is a key component to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture via the IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) to provide critical air surveillance of the forward areas.The Sentinel currently consists of two primary variants: the AN/MPQ-64A1 system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) and an enhanced radar variant the AN/MPQ-64A3 mounted on a 2.5 ton trailer and towed by an armored Family of Medium Tactical Vehicle (FMTV) platform. Sentinel also consists of Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) and Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) Command Control and Intelligence (C2I) interfaces. The radar is deployed in both an air defense role and a force protection role for Counter-Rocket Artillery and Mortar (C-RAM) missions.  The sensor is an advanced three-dimensional battlefield X-Band air defense phased-array radar with an instrumented range of 75 kilometers.  Sentinel is capable of operating day or night in adverse weather conditions in the battlefield environments of dust smoke aerosols and enemy countermeasures.  It provides 360-degree azimuth coverage for acquisition tracking.  Sentinel contributes to the digital battlefield by automatically detecting classifying identifying and reporting targets (cruise missiles unmanned aerial systems rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft). Sentinel acquires targets sufficiently forward of the battle area to allow weapons reaction time and engagement at optimum ranges.  Sentinel's integrated IFF reduces the potential for fratricide of US and Coalition aircraft.The Research and Development funding supports Sentinel modernization/upgrades hardware/software issue resolution resolution of obsolescence issues engineering studies and cost reduction initiatives.  The funding for Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 through FY 2020 development activities addresses the following Sentinel system capability gaps and obsolescence issues identified by the User:  1) Target Detection gap; 2) Target Tracking gap; 3) Net Readiness gap; 4) Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) gap; and 5) Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Defense gap. Battle Space Improvement addresses the Target Detection gap that currently exists with the Sentinel system.  This development effort modifies the radar signal processor algorithms and will increase target acquisition and tracking range capability by a minimum of 12 percent against the threat set within the instrumented range band.  This effort also develops modifications to the radar hardware by utilizing an upgraded common signal processing card to the radar signal processor to provide a common hardware and software processing configuration across the Sentinel radar fleet.Stop Stare and Track addresses the Target Tracking Gap.  This development effort provides direct Fire Control Radar (FCR) support in an integrated air and missile defense architecture. In addition this provides significantly improved Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) timeline and performance against all targets to include UAS Cruise Missiles Rotary Wing and Fixed Wing aircraft. This upgrade also enables rapid classification of cued Rockets Artillery and Mortars (RAM) UAS Rotary Wing and Fixed Wing aircraft as well as very accurate Point of Origin (POO) and Point of Impact (POI) of RAM targets and enables a robust kill assessment capability of engaged targets.Cross Domain Solution (CDS) Network Interface addresses net readiness and system security concerns. This effort develops a CDS interface to isolate the Sentinel radar from connected networks of lower classification levels. Allows for ongoing cyber security initiatives to be reviewed and addressed as they arise. Ensures that Information Assurance/Cyber security is part of Sentinel operations missions and functions. Makes certain that practices necessary to ensure the protection of information and personnel are instituted.Electronic Attack/Electronic Protect (EA/EP) addresses the electronic countermeasures (ECM) gap.  This effort conducts additional design and testing to verify initial EA/EP results and updates the database and associated software and hardware with more extensive EA/EP signatures to address evolving threats.Signal Data Processor (SDP)/North Finding Module (NFM) addresses the Target Detection Target Tracking and Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) capability gaps and funds the mitigation of the SDP and NFM obsolescence issues.   SDP cards are estimated to go obsolete every four to six years.Medium Bandwidth Waveform upgrade will address latent tracking issues that currently exist with Sentinel in certain applications.  This development effort modifies firmware as well as software in the Sentinel radar.  This effort will provide better target resolution and more accurate tracking in the slant range coordinate.  This improved target resolution and tracking accuracy will provide improved retention of target identification and more robust tracking that addresses the latent tracking issues.  Mode S upgrade to existing Sentinel Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) will address Sentinel's objective requirement to interrogate IFF mode S which is currently not being met.  Mode S transmissions are a key component of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) surveillance technology being used by the Federal Aviation Administration for tracking aircraft as part of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  In the United States all aircraft required to have transponders (most aircraft) must transition to mode S capable units by 2020.  Without the Mode S upgrade Sentinel will have to rely on these aircraft transponders responding to the legacy mode 3/A interrogations.  The data available in the mode S response will be valuable in identifying the aircraft and correlating Sentinel tracks with civil aviation tracks/data and other track data sources.The Active Electronic Steered Array (AESA) is the next generation of radar technology to replace the current phase and frequency scanned array used by Sentinel today.  The AESA Antenna will provide increased capability including extended range for ground-based surveillance and situational awareness faster and more accurate Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) for clearing fires and preventing fratricide improved Fire Control (FC) quality track accuracy and management of larger track loads.  The AESA will also provide improved operation in severe/urban clutter.  The system will detect and track small targets such as Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Cruise Missiles in clutter and will detect and track slow targets such as UAS and Rotary Wing (RW) aircraft at low altitudes in clutter.  The system will detect track and classify Rocket Artillery and Mortar (RAM) threats and will support Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) requirements and can provide sensor support for the Counter-RAM requirements for Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2-Intercept Block 2 (IFPC Inc 2-I block 2) mission.

It followed the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture which is aligned to the mandated Federal Enterprise Architecture. GFEBS was implemented to fulfill the needs and comply with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 and the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and to fulfill the stated mission of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller. GFEBS replaced in full or in part financial systems operating in excess of 40 years including the Standard Finance Systems and other costly feeder systems which do not allow the Department of Defense or the U.S. government to achieve an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements. GFEBS is used to administering the Army's General Fund. GFEBS was developed using a commercial off-the-shelf Enterprise Resource Planning system that is certified by the Chief Financial Officer Council and provides six core financial functions. GFEBS allows tactical commanders to make informed decisions on a virtually real time system.On 1 October 2008 GFEBS deployed to Wave 1 end users at Fort Jackson Garrison Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) Indianapolis Indiana and several other organizations. On 1 April 2009 GFEBS deployed to Wave 2 users at Fort Benning Fort Stewart DFAS Rome and several other organizations. Wave 3 deployed in October FY10 Wave 4 in January of FY11 Wave 5 in April 2011 Wave 6 in July 2011 Wave 7 in October 2011 Wave 8A in April 2012 and the final Wave 8B in July 2012. GFEBS is fielded to over 37000 trained end users. Each fielded release subsumed the previous release keeping all deployed sites executing under the same GFEBS release. The Full Deployment Decision was received by the Milestone Decision Authority on 24 June 2011 and Full Deployment was Full Deployment was achieved on 1 July 2012.GFEBS-Sensitive Activities (SA): GFEBS is a commercial off-the-shelf Enterprise Resource Planning System certified by the Chief Financial Officers Council. GFEBS has trained and supports over 37000 end users at 227 installations worldwide and is the Army's solution to the current capability gap in accounting and financial management. Army still has classified and sensitive financial activity remaining in legacy systems that cannot be processed in our new fully-fielded GFEBS. To protect sensitive information and enable auditability Army needs a separate instance of GFEBS operated on a secure network for processing sensitive and classified financial transactions. GFEBS-SA will be implemented in two functional releases to 3000 users across 100 locations worldwide. GFEBS-SA will integrate seamlessly with GFEBS to provide secure web-based financial execution and reporting capabilities to the Army's classified and sensitive activities. SA is envisioned as a fully functional GFEBS application operated on a secure network including additional performance requirements designed to enhance security. SA is essential to comply with the Chief Financial Officers Act and the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act; includes the additional security controls; shall be delivered NLT 1QFY17 with all capability and required cross domain interfaces. SA will be accessible on SIPRnet domain contain Secret Collateral level information and below. SA will utilize a cross-domain solution to exchange summary level financial transaction data to GFEBS and other required systems enabling total general ledger accountability in one system. In accordance with 2010 NDAA GFEBS-SA willl support the legal requirements to achieve full audit readiness of all DOD finanical statement by 2017. Without the SA increment GFEBS will be unable to achieve an unqualified audit opinion or achieve audit readiness. GFEBS and GFEBS-SA will provide Army's decision makers with relevant reliable and timely information for decision making. RDTE funds are required to execute the System Integrator contract to develop and test the SA solution. Sensitive Activities provides a classified version of the GFEBS program. Sensitive Activities allows processing of data in a secure environment to protect and manage classified data without causing risk to our national security.Integration of Environmental Management will migrate HQAES capabilities for collection analysis and reporting of environmental clean-up quality and hazardous waste data.","","The GFEBS program received FY 2014 funding in PE 0605013A Project M05.

The Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) is a Global Positioning System guidance kit with fuzing functions. PGK provides near precision accuracy and effectiveness for 155mm High Explosive artillery projectiles. PGK will improve the accuracy of existing artillery ammunition by correcting the trajectory of projectiles to their designated target location. Precision guidance systems will effectively reduce target delivery error reducing the number of rounds required to conduct a fire mission.Project EC1:  The Target Practice Day/ Night/ Thermal (TP D/N/T) cartridges are 40mm grenade training cartridges. The low velocity variant is for training with the M203/M320 grenade launchers and the high velocity variant is for training with the Mk19 grenade machine gun. Both of these cartridges will provide the War Fighter with a non dud producing environmentally friendly training cartridge which provides a visual and thermal impact signature that can be seen day or night by the unaided eye or through night vision devices and thermal weapon sights. The program will carry competitive prototypes for each cartridge variant through the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.Project EC4:  Army's Combat Training Centers are currently using non-standard munitions to replicate both conventional and asymmetric warfare battlefield effects. These modified commercial-off-the-shelf products have not been type classified material released and are not sustainable; because of these issues risk assessment and risk mitigation lies with the individual Training Center. Standardization of these munitions will reduce training costs eliminate redundancies between systems and mitigate safety risks associated with realistic scenario based training.Project EL9:  This project supports the future force by improving the distribution management reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development integration and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations to include retrograde while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling distribution and management (strategic and tactical) prognostics diagnostics and asset visibility explosives safety and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization. The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield. This project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter. Project EP7:  This project will support Integrated System Design (ISD) and System Capability and Manufacturing Process Demonstrations (SC&MPD) on current pyrotechnic munitions and tunable pyrotechnic aircraft counter measures and decoys. The project will also support ISD & SC& MPD on new expendable countermeasure munitions that will protect Army aircraft from advanced and current guided missile threats. Activities include modeling and simulation flight testing qualification testing engineering to reduce size and weight environmental considerations safety enhancements manufacturing enhancements qualification of other service and foreign munitions that could meet current requirements product improvements insertion of new technologies to increase performance and enhancement of current flare solutions for new and existing aircraft.  Systems include impulse cartridges pen flares hand held signals trip flares simulators marine markers smoke pots smoke grenades rail road flares and other type of emergency/distress devices aircraft expendables (to include Radio Frequency (RF) expendables) and primers used in munitions systems.","","FY 2016: New start for Projects EL9 and EP7;  Budget rephasing for project S36.","","","",

The APR-39 Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) detects categorizes and prioritizes Radio Frequency (RF) emitters and provides a visual / aural alert to aircrew members warning them of targeting by RF-guided weapons. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved Phases 1 and 2 of a 3-phased path forward. Phase 1 serves as an obsolescence / sustainment upgrade to the Processor Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) of the AN/APR-39A(V) Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) implemented to ensure that the currently fielded system remains viable until affordable improved RF ASE capability can be pursued in Phases 2 and 3. Phase 2 RWR Modernization adopts the ongoing United States Navy Class I RWR Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) commonly referred to as the APR-39D(V)2 system. APR-39D(V)2 will significantly improve the near-spherical RF threat coverage automatic detection and identification of threat types bearing and lethality. Under Phase 2 the Army will develop enhancements to the APR-39D(V)2 including integrated suite control functionality threat correlation and off-boarding capability and hardware upgrades needed to keep the APR-39D(V)2 technically relevant and address emerging Low Probability Intercept (LPI) and frequency agile threats. Phase 3 adds active Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) jamming capability for selected aircraft; Materiel Development Decision (MDD) for this ECM jamming capability phase is not expected until later in the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).ER8: Common Missile Warning System (CMWS):The US Army operational requirements concept for Aviation Infrared (IR) countermeasure systems is known as the Suite of Integrated Infrared Countermeasures (SIIRCM). SIIRCM is an integrated warning and countermeasure system to enhance aircraft survivability against IR-guided threat missile systems. The Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) is a core element of the SIIRCM concept. CMWS is an integrated ultraviolet (UV) missile warning system with an Improved Countermeasure Dispenser (ICMD) serving as a subsystem to a host aircraft. The CMWS program is a UV missile warning system that cues both flare and laser-based countermeasures to defeat incoming IR-seeking missiles and will alert aircrews to the presence of certain incoming unguided munitions. The B-Kit consists of the components which perform the missile detection and aircrew notification unguided munitions detection and aircrew notification false alarm rejection and countermeasure employment/cueing functions of the system. The CMWS Electronic Control Unit (ECU) receives UV missile detection data from Electro-Optic Missile Sensors (EOMS) and sends a missile alert signal to warn aircrews via on-board avionics. Tier 1 threat missiles detected and tracked by the CMWS are subsequently defeated by a combination of missile seeker countermeasures including decoy flares and IR Laser Jamming (currently ATIRCM-equipped CH-47 platform only). In addition the CMWS ECU receives from the EOMS unguided munitions detection data which it also passes to the aircrew through aural and visual alerts. The aircrew then applies the appropriate Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to break contact or engage the enemy with own-ship ordnance. The CMWS Generation 3 (Gen 3) ECU in conjunction with ongoing software development efforts will address outstanding material release conditions to achieve a Full Material Release (FMR) for CMWS and ensure protection against emerging IR-guided missile threats. The A-Kit for CMWS includes mounting hardware wiring harnesses cables and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft. The A-Kit ensures the mission kit is functionally and physically operational with a specific host aircraft type.ER7: Justification: Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Base RDT&E funding of $15.115 million supports RWR software development Software Integration Lab (SIL) updates and emerging threats.ER8: Justification: Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Base RDT&E dollars in the amount of $2.997 million supports development engineering of the Threat Analysis Database (TAD) and integration with other Aircraft Survivability Equipment systems.","","","","","",

The addition of the digital fire control system enables the weapon to program and fire the improved Excalibur precision-guided munitions to ranges in excess of 25 miles with better than 10-meter Circular Error Probable (CEP) accuracy. The LW155 is the first ground combat system whose major structures are made of high strength titanium alloy and the system makes extensive use of hydraulics to operate the breech load tray recoil and wheel arms. The combination of titanium structures and the use of hydraulic systems resulted in a significant weight savings of 7000 lbs over the M198 system. Compared to the M198 the LW155 emplaces three-times faster and displaces four-times faster. It traverses 32 percent more terrain worldwide and is 70 percent more survivable than the M198. It is a successful joint service program between the Marine Corps and Army working together to develop produce field and sustain the howitzer. The LW155 was first introduced into the Marine Corps in April 2005 and the Marines have now fielded the howitzer to all active units. The Army has fielded the howitzer to its Stryker Brigade Combat teams (SBCT) Fires Brigades and National Guard. Fielding of the Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) commenced in FY14 and will continue through 2018. The LW155 saw extensive action in Afghanistan receiving high marks for its performance. Having now been in the field for almost 10 years the howitzer will be going through obsolescent replacement of electronic components in its digital fire control system.  Funding supports engineering studies for capabilities identified in the Joint U.S. Army U.S. Marine Corps Operational Requirements Document (JORD) for the Advanced Towed Cannon System but deferred during Engineering Manufacturing and Development due to technology maturity cost and schedule as well as government sustainment activities requiring RDTE. This includes a digital direct fire sight for the Digital Fire Control System; low temperature high density power solutions; and electric elevation drives and auto loader to achieve full operational requirements. Efforts in FY2015-FY2018 will be centered on researching technical solutions while efforts in FY2019-FY2020 will involve developing technology demonstrator prototypes.","","Beginning FY15 0604854A project 516 has been moved to new APE 0210609A project ED8.","","","",

P455 the Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF) incentivizes S&T to promote long term change in DoD capabilities so they are better aligned with the Operational Energy Strategy. OECIF generally fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance and has two key mission aspects. First to develop demonstrate and transition into use operational energy technologies and practices that will improve DoD military capabilities and/or reduce costs. Second to establish within the military Services sustainable institutional capacity to continue to research develop and adopt operational energy innovations. OECIF funds serve as “seed money” to start or consolidate promising operational energy programs to be sustained by the Services; accordingly OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs rather than one-off projects. P456 the Hybrid Energy Storage Module (HESM) co-sponsored by ASD(R&E) and ASD(OEPP) develops advanced energy storage technologies to maximize performance and reliability and enable future high power weapons and sensor systems on legacy and next generation vehicles aircraft and ships. The goals of HESM are to (1) demonstrate energy storage systems with high power and energy densities scalable to all power levels that reduce total logistics demand increase platform ability to sustain operations during engagement and (2) reduce maintenance. Once demonstration is complete this technology will be sustained by the Services and used to extend the operational performance and safety for these applications beyond the hybrid storage module baseline design configuration. This program is closely coordinated with the Advanced Management and Protection of Energy-storage Devices (AMPED) program of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E).","","","","","",

The suite of remote ground-based sensors provide early warning midcourse and terminal ballistic missile defense threat data enabling layered detection and tracking of ballistic missile targets providing fire-control quality position velocity and discrimination data through Command and Control Battle Management Communications (C2BMC). Overlapping coverage of geographically diverse sensors provides improved threat track data as well as reducing the loss of any one sensor and reducing the potential impact of countermeasures. The extended coverage and accuracy provided by a network of layered sensors increases the defensive footprint and reduces the number of target engagements required thereby conserving interceptor inventory and ensuring a high probability of successful engagement. Networked forward-based sensors enables C2BMC to pair the best sensor coverage with the best available weapon system to provide the most effective defense against ballistic missile threats. This Program Element includes support for the Discrimination Improvements for Homeland Defense (DIHD) effort. The goal of this effort is to develop and field an integrated set of Element capabilities to improve BMDS reliability lethality and discrimination.  The end result will be a deployed future BMDS architecture more capable of discriminating and destroying a reentry vehicle with a high degree of confidence that will improve Warfighter shot doctrine and preserve inventory.  This effort will encompass a Near-Term Mid-Term capability and Far-term DIHD capability fielding.  DIHD is a combined effort between Systems Engineering Ground-based Midcourse Defense (PE 0603882C) BMD Sensors (PE 0603884C) C2BMC (PE 0603896C) Aegis BMD (PE 0603892C) and Advanced C4ISR (PE 0603179C).    The BMD Sensors Program contributes to regional missile defense through the following activities: Development delivery and deployment or redeployment of remote forward based Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance and Control (AN/TPY-2) radars to include radars for tests or operations. Radars provide early warning track and discrimination data through all phases of ballistic missile flight. Through the BMDS C2BMC and coalition data links the AN/TPY-2 provides fire control data to enable remote Standard Missile (SM)-3 engagements by Aegis BMD to allow earlier engagement by the Arrow Weapon System and to cue deployed THAAD and U.S. and partner PATRIOT batteries. Provides the enhancements/development of AN/TPY-2 software across the fleet of radars. Lessons learned from each radar are addressed in new software builds that are developed tested and subsequently installed at each radar. AN/TPY-2 radars can be configured to operate either as a THAAD Fire Unit Radar (terminal mode) or Forward-Based Radar. These radars are transportable adding flexibility to respond to geographical changes in threats. The AN/TPY-2 used in a Forward-Based role detects and acquires ballistic missile threats and provides precision track and discrimination data during the boost and midcourse phases of flight. The BMDS C2BMC provides this track and discrimination data for cueing and engagements to GFC for GMD defense of the homeland and to Link 16 for Aegis and other regional missile defense systems to support defense of U.S. deployed forces friends and allies. This track and discrimination data identifies the lethal object significantly reduces the target uncertainty and provides additional reaction time to increase the probability of successful BMDS engagements. The AN/TPY-2 used in terminal mode is an integral component of the THAAD Battery. The THAAD battery radar is capable of tracking multiple threats and multiple interceptors during engagements in the terminal phase. It provides surveillance acquisition track discrimination interceptor communications and hit assessment data collection for the fire control. The current and planned utilization of the AN/TPY-2 radars supports GMD THAAD and the Aegis Weapon System via C2BMC. The Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) network of sensors also includes the COBRA DANE Radar at Eareckson Air Force Station in Alaska and the Upgraded Early Warning Radars (UEWR) at Beale Air Force Base CA Fylingdales Royal Air Force United Kingdom and at Thule Air Force Base in Greenland. These Ultra High Frequency Early Warning Radars (EWR) have been upgraded to include missile defense functionality. This upgrade expands the capabilities of the U.S. to include defense against limited long-range threats. The Clear EWR located at Clear Air Force Station AK and the Cape Cod EWR Located at Cape Cod Air Force Station MA are also being upgraded to include missile defense functionality. Upgrade activities began in FY 2012 and are expected to be completed in FY 2017. The addition of the Clear UEWR and Cape Cod UEWRs the BMDS sensor architecture will improve BMDS sensor coverage and provide new engagement options against long-range missile threats. The BMD Vision Study conducted by MDA with USSTRATCOM identified the need to enhance the discrimination capabilities of our sensors and weapon systems.  There is an Enhanced Discrimination and sensors program that will improve discrimination capabilities of the AN/TPY-02 Cobra Dane Sea Based X-Band and the UEWR radars against the long range missile threat.

On 17 September 2009 the President announced an overarching plan to provide regional missile defense to U.S. deployed forces allies and partners in Europe called the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA). The United States will also pursue Phased Adaptive Approaches (PAA) in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East by building on current efforts. The PAA envisions tailoring U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities to specific theater needs to enhance integrated regional missile defenses to protect defended assets against medium intermediate and ultimately intercontinental range ballistic missiles. Within this policy an EPAA specifically addresses a timeline to deploy a mix of afloat and land-based BMD capabilities. Aegis Ashore represents one of these land-based capabilities. Phase II of EPAA (2015): Deploys the first land-based BMD configuration (Aegis Ashore) in Romania and deploys the SM-3 Block IB on land at the Aegis Ashore site and at sea on multi-mission Aegis ships with BMD capability. Phase III of EPAA (2018): Deploys a second land-based Aegis Ashore in Poland and introduces an upgraded Standard Missile the SM-3 Block IIA. This missile brings improved coverage against medium and intermediate range ballistic threats and extends coverage to the majority of the European continent. Aegis Ashore is a key component of Phases II and III in the European PAA and will provide Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense capability against short and medium range ballistic missiles in an ashore configuration. It will be similar to the Aegis At-Sea BMD capability inherent in the DDG-113 series of the Arleigh Burke Class Destroyers to facilitate training and logistical support by the lead service Navy. Aegis Ashore essentially re-hosts the required BMD components of a Navy Destroyer in an ashore configuration to include: SPY Radar; Vertical Launch System Computing Infrastructure; Command Control; Communications; Computers and Intelligence (C4I) Systems and Operator Consoles.  Aegis Ashore will provide sophisticated engagement strategies and can adapt to threat updates while also being deployed/redeployed worldwide where needed to provide persistent coverage for the Geographic Combatant Commanders.  The initial Aegis Ashore Missile Defense System (AAMDS) will be deployed to Romania in FY 2015. A second AAMDS will be deployed to Poland in FY 2018 as part of the European Phased Adaptive Approach.   MDA will use procurement funds to purchase and install AAMDS in Poland (0208866C MD73).Missile Defense Agency (MDA) approved the acquisition strategy in FY 2010. MD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).","","Decrease in funding from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the completion of Aegis Ashore fielding in Romania. Future Aegis Ashore sites transition to Procurement as the life cycle of the program continues to evolve.","362","","",

The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the Department of Defense’s “Testing in a Joint Environment Roadmap” to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to “test like we fight.”  JMETC provides a persistent distributed test and evaluation (T&E) capability; supporting system development interoperability testing and cyber testing; that otherwise would not be readily available to Service/Component acquisition programs.  The JMETC program is funded within the Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) Management Support Budget Activity because it is intended to provide test capability in support of RDT&E programs. By linking distributed facilities JMETC allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  This enables a customer-defined joint mission test environment for systems engineering and testing extensible to training and experimentation in a timely and cost effective manner.On October 1 2012 the Under Secretary Defense for Acquisition Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) directed Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) to take responsibility for operations and resources of the National Cyber Range (NCR).  TRMC undertook management oversight of the NCR including all operational activities and sustainment of resources transitioning it from a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Science & Technology project to an operational capability supporting cyber test experimentation and training events. The NCR mission is to provide secure facilities technology processes and workforce to rapidly create hi-fidelity mission representative cyberspace environments and facilitate integration/federation of cyberspace T&E infrastructure in support of the TRMC Mission.  In FY-14 the NCR demonstrated robust operational capability supporting 20 different events for a diverse set of customers including US Cyber Command Joint Staff J-7 Director Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) and US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). The NCR was critical to the successful execution of CyberFlag 14-1 CyberGuard 14-1 14-2 and 14-3 and just completed CyberFlag 15-1 in the 1QFY15. In 3QFY14 the NCR team executed the first Cybersecurity Developmental Test & Evaluation (DT&E) event supporting a Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) the MQ-4C Triton Program. In the 1QFY-15 the NCR executed a second MDAP Cybersecurity DT&E Event in support of the P-8A Increment Three. In FY-15 a Systems of Systems Cybersecurity DT&E Event will be conducted involving triton the P-8A and Tactical Mobile (TACMobile) Program. Additional events are planned in support of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) F-35 (Re-programming Center West) Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Mission Space (JMS) Program and other acquisition and operational customers. Concurrent with these NCR Events are engineering activities to sustain and upgrade NCR Computing Resources improve the automated software tool suite and improve operational capabilities to satisfy increasing customer demand.      The Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is the Department’s lead for the JMETC program the National Cyber Range and oversees both their development and operations.","","","","0.000","",

The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) establishes a capabilities-based adaptive near real-time readiness information system for the DoD. This system is being designed to measure the readiness of military forces and supporting infrastructure to meet missions and goals assigned by the Secretary of Defense. DRRS hosts information and applications used to support the Geographic and Functional Combatant Commanders.The transformation of readiness reporting into a new more comprehensive system presents a number of significant challenges. First there are thousands of new potential reporting entities to include in DRRS such as Combatant Commands Joint Task Forces Services Active and Reserve component units installations depots ports and major elements of the industrial base. These entities must not only define and implement reporting based on specific readiness metrics but they must make their readiness status continuously available in near real time to DRRS. Second the shift from resource centric readiness reporting to a mission/ capabilities based reporting system oriented towards the National Military Strategy (NMS) makes substantially more complex demands on readiness reporting. DRRS allows the Department to assess readiness globally based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements. Finally the challenges associated with sourcing and evaluating the readiness of our forces engaged in on-going real operations mean that force managers need applications that will query the entire Department for suitable available organizations to meet current needs. The need for these applications and the underlying data are a top priority for the DRRS project.The realization of DRRS requires integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that supports distributed collaborative and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment. The primary technical goal is the creation of a highly reliable and securely integrated readiness data environment to leverage and extend current readiness information systems. This system is based on intelligent agents dynamic databases semantic middleware and publish/subscribe concepts; providing a logically uniform view into the multiple databases and information sources that feed DRRS. Through this type of advanced information environment the DRRS dramatically expands the range of readiness information available to manage the force. This environment supports a suite of analysis tools that allow users to explore the consequences of readiness deficiencies in terms of the ability to generate forces and assess transportation feasibility as it pertains to specific scenarios. These tools and tool suites harness the power of the information environment to make possible the kind of quick-turnaround excursion-driven readiness assessment that is at the heart of DRRS.","","","","","",

In accordance with the President’s Management Agenda (PMA) DoD’s Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) “Six Areas of Focus” and the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) DCMA is seeking to adapt reshape and rebalance to prepare for the strategic challenges and opportunities we face in the years ahead.  As the independent eyes and ears of the DoD national and international partners DCMA is continually delivering actionable acquisition insight.  Adherence to Better Buying Power (BBP) 2.0 initiatives such as controlling costs throughout the product lifecycle incentivizing productivity and improving tradecraft in acquisition of services are ensuring affordability and increasing productivity.  Application of improved supply chain management directives and superior price-costing strategies will eliminate requirements imposed on industry where costs outweigh benefits.  The intent is to work with industry to collect data that will enable the Department to identify requirements that can be reduced or eliminated to reduce cost without adversely affecting performance.  Better understanding of the commercial sector will allow the Agency to properly exploit its benefits while protecting government interests.  Furthermore we are invigorating our efforts to adjust to the changing environment through achieving and sustaining audit readiness creating an agile and flexible learning organization/culture to support future customer programs initiating and strengthening acquisition processes and optimizing mission execution to support the acquisition enterprise through agile business practices.  DCMA’s mission is to provide Contract Administration Services (CAS) to the Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisition Enterprise and its partners to ensure delivery of quality products and services to the warfighter; on time and on cost. DCMA has two primary objectives 1) providing CAS to the military services and other authorized customers worldwide and 2) providing contingency contract support in theater.  The Agency has worldwide acquisition impact through three Field Directorates (Operations International and Special Programs). The Agency's Field Directorates are regionally based. The Agency's civilian and military personnel manages over 20063 contractors and approximately 348000 active contracts.  DCMA is executing a strategy to modernize and consolidate all web-based applications in concert with a new Enterprise Architecture framework that adheres strictly to the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA). Investing in newer modern technologies that utilize business process driven frameworks will greatly improve not only the quality of the DCMA contract information but allow DCMA to realize internal process efficiencies. The web-based capabilities support DCMA's unique mission and provide cross functional capabilities that support the full range of acquisition and contract management. These capabilities help DCMA acquisition workforce access real time data; thus enabling them to make sound contract management and business decisions. The objective behind web-based capabilities is to provide mission-effective and efficient solutions to unique sets of problems that slow down or hinder performance based contract management for DCMA and other DoD support components. FY 2014 Actual:  In FY 2014 ($13.812)  DCMA reengineered some of DCMA’s Contract Administration and Line of Service business processes and the toolsets that provide these capabilities. We streamlinedd business processes and consolidated toolsets that enable those capabilities to reduce operations and sustainment costs for the Department and where applicable for DCMA.  FY 2015-2016 Plan:  In FY 2015 ($12.530) and FY 2016 ($12.542) DCMA is planning to capitalize on Information Technology (IT) investment innovations that leverage technology to achieve an agile enterprise architecture that equips the Agency with enhanced IT solutions for mission support operations and gives Agency decision-makers better data to compare options provide ready analytic solutions allocate resources and improve processes.","","","","","",

The DMR AN/USC-61(C) is the first software defined radio to have become a communications system standard for the U.S. Military. The compact multi-channel DMR provides multiple waveforms and multi-level information security for voice and data communications. DMR radios currently operate aboard U.S. Navy surface and subsurface vessels fixed-sites and other Department of Defense communication platforms using frequencies ranging from 2 MHz to 2 GHz. Certified to pass secure voice and data at Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) over High Frequency (HF) Very High Frequency (VHF) Ultra High Frequency (UHF) and Satellite Communications (SATCOM) channels the DMR system was developed to the U.S. Navy's specifications and meets all the stringent environmental Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and performance requirements for use in the U.S. Fleet. This task is to continue the development/integration of the IW and MUOS waveforms for the DMR in accordance with Military Standards 188-18123 and the High Frequency Distribution Amplifier Group (HFDAG). IW uses a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) communication system in an attempt to improve satellite bandwidth utilization over legacy SATCOM waveforms. This enables demand assigned services on UHF SATCOM networks to support new applications that require better performance and higher channel throughput. The MUOS waveform will enable MUOS satellites to provide worldwide communication satellite coverage for DoD requirements. MUOS will provide functionality comparable to commercial mobile phone systems. HFDAG is a follow-on HF solution to fulfill the HF communication capability from 2MHz - 30MHz (transmit) and 2MHz - 30MHz (receive) with ALE Link 11 FSK USB LSB and ISB modes of operation for Navy Modernization Process (NMP) and platforms.

NECC will develop and deploy adaptive force packages (AFPs) tailored for the specific missions to achieve greater efficiency and combat readiness. NECC units have a number of current and future Command Control Communications Computers & Intelligence (C4I) technological requirements for Tactical/Command Operations Center vehicles craft personnel capabilities and SATCOM availability. Each NECC operation requires units to maintain effective command and control develop and display a tactical picture and share intelligence and current operational information with higher adjacent and subordinate headquarters. These capabilities must be interoperable with higher and adjacent echelons of command (to include coalition allies) as well as with supporting elements to include joint forces. Small Medium and/or Large Scale Communication Systems (LSCS) are the C4I hub for the NECC Forces. LSCS suites are interoperable with joint systems and include communications HF VHF and UHF in all common modes with encrypted and clear voice and data to include Tactical Data Link Network capability. The future of large scale communications assets such as Mobile Ashore Support Terminal (MAST) Ruggedized Deployable Satellite/Tactical Data Network (RDSAT/TDN) and Deployable Expeditionary Network-Medium (DEXNet-M) supporting Surveillance Control Central Expeditionary (ESCC) formerly Radar Sonar Surveillance Center (RSSC) will be converging to a common baseline the Navy Enterprise Tactical Command and Control (NETC2). Next generation air surface and subsurface surveillance systems as well as enhanced C4I capabilities are required to meet operational objectives. Future technologies are being evaluated as enabling capabilities to expand situational awareness providing additional tactical decision aids to the local area commander. Future C4I research and development efforts will be identified within NECC's strategic Expeditionary Warfare Improvement Program (EXWIP) Integrated Priority Capability List (IPCL) priorities to increase agility mobility and network security posture. Additional efforts will be driven by greater DoD initiatives such as Joint Information Environment (JIE) Inc II in order to maintain interoperability and drive down DoN enterprise costs.The Expeditionary Warfare Decision System (EWDS) (formerly Tactically Integrated Sensors (TIS)) software constitutes an upgrade to the MAST-RSSC and is being executed as a separate Abbreviated Acquisition Program. The AAP will enable the deployment of a currently fielded Program of Record (POR) combat system (AN/SQQ-34C) known as Tactically Integrated Sensors (TIS) to the CRF units. TIS system restores the acoustic surveillance capability that has been eroded from the current RSSC suite. Additionally future mult-spectal technologies are being looked at as enabling capabilities to expand the situational awareness of the littoral region providing additional tactical decision aids to the local area commander.This funding supports the Identity Dominance System (IDS) as key enabler in support of the Joint Personnel Identity (JPI) program. OPNAV N957 conducted the NCW CBA and MES ICD. MESF forces have a mobile security mission that requires methodologies procedures equipment and the communications capacity to identify individuals who represent a potential threat as a means to deter and eliminate individuals from conducting asymmetric/non-traditional attacks upon friendly forces high value assets and coastal areas that NCW is charged with protecting. The Vessel Boarding Search and Seizure (VBSS) teams conducting Expanded Maritime Interception Operations also have a similar requirement to identify individuals. The development of a device to support identity functions is captured in the Identity Dominance System Capability Development Document (IDS CDD). IDS will be used in the following environments: aboard ship and ashore in ports the littorals and extended inland field environments worldwide. IDS will be employed in maritime and very austere ashore environments and carried by individuals who are part of ship boarding parties and dismounted patrols. These mission and environmental demands dictate a portable lightweight rugged and reliable system with intuitive and user friendly features. IDS biometric modalities may differ by mission profile requiring the authoritative response to the On-Scene Commander/Boarding Officer on whether to detain or further investigate an individual of interest.Coastal Riverine Force will integrate and employ a variety of surface and air assets special vehicles weapons and appropriately trained personnel. Mission assets needed to support the operational capabilities will vary widely dependant on the Host Nations involved. The Riverine Squadron will deploy with inherent but limited force protection capabilities. The Modular Unmanned Scouting Craft Littoral (MUSCL) is man-portable "X-Class" Unmanned Surface Vehicle providing enhanced surveillance and reconnaissance capability to Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) Riverine forces.This program provides efforts in support of the Navy Expeditionary Warfare Division (formerly known as Navy Irregular Warfare (IW) Office).  It provides for the identification and assessment of available technologies to confront expeditionary challenges including irregular warfare urgent/emergent and unfulfilled needs of the warfighter.  It provides for the validation and combat demonstration of identified technologies and/or packages of technologies to meet Oversea Contingency Operation (OCO) goals.  It also provides funding necessary to attract additional investment and sustainment of demonstrated capabilities.  The goal of the Navy Expeditionary Warfare Innovations Branch office is to: identify those requirements necessary to meet the immediate warfighter needs; integrate those existing unique and/or related capabilities that can best meet those warfighter needs; test those integrated capabilities; and then demonstrate in real time and/or during planned deployments all within an 8 month period. Combatant Craft Replacements will provide second generation Riverine Multi Mission Craft that will replace in-service Riverine Patrol Boats (RPBs) and Riverine Assault Boats (RABs).  Combatant Craft replacements will: conduct inland waterway patrol and interdiction to preserve the rivers for friendly use as lines of communications; deny the use of rivers and waterways to waterborne and immediate shore sited hostile forces by barrier and interdiction operations;  and with augmentation of ground and air forces locate and destroy hostile forces within a riparian area.

Analysis and demonstration have established that surface SSD based on single-sensor detection point-to-point control architecture is inadequate against current and projected Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats.  The supersonic seaskimming ASCM reduces the effective battle space to the horizon and the available reaction time-line to less than 30 seconds from first opportunity to detect until the ASCM impacts its target ship.  Against such a threat multi-sensor integration is required for effective detection and parallel processing is essential to reduce reaction time to acceptable levels and to provide vital coordination/integration of hardkill and softkill assets. These SSD projects address and coordinate the detection and control functions necessary to meet the rigorous SSD requirements. Quick Reaction Combat Capability (QRCC PU2178): This project provides multi-sensor integration parallel processing and the coordination of hard-kill / soft-kill capabilities in an automated doctrine-based response to the ASCM threats and are the cornerstones of SSDS being developed through QRCC (PU 2178) efforts. In addition this project provides for the central system engineering management for the integration of advanced sensor weapon and C4I upgrades and the test and certification of the Integrated Combat System (ICS). SSDS MK 2 Advance Capability Build (ACB)-16 was delayed 2 years due to the need to prioritize critical SSDS system improvements. ACB-16 was the designation for the next major SSDS baseline for the integration of new sensor weapon and C4I capabilities for anti-ship missile defense and strike group interoperability. As a result of the delay ACB-16 has been re-designated to ACB-20. The SSDS MK 2 ACB-12 capability baseline development test and fielding will continue as planned. However with the delay in development and fielding of ACB-16 an increased number of SSDS MK2 ships will receive ACB-12 capability baseline and specific fire control loop and interoperability improvements in lieu of ACB-16.SSDS Training Improvement Program (PU 3358): The SSDS Training Improvement project will provide enhancements and upgrades to the Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC) training components within the combat system to address needs for increased training capability and functionality in conjunction with SSDS MK2 Advanced Capability Builds (ACB)/Fire Control Loop Improvement Project (FCLIP)/ Far-Term Interoperability Improvement Project (FTIIP) and Technical Insertion efforts under PU 2178 (QRCC).  These enhancements will address current and future training requirements by implementing new functionality to enable the individual warfighter to engage in more complex training requirements and distributed battle group events to support fleet required training certification events. Capability Development and integration are related to Integrated Air and Missile Defense Underwater Surface and other warfare areas.  Capability enhancements and upgrades include development of re-useable common components that can be leveraged by AEGIS combat systems and/or integration of re-usable common components developed by the TSTC BFTT Program (PE 0204571/PU1427) and AEGIS TSTC Training Improvement program (PE 0604307/PU 3357)to meet SSDS integrated combat system training requirements.The Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) is the core combat system control element for the Quick Reaction Combat Capability (QRCC) in aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships.  SSDS integrates a diverse set of fire control loop sensors and weapons and C4I systems for each ship class (CVN68/78 LHA6 LHD1 LPD17 and LSD41/49).  SSDS MK2 provides the capabilities for integrated air and missile defense multi-warfare situational awareness combat direction and joint interoperability via the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) and Tactical Digital Information Link (TADIL)-J (Link 16).  SSDS MK2 is being fielded with the new construction carriers (CVN78 class) and amphibious ships (LHA6 LPD17 classes).  SSDS MK2 is replacing the Advanced Combat Direction System (ACDS) in the LHD1 class and SSDS MK1 in the LSD 41/49 class as fleet modernization initiatives.  In addition with the decision to replace the Dual Band Radar (DBR) for CVN 80 and L-Class Ships (LHA 8) with an Enterprise Surveillance Suite (ESS) consisting of a new radar (Enterprise Air Search Radar (EASR) and X-Band Illuminator) SSDS will require development of system and software changes.SSDS MK2 integrates new combat system war-fighting capabilities and improvements on a phased basis via ACB TI the Fire Control Loop Improvement Project (FCLIP) Far-Term Interoperability Improvement Project (FTIIP) and the Task Force Cyber Awakening (TFCA) Boundary Defense Capability (BDC) project and the development requirements imposed by integration of a DBR replacement radar onboard CVN 80 and L-Class (LHA). FTIIP is the second phase of the corrective action plan for the resolution of the strike group interoperability issues and TFCA BDC will provide Combat Systems-level and element-level cyber-security protection based on System of Systems (SoS) risk assessment. New hardware TI baselines are required every four years to refresh the Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) assemblies to sustain system production and to support the incorporation of new ACB capabilities.  Each individual ship is planned for a TI upgrade on an eight year interval to replace obsolescent COTS hardware and support the fielding of the war-fighting capabilities and improvements.Integrated Swimmer Defense (ISD PU3306) scope is to provide the Navy Expeditionary security forces with capabilities of a portable marine integrated swimmer defense system (ISDS) to engage combat swimmers/divers or unknown individuals underwater once they have been detected. There are no funds programmed for PU3306 in FY2016 and out; the program requirement has been cancelled.Non-Lethal Weapons (PU 3172) provides a long range laser warning and dazzle system vessel stopping system and combined effects (light laser and sound) system for use in the maritime environment.  Optical warning and distraction has been identified by the services as a possible technology solution to mitigate and/or address several known joint non-lethal capability gaps.","","","","","",

It includes Battle Force Tactical Network (BFTN) Joint Aerial Layer Network-Maritime (JALN-M) Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) and High Frequency Internet Protocol/Sub Network Relay.The Battle Force Tactical Network (BFTN) on each surface subsurface air or fixed US Navy platform utilizes previously installed/existing Line of Sight (LOS)/Extended Line of Sight (ELOS) radios (a.k.a. Radio Frequency (RF)) to create a secure gateway that inter-connects all users into a common RF Tactical Network (a.k.a. wireless). This Network separately supports US-Only and NATO Allied/Coalition users' tactical data information exchanges on each platform (node) between and/or across separately dispersed RF Networks even if Satellite Communications (SATCOM) channels to shore are lost during an Assured C2 and Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) event.Joint Aerial Layer Network-Maritime (JALN-M) is the Navy implementation of the JALN-M architecture which provides assured communications in any environment especially Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD). With disruption or loss of Space tier communications JALN-M establishes and/or restores connectivity with the High Capacity Backbone (HCB) tier the Distribution Access Range Extension (DARE) tier and the Transition tier in accordance with the JALN-M Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and the JALN-M Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Final Report. JALN-M is a robust assured communications capability providing joint connectivity via the HCB and Navy platform connectivity via a pseudo satellite DARE capability. JALN-M will use the Extended Data Rate (XDR) waveform (Navy Multiband Terminal (NMT)) for intra-battle group DARE communications a Common Data Link (CDL) waveform for the HCB cross-link capability and will leverage enhanced Ultra High Frequency/High Frequency (UHF/HF) waveforms for coalition connectivity. Furthermore Positioning Navigation and Timing (PNT) efforts related to the JALN-M Pod will develop a prototype PNT subsystem that will be integrated into the JALN-M Pod and will provide position and timing data to other Pod subsystems both with and without Global Positioning System (GPS) connectivity.  Because the Pod is being designed to operate in an A2/AD environment the Pod HCB and XDR (NMT) subsystems need to be provided with PNT data in the absence of GPS and the assured PNT subsystem will provide that data.ADNS is the method by which Tactical Navy units transfer Internet Protocol (IP) data to Navy and Department of Defense communities on the Global Information Grid (GIG). ADNS is the gateway to technical Wide Area Network (WAN) afloat for Internet Protocol network operations supporting information dissemination and external connectivity. ADNS allows services and applications to interconnect to the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) ashore via multiple Radio Frequency (RF) resources and pier connectivity.FY16 BFTN efforts will focus on the completion of the development of the engineering changes and resolve any developmental issues that are realized as part of the Integrated Test/Operational Test (IT/OT).FY16 efforts will focus on the continued design development integration and test of the Joint Aerial Layer Network-Maritime (JALN-M) end-to-end system.In FY 2016 ADNS RDT&E investment will continue to support Interface Design Development (IDD) and integration with network applications development of Line-Of-Sight (LOS) link DISN integration and development of Cipher-Text (CT) piers. Study efforts will continue with the intention of integrating ADNS into the JALN-M system. JALN-M is the Navy implementation that provides network connectivity in areas that have limited or denied Satellite Communications (SATCOM). Also in FY 2016 Post Implementation Review (PIR) will begin in support of INC III Submarines. ADNS system development will include addressing network management intra and inter domain routing Quality of Service (QoS) and Concept of Operations discussions. Two new efforts will commence using emerging technologies: 1) Network-Based Cyber Security and 2) Virtualization to increase performance of the Navy's ADNS routing and transport architecture.","","Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) - Prior to FY13 funding resides in PE 0204163N.

Project 0766 provides for Integrated Undersea Surveillance Systems (IUSS) Research and Development Projects under the Maritime Surveillance Systems (MSS) Program Office (PEO SUB PMS 485).  IUSS provides the Navy with its primary means of submarine detection both nuclear and diesel.  A portion of project 0766 (FSS) is classified with details available at a higher classification level. Project 0344 funds the Shallow Water Surveillance System (SWSS) project to develop and demonstrate the technology to enable autonomous installation of a passive acoustic array with processing and communications gear. The IUSS Research and Development project (0766) funds SURTASS Passive and SURTASS Low Frequency Active (LFA) developments.  SURTASS provides the mobile tactical arm of the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System providing long range detection and cueing for tactical weapons platforms against both diesel and nuclear powered submarines.  SURTASS LFA provides an active adjunct capability for IUSS passive and tactical sensors to assist in countering the quieter diesel and nuclear threats of the 1990s and beyond.  The LFA tasks are directed at detection of slow quiet threats in harsh littoral waters.In order to continue with reductions in life cycle costs and continue with system-wide consolidation a short-term goal is to develop a common IUSS processor based on NAVSEA's Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (ARCI) program with a cyclical tech refresh of hardware and software in conjunction with the submarine Advanced Processor Build (APB) process.  The IUSS Integrated Common Processor (ICP) has the capability to process and display data from all fixed and mobile underwater systems.  The IUSS ICP will be used for all new system installations and replace the legacy systems as they reach end of life and require upgrading.  Additionally SURTASS has consolidated on the TB-29A Twin-line array a variant of the Submarine TB-29A Long line array.  This reduced the number of array variants employed by SURTASS from 3 to 1 and enabled development and logistics cost savings by leveraging off the submarine TB-29A program.The Shallow Water Surveillance System (SWSS) project (0344) funds the development and demonstration of the Version 1 system with technology to enable autonomous classification and reporting of specific submarine targets of interest.","","","","","",

Opportunities occur when a sufficiently mature technology is identified that can meet a particular need on a timetable which matches that of an acquisition program and is supported by a business case which justifies the associated cost and schedule risk. The combination of circumstances which create such opportunities can appear and disappear well inside the Program Objectives Memorandum (POM) cycle. This program is designed to be proactive in identifying opportunities and to work with resource sponsors fleet and force users and Program Managers (PMs) in constructing viable technology transition deals one at a time. To ensure the widest possible awareness of emergent commercial technology opportunities this program interacts with the industry and coordinates closely with Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) to maintain awareness of insertion opportunities. Utilizing existing authorities TIPS applies execution year funds where necessary to "jump-start" transitions so they can be inserted and validated leading directly to deployment and/or demonstrations of high risk/high payoff technologies. This Program Element is the only Navy program that addresses current opportunities to reduce operations and support (O&S) cost drivers within a 18-24 month period. As such planning and initiation are accomplished within the same fiscal year which causes a non-traditional financial execution profile for the program. The program therefore does not meet traditional expenditure benchmarks for the first year of execution but rapidly recovers in the second year.Funding increases to TIPS reflect emphasis on increasing the number of projects that reduce operations and support costs since the number of projects funded is directly proportional to the cost benefits provided to DoN and demand continues to grow as operations and sustainment budgets experience increased downward pressure.The RDD program provides for the rapid development and fielding of prototype solutions to meet urgent operational needs. The RDD process applies when existing DON processes cannot meet urgent operational needs. Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) have generated rapidly evolving military needs that require responsive materiel solutions.","","","","","",

The popular name Triton was approved for the MQ-4C UAS in June 2012 designating the RQ-4 Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) UAS as the MQ-4C Triton. The MQ-4C Triton is a high altitude-long endurance UAS designed to provide Fleet and combatant commanders with persistent maritime Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) of nearly all the world's high-density sea-lanes littorals and areas of national interest. Teamed with its manned-capability counterpart the P-8A Triton will be a key component of the Navy's family of systems to achieve maritime domain awareness.  MQ-4C Triton will seek to leverage Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force manpower training and maintenance efficiencies.The MQ-4C Triton features sensors designed to provide near worldwide coverage through a network of five orbits inside and outside continental United States with sufficient air vehicles to remain airborne for 24 hours a day 7 days a week out to ranges of 2000 nautical miles. Onboard sensors will provide detection classification tracking and identification of maritime targets and include maritime radar electro-optical/infra-red and Electronic Support Measures systems. Additionally the MQ-4C will have a communications relay capability designed to link dispersed forces in the theater of operations and serve as a node in the Navy's FORCEnet strategy. Tactical-level data analysis will occur in real-time at shore-based mission control sites connected to the air vehicle via satellite communications. Further intelligence exploitation can be conducted at Fleet shore-based sites or aboard aircraft carriers and other ships.The MQ-4C Triton UAS will implement phased capability upgrades within the ongoing acquisition program to pace capability with rapidly evolving technologies and threats to ensure the Navy maintains persistent ISR dominance through the system's lifecycle and to support the OPNAV N2/N6 Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance and Targeting  transition plan.  System upgrades will include Multi-Intelligence capabilities Counter Electronic Attack upgrades a more robust electronic support capability and continue improvements to baseline mission system payloads.  MQ-4C will play a significant role in the Sea Shield and FORCEnet pillars of Sea Power 21. In its Sea Shield role the system will rely on its key attribute of persistence to provide the supported combatant command or fleet commander with unparalleled situational awareness of the maritime battle space as it develops and sustains the common operational tactical picture. The system will also serve as a Fleet response plan enabler while acting as a trip wire for intelligence preparation of the environment. Additionally Triton Unmanned Air System will be a FORCEnet enabler and relay platform directly connected to both the Global Information Grid and the Distributed Common Ground System-Navy information backbone.","","MQ-4C Triton RDTE funding for modernization has been segregated into a new program element (from PE 0305220N to PE 0305421N) in order to satisfy Congressional direction for increased transparency.  In the FY2015 Appropriations Act Congress limited the amount of FY2015 funding in the modernization line (PE 0305421N) to $5M until a review of the capability development document is completed by the Joint Requirements Oversights Council (JROC).  In concert with completion of the JROC review the Navy will request a reprogramming from Congress to move the remaining required FY15 funding from PE 0305220N into PE 0305421N in order to maintain the Triton Multi-Intelligence phased capability upgrade schedule.","373","","",

The NMT system provides an increase in single service capability from 1.5 Megabits per second (Mbps) to 8 Mbps increases the number of coverage areas and retains Anti-Jam/Low Probability of Intercept (AJ/LPI) protection characteristics.  It is compatible with today's Navy Low Data Rate/Medium Data Rate (LDR/MDR) terminals and will sustain the Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) architecture by providing connectivity across the spectrum of mission areas to include land air and naval warfare special operations strategic nuclear operations strategic defense theater missile defense and space operations and intelligence in support of A2AD initiatives.  The NMT system will replenish and improve on Navy terminal capabilities of the Military Strategic Tactical & Relay System (MILSTAR) Defense Satellite Communications System  (DSCS) Wideband Global Satellite (WGS) and Global Broadcast System (GBS).  The new system will equip the warfighters with the assured jam resistant secure communications as described in the joint AEHF satellite communications system and WGS Operational Requirements Documents (ORD).  The NMT will provide multiband Satellite Communications (SATCOM) capability for ship submarine and shore platforms.The Joint Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) Network Integrated Control System (JMINI CS) is a legacy system that commenced in 1998. JMINI CS is a Navy-led Joint-interest program providing integrated dynamic and centralized control of non-processed UHF MILSATCOM 5/25 kHz Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) and Demand Assigned Single Access (DASA) channels to maximize existing highly sought after SATCOM resources.  The system also provides decentralized web-based management of those resources for use as a situational awareness tool for Combatant Commanders Global SATCOM Support Centers and Regional SATCOM Support Centers.  The system is expected to operate well beyond the original 2015 End of Life (EoL) date to 2033.  The JMINI CS Program will perform concept development and exploration  to identify  cost-effective solutions to address multiple life cycle support issues in order to minimize loss of service to the fleet.  The effort will involve evaluation development laboratory and integration testing of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) hardware and software to replace obsolete components or subsystems while maintaining interoperability with existing systems. Maritime Integrated Broadcast Service (MIBS)  (formerly Tactical Data Information Exchange Subsystem Broadcast (TADIXS-B)) Program Charter is to deliver Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) data to operational and tactical decision makers aboard United States Navy ships shore headquarters and other joint platforms.  It will provide means to disseminate organically derived data from Navy platforms to other  tactical operational and strategic users in theatre. MIBS provides the Navy a capability to deliver near real time data enhancing the Common Operational Picture (COP) to support operations in all warfare areas including: Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) Anti-Surface Warfare (ASW) Undersea Warfare (USW) Electronic Warfare (EW). The program encompasses Navy IBS systems (Joint Tactical Terminal - Maritime (JTT-M)).  These systems will provide the Navy and other joint platforms with a coherent approach to fielding maritime IBS systems that takes advantage of all available pathways and services. The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) program provides for the development of the next generation Department of Defense (DoD) advanced narrowband communications satellite constellation. The current Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) Follow-On (UFO) constellation is projected to degrade below acceptable availability parameters in 2015.

The Department certified a restructured program to Congress on 16 June 2014.  The restructured program that was certified includes MQ-8B air vehicles procured under the original program of record MQ-8C air vehicles procured under the Department of the Navy's Rapid Deployment Capability (RDC) procurement process and an additional 21 MQ-8C air vehicles to be procured to complete the program Fleet requirements of 70 air vehicles (61 procurement and 9 RDT&E) and associated Mission Control Stations (MCS) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Common Automatic Recovery Systems (UCARS) and support equipment.  The restructured program also includes the endurance upgrade radar and weapons capabilities such as those developed under the Navy's RDC authorities.  All acquisition actions previously planned under the RDCs have transitioned into the restructured program of record.  The MQ-8B based system had an approved Milestone C (MS C) in May 2007.  The Nunn-McCurdy certification process revoked the MS C approval.  MS C for the restructured MQ-8 program is currently scheduled in the 2QFY16.  The MQ-8 Fire Scout provides real-time and non-real-time Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) data to tactical users without the use of manned aircraft or reliance on limited joint theater or national assets. The baseline MQ-8 can accomplish missions including over-the-horizon tactical reconnaissance classification targeting and laser designation and battle management (including voice communication relay). The MQ-8 Fire Scout launches and recovers vertically and can operate from any suitably equipped air capable ship as well as area land bases.  Interoperability is achieved through the use of the Tactical Control System (TCS) software integrated into the Mission Control Station (MCS) (also referred to as Ground Control Station (GCS)) and through the use of the Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL).  The data from the MQ-8 will be provided through standard DoD Command Control Communications Computers and ISR system architectures and protocols.A deployed MQ-8 System is comprised of:  air vehicle(s) payloads (i.e. electro-optical/infra-red/laser designator-range finder Automated Identification System communications relay radar weapons and other specialty payloads) MCS (with TCS and TCDL integrated for interoperability) a UCARS for automatic launch and recovery and associated spares and support equipment.  A limited number of land-based mission control stations supplement the shipboard systems to support shore-based operations such as pre-deployment or acceptance functional check flights. These land-based mission control stations will also support depot-level maintenance/post-maintenance activities.The MQ-8C provides additional mission endurance and payload-weight-power increased reliability and improved maintainability to the MQ-8 Fire Scout System.  The MQ-8C is a more cost efficient and capable air vehicle that meets the requirements of the updated Fire Scout Capability Production Document.  The Navy plans to procure 40 MQ-8C air vehicles to support the Navy's fleet of small surface combatant suitably equipped air capable ships including the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). This budget transitions the MQ-8C Endurance Upgrade Radar and Weapons capabilities into the Program of Record.","","","253","","",

SBIRS EMD:  The Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) primary mission is to provide initial warning of a ballistic missile attack on the US its deployed forces and its allies. SBIRS enhances detection and improve reporting of intercontinental ballistic missile launches submarine launched ballistic missile launches and tactical ballistic missile launches. SBIRS supports Missile Defense Battlespace Awareness and Technical Intelligence missions by providing reliable accurate and timely data to Unified Combatant Commanders Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders the intelligence community and other users. SBIRS provides increased detection and tracking performance over legacy systems in order to meet requirements in Air Force Space Command's (AFSPC) Operational Requirements Document (ORD). The SBIRS system includes both space and ground elements. The space segment consists of Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites payloads hosted on satellites in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) and Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites. The ground segment consists of both fixed and mobile data processing elements communications infrastructure and relay ground stations serving all SBIRS space elements. The HEO-1 and HEO-2 payloads are on-orbit and certified for Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) missile warning operations and technical intelligence operations. The GEO-1 and GEO-2 satellites have completed AFSPC and USSTRATCOM operational acceptance.  GEO-1 received ITW/AA certification in August 2013. The GEO-2 satellite received ITW/AA certification in December 2013. These payloads provide a rich data set for exploitation. The program of record ground segment development exploits both the new scanner and starer sensor data through software processing and builds user messages for missile warning and missile defense. Also data exploitation efforts enable access to raw and processed data to expand capabilities for battlespace awareness and other applications.  FY17 and FY18 funds support ground segment development.  The baseline requirement document is the 1996 SBIRS ORD. Enterprise systems engineering and integration (SE&I) provides intra- and inter-program requirements development enterprise master planning validation and verification specialty engineering and architecture development. 2. SMI:  Future SBIRS Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) satellites will be procured using the Department of Defense (DOD) Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) concept.  ESP is an approach which seeks stable production and efficient sub-contractor product management through the block buy of two space vehicles at one time (please see SBIRS P-40 Exhibit). A portion of the savings realized from ESP block buys are programmed for investment into OPIR Space Modernization Initiative (SMI); the current OPIR SMI project was established in this manner in the FY12 President's Budget.  The primary objective of SMI is to enable and inform future decisions to maintain and evolve a capable resilient and affordable OPIR architecture by maturing technologies and mitigating risk areas to facilitate OPIR modernization within the Department's constrained resources. SMI supports the Program of Record (PoR) by assessing future parts and material obsolescence and designing future space and ground modifications focused on affordability and capability while simultaneously maximizing the effectiveness of existing system data products. SMI funds engineering activities to reduce both production and future system costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements and through technology insertion. SMI will also mature potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for future space and ground architecture affordability and capability enhancements.  The SBIRS OPIR SMI plan includes studies and risk reduction activities to evolve the current PoR SBIRS GEO satellites reduce production timelines and reduce recurring production costs. SMI funded data exploitation efforts include OPIR mission data processing data fusion data dissemination algorithm development network connectivity efficient interfaces and sensor performance assessments to enable greater exploitation of SBIRS PoR and other data sources. SMI exploitation efforts build upon PoR capabilities and inform the PoR decision process. The data exploitation efforts identify affordable responsive and resilient measures to improve technical intelligence and battlespace awareness processing and data dissemination tools to enhance OPIR support to the warfighters and other data users. The SMI Hosted Payloads and Wide Field of View (WFOV) Testbed activities explore technology maturation qualification of new components and subsystem/component prototyping to evolve the OPIR architecture. Hosted Payloads and WFOV Testbeds support maturation of mission data processing algorithms for tactical and strategic applications which are critical demonstration efforts to enhance PoR capabilities and to reduce program risks for future OPIR systems whether new systems or evolutions of the PoR.  Collection of on-orbit WFOV data is critical to develop algorithms to process large data sets generated by emerging large format focal planes and to reduce risk for possible SBIRS follow-on architectures.  SMI activities are balanced and phased to enable an expanded tradespace and improve the competitive environment.   3. Evolved SBIRS Follow-on: The SBIRS Follow-On AoA and knowledge gained from the SBIRS SMI projects will inform a future Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) decision for the Evolved SBIRS effort.  DAB alternatives are expected to include: 1) continued production of SBIRS PoR design; 2) an evolved satellite and ground system derived from the SBIRS POR designs; 3) an evolved satellite and ground system that includes a combination of PoR derivatives and new systems; or 4) an alternative architecture (potentially disaggregated).  The Evolved SBIRS effort will implement the DAB directed program alternative. The Evolved SBIRS AoA will consider the requirement for global coverage in the post-GEO-6 and post-HEO-4 timeframe.This program is in Budget Activity 5 System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production.","","Prior Years: Total Program Element above includes $39.831M for BPAC 65A040 Commercially Hosted Payload funded in FY11 and FY12.MDAP PNO 210 includes only BPAC 653616 SBIRS High EMD.","210","0.000","39.831",

The Joint Capability Document (JCD) for CID BFT (Blue Force Tracking) operational documents lessons learned and NATO requirements state the need for positive CID.  High confidence CID increases combat effectiveness prevents fratricide and reduces collateral damage.  It also enables combatant commanders to effectively command and control their forces in all weather day or night.  This program element focuses on the cooperative and non-cooperative technologies that have the capability to positively identify surface and air targets in both air-to-surface and air-to-air engagements.  In order to rapidly make available promising CID technologies for platform EMD decisions the program element funds design studies engineering analysis and other efforts associated with demonstration of prototype CID related technologies and subsystems on platforms.  It also supports the development testing and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint Allied and coalition interoperability.  Non-cooperative CID employs a number of sensing technologies and signal processing techniques.  The observations may be compared to a database of known objects to identify surface or air threats from air platforms.  These technologies include: (1) Laser Vision an Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) imaging system that significantly increases ID ranges;(2) Radar Vision an air-to-ground radar imaging technique to identify stationary and moving targets using their radar signatures; including passive techniques and electronic warfare identification technologies; (3) Hydra Vision a balanced (robust) amalgamation of sensor data from multiple sources to provide warfighters with higher confidence CID results on surface or air targets potentially including fusion with intelligence sources identification of non-traditional targets fusion to counter camouflage concealment and deception (CCD) and multi-phenomenology features for sustainable databases; (4) Compact ATR (Aided Target Recognition) and Sustainable Environments (CASE) a CID approach that focuses on tailoring algorithms to utilize smaller more efficient databases that are faster and less expensive to generate and maintain; and (5) X-Patch a validated set of prediction codes and analysis tools that predicts realistic far-field radar signatures from 3-D (3 dimensional) target models in order to predict 1D and/or 2D data. (6) A new program called Radio ID (RID) will develop methods for utilizing advances in radio technologies such as software defined radios to provide a low cost ID solutions for situational awareness and fratricide prevention potentially fusing non cooperative techniques and cooperative technologies. Cooperative CID employs technologies required to rapidly identify friendly platforms.  The program develops integrates and evaluates technologies that provide AF platforms with a means of positively identifying an air or ground platform as a friendly via active or passive cooperative ID capabilities.  Development funded by this program element ensures availability of Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) as well as Mode 5 IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) upgrade path for implementing ground and air platforms across the Air Force fleet. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. Fund Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon Systems Identification Friend or Foe Mark XIIA System (AIMS)Program Office test engineers.  The DoD International AIMS PO has system level interoperability testing and certification responsibilities for the present Mark XII system development and integration of Mark XIIA (Mode 5) and transition to Mark XIIA Mode S systems.  AIMS PO will continue to test and certify IFF equipment for the services now as long as IFF is used for combat identification.This program is in Budget Activity 4 Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.The FY2016 funding request was reduced by $2.981 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances.","","In FY 2016 Project 642597 Non-cooperative Identification Subsystems includes new start efforts for Radio ID (RID).","","0.000","",

This funding supports the development of RQ-4 aircraft payloads ground and support segments.  The Block 20/30/40 RQ-4B RPA is the successor to the Block 10 RQ-4A and is designed to employ 3000 pounds of payload and enable Multi-Intelligence (multi-INT) collecting.  Block 30 (Project Number 675145) employs upgraded Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors known as the Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS) and the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) sensor. Activities include mission planning development and testing enhanced weather capability development and testing airspace and interoperability enhancements and updates airframe upgrades sensor upgrades risk reduction and integration ice protection system development and testing and resolution of issues with Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS).   The Block 40 (Project Number 675146) employs the MP-RTIP radar sensor. In FY15 and beyond this includes the Block 40 costs for the development of enhanced weather capability development and testing maritime mode utilization mission planning development and testing airspace integration activities including Mode 5 Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) ice protection system development and testing airframe and sensor enhancements to the Block 40 fleet.The Ground Segment Modernization (GSM)/Communication System Modernization (CSM) Project Number 675147 includes the GSM project CSM project and the Next Generation Communication System. The ground segment currently includes the Mission Control Element (MCE) the Launch and Recovery Element (LRE) and the networking resources required to simultaneously disseminate intelligence while remaining compliant with Department of Defense (DoD) cybersecurity network requirements to operate on the Global Information Grid. As a result of the reinstatement of the Block 30s in the FY15 PB the requirement for ground stations operations significantly increased which increased the need for efforts to address DMS issues.  The GSM project will initiate in FY16 in support of a 20 year operational lifecycle and will comprise an approach that combines the functionality of legacy MCEs and LREs into a single building-based configuration.  The CSM project will provide enhancements across the RQ-4 communication network.When judged feasible and affordable this program will participate in the development testing and implementation of international standards to enhance joint allied and coalition interoperability. Studies and activities may be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aeriel System (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS).  GSM and CSM will incorporate UCI and UCS standards. The RQ-4 program will maintain and upgrade interoperability for Blocks 20/30/40 with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms such as  the U.S. Navy's Triton other RPA weapon systems and Processing Exploitation & Dissemination (PED) elements.  The networking capability for intelligence dissemination is required to provide the data transport interface between the Weapons System Operations Centers and external Intelligence Community customers.C-ABSAA: C-ABSAA is an analysis and developmental effort in the pre-Material Development Decision phase of the acquisition lifecycle which supports emerging warfighter requirements to fully integrate Group 4-5 RPA into the National Airspace System (NAS) international airspace other nations' sovereign airspace and operational combat airspace to conduct the entire range of military operations across all mission environments.  C-ABSAA also supports the "Worldwide Operations" Key Performance Parameter (KPP) in larger RPA requirement documents and Public Law 112-239 directing DoD collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Air and Space Administration (NASA) to safely integrate RPA in the NAS.  Funding in this project supports the development of a Sense and Avoid (SAA) capability set for Group 4-5 RPA and covers analysis research and developmental activities as well as infrastructure and other government costs.  Activities included support to the development of warfighter requirements and analysis of possible solution alternatives the collaboration with the FAA NASA and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to develop national policy and standards and SAA related studies analysis modeling and simulation program planning and project execution.  RPA platform specific integration and testing is not included.In FY16 Project 675148 C-ABSAA transferred to PE 0305206F Airborne Reconnaissance Systems Project 675148 C-ABSAA in order to provide greater visibility into this capability and prepare for expanded applications.MP-RTIP:The MP-RTIP sensor was designed as a family of modular scalable sensors to provide next generation capabilities to support sustainable network centric operations with integrated Command and Control Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) capability. MP-RTIP provides the RQ-4 Block 40 aircraft with advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Moving Target Indicator (MTI) sensor capabilities.This project (67RTIP) includes all MP-RTIP design development test and integration efforts for the RQ-4 Block 40 platform. Integration activities include platform integration of the MP-RTIP sensor and sustainment logistics planning support. MP-RTIP studies and development insertion include the implementation of Maritime Modes (MM) High Range Resolution (HRR) modes electronic protection technical refresh product improvements and other advanced capabilities.  Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and future modes development based on user requirements.Per direction of USD(AT&L) the RQ-4 program was restructured from the original project 675144 (Baseline) into multiple projects: (1) Block 30 (2) Block 40 (3) GroundSegment/Communications System and (4) C-ABSAA. Prior year funds in the amount of $2031.377M were accounted for in project 675144.In FY 2016 and beyond the RQ-4 Block 30 project 675145 includes budget necessary for systems engineering/program management test and evaluation management services and fielding support for projects 675145 675146 (Block 40) and 675147 (Ground Segment/Comm System). This reflects contracting/acquisition strategy for these common elements within the Global Hawk program. Projects 675148 (C-ABSAA) and 67RTIP (Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP)) reflect separate costs as they are separately managed/supported programs.The Cost to Complete and Total Cost for Major Defense Acquistion Program (MDAP) projects in this program element are documented in the R3. Total Cost on the R2 is not reflective of the total cost for MDAP projects since the R2 does not account for prior years funding for in project 675144.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","In FY 2016  PE 0305220F RQ-4 Project 675148 Common-Airborne Sense & Avoid (C-ABSAA) transferred to PE 0305206F Airborne Reconnaissance Systems Project 675148.

The DCGS Family of Systems including AF DCGS was directed to migrate to a net-centric DoD Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) enterprise enabling the Services to operate and share intelligence products more effectively in a joint environment.  All Services must pursue a common path based on a set of common enterprise services consistent with the Department's net-centric vision while maintaining flexibility to support the full range of warfighter missions.  Specifically DoD charged the Air Force to lead the development upgrade integration and test of common DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) enterprise services.  The DIB is a set of enterprise standards and services that enable interoperability and component reuse.  All the military services are mandated to incorporate DIB interoperability standards and commit to DIB architecture as the migration path to common DCGS enterprise services. The Distributed Common Ground Systems-Imagery (DCGS-I) Testbed is an integration and test environment used by the Services and Agency DCGS program offices to conduct integration of DCGS components and test interoperability interfaces with new sensors applications and net-centric operations. This testbed also supports the integration and testing of DoD DCGS components prior to introduction into the operational environment.  Periodic upgrades ensure the Testbed stays current with DCGS standards and architecture.Support to OUSD(I) AF DCGS and NATO interoperability efforts is also provided through this program element. This includes development testing and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint allied and coalition interoperability. The Common Imagery Processor effort develops a common imagery sensor processing capability within the DCGS architecture.  The imagery processor accepts airborne imagery data processes it into an exploitable format and provides it to other elements within the weapon system and the DCGS Enterprise. Current efforts are transitioning the legacy imagery processor from a hardware/software capability to a virtual software capability thereby improving enterprise processing capabilities.   Efforts continue to keep the capability on track to handle the current sensors. Activities also include testing development and demonstrations integrating updated and new/emerging sensors into DCGS.Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","","","0.000","",

The consistent accuracy unaffected by location or weather and available in real  time significantly improves effectiveness of reconnaissance weapons delivery mine countermeasures and rapid deployment for all services. GPS must comply with Title 10 United States Code (USC) 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures that continued sustainment and operations of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 51 USC sec 50112 which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.The system is composed of three segments: user equipment (funded under PE 0305164F) space (funded under this PE and PE 0305165F) and a control network (funded under PE 0305165F and PE 0603423F). The satellites broadcast high accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals which are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. This equipment computes the platform position and velocity and provides steering vectors to target locations or navigation waypoints. The control segment provides daily updates to the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to maintain system precision in three dimensions to 16 meters spherical error probable worldwide. Additionally GPS supports the United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) mission and provides strategic and tactical support to the following Department of Defense (DoD) missions: Joint Operations by providing capabilities for Positioning Navigation and Timing (PNT); Command Control Communications and Intelligence; Special Operations; Military Operations in Urban Terrain; Defense-Wide Mission Support; Air Mobility; and Space Launch Orbital Support.GPS III is the next generation Space Vehicle (SV) to join the GPS constellation. GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements including a new civil (L1C) Galileo- compatible signal and enhanced anti-jam power. Two auxiliary payloads Search and Rescue/GPS (SAR/GPS) and Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA) will be added no earlier than SV11. The SAR/GPS payload provided by Canada will fill a validated National Search and Rescue Committee requirement to provide enduring space-based distress alerting capability to detect locate and relay distress alerts to fulfill its responsibilities under international agreements for Search and Rescue. SAR integration costs are  funded by the Coast Guard. LRA built by the Naval Research Lab (NRL) is a passive reflector that will improve accuracy and provide better ephemeris data. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) funds the integration costs of LRA.This program funds GPS III and supports research development test and evaluation of GPS III SV01-02 and risk-reducing simulators through a systems engineering approach that matures and delivers SVs for launch.Additionally the program includes SV01-02 engineering studies and analyses trade studies system development test and evaluation efforts integrated logistics support products on-orbit support and mission operations support for civil and military applications that protect U.S. military and allied use of GPS.

The F-15C/D continues to provide air superiority with an undefeated and unmatched aerial combat record.  The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems such as advanced imaging and targeting systems to meet the requirement for all-weather deep penetration and night/under-the-weather air-to-surface attack.  Configured with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) the F-15E deploys worldwide with minimal tanker support and arrives combat-ready.  A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad upgrades to the F-15 (avionics armament airframe and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality survivability and supportability).  Projected to remain in service past 2035 avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability.  This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors) forestalling obsolescence exploiting proven technological advances and leveraging new technology.  Major avionics upgrades center around radar modernization (both hardware and software upgrades) and the exploitation of enhanced capability via precision timing data delivery and processing technology precision registration systems cockpit Head Up Display (HUD) instrumentation digitization and modernization central computer processing power increases digital mission event recording systems and an infrared (IR) based fire control system.  Funds are also used as required to resolve Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. The proliferation of fourth generation enemy aircraft and sophisticated "double-digit" anti-aircraft missile systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability.  A fully integrated electronic warfare suite holds the promise of providing survivability as well as expanded electronic attack capability.

These programs will ensure continued battlefield overmatch and lethality of U.S. maneuver forces against the full range of modern battlefield threats.  To achieve this Weapons and Munitions Engineering Development Program will identify and develop promising technologies through competitive development and streamlined acquisition procedures.M829E4:The M829E4 cartridge is an Abrams delivered Line of Sight (LOS) munition that will provide capability for the current force Armored Brigade Combat Team's (ABCT) commander to conduct decisive operations and destroy current and future enemy Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) equipped with Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and Active Protective System (APS) at ranges from 0-2km (T) and 0-4km (O).  The M829E4 equips ABCT commanders with a unique capability which will increase the ABCT's lethality and ability to seize the initiative during unified land operations.  One Way Luminescence (OWL): Current legacy small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are comprised of a pyrotechnic tracer mix that allows enemy forces to visually see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter. The objective of the OWL program is to develop and field a full day/night tracer technology to replace the current pyrotechnic trace cartridges with new trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and those soldiers in close proximity thereby increasing soldier survivability. Additional benefits of the OWL program depending on the technology that is selected include a possible reduction in unit cost compared to the pyrotechnic trace round and the potential for every round to have a trace capability. 7.62mm will be the critical focus followed by development of 5.56mm and .50 caliber OWL cartridges.Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP):The Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP) program is a direct fire line of sight 120mm large caliber munition under development for the Abrams Main Battle Tank.  It has three modes of operation including point detonate delay and airburst.  AMP is the material solution for breaching reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50m to 2000m (T) and 50m to 4500m (O) a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition.  In addition to added capability AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions thereby addressing the users' battlecarry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including ATGM teams reinforced walls personnel light armor bunkers and obstacles.  The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification the same required by the 120mm M829E4 cartridge that achieved Milestone C in FY 2014.  FY 2016 supports multiple contracts with competing prototypes in Phase I of II for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD). Medium Caliber Ammunition: The Target Practice Day Night Thermal (TP-DNT) cartridges are 40mm grenade training cartridges.  The low velocity variant is for training with the M203/M320 grenade launchers; the high velocity variant is for training with the Mk19 grenade machine gun.  Both cartridges will provide the Warfighter with a non-dud producing environmentally friendly training cartridge that provides a visual impact signature seen day or night by the naked eye through night vision devices and thermal weapon sights.  These cartridges will replace the 40mm Target Practice M918/M385A1 (Mixed Belt) cartridges and the 40mm M781 cartridges.  It is expected that the unit price for high velocity cartridges will be lower than the Mixed Belt cartridges.  Funding for FY 2015 activities transitions to PE 0654802/Project EC1.  In FY 2018 funding is in place to start an Increased Range Anti-Personnel (IRAP) Program which will extend the range of conventional 40mm Low Velocity grenades from 300 meters to 600 meters.Tunable Pyrotechnic Aircraft Countermeasure: This project will support research development and testing to field new expendable countermeasure munitions that will protect Army aircraft from advanced and current guided-missile threats. Advances in the capability of threat systems necessitate development of new expendable countermeasures decoys. This program is considered essential to provide Army Aircraft and aircrews protection against surface-to-air weapon systems.Ammunition Logistics Prototyping:This project supports the future force by improving the distribution management reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development integration and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations to include retrograde while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling distribution and management (strategic and tactical) prognostics diagnostics and asset visibility explosives safety and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization. The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield. This project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter.Adv Armor Piercing (ADVAP): The overall objective of the XM1158 Small Caliber Ammo program is to develop and field a 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge variant followed by a 5.56mm cartridge variant that will provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun ranges. Current XM1158 ammunition performance has been stagnant over the last 20 years which has led to known deficiencies against current and future hard target threats. The 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge will be designed specifically for use in the M240 Machine Gun and will replace the older M993 Armor Piercing cartridge.Lightweight Cartridge Case for Small Caliber: The overall objective of the Lightweight Small Caliber Ammunition (LSCA) program is to develop and field 7.62mm LSCA cartridges that will provide the same capabilities as the M80A1 and M62A1 cartridges while achieving up to twenty percent weight savings at the cartridge level. The LSCA cartridge will be designed to be compatible with all Army 7.62mm weapons but specifically optimized to work in the M240 Machine Gun. After the 7.62mm cartridge is matured a .50 Caliber variant will be developed.","","In FY 2016 Lightweight Cartridge Case for small caliber PE 643639 Project EL8 is a new start $2.400 Million.In FY 2016 PE 643639 Project EC2 XM1158 for Small Caliber Ammo is a new title.  Previous title was Advanced Armor Piercing (ADVAP).PE 643639 Project EC2 M829E4 was completed in FY 2015.","","","",

ASAS provided the means to enhance the commander's timely and comprehensive understanding of enemy deployments capabilities and potential courses of action. The system used standard joint and Army protocols and message formats to interface with selected National joint theater and tactical intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance systems and preprocessors and Army joint and coalition battle command systems. The ASAS Family of Systems migrated into the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) program and the Army is using it as the initial platform to provide accelerated DCGS-A capabilities to the force. The Counterintelligence (CI) and Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Automated Reporting and Collection System (CHARCS) is the Army's CI and HUMINT tactical collection and reporting system.  CHARCS provides automation support for information collection reporting investigations source & interrogation operations and document exploitation. The CHARCS automation architecture extends from the individual HUMINT team soldier or CI agent to the Corps Analysis and Control Element (ACE).  CHARCS reports digital data such as maps overlays images video biometrics scanned documents and audio files.  These media are transmitted through secure networks and interfaces with the DCGS-A for detailed analysis and creation of finished intelligence products.  Collection and reporting teams at Military Intelligence (MI) battalions and their operational managers are equipped with one of two CHARCS systems.  The first is the AN/PYQ-8 Individual Tactical Reporting Tool (ITRT) which provides collection and processing devices for individual HUMINT team member or CI agents.  The second is the AN/PYQ-3 CI/HUMINT Automated Tool Set (CHATS) which provides the team leader tools to process and manage team-collected information and a robust set of devices such as printers scanners cameras and audio recorders to assist the collection mission.  Each CHATS has an associated Mission Support Peripheral Sets and Kits (MS-PSK) or Collection Peripheral Sets and Kits (C-PSK). The Machine Foreign Language Translation System (MFLTS) formerly Sequoyah develops fields and sustains a basic automated foreign speech and text translation capability for Army tactical systems to augment and compliment limited human linguistic resources.

AMSAA conducts systems and engineering analyses to support Army decisions in technology; materiel acquisition; and the design development fielding and sustaining of Army weapon/materiel systems.  As part of this mission AMSAA develops and certifies systems performance data used in Army studies and develops baseline systems performance methodology and Models and Simulations (M&S).  AMSAA exercises Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) responsibility for verification validation and accreditation of item-level performance M&S for combat effects including the development and maintenance of common data formats.  Similarly AMSAA also exercises HQDA responsibility for developing maintaining improving verifying validating and accrediting item-level performance data and M&S for combat effects and logistics.  In support of its materiel systems analysis mission AMSAA analyzes the performance and combat effectiveness of conceptual developmental and fielded systems.  Unique models and methodologies have been developed to predict critical performance variables such as weapon accuracy target acquisition rate of fire and probability of inflicting catastrophic damage survivability mobility and system reliability.  AMSAA generates performance and effectiveness measures and ensures their standard use across major Army and Joint studies.  AMSAA conducts and supports various systems analysis efforts across the entire materiel system life cycle such as:  Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs); system cost/performance tradeoffs and early technology trade-offs to inform system and acquisition program risk assessments; weapons/systems mix analyses; business case analyses and cost benefit analyses; requirements analyses; technology insertion studies; reliability growth studies; Physics of Failure (PoF) analyses; and analytical support for Test and Evaluation.  AMSAA also maintains pursuant to Army Acquisition Executive direction the Center for Army Acquisition and Materiel Lessons Learned (CAAMLL).  These analyses are used by the Army Research Development and Engineering Command; Army Materiel Command; Training and Doctrine Command; Army Test and Evaluation Command; Program Executive Officers/Project Managers; Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) (both Army Staff and Assistant Secretaries in the HQDA Secretariat); and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD)/Department of Defense (DoD) Leadership.  AMSAA analyses and data are used by these organizations in making acquisition procurement and logistics decisions in order to provide quality equipment and procedures to the Soldier. AMSAA's M&S capabilities support the development linkage and accreditation of live virtual and constructive simulations and provide unique tools that support systems analysis of individual systems and the combined-arms environment.  AMSAA maintains a significant number of models and simulations most of which were developed in-house to address specific analytical requirements.  This M&S infrastructure provides a hierarchical modeling process that is unique to AMSAA and allows for a comprehensive performance and effectiveness prediction capability that can be utilized to make trade-off and investment decisions prior to extensive and expensive hardware testing of proposed systems/technologies for Current and Future Force efforts.  AMSAA is the Army's executive agent for the verification validation and accreditation of item/system level performance models.  In this role AMSAA assists model developers with the development and execution of verification and validation plans to ensure new models and simulations provide credible information/results for decision making.AMSAA exercises HQDA responsibility for Army reliability methodology development.  In this role as the Army's Executive Agent for reliability and maintainability standardization improvement AMSAA develops and implements reliability and maintainability reform initiatives that support acquisition decisions and lifecycle management.  AMSAA develops and applies engineering approaches that assess the reliability of Army materiel and also provides recommendations on ways to improve reliability thereby reducing logistics footprint reducing life cycle costs and extending failure-free periods for deployed equipment.  AMSAA's electronic and mechanical Physics of Failure (PoF) program pioneered the Army's involvement in utilizing computer-aided engineering tools in the analysis of root-cause failure mechanisms at the component level during the system design process.  AMSAA's reliability engineering and PoF tools/analyses have been used extensively to support the design improvement of developmental and fielded systems used in Current Operations resulting in improved reliability reduced Operational and Support costs and reduced logistics expenditures and footprint.  AMSAA in conjunction with the Army Evaluation Center has formed the Center for Reliability Growth (CRG) which is developing critical tools methodology policies formal guidance and educational materials needed to help acquisition programs to achieve their required reliability during the acquisition process.  The reliability improvements achieved for major weapon systems will translate into billions of dollars in operating and support cost savings across the life cycle.AMSAA's unique analytical capabilities are supporting the Army Evaluation Center to assess and determine the essential analytical requirements to enhance Army evaluations and reduce extensive testing.  AMSAA's support in this area improves evaluation products and result in better materiel solutions to the Warfighter.  AMSAA assists in systems evaluations which support various Acquisition Category (ACAT) materiel system decisions and provides quick response analyses in support of rapid initiatives for Current Operations.As the Army's center for materiel systems analysis AMSAA provides the technical capability to support Army and DoD decision makers throughout the entire acquisition process in responding to analytical requirements across the full spectrum of materiel.

This entails architecture studies system integration and testing developing installation kits and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems. The program assesses develops and integrates Information Assurance (IA)/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post camp and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.Information Assurance Development funding supports the technical assessment and specifications documentation of cryptographic key management and IA capabilities in coordination with the NSA the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and Joint Services to secure National Security Systems (NSS) and National Security Information (NSI).  Technical evaluations assess the security operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to develop policies standards and fundamental building blocks for Army COMSEC capabilities.  Develop and publish the Cryptographic Modernization strategy to identify standardize and govern the insertion of IA capabilities to bridge operational gaps and support the DoD and NSA mandated requirements to enhance network capacity while providing for secure information exchange of voice video and data in accordance with the Army Network Campaign Plan.  This will be accomplished by interoperability standards testing and IA System of System Network Vulnerability Assessments (IA SoS NVA) of Army Capability Sets for IA/COMSEC capabilities that provide protections for fixed infrastructure post camp and station networks. The Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities that enable passive and active cyberspace defense operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data networks net-centric capabilities and other designated systems.  Big Data Pilot provides an advanced analytics capability capable of ingesting structured semi-structured and unstructured data from multiple data sources (e.g. Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS) intrusion detection systems intrusion prevention systems network device log files trouble tickets firewalls proxies web and applications server log files etc) and proves situational awareness of cyberspace battlefield.  It provides the computer network defense provider with common analytic platform which informs and reduces risk associated with future material solutions and forms a blueprint for future Big Data Analytics.  Big Data (analysis-of-all DoD Information Network sensor data) provides two optimized and accredited clusters deployed in support of JRSS and Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) with a tools suite accessible to Cyber Mission Forces via secure remote access.  The Army's DCO activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized real-time capability to discover detect analyze and mitigate threats to and vulnerability of DoD networks and systems.

The NSA EKMS program is being replaced by the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program.  The AKMS System of Systems (SoS) systems components are the Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS) Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Simple Key Loader (SKL).  The transition of the legacy EKMS LCMS to the modern KMI Management Client Nodes (MGC)s began in FY12 and must be completed by the LCMS sunset date of December 2017. AKMS supports the transition to AKMI.  The Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is the Army's implementation of the NSA KMI ACAT IAM Program.  KMI further automates the functions of COMSEC electronic key management control planning and distribution.  AKMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to and reducing the vulnerability of Army C4I systems.  KMI provides an integrated operational environment that brings essential key management functions in-band.  AKMI supports Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives and supports emerging key management requirements.  AKMI achieves an Over the Network Keying (OTNK) solution to support emerging cryptographically modernized systems.  Some components of the AKMS SoS will be replaced under AKMI while others will be modified or adapted to meet the new KMI requirements.  The AKMI SoS includes the MGC Nodes ACES and the NGLD Family.  The Crypto Modernization program supports using NSA developed COMSEC technologies within the Army providing encryption trusted software or standard operating procedures and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise in as transparent a manner as possible.

The MDSC facilitates the integration and demonstration of missile defense space capabilities with other defense and national security systems. Kill assessment is the determination that the weapon hit a lethal object and that object is assessed to be no longer lethal. In FY 2014 a timely confluence of events was setting the stage for the kill assessment experiment that later became known as SKA. First the cancellation of the Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS) program allowed residual FY 2013 PTSS funds in PE 0604883C to be used for space experimentation consistent with the intent of the original appropriation. Second an MDA study called the “Space Layer Option Study” found that disaggregated systems could provide sensor capabilities at lower price points (later echoed in Government Accountability Office report GAO-15-7 on the same topic). Third section 237 in the FY 2014 National Defense Authorization Act directed MDA to improve kill assessment for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense program. Nine years of testing using the “Kill Assessment Sensor Package” sensor on the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense program indicated that the physics of the kill assessment problem was well understood and that expensive and risky technology development was not needed for space-based kill assessment. This sensor testing on the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense program also showed that an electro-optical / infrared sensor was the optimal sensor to observe an intercept and record data in the frequency bands most advantageous for kill assessment. Additionally a United States Air Force space experiment highlighted an opportunity was still available to leverage remaining space on the replenishment of a commercial satellite constellation. In April 2014 MDA began the SKA experiment remaining consistent with guidance to best leverage intellectual capital investment in the PTSS program while evolving the technical plan to respond to changes in circumstances risk and budgetary environment. The SKA experiment will design and assemble a network of small sensors to be integrated onto commercial host satellites and while on orbit observe missile defense intercepts and deliver a kill assessment declaration to the Ballistic Missile Defense System. If deemed successful by the warfighter this experiment has the potential to change the economics of the defense of the American homeland from enemy ballistic missiles. The MDSC capabilities and infrastructure provide MDA user capabilities for supporting flight tests conducting concept development demonstrations experiments and developing and evaluating algorithms within a multi-security level collaborative environment. As part of a collaborative environment the Missile Defense Space Center (MDSC) conducts studies and experiments with Air Force Space Command seeking to optimize future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) space-layer options to support Space Situational Awareness (SSA).The MDSC provides MDA elements with a centralized collaboration and integration environment for Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) sensor operations and integration to support the ballistic missile defense mission. The infrastructure of the MDSC supports the operation and control of MDA space systems. In addition the MDSC annual operating expenses provide infrastructure support for security configuration management engineering test experiment data and logistics and create a collaborative environment for the MDA community that includes the Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS); Near Field Infrared Experiment; BMDS Overhead Persistent Infrared Architecture; Command and Control Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC); Integrated Sensor Manager; MDA C2BMC Experimentation Laboratory; MDA Enterprise Sensors Laboratory; and future MDA space-layer capabilities.

The gun system is used against ground targets and to cover the Stinger missile dead-zone.  Avenger is capable of day night and adverse weather operations; can be transported by UH-60L Blackhawk helicopter or C-130 aircraft; is air-droppable and can shoot on the move.  The system can also be operated by remote control from a protected position up to 50 meters away from the fire unit.  The Avenger system is operated by a two-man crew to counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) cruise missiles attack helicopters and high performance fixed wing/rotary wing aircraft. The system fills the line-of-sight rear component of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) system.These funds are provided for the Avenger PIP to modify the Avenger to ensure viability and sustainability through the end of the useful life. Avenger will remain in the force through the Fiscal Year (FY) 30 timeframe according to the Long Range Investments Requirements Analysis. Avenger fills a capability gap which will be permanently filled by the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 Intercept (IFPC2-I) which will be fully fielded in FY30. The Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC) will undergo software and hardware upgrades that will enable the system to handle increased targeting capability realized with the latest version of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) early warning system and ensures the system meets the latest Information Assurance (IA) requirements upgraded analog to digital vehicle intercommunication system and Mode 5 cooperative target identification functions. Project DT5 Stinger Product Improvement: The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced fire-and-forget short-range man-portable air defense weapon system.  Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low-altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM).  Stinger employs an infrared (heat seeking)/ultraviolet seeker to guide to the target.  Stinger Block I has extensive infrared counter-countermeasure capabilities and can engage targets from any aspect to include head-on.  The missile utilizes a high-explosive hit-to-kill warhead.  Stinger can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles helicopters and UAS.  The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.  The Stinger Product Improvement provides design development test and integration of a Proximity Fuze into the existing Stinger Block I missiles. The Proximity Fuze will improve system effectiveness against the evolving UAS threat. Unmanned Aerial System Defense (UAS-D) is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff G-3/5/7 Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO-CIC) in memo dated 28 May 2013.","","","","","",

The successful first phase of the Common Kill Vehicle Technology effort defined concepts for the redesign of the GBI Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV).  This effort completed advanced technology development and transitioned to the redesigned kill vehicle effort in FY 2014.  The next phase of the Common Kill Vehicle Technology effort will enhance our interceptor performance by improving discrimination and adding the capability to destroy several objects within a threat complex using multiple kill vehicles carried on a single interceptor.  The Agency is developing the concepts for a MOKV based on a modular open architecture designed to common interfaces and standards making upgrades easier and broadening our vendor and supplier base.  The Agency will focus on the competitive development of a MOKV concept(s) with industry in FY 2016.This capability relies on a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) architecture that balances performance across the sensor Command Control Battle Management and Communications and kill vehicle elements. The Agency anticipates deploying this capability across the interceptor fleet in the next decade to address the evolving threat.

The BMDS Test Program as documented in the Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP) has a primary emphasis of increasing confidence in M&S as well as providing the Operational Test Agency (OTA) with data to verify and assess BMDS capabilities and Critical Operational Issues. Lastly as models are validated and accredited MDA and the OTA will utilize these models to assess BMDS capabilities through a campaign of ground testing and digital performance assessments.BMDS Test Program Functions:-Develop and implement MDA test policy standards tools products and processes to enable effective tests while balancing MDA and element programmatic needs-Develop an IMTP that compiles all MDA test objectives test schedules and funding  requirements from the year of execution through the Future Years Defense Program time period -Provide maintain and develop common test resources and infrastructure required to execute tests in the MDA Test Program by leveraging element laboratories ranges executing agents and functional expertise as applicable.-Act as the single point of contact in MDA for all external ranges and common test resources -Collect archive and distribute all MDA test data/information-Certify that test personnel are trained and equipped to conduct safe and effective tests -Provide test personnel and support services to plan and execute tests-Represent MDA as the single test authority to the test and evaluation community international cooperative program representatives and other organization representatives on test mattersMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).","","FY 2016 decrease reflects a transfer of Target Launch Operations from PE BMD Test (0603914C) to PE BMD Targets (0603915C).","362","","",

The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment to this effort.  The JMP funds budgeted in this justification are matched dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation DoD’s relatively small investment leverages DOE’s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills advanced scientific equipment and facilities and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services’ needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration development and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.The JMP seeks to develop technological advances in several munitions subject areas.  These include:  1) improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions design and evaluation including evaluation of vulnerability and the design of insensitive munitions (IM) 2) novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation 3) higher power and safer explosives and propellants 4) miniaturized lower-cost and higher reliability fuzes initiators power systems and sensors 5) design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons such as penetrators that are hardened against high impact loads and 6) tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.  The supporting experimental research requires the development of new technologies related to the synthesis processing and characterization of advanced munition materials components and systems.  This involves energetic material research new fuzing concepts dynamic testing of munition materials and advanced characterization including high-rate in-situ diagnostics.The JMP is aligned with Department strategic plans and policies such as:•  Munitions for contingency operations particularly for the reduction of unintended collateral effects.•  Reducing time and cost for acquisition of munitions.•  Rapidly transitioning science and technology (S&T) to support the warfighter in today’s conflicts.•  Establishing future core capabilities and maintaining our national S&T capabilities through joint investment and interagency cooperation and teaming.•  Aiding in recruiting and retaining high-caliber scientists and engineers at DoD S&T organizations.•  Developing advanced munitions technologies to support the increased role of conventional weapons to deter and respond to non-nuclear attack as described in the Nuclear Posture Review report.•  Developing safer munitions that are compliant with IM standards to meet statutory and Department policy requirements.The JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  This community develops technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Munitions Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) which is comprised of over 25 senior executives from the Army Navy Air Force Special Operations Command the Defense Threat Reduction Agency OSD and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content relevance and progress.  The TCGs conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCGs to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD needs.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.The JMP has a long history of successful transitions and significant Return on Investment (ROI).•  The JMP is the primary developer of high-performance structural mechanics computer codes used by DoD and the primary source for transitioning these codes to the DoD.  JMP computational tools are critical to the development and support of DoD programs; a recent tabulation shows that well over 50 DoD programs have been supported by these DOE codes.  For FY 2014 it is projected by the High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) that JMP-supported codes will have accounted for 82 percent of all HPCMP Central Processing Unit (CPU) hours including virtually all HPCMP classified computing.  The total CPU hours represents an eight-fold increase from FY 2012.  The Department expects this heavy reliance on DOE codes to continue for several reasons including: preference for using DOE codes because they are export-controlled; DOE codes are scalable incorporate multiphysics and run on massively parallel computer systems; and the Department can obtain source codes to modify for individual Service needs.     -  A significant number of defense industrial contractors also use the DOE structural mechanics computer codes.     -  CHEETAH a standalone thermochemical computer code is the most widely used code by DoD and defense contractors for predicting performance of energetic materials.     -  The Army Armament Research Development & Engineering Center (ARDEC) has stated that the DOE computer codes are now routinely used to design all new warheads.  The use of these tools has reduced the number of validation tests required for each new warhead from about five to one with concomitant cost and time savings.     -  The Army Research Laboratory has used DOE computer codes to develop and deploy new armor solutions to Iraq and Afghanistan with unprecedented speed.•  New munitions’ case material and explosive fill technologies provide the warfighter with a lethal and low collateral damage capability.  These technologies have been transitioned to the Focused Lethality Munition variant of the Small Diameter Bomb which is currently fielded.  The technologies were also the basis for a new GBU 129 weapon that has been developed to meet a Joint Urgent Operational Need requirement for a low-collateral MK-82 class weapon.  The GBU-129/B received the 2014 William J. Perry Award from the Precision Strike Association recognizing significant contributions to the development introduction or support of precision strike systems.•  The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has supported applications of JMP technologies including:  compact synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) efforts; pre-deployment training of military personnel by DOE explosive experts on how to recognize feed stocks and processes for homemade explosives; and use of massively parallel multiphysics computer codes to understand how explosive blast waves cause brain injury and how to mitigate these injuries.•  The JMP-supported CTH and Sierra codes were used for the Air Force Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) Quick Reaction Effort (QRC) and the Air Force Research Laboratory Conventional Survivable Ordnance Package (CSOP).•  An erosive initiator technology developed under the JMP has been transitioned to the Services for use in selectable output weapons and self-destruct capabilities.•  A novel approach to controlling the sensitivity and therefore the initiability of explosives using microwave energy as well two new insensitive energetic materials have transitioned to development projects in the Joint IM Technology and Joint Fuze Technology Programs.•  Reliability analysis tools were used by Army Missile Command to assess Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM) and Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wire command data-linked guided Missile (TOW).•  Robotic demilitarization processing systems were installed at several locations including a system at Hawthorne Army Depot to recover copper shape charge liners Comp A5 and grenade bodies. •  Characterization and analysis of the Army’s Excalibur fusible plug resulted in a savings of at least $2.000 million.The JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Armaments Consortium (NAC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors.  In addition to the computer codes mentioned earlier the JMP has transitioned case technology for low-collateral weapons low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology for smaller less expensive fuze electronic components and erosive initiator technology for selectable effects weapons to defense industrial suppliers.The integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions’ technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the 33 current JMP projects require multi-year efforts and sustained long-term investments to achieve success.The JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  1) Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling 2) Energetic Materials 3) Initiators Fuzes and Sensors 4) Warhead and Penetration Technology and 5) Munitions Lifecycle Technologies.","","","","0.000","",

In FY 2014 the JCTD Program successfully completed the demonstration and transition of several JCTDs that addressed operational warfighting needs of the Department providing affordable and sustainable solutions.  In addition the program initiated several key prototyping efforts to address the strategic priorities of the Department.Key values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:•  The JCTD Program has a long history of providing enduring capabilities.  See “Section D.  Acquisition Strategy” for more details on transition.•  Recent examples include:      1. A robust “detect and track” capability of "dark" i.e. non-emitting maritime targets.  This is accomplished through automated data fusion of an existing suite of sensors supporting the Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) function.  This capability was successfully transitioned into the Sealink Advanced Analysis system at Office of Naval Intelligence and is now used by multiple agencies to provide a MDA capability.     2. Counter-electronics High powered-microwave Advanced Missile Project (CHAMP) that demonstrated the capability of a missile with an integrated High Powered Microwave source to degrade disrupt or damage electronic systems.  The results are informing the acquisition system and will be used to address time sensitive capability shortfalls.     3. Jetpack fifth to fourth supports Combatant Commanders' airborne gateway needs to distribute fifth Generation data to fourth Generation fighters by translating 5th Generation tactical data link messages into Link-16 messages that can be viewed by fourth Generation aircraft.  It is a critical force multiplier enabling 4th Generation aircraft to participate in a collaborative targeting environment that will be transitioning to our forces.•  The JCTD Program enables coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources; approximately one-fifth of JCTD projects involve some degree of coalition partner participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom Canada Australia and the Republic of Korea. •  The JCTD Program also enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects with the Department of Homeland Security State Transportation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  •  JCTDs will demonstrate capability objectives within 24 - 48 months. •  The JCTD program achieved transition rates of the following:  70 percent transitioned to a new or existing Program(s) of Record 24 percent transitioned to fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater.  In FY 2014 17 of 18 completed JCTDs successfully transitioned.","","Historically the Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) Program has worked primarily with Combatant Commands (COCOMs) and Services to identify Department of Defense (DoD) priorities and accelerate development and demonstration of technical solutions to meet warfighter needs not being adequately addressed by the Services.  However with the end of current conflicts there has been a strategic shift to enable introduction of new capability more affordably through employment of Pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (Pre-EMD) prototypes while addressing the strategic priorities of the Department and the Chairman’s Risk Assessment in the following areas: Electromagnetic Spectrum Agility; Space Capability Resilience; Autonomous Systems and Multi-Domain Technologies; Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction; and Force Application.  The shift in the JCTD Program will also result in a shift in Program metrics.  JCTDs supporting the DoD’s strategic priorities will tend to be longer and larger with increased emphasis on innovation risk reduction and affordability.  Overall we envision initiating fewer yet more strategically decisive JCTD projects.  JCTDs will reinforce key partnerships across the Department Services other government agencies select allies and industry that allow for expedited development deployment and evaluation of capability solutions with potential to address some of the most pressing needs of the Department.  These JCTD partnerships will enable interdepartmental cooperation and capability development with the Departments of Homeland Security State Transportation Justice and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  In FY 2015 Disruptive Demonstrations funding (P264) was transferred from the JCTD Program Element (PE) to a new PE 0603289D8Z (Advanced Innovative Analysis & Concepts).","","","",

JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide the CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content.USFK:  FY 2015 is the last year for dedicated funding within the overall program.  The U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) Training & Exercise Support program develops simulations capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations.  Interoperability with the Republic of Korea-developed Korean Simulation System (KSIMS) is a critical and unique requirement of this USFK RDT&E program.  This solution will be capable of interoperating in a common battle space that realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences -- tactical to strategic -- in Korean theater exercises.  While supporting USFK’s specific requirements this solution will contain enhancements that will benefit other combatant commander training programs that use the aging Joint Live Virtual and Constructive (JLVC) simulations and the emerging JLVC 2020 simulations.  Air Force JNTC:  The Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based capabilities for integration into the JLVC environment.  The Air Force supports development of cross-domain solutions that enable the integration of systems with disparate security requirements and significantly increases the training audience to additional joint and coalition participants.  Navy JNTC:  These funds enable the Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. The Navy program activities include conducting research development test and evaluation and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems.  Additionally the program develops cross-domain architectures for U.S. and Coalition Forces and ensures sister service modeling/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a unified standard.","","","","","",

Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability readiness and safety and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD has been estimated at over 23 billion each year. The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010. The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&L)) designated a Director Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies materials and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus technology development demonstration and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.   In addition the University Corrosion Collaboration (now the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC)) was formed as a collaboration between universities academies and research laboratories focused on corrosion technology research and development to provide solutions to long-term complex corrosion prevention and control problems including metallic-non-metallic interactions advanced surface coatings and treatments for non-traditional use of materials . This advanced corrosion research has been funded since FY 2008 and performed by teams from TCC participating organizations.In FY 2009 the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of storage tanks and other mission support facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of electrical and avionics equipment.  Likewise an array of highly effective rapid cure coatings that are easy to apply and can forestall corrosion for many years on aircraft and ships are being developed.  Other vital projects being considered include sealants wash down systems sensors and prognostic technologies that have joint service applications and potential to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects over a wide range of systems.","","The FY 2016 funding request was reduced by $1.521 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.","","","",

Systemic software issues are significant contributors to poor program execution and reliance on software-intensive mobile and net based products and systems has been increasing (for example (e.g.) Joint Tactical Radio System USS ZUMWALT (DDG-1000) Joint Strike Fighter F-22 and Army Modernization).  As stated in the 2010 National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences report entitled Critical Code “It is dangerous to conclude that we are reaching a plateau in capability and technology for software producibility.”  The report notes that software is “…unconstrained by traditional physical engineering limitations…” and what we can accomplish is derived “…from [the] human intellectual capacity to conceptualize and understand systems….”  With growing global parity in software engineering the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Program Element (PE) addresses the critical need to research develop and rapidly transition state-of-the-art software technology tools development environments and best practices to improve the engineering management fielding evolution acquisition and sustainment of software-intensive DoD systems.  The SEI’s program of work coordinates across the Department through Reliance 21 the overarching framework of the DoD’s Science and Technology (S&T) joint planning and coordination process.  This PE directly benefits these DoD S&T Communities of Interest (COI): Command Control Communications Computers and Intelligence (C4I); Autonomy; Cyber; and Engineered Resilient Systems.  Additionally this PE benefits every COI to some degree due to the ubiquitous nature of software.  This PE also leverages expertise in government industry and academia to enable the development of joint-Service capabilities.Software is more pervasive than ever and computer programs are growing in size and complexity.  Designing managing and securing integrated complex and large-scale mission-critical systems are abilities that the DoD and the Defense Industrial Base have not yet mastered.  To address this the PE funds research and development within the SEI Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) and to access particular expertise in the Services industry and academia.The SEI FFRDC is the DoD’s dedicated source for software research and development.  It is an institute which enables the exploitation of emerging software technology by bringing engineering management and security discipline to software acquisition development and evolution.  The SEI FFRDC focuses on software technology areas judged to be of the highest payoff in meeting defense needs.Private sector investment has created rapid advances in information technologies but the pace of transition to DoD applications is often very slow or the commercial applications do not meet DoD unique needs e.g. high assurance software or large-scale integrated systems.  The DoD needs to create opportunities to discover emerging technologies to evaluate their potential to fit DoD needs and where appropriate conduct critical tests of the technologies under DoD conditions.  The Software Producibility Initiative project P783 works across the Services industry and academia to research and transition software science and tools that address the capacity to design produce assure and evolve software-intensive systems in a predictable manner while effectively managing risk cost schedule quality and complexity.","","","","","",

JWP supports analyses for customers including joint command staffs the Joint Staff and OSD elements responsible for oversight of Components equipping forces for joint missions. The account underwrites limited-scope analyses experiments and partnerships that define joint capability gaps and develop actionable requirements for follow-on acquisition efforts.  This program element plays a major role in portfolio assessments aiming to identify critical gaps between Service-generated capabilities and suggest affordable solutions. JWP funds venues for demonstration of emergent technology-based prototypes that enable joint customers to draft requirements based on realistic understanding of feasible solutions.  JWP specifically aims to assist joint-end-users by analyses that identify essential capability improvements as actionable joint military needs expressed as specific Key Performance Parameters (KKPs) and Key System Attributes (KSAs).  These analyses and assessments deliver independent perspectives on ways to align Service and Agency investments and potential solutions for capability gaps created by evolving threats not aligned to single Component missions.  Though a relatively modest program JWP is consistently cited by joint combatant commanders’ staffs as the seminal infusion of funding that spawned insightful demonstrations theater centers of excellence mission essential capability modifications and strategic concepts.  JWP also underwrites staff analyses in the Acquisition Technology & Logistics staff of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  Working with Service OSD and joint command counterparts the AT&L staff performs portfolio assessments focusing on warfighting environments ten to twenty years ahead.   Typical projects funded with JWP include translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements identification of candidate solutions via experimentation translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources dedicated to direct support joint commands provides analytic expertise not normally allocated via formal staffing billets.  In this activity JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.  JWP resources also support Mission Area Portfolio Assessments (MAPA) and the development of tools supporting joint analytic efforts.The balance of JWP funds contributes resources to examination of potential remedies for joint mission capability gaps.  These early assessments of potential capability gap solutions can accelerate engineering development subsequent field experiments and capability demonstrations in field conditions.  This segment of JWP often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine Organization Training Material Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.  The resources sustain a small segment of civilian operation research analysis (currently hosted by the Institute for Defense Analysis – IDA and the Naval Postgraduate School - NPS).  Administered by the Joint Operations Support (JOS) division within OSD’s AT&L organization JOS works closely and continuously with joint customers around the world.  Analytic project selection is undertaken in consultation with the OSD staffs serving AT&L and Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff.","","","","","",

Operating forces have a critical need for defense against worldwide proliferation of CB warfare capabilities and for medical treatment of CB casualties.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) CB Defense initiatives both medical and non-medical.  This program element supports the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) of medical and physical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Projects within BA5 are structured to consolidate Joint and Service-unique tasks within four commodity areas: contamination avoidance individual and collective force protection decontamination and medical countermeasures.  This consolidation provides for development and operational testing of equipment for Joint Service use and for Service-unique requirements.  Contamination avoidance efforts under this system development program will provide U.S. forces with real-time hazard assessment capabilities.  They include multi-agent point and remote chemical detection for ground aircraft and shipboard applications; automated warning and reporting systems; integrated radiation detection and monitoring equipment; and enhanced battlefield reconnaissance capabilities.  Force protection efforts will increase protection levels while decreasing physical and psychological burdens imposed by protective equipment.  The Secretary of Defense is responsible for research development acquisition and deployment of medical countermeasure equipment and materiel to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD unlike those developed to support the U.S. population must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasize prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this SDD such as vaccines and chemical prophylaxis conserves fighting strength decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation and satisfy the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available efforts on this SDD support pre-hospitalization treatment en-route care hospital care and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include CB diagnostics and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic threats and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  The Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  The Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process ("One Portfolio").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research development acquisition and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research development and acquisition because of its unique facilities testing capabilities and trained and experienced personnel.  The projects in this program element support efforts in the engineering and manufacturing phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 5.FY 2015 funding includes $335.9 million of base funding and $10.0 million of Ebola emergency funding.","","","","","",

Through identifying Defense Critical Assets assessing them to determine vulnerabilities incorporating specific threat and hazard information and analysis and visually displaying relevant infrastructure data and analysis DoD will be positioned to make risk management decisions to ensure the appropriate infrastructure is available when needed to support DoD missions.Specifically DCIP works with the Combatant Commands (CCMD) to determine the mission capability requirements and coordinates with the Military Departments Defense Agencies DoD Field Activities and Defense Sector Lead Agents (DISLA) to identify and prioritize defense critical infrastructure required to support assigned mission essential tasks. DCIP also works with mission and asset owners to identify vulnerabilities and apply appropriate remediation and mitigation measures. DCIP leverages the DISLA inputs to identify the specific functions systems assets (DoD and non-DoD owned) and interdependencies within the Defense Sector infrastructure networks that support the identified critical missions. Each DISLA as identified in DoDD 3020.40 “DoD Policy and Responsibilities for Critical Infrastructure” represents one of ten (10) functional areas that provide support to the CCMDs and asset owners. These functional areas are as follows:  defense industrial base (DIB); financial services; DoD Information Networks (DODIN); health affairs; intelligence; logistics; personnel; public works; space; and transportation.  In addition DCIP manages specific analytic efforts to identify inter- and intra-dependencies DoD has on the critical commercial infrastructure supporting identified missions.  Specific analytic efforts are focused within six (6) commercial infrastructure areas:  energy (electric power natural gas); chemicals; transportation; communications; water; and petroleum oil lubricants (POL).For each functional area and commercial infrastructure area DCIP examines specific vulnerabilities to DoD missions and develops remediation and mitigation options incorporating unique analytic insights from engineering and industry best practices to reduce the risk to missions.","","","","","",

This mission directly aligns with several national and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance/vision documents.  For Research Development Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) these documents include the National Security Strategy Defense Strategic Guidance (Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense) 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review National Strategy for Combating Terrorism 2014 DoD Strategy for Countering WMD National Strategy to Combat WMD Defense Planning Guidance Guidance for Employment of the Force 2006 National Military Strategy for Combating WMD National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism and Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex).  To achieve this mission DTRA has established strategies and tasks to meet their principal objectives.  These objectives are: 1) Ensure a safe secure and effective nuclear deterrent; 2) Anticipate emerging WMD threats; 3) Provide Combating WMD situational awareness; 4) Assess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities; 5) Prevent proliferation and use of WMD; 6) Defend against WMD threats; 7) Defeat WMD threats; 8) Recover from WMD consequences; and 9) Synchronize countering WMD activities. A focused and strong WMD threat reduction technology base is critical to meeting these objectives.  This technology base is closely tied with the operational support programs that make up DTRA’s combat support mission.  DTRA's has taken the steps to develop this technology base and provide a foundation for transformational activities within the WMD arena.Activities funded by Program Element 0602718BR implement a wide set of National Security Presidential Directive 17 and emerging Presidential Policy Directive guidance for prevention of proliferation of WMD and WMD terrorism.  Projects support the prevention and adversary use of WMD through the development of technology to locate and identify nuclear threats post-detonation forensics and treaty verification.  Through development of new sensor systems sensor networks counterforce and fundamental Counter-WMD (CWMD) research these programs contribute to securing and interdicting WMD WMD delivery systems and related materials.

This Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E).  The primary objective of LFT&E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or if not available acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.This Program Element also supports DoD’s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&E related initiatives.  JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons both U.S. and foreign for their lethality against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD’s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Life Cycle Management Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&E to improve military aircraft survivability develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&S) facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG) which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT) is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&E.The Joint Logistics Commanders Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME) was chartered more than 40 years ago to serve as DoD’s focal point for munitions effectiveness information.  This has taken the form of widely used Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) which address all major non-nuclear U.S. weapons.  JTCG/ME authenticates weapons effectiveness data for use in training systems acquisition weapon procurement and combat modeling and simulation.  JMEMs are used by the Armed Forces of the U.S. NATO and other allies to plan operational missions support training and tactics development and support force-level analyses.  JTCG/ME also develops and standardizes methodologies for evaluation of munitions effectiveness and maintains databases for target vulnerability munitions lethality and weapon system accuracy.  The JMEM requirements and development processes continues to be driven by operational lessons learned (Enduring Freedom Iraqi Freedom Odyssey Dawn and Inherent Resolve) and the needs of Combatant Commands Services Military Targeting Committee and Operational Users Working Groups input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. This program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&E JASP and JTCG/ME programs.","","","","","",

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises the combatant commands the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Headquarters Marine Corps)to include specific Marine Corps objectives defined by the USMC S&T Strategic Plan. It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential S&T efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of United States Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. It also directly supports Expeditionary Force 21 (EF 21) which is now the Marine Corps' capstone concept that establishes  the vision and goals for USMC S&T over the next 10 years and provides a plan for guiding the design and development of the future force.  One third of the Marine Corps operating forces will be forward  deployed.  These forces will be task-organized into a greater variety of formations capable of operating from a more diverse array of ships dispersed over wider areas in order to meet the Combatant Commanders' security cooperation and partner engagement requirements.  In the event of crises those forces will be able to composite these distributed formations into larger cohesive naval formations.  This presents both challenges and opportunities for USMC S&T. Expeditionary Force 21 will inform future decisions regarding how the Marine Corps will adjust organizational structure to exploit the value of regionally focused forces.  A fixed geographic orientation will facilitate Marine Commanders and their staffs with more frequent interactions with theater- and component-level organizations establishing professional bonds and a shared sense of the area's challenges and opportunities.  Expeditionary Force 21 provides the basis for future Navy and Marine Corps capability development to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.  The vision for Expeditionary Force 21 is to provide guidance for how the Marine Corps will be postured organized trained and equipped to fulfill the responsibilities and missions required around the world.  Through Expeditionary Force 21 the Marine Corps intends to operate from the sea and provide the right sized force in the right place at the right time.As a key component of naval expeditionary forces the Marine Corps has unique and technologically stressing requirements because of its expeditionary mission and intensive operational tempo Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) structure and conduct of maneuver warfare. Critical requirements in this PE are: Command Control Communications Computers (C4); Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); maneuver techniques and means; force protection; logistic sustainment; human performance training and education; and firepower. There are ongoing actions to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and concepts in operational environments. Joint service efforts are aligned with Defense Technology Objectives and Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives. In addition there is funding for experimentation in warfighting concepts as well as operational assessment of emerging technologies to include technical support of operating forces to assess military utility of selected technologies. This PE specifically supports: continued development of enhanced warfighting capabilities through field experiments with Marine operating forces; rapid response to low- mid- and high-intensity conflicts as well as methods for countering irregular threats; and expansion of seabasing and naval force packaging capabilities. The investment directly assists in fulfilling the forward presence requirements of Sea Shield and the transformational capabilities prescribed by Sea Strike. The Future Naval Capability (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly. This PE is largely focused on demonstration of products and capabilities from the knowledge base and Discovery and Invention (D&I) phases of Naval S&T. As Naval partners the Navy and Marine Corps S&T Team strive to transition technologies that will implement objectives outlined in the Naval Operations Concept. This PE also funds technical solutions designed to increase Naval force capability such as the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command. Investments in S&T provide the opportunities for future capabilities and will prevent technological surprise. The PE as a whole will advance the amphibious and expeditionary capabilities for the Combatant Commanders. The Marine Corps Service Campaign Plan (MCSCP) is the lens through which USMC S&T priorities are acted upon in order to support the future development of the Total Force.Due to the number of efforts in this PE the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.","","","","","",

These operations include littoral open ocean and over land surveillance anti-surface warfare over-the-horizon targeting counter-drug operations power projection antisubmarine warfare mining search and rescue and special operations. The missions are supported by the Tactical Operations Centers (formerly Tactical Support Centers) the Mobile Tactical Operations Centers (formerly Mobile Operations Control Centers) and the Joint Mobile Ashore Support Terminal. TacMobile C2 systems are based on the Global Command and Control System - Maritime architecture which is Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment compliant.Mission Planning:  The Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) is the designated automated mission planning system for the Navy.  JMPS enables weapon system employment by providing the information automated tools and decision aids needed to rapidly plan aircraft weapon or sensor missions load mission data into aircraft and weapons and conduct post-mission analysis.  JMPS is a mission critical system which is a co-development effort between the United States Navy (USN) and United States Air Force (USAF). Common requirements are identified and capabilities are developed and prioritized in an evolutionary approach.  An individual JMPS Mission Planning Environment (MPE) is a combination of the JMPS framework common components and the necessary system hardware required to satisfy mission planning objectives.  Most Tactical Naval Aviation platforms are dependent solely on JMPS to plan precision guided munitions sensor systems tactical data links secure voice communications and basic Safety of Flight functions.  The following type/model/series (T/M/S) naval aircraft are supported by JMPS:  AH-1W F/A-18 A-F E-2C EP-3E EA-6B AV-8B S-3 V-22 Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) EA-18G MV-22 C-2 MH-53E P-3 Aircraft Carrier Intelligence Center (CVIC) SH-60B/F HH-60H CH-53D/E CH-46E UH-1N VH-3/VH-60 AH-1Z UH-1Y MH-60R/S and E-2D. All T/M/S are required to transition to Microsoft Windows 7 due to End of Life (EOL) of Microsoft XP (April 2014)using Framework (FW) Version 1.3.5. Custom support for Windows XP is planned to allow remaining naval aircraft to be supported during the transition.  Future JMPS platforms include: MQ-4C (Triton) and CH-53K.  The re-architecture of JMPS will support net-centric goals by providing route "publish and subscribe" capabilities transition to 64 bit allows for memory space expansion to accommodate future Microsoft Operating Systems emerging technologies and critical Cyber Security vulnerabilities as identified in Operational Test (OT). Funding profile includes JMPS baseline efforts for all existing T/M/S on Windows 7 32 bit framework while concurrently re-architecting to a 64 bit framework.  64-bit development requires complete software restructure to address memory limitations and system errors resulting in JMPS computer crashes.  The transition from the current 32-bit architecture (4GB RAM) to a 64-bit architecture (196GB RAM) provides additional memory access increased planning efficiencies; creating a more stabilized architecture with fewer fleet memory crashes.  Delaying JMPS 64-bit transition to the fleet will cause system crashes to continue. It will also delay required mission planning fixes based upon known software obsolescence and will expose the system to risks based upon  architectural weaknesses in regards to cyber security vulnerabilities.Naval Tactical Command Support System (NTCSS): Enterprise Database and Maritime Logistics Data Network (MLDN): The NTCSS is a multi-function program designed to provide standard tactical support information systems to various afloat and associated shore-based fleet activities.  The mission is to provide the Navy and Marine Corps with an integrated scalable system that supports the management of logistical information personnel material and funds required to maintain and operate ships submarines and aircraft.Maritime Tactical Command and Control (MTC2): MTC2 is a software program which will provide tactical Command and Control (C2) capabilities and Maritime unique Operational Level of War capabilities not supported by the joint C2 effort. MTC2 will align with the Navy Tactical Cloud (NTC) when available and leverage Consolidated Afloat Network Enterprise Service (CANES) Agile Core Services (ACS) and legacy Integrated Shipboard Network System (ISNS). MTC2 will field to all echelons of command (afloat and ashore) within the Navy.  The goal is to provide a suite of maritime applications that enable enhanced situational awareness planning execution monitoring and assessment in support of operational and tactical level of war requirements. MTC2 will field maritime applications designed to provide automated and structured support for tactical and operational planning decision-making and execution. Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI) is the Department-wide enterprise solution that enables visibility/accessibility/sharing of data applicable to the entire DoD force structure. MTC2 will be the program that fulfills a portion of the Navy's GFM-DI requirements.Navy Air Operations Command and Control (NAOC2): integrates and tests Air Force produced systems that provide for an integrated and  scalable planning system that provides standardized secure automated decision support for Air Force Joint and Allied commanders worldwide.  These programs provide automated air operations planning execution management and intelligence capabilities at the Force level to include Fleet Commanders Numbered Fleet Commanders Commander Carrier Strike Group Commander Expeditionary Strike Group Commander Landing Force and Joint Task Force Commanders. NAOC2 includes Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS) Command and Control Air and Space Operations Suite (C2AOS) plus Command Control and Information Services (C2IS). C2AOS and C2IS are being developed as Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) services to allow for scalability and integration with Common Computing Environments (CCE). Continuation of these efforts will significantly enhance the Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) and Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) personnel to plan daily air operations including strike airlift offensive and defensive air and tanker missions in support of combat operations addressing the requirement of war fighter of distributed planning and execution processes and significantly improving Joint interoperability. TBMCS continues a hardware transition to CCEs such as Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES). Currently TBMCS is the key system that is used to conduct real world air planning in the Joint and Navy environment. C2AOS and C2IS will replace TBMCS in a SOA environment while bringing more flexibility to the war fighter planner and executor. FORCEnet:  Initiative's mission is to deliver Information Dominance by (a) accelerating the transformation to a Distributed Networked force; (b) achieve interoperability based on Architectures and Standards; and (c) Experiment with evaluate and employ the enabling technologies.  Effort is a non-acquisition program that is the operational instantiation of FORCEnet.  The end-state is a distributed network of weapons sensors Command and Control (C2) platforms and warriors.  Trident Warrior (TW): TW enables early delivery of Net-Centric Operation/Warfare (NCO/W) capabilities to the warfighter via Fleet-directed Trident Warrior operational events with an emphasis on delivering Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) with Maritime Operations Center (MOC) capability.","","","","","",

The P-8A program was initiated in response to the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validated Mission Needs Statement "Broad Area Maritime and Littoral Armed Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance" and the requirements for the program are defined in the P-8A Capability Production Document #791-88-09 validated and approved on 22 June 2009.  A successful Critical Design Review was completed in June 2007.  In August 2007 the Design Readiness Review was conducted and resulted in approval to obligate funding for the fabrication of the Stage II flight test aircraft.  The first flight of P-8A occurred on 25 Apr 2009.  Milestone (MS) C was successfully completed on 11 August 2010. The program completed Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) in March 2013 and achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in November 2013.  The Acquisition Decision Memorandum approved entry into Full Rate Production on January 3 2014.The primary objectives of Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD) are to perform the system detailed design develop and produce Systems Integration Labs develop and build ground and flight test articles and conduct ground and flight tests to sucessfully achieve program milestones. Ground testing includes the conduct of static testing fatigue testing and Live Fire Test and Evaluation.  Six flight test aircraft have been built during SDD (PU 2696).  These test aircraft are grouped into two stages based on which phase of the test program the aircraft will support.  SDD Stage I flight test aircraft (FY06/Qty-3) support Integrated Test and Evaluation (IT&E).  SDD Stage II flight test aircraft (FY09/Qty-3) support the completion of IT&E and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) after being updated to the production configuration. The SDD contract includes the development and initial building of training devices to support IOT&E.  The scope of SDD includes activities necessary to facilitate an efficient transition of the fleet to achieve the P-8A Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of SDD (PU 2696) in CY13.  The scope of SDD also includes the engineering and verification of corrected deficiencies identified in testing and Fleet operational use.  P-8A entered Production and Deployment phase in the 4th quarter of FY10 and entered Full Rate Production in 2nd quarter of FY14.  P-8A program is based on an evolutionary acquisition strategy consisting of sequential incremental enhancements to system capabilities that will retain cost-wise effectiveness for winning major combat operations beyond 2020.  In order to pace the threat Spiral One (Increment 2) the Next Phase of Capabilities will incorporate the following capabilities into the P-8A: Multi-Static Active Coherent (MAC) Automatic Identification System Rapid Capabilities Insertion (RCI) updates to the Tactical Operations Center (TOC) as well as additional Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) and Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance capabilities as Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs).  The scope of this effort includes the integration design ground testing (lab & aircraft) and flight test of the capability enhancements to the P-8A and associated Tactical Operations Center ground support facilities and initial trainers.  Integration and test of these capabilities as well as integration of Advanced Airborne Sensor (AAS) capability will be accomplished incrementally based on the scope of the integration effort.

JSOW will enhance aircraft survivability as compared to current interdiction weapon systems by providing the capability for launch aircraft to standoff outside the range of most target area surface-to-air threat systems.  The JSOW launch-and-leave capability will allow several target kills per aircraft sortie.  The JSOW program first developed a baseline weapon for use against fixed area targets.  JSOW is a Navy led joint Navy/Air Force program.The JSOW Baseline (AGM-154A) variant includes a kinematically efficient airframe an integrated Inertial/Global Positioning System navigation capability and a BLU-97/B or BLU-111 payload. This weapon was designed up front for pre-planned product improvements.  Procurement of JSOW-A in the Future Years Defense Plan is deferred pending a fix to the unexploded ordnance issue or a change in the inventory levels.  The JSOW BLU-108 (AGM-154B) variant incorporates the sensor fuze weapon submunition (BLU-108) into the baseline vehicle.  Planned production of the JSOW/BLU-108 is deferred pending a change in the threat.  The JSOW Unitary (AGM-154C) variant has a terminal seeker autonomous target acquisition capability and a broach lethal package to enable the attack of blast/fragmentation and penetration type targets.  The JSOW Unitary provides increased accuracy and lethality and the capability for aimpoint selection.  Operational Testing of the JSOW-C was successfully completed in December 2004.  Approval for Milestone-III/Full Rate Production was granted on 20 December 2004.  JSOW-C Initial Operational Capability was achieved in February 2005.FY 2014-2016 includes funding for development integration qualification and follow-on developmental and operational test and evaluation of a Network Enabled Weapon moving maritime target capability into the JSOW Unitary weapon (AGM-154C-1). The moving maritime target capability is currently being integrated as an engineering change proposal beginning with FY 2009 procured JSOW-C weapons.  The new AGM-154C-1 capability will enable the weapon to be integrated with the network and attack sea moving maritime targets via real-time pre-and post-launch targeting updates. JSOW will continue to conduct analysis and development of solutions to system integration challenges and continual enhancement of warfighter effectiveness in the employment of the JSOW weapon system. JSOW funding will provide enhancements to include the analysis of extended range and future improvements to the JSOW-C configuration to improve capability.  In addition FY 2014-2016 includes funding to integrate new functionality of the Common Unique Planning Component into the joint mission planning systems and precision guided munitions planning system. In FY 2016 the program will transition to software improvement/integration and interoperability following the completion of efforts associated with Operational Testing in FY 2015.   JSOW utilizes a "common truck" for both AGM-154A and AGM-154C variants.  Through adherence to international standards for weapons interfaces weight and dimension considerations JSOW is compatible with Air Force and North Atlantic Treaty Organization aircraft.This program is funded under SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION because it includes those projects that have passed Milestone B approval and are conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirement prior to full-rate production decision.Note: Cost To Complete should be 3.943; Total Cost should be 903.194.","","","766","","",

CANES is the technical and infrastructure consolidation of existing separately managed afloat networks including Integrated Shipboard Network Systems (ISNS) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System - Maritime (CENTRIXS-M) Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Networks and Submarine Local Area Network (SubLAN).  These legacy afloat network designs are currently End of Life and CANES will replace these unaffordable and obsolete networks. The fundamental goal of CANES is to bring Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) within which current and future iterations of Navy Tactical Network computing and storage capabilities will reside.  CANES will provide complete infrastructure inclusive of hardware software processing storage and end user devices for Unclassified Coalition Secret and SCI for all basic network services (email web chat collaboration) to a wide variety of Navy surface combatants submarines Maritime Operations Centers Regional Network Operations and Security Centers (RNOSC) and Aircraft.  In addition hosted applications and systems inclusive of Command and Control Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Information Operations Logistics and Business domains require the CANES infrastructure to operate in the tactical environment. Integrating these applications and systems is accomplished through Application Integration (AI) the engineering process used to evaluate and validate compatibility between CANES and the Navy-validated applications systems and services that will utilize the CANES infrastructure and services. Specific programs such as Distributed Common Ground System - Navy (DCGS-N) Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M) Naval Tactical Command Support System (NTCSS) and Undersea Warfare Decision Support System (USW-DSS) are dependent on the CANES Common Computing Environment (CCE) to field host and sustain their capability because they no longer provide their own hardware. CANES requires that Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) field prior to or concurrently with CANES due to the architectural reliance between the two programs. CANES will develop updates on a rolling four year hardware baseline and a two year software baseline. CANES is based on the overarching concept of reducing the number of afloat network baselines and providing enhanced efficiency through a single engineering focus on integrated technical solutions. This will allow for streamlined acquisition contracting test events and significant lifecycle efficiencies through consolidation of multiple current configuration management baselines logistics and training efforts into a unified support structure. Platform Sets define phases of CANES system development efforts. Each platform set consists of different ship class design baselines. In FY 2016 CANES RDT&E investment will support completion of Technical Insertion (TI) software baseline development and initiate development for TI 2 hardware and software baseline including E2C laboratory test efforts. Perform systems engineering efforts to complete functional baselines and updates to technical data packages. Initiate Development Testing (DT) in support of submarine testing.The Communications Automation Program - This project is a continuing program that provides for automation and communications upgrades for Fleet tactical users. It includes Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) and High Frequency Internet Protocol/Sub Network Relay.ADNS is the method by which Tactical Navy units transfer Internet Protocol (IP) data to Navy and Department of Defense communities on the Global Information Grid (GIG). ADNS is the gateway to technical Wide Area Network (WAN) afloat for Internet Protocol network operations supporting information dissemination and external connectivity.  ADNS allows services and applications to interconnect to the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) ashore via multiple Radio Frequency (RF) resources and pier connectivity.In FY 2016-2020 ADNS funding resides in PE 0204163N (Fleet Tactical Development).","","Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) - FY14-15 funding resides in PE 0303138N. FY16-20 funding was realigned into PE 0204163N for Major Automated Information System (MAIS) transparency compliance.","","","",

This mission has been defined by the 2002 Unified Command Plan (UCP) changes 1 and 2.  To enable completion of these missions USSTRATCOM is modernizing the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as Strategic War Planning System [SWPS]) and establishing a unified national architecture integrating disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) data into a single Internet Protocol (IP)-based system known as the Global Sensor Integrated Network (GSIN) to provide redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership.  When the ISPAN modernization is complete the system will support the warfighter in both deliberate and adaptive planning environments while allowing the National Command Authorities to employ the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons.  The ISPAN system will continue to evolve as weapon systems are matured new systems are developed and the threat changes particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).   The nation's strategic Command and Control (C2) sensors and other planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes.  GSIN establishes a unified national architecture integrating disparate MW/MD systems into a single IP-based system that will provide redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership.  GSIN nets together all sensors from tactical to strategic (including the Nation's most modern and capable assets) taking advantage of their larger numbers improved algorithms mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts.  GSIN will permit an IP-based User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) to augment voice conferencing and rapidly build a single unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time senior collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) and decision-making.

Dual-frequency WGS satellites augment then replace the DoD's Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) X-band service and augment one-way Global Broadcast Service Ka-band capabilities.  In addition WGS provides a new high capacity two-way Ka-band service.All WGS Block I (Satellites 1-3) and Block II (Satellites 4-6) have been launched and are operational.  With the operation of WGS-5 the constellation has global coverage and Full Operational Capability (FOC) was declared on 12 May 2014.  Project 657107 WGS Space Systems Resiliency Upgrade is an Acquisition Category III (ACAT III) effort.  The WGS resiliency upgrade will enable the WGS system to both locate and neutralize ground-based jamming threats to both X-band and Ka-band.The MILSATCOM Command and Control System-Consolidated (CCS-C) system provides integrated launch and on-orbit command and control (C2) functionality and backup operations at Schriever AFB and Vandenberg AFB for MILSATCOM satellites as the legacy capability provided by the Air Force Satellite Control Network (PE 0305110F) has phased out according to plan.  CCS-C uses modified commercial off the shelf hardware/software to control emerging and legacy MILSATCOM systems including Milstar DSCS WGS and Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellites.  The CCS-C project 657102 funds system architecture evolution to provide increased performance for additional satellites and to comply with DoD Air Force and AFSPC-directed standards for Information Assurance Satellite Control Standardization and Net-Readiness.  This continuing effort was previously funded in the FY14PB and prior as an ACAT II program.  With the 10 October 2013 FOC declaration the program has transitioned to an ACAT III beginning FY2014.  The WGS and AEHF procurement program elements fund the mission unique software and databases for the WGS Block II Follow-On satellites and the AEHF 4-6 satellites respectively.

Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo (JROCM) 049-10 dated April 5th 2010 approved the Positioning Navigation and Timing Assurance Initial Capabilities Document and designated the Army as the Lead Component for Assured PNT. The Material Development Decision (MDD) was approved on July 30th 2013.  The Assured PNT draft Capabilities Development Document was validated by the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) on July 28th 2014. PNT is a critical enabler of many Army systems. The current capability GPS is a fixed frequency system which can be impacted by current and emerging threats and field conditions which means that PNT access and integrity to the Warfighter cannot be guaranteed. This situation degrades mission performance to an unacceptable level. Therefore current Army systems cannot operate at the required PNT Assurance Levels with GPS alone.Assured PNT is a family of solutions which includes four subprograms: (1) The Pseudolites subprogram provides PNT Assurance in GPS denied environments by providing terrestrial radio navigation (GPS-like) service in electronically or physically challenged environments using a higher power signal. (2) The Mounted PNT subprogram is the integration of multiple sensors and provides PNT platform distribution. The Mounted PNT subprogram incorporates a System of Systems architecture that acquires protects and distributes secure PNT on stationary and vehicular platforms. (3) The Dismounted PNT subprogram is the integration of multiple sensors for platform distribution of PNT on the Soldier. The Dismounted PNT subprogram incorporates a System of Systems architecture that acquires protects and distributes secure PNT wirelessly on the soldier; (4) The Anti-Jam subprogram provides GPS signal protection and PNT Assurance in challenged environments through anti-jam technologies.

The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information and distribution of relevant red (threat) gray (non-aligned) and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning targeting and sensor ground station capabilities.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors other information sources all Warfighting Functions and the Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (ICITE).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed Mobile and embedded configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested a continuing series of software releases will be integrated into Army Common/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Dynamic Army Resourcing Priority List (DARPL) process.The Army Acquisition Executive designated PEO IEW&S and DCGS-A as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead.  As such DCGS-A is defining the architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition Logistics and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.DCGS-A consolidated enhanced and modernized the Tasking Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities formerly found in nine Army intelligence programs of record (Common Ground Station (CGS) Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) Counterintelligence & Interrogation Operations Workstation (CI&I OPS WS) All Source Analysis System (ASAS) Enhanced TrackWolf (ETW) Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS) Integrated Meteorological System (IMETS) Tactical Exploitation System (TES) and Prophet Control) and two Quick Reaction Capabilities (Joint Intelligence Operations Center – Iraq (JIOC-I) and Imagery Work Station(IWS)).  DCGS-A provides these technologically advanced PED capabilities in tailored and scalable mobile fixed and embedded configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  The program develops software packages to be embedded in mission command and other select systems to provide required ISR/analytic capabilities.  DCGS-A is one of the Army's top modernization priorities.DCGS-A software is tailored by echelon and scalable to each unit's mission.  DCGS-A provides commanders and staffs the ability to maintain an accurate and up to date understanding of the operational environment.  The DCGS-A contribution to commanders' visualization and situational awareness rapid planning and the synchronization of all warfighting functions enable Army units to operate within the enemy's decision cycle.  This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from humanitarian to major combat operations and campaigns through all phases of the Joint Continuum of Military Operations.The DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a sanctuary based processing environment.  The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers where the data is stored.  This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems.  Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12/Full Deployment Decision in 1QFY13 the program is deploying DCGS-A Increment 1 Release 1 Software Baseline capability throughout the Army.FY16 Base funding in the amount of $8.923 million for project 956 will be used for the continued development and testing of the DCGS-A Increment 1 Software Release 2 as well as the continued development and testing of the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) as it fits into the Army's overarching Common Operating Environment (COE) construct.   The COE has been directed as a priority effort to align all Army networks procurements and enhancements under one COE vision.  Funds used for efforts associated with the development of the CPCE/COE will include the continued merger/collapse of capabilities across multiple Battlefield Functional Areas (BFAs) and the consolidation of hardware used across the BFAs.  Funds used for efforts associated with the development of the software will include continued advancements in the Standard Sharable Geospatial Foundation to support the Tactical Common Operating Picture as well as further investment into capabilities and widget development supporting All Source Intelligence Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) emerging architectural and infrastructure enhancements and software integration efforts.  The FY16 funding will be used for integration of commercial technologies to the latest version(s) and changes due to Information Assurance updates.  Testing activities requiring these funds will include participation in Network Integration Evaluation and Exercises such as: Empire Challenge ULCHI Freedom Guardian and Joint Interoperability Certification test(s) for each software release. FY16 Base funding in the amount of $16.669 million for D07 will continue the iterative DCGS-A software releases that will increase the Processing Exploitation and Dissemination capability our Army requires.  Increment 2 of the DCGS-A program will continue critical updates to the Army's ISR PED and multi-intelligence planning analysis and production capabilities through the exploitation of Cloud Computing and advanced analytics capabilities.  This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment while developing the incremental software updates required to remain current.","","Project 956 (DCGS-A Increment 1) is a designated Major Automation Information System (MAIS) program.Project D07 (Increment 2) was created to clearly delineate between the DCGS-A Project 956 (Increment 1) development efforts beginning in FY15.","","","",

It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission.  The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels regardless of service component to operate as one system.The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network robotic and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability lethality and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are:  (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible robust and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  The Maritime Systems project will identify develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Improvements in communications between and among submarines surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.","","","","","",

Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) is a Joint and Coalition targeting coordination mission management software application. It links Command and Control (C2) Intelligence and Air operations information with execution systems using real time collaborative targeting managers customized for each service or specific functional area. JADOCS is used to significantly enhance the Joint Force and Component Command's capability to simultaneously develop coordinate and execute Dynamic and Time Sensitive targets and fire missions as well as battle space coordination search and rescue and disaster relief/recover operations worldwide. JADOCS provides coordination and de-confliction of targeting information at all levels of command structure for the military. JADOCS system–to–system interfaces enables automated communications with Joint and Coalition systems to minimize targeting process time and increase dynamic targeting accuracy. JADOCS coordination managers provide operators and commanders with a clear definition of the targeting cycle's workflow process steps responsibilities and status. JADOCS is used by Air Ground Maritime and Special Operations forces. It provides horizontal (across Services) as well as vertical (within Services) coordination of missions to ensure a common picture of targeting operational status across the entire joint force. As a software application JADOCS can be configured and customized for each user and location. The client and server software can be installed on typical Windows Operating System.Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) Increment II will be a software only application that operates on the Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD).  It will provide the dismounted Forward Observer (FO) and Fire Support Teams (FISTs) the capability and functionality to accurately and rapidly locate ground targets and enable the Nett Warrior ensemble to digitally process a Call For Fire. PFED Increment II aligns with the Army's Fires and Effects Concept of Operation and contributes to Networked Fires as part of the combined arms teams in Army Special Operations Forces (SOF) and Joint operations.  PFED Increment II answers the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment requirement that all handheld applications reside on the Nett Warrior End User Device. Project code EF7 funds the evolutionary software development of this handheld Fires Command and Control (C2) system.The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) provides the Army Navy and Marine Corps automated fire support command control and communications. AFATDS is used to plan execute and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects. AFATDS provides Joint/Coalition Situational Awareness for fires execution and mission management. The system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems including Navy and Air Force command and control weapon systems; and the German French Turkish and Italian fire support systems. AFATDS automates the planning coordination and control of all fire support assets (field artillery mortars close air support naval gunfire attack helicopters offensive electronic warfare fire support meteorological systems forward observers and fire support radars). AFATDS provides eleven core services that manage user input and handle dissemination of complex fires processes. These core services are: Attack/Engagement Analysis Fire Support Planning Mission Guidance Target Definition Mission Area Definition Cross-System Graphics/Mapping management Unit Task Organization Data Fires Conflict Detection Mobile Air/Ground Tracking Mission Execution and Mission Trigger Events. These AFATDS services promote situational awareness of data intelligence information and targeting data in near real time in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities.","","Project code EF6 (JADOCS) and EF8 (AFATDS) were previously funded in OSD program element 0203726A project codes F19 and 322 (PB2014 BLIN 161) up to FY2014.  Due to Major Automated Information System (MAIS) transparency requirements beginning in FY2015 all non-MAIS funds were transferred out of 0203726A into 0203728A.   Beginning in FY2015 JADOCS funding is justified in project code EF6 and AFATDS funding in project code EF8.The Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) determined that AFATDS Increment 2 (program element 0203726A project code DU5) is a software modernization effort of the existing AFATDS program. Therefore the Army moved funding for AFATDS Increment 2 from program element 0203726A project code DU5 (PB2015 BLIN 163) to the current AFATDS funding (program element 0203728A project code EF8) as AFATDS version 7.0.

Areas of concentration include advanced detectors infrared sensors focal planes and algorithms for ground sea air and space systems. Sensor technology enhances both the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) capability to develop precision tracks and the ability to discriminate lethal objects among the incoming threat cluster. The Discrimination Sensor Technology (DST) program funds the demonstration of Aegis LoR real time stereo tracking with MTS-Cs integrated into MQ-9 Reapers. Aegis LoR is the capability that allows Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) to launch an interceptor before its own radar acquires the threat greatly expanding the space where the Aegis BMD can intercept the threat and significantly extending the defended area. In Fall 2014 the Agency conducted a campaign at the Pacific Missile Range Facility with Multi-Spectral Targeting Systems (MTS) equipped MQ-9 Reapers specifically modified to accomplish missile defense tracking missions. The MDA tested MTS-B variants aboard MQ-9 Reaper Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and MTS-C variants on the ground at Makaha Ridge for Flight Test X (FTX-20) and Flight Test Standard Missile 25 (FTM-25). Both tests were executed using the BMDS operational architecture proving that the Aegis weapon system could launch a Standard Missile - 3 against a ballistic missile target and achieve intercept using the tracking data from the airborne MTS sensors.  The MD95 DST project funds the prime contract integration and system test checkout flights and performance analysis. DST incrementally builds on the airborne MTS-B launch-on-remote demonstrations using airborne MTS - C sensors integrated into MQ-9 Reaper UAVs.  The DST program will demonstrate the increased Electro Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) capability of MTS-C airborne sensors for precision track launch-on-remote and discrimination over MTS-Bs as a precursor to advanced sensor equipped MTS-C prototype development and test under the Technology Maturation Initiatives PE.  The MT95 DST Flight Test Execution project funds the costs associated with MTS-C/MQ-9 Reaper participation in BMDS testing including prime contract test execution MQ-9 operations and maintenance and Enterprise Sensors Laboratory (ESL) and Space & Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWAR) interfaces. The Missile Defense Agency collaborates with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering the United States Navy and the United States Air Force in a systems engineering based strategy to research develop test and evaluate DST. The DST test program include Air Force provided F-16 aircraft for use as surrogate targets and sharing of MTS-C test data between the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and the Air Force to augment sensor characterization activities.  This technology  significantly enhances the following Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) priorities:- Precision track of multiple objects to enable missile defense components to engage-on-remote- Discriminating lethal objects from countermeasures- End-to-end correlation of sensor track and discrimination dataThe Discrimination Sensor Technology program element development and test results directly feed sensor prototype demonstrations in the Technology Maturation Initiatives program element (0604115C). MD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).","","In FY 2016 the Discrimination Sensor Technology program element (PE) will complete technology demonstration of real time stereo tracking with Multi-Spectral Targeting System Cs (MTS-Cs) to meet Aegis Launch-on-Remote (LoR) quality of service performance. In FY 2016 $31.078 million transferred to the Technology Maturation Initiatives PE 0604115C for follow-on MTS-C advanced sensor development and prototype development and test.","362","","",

The end result will be a future BMDS architecture more capable of discriminating and destroying a re-entry vehicle with a high degree of confidence improving Warfighter shot doctrine and preserving inventory.  This effort encompasses a Near-term Mid-term and Far-term DIHD capability fielding.  DIHD is a combined effort between Systems Engineering Ground-based Midcourse Defense (PE 0603882C) BMD Sensors (PE 0603884C) C2BMC (PE 0603896C) Aegis BMD (PE 0603892C) and Advanced C4ISR (PE 0603179C).    The MDA Enabling Programs are: -(MD24) Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) - Systems Engineering and Integration leads the integration of the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) System using Element and Component capabilities to provide the Warfighter with the ability to defend the United States and its friends and allies from ballistic missile attacks. Systems Engineering defines and develops integrated BMD System capability improvements through BMD level control of system requirements and allocates those requirements to the Elements and Components most capable of supporting intercepts in a particular Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) phase. -(MT23) Enabling-Test - The Enabling Programs Test project drives BMDS test planning execution and post-test assessment and provides critical data for proving that missile defense works. -(MD28) Intelligence and Security - MDA develops data from intelligence sources into the necessary engineering products that drive the design development and testing used to inform and support decision-making for BMD System capability deliveries. Engineering processes translate missile data into threat parameter space and generate threat scenarios contained in the SE&I-developed Adversary Capability Document. These products are also fundamental for system ground testing hardware-in-the-loop testing and the target development for live-fire testing necessary to assess system operation and verify and validate system performance. Security is also provided as an Enabling Program to apply protection across the entire BMDS and MDA. -(MD30) Information Management Systems - Information Management is vital to the efficient operation and safeguarding of all information from development to fielding new BMDS capabilities. -(MC30) Cyber Operations -  The Cyber Operations project sustains MDA's DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program (DIACAP) and Controls Validation Testing (CVT) activities.  It also funds the MDA Security Operations Center (SOC) responsible for monitoring managing patching and maintaining MDA network and core Information Technology (IT) services; issuing and tracking Technical Compliance Orders; and coordinating overarching Enterprise NetOps.   The MDA Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) funded in this project monitors the classified and unclassified information technology MDA administrative IT networks and report vulnerabilities. The MDA CERT coordinates with U.S. Cyber Command to identify and implement network vulnerability updates and patches to comply with U.S. Cyber Command vulnerabilities identified for DoD networks.  The project also funds Information Assurance (IA) governance management and administrative management support annual Agency-wide computer-based IA training and metrics reporting implementation of Public Key Infrastructure and Enabling and Communications Security (COMSEC) related activities.-(MD31) Modeling and Simulation (M&S) - As missile defense technologies continually advance and the threat changes M&S develops system-level models simulations and environments then evaluates performance of the Elements Components and overall BMD System in support of verification validation and accreditation activities.  MDA's M&S program provides a cost effective means to assess and explore the performance space of the BMDS beyond what can be physically tested under current test range conditions and within the Agency's fiscal constraints. Through conceptual simulation activities M&S provides the capability to design and develop technologies to hedge against future missile threats.-(MC31) M&S Cyber Operations  provides the network / system certification and accreditation of M&S related information technology networks and systems necessary to comply with the Federal Information Security Management Act.  -(MD32) Quality Safety and Mission Assurance - Quality Safety and Mission Assurance has the distinct management role of improving quality safety and mission assurance throughout the product life cycle of design manufacturing test and system operation in order to achieve a safe and reliable BMD System.-(MD40) Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).","","N/A","362","","",

The C2BMC enables the BMDS to manage complex threats -- near simultaneous enemy missile shots aimed at theater regional or homeland assets. The systems linked through C2BMC include Patriot Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Aegis Ashore  Ground Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command system (IBCS); and sensors such as the Army Navy/Ground Transportable Radar Surveillance model 2 (AN/TPY-2) radar Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX) Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and BMDS Overhead Persistent Infra-Red (OPIR) Architecture (BOA). In FY 2014 the C2BMC Program shipped a C2BMC Deployable Interface Node (CDIN) in support of a second forward based AN/TPY-2 to the Pacific Command (PACOM). The C2BMC program will install communications support Hardware-in-the-Loop (HWIL) integration testing provide operations and sustainment and training.  Based on the Missile Defense Agency's defined architectures and system specifications the C2BMC program will provide the warfighter the capability to plan the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) fight while concurrently tracking all potential ballistic missile threats and pairing any sensor with any shooter to defeat ballistic missile threats at any range in all theaters. C2BMC battle management will deliver full AN/TPY-2 X-Band radar sensor control and capabilities for improved threat object correlation which calculates a common threat track from multiple sensors through data fusion with sufficient data accuracy and timeliness for Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) weapon elements to enable successful engagements via Link-16 and satellite communications. The C2BMC program also works to increase coalition partners' capabilities. This Program Element includes support for the Discrimination Improvements for Homeland Defense (DIHD) effort. The goal of this effort is to develop and field an integrated set of Element capabilities to improve BMDS effectiveness and resilience against the evolving threat.  The end result will be a future BMDS architecture more capable of discriminating and destroying a re-entry vehicle with a high degree of confidence improving Warfighter shot doctrine and preserving inventory.

C2BMC will provision Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) and redundant terrestrial communication services from C2BMC to the LRDR. C2BMC will update interfaces to provide appropriate LRDR-based information to Ground Based Missile Defense (GMD) Fire Control (GFC) and other BMDS elements.The C2BMC Program will expand defense of the United States allies and deployed forces by continuing work that enables a coordinated missile defense against short- to long- range threats in multiple regions/theaters. C2BMC capability is developed and delivered incrementally. The FY 2017 delivery (Spiral 8.2-1) supports Enhanced Homeland Defense capability by providing increased Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) battlespace Link 16 track reporting of additional sensors enhanced sensor tasking to meet track quality and discrimination timeliness requirements to support GMD engagements and space situational awareness  tasking support.  The FY 2019 delivery (Spiral 8.2-3) supports Presidential mandate EPAA Phase 3 capability declaration by providing critical sensor management and track reporting improvements to Aegis BMD Engage-on-Remote functionality as well as integration with the new Army IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS).One of the best ways to dissuade deter and defeat ballistic missile threats is through integrated ballistic missile defense capabilities: weapons; sensors; and command and control battle management and communications. A potential or actual attack may cross regions and may fly higher and faster than stand-alone autonomous capabilities operated by a single Military Service can defend against. Integrated Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities draw on space- land- and sea-based assets operated by multiple Services to provide the best sensor information about the enemy missiles location and track a more diverse and effective set of weapon options to be used by the Combatant Commander to defeat the attack; with all connected by a unifying Command and Control Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) system. As a result an effort funded in a program element may be critical to the success of efforts in other program elements. These connections are referred to as interdependencies.MD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).","","The increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is attributed to increased requirements in Mid-Term Discrimination and Spiral 8.2-1 hardware/software development integration.","362","","",

The primary threat is from sophisticated electronic warfare whose effects may be enhanced by other techniques.  Therefore in FY 2016 the Network Communications Capability Program (NCCP) will return with a new focus that seeks to enable the development and deployment of Joint robust/resilient and assured communications.  The goal is to mitigate degradation across the operational tiers (strategic operational and tactical) and domains (nuclear intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance [ISR] command and control [C2] etc.) to ultimately support the mission needs of Joint Functional Component Commanders (JFCCs) Joint Force Commanders (JFCs) and deployed forces. The DoD has large investments in TDLs that may have to operate in an A2/AD environment.  Examples include communications planning systems (across multiple domains and echelons) situational awareness capabilities with limited automation support for highly dynamic A2/AD environments aerial networking technologies that create Beyond-Line-of-Sight(BLOS)communications and networking backbone technologies for disruptive environments.  This research will develop new technology and exploit existing methodologies to ensure performance in A2/AD environments.  Additionally this will enable standardization of military network communications capabilities across the Department.Beginning in FY 2016 the Robust Tactical Data Links Modernization (RTDLM) project will specifically address the need for improvements in robustness and efficiency to the current Link-16 which is the primary data link deployed over 10000 radios with United States (U.S.) and Allied militaries.  It will focus mainly on developing ways to improve the resiliency and range/reachability of the tactical data links lost due to conditions in an A2/AD environment.  This will include advanced and improved Link 16 waveform designs receiver processing algorithms and advanced data forwarding and routing overlay technologies as well as alternative antenna systems.","","The Department made the decision to sunset the initial thrust of this program in fiscal year (FY) 2014.  The program element (PE) has been refocused in FY 2016.","","","",

USSOCOM has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command Control Communications Computers and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities into the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.","","","","","",
