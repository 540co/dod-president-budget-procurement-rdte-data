The REF combines and integrates functions that cross several Army staff elements and Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) to accelerate materiel solutions and technology insertion to forces on a global scale.  The REF provides the Army's rapid response capability to develop prototype acquire integrate and sustain Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) solutions to meet urgent combat requirements for deployed forces.  It develops and inserts selected future force technologies capabilities and surrogate material solutions into committed deploying and transformational forces for operational evaluation assessment and spiral development.  It plans and executes assessments and studies of Army practices and issues concerning operational needs desired future force capabilities and relevant Army business practices to provide feedback to Senior Army Leaders. The REF bridges the gap between the lengthy acquisition process and immediate equipping needs.  We pursue tangible solutions that can be equipped within a goal of 90 days. The REF focuses on finding effective game-changing capabilities to increase Soldier effectiveness protection and lethality in any operational environment. The REF process provides the mechanism to respond rapidly to an adaptive enemy who changes in days and months not years. The REF Headquarters Operations team will coordinate in theater work with Army Service Component Commands of the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) to understand their urgent needs for which the REF acquisition capability may identify procure deliver and sustain solutions to the deployed units. A key element of this process is fiscal flexibility permitting the REF to allocate funds against emerging threats and requirements in the year of fiscal execution.  As the REF procures the COTS and GOTS solutions in the future that are not Type Classified or an Army Program of Record (POR) there will be a substantial logistics/sustainment tail that accompanies these capabilities particularly as these solutions are being employed in immature or austere theaters where the logistics infrastructure is not already established.The REF works directly with Operational Commanders at Brigade and below to find solutions to identified equipping requirements. These solutions may result in procurement of new or existing military/commercial materiel equipment or accelerated development of a Future Force materiel solution for insertion into the current force now.  The REF key tasks are:- Partner with Army Service Component Commands and be responsive to tactical unit commanders in a global operating environment- Bridge specific Operational Needs Statement/Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement/Joint Emergent Operational Needs Statement (ONS/JUONS/JEONS) Gaps to meet urgent needs- Develop material solutions to counter emerging global Asymmetric Threats with reduced Soldiers in the operational environment- Ensure training transportation and sustainment are provided with every capability- Cultivate and rapidly insert emerging technologies into Soldiers hands- Conduct operational assessments to provide useful operator feedback to the Army - Transition effective projects through Capability Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) to support long-term sustainment- Be aggressive and push the acquisition envelope but operate within the law- Integrate with existing Army organizations and systems to enable them to recognize and solve problems for tactical units The REF Integrated Priority list (RIPL) consists of the REF top seven priorities based on requirements received from deployed units and drives all REF efforts.  The priorities with associated metrics as of 31 January 2014:1.  Dismounted Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Defeat (24 Requirements/13 Projects)2.  Small Combat Outpost (COP)/Patrol Base (PB) Sustainment (35 Requirements/32 Projects)3.  Small Combat Outpost (COP)/Patrol Base (PB) Force Protection (47 Requirements/32 Projects)4.  Dismounted Operations Support (60 Requirements/43 Projects)5.  Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Shortfalls in Environmentally Inhospitable Operational Environments (OEs) (49 Requirements/30 Projects)6.  Dismounted Blue Force Tracking and Mission Command (12 Requirements/7 Projects)7.  Other (43 Requirements/24 Projects)Total:  270 Requirements/181 ProjectsFY12 metric shows the REF average procurement unit cost of ~$1.1 million per requirement. REF supports COCOM/ASCC based emerging rapid equipment requirements.  Army Senior Leadership has determined the REF will be an enduring organization (Base funded) per Headquarters Department of the Army Deptuy Chief of Staff memo SUBJECT: Implementation Plan for Stabilization of the Rapid Equipping Force (REF) signed by:  Joseph W. Westphal dated 30 January 2014.  The REF FY15 RDT&E Request of $6.120 million (Base) and $4.500 million (OCO) integrates coordinates deploys and provides urgent material capabilities to deployed and pre-deploying units in support of Joint and Army Forces Commanders to enhance the combat effectiveness of the operating force and enable the defeat of asymmetric threats. The emphasis for RDT&E funding is on Testing and Evaluation that supports projects in the areas of Force Protection; Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Detection and Defeat; Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities; and Tactical Command; Control and Communication tools. RDT&E funding also provides the REF the flexibility to invest in near-term innovative solutions. RDT&E funds are necessary in the vast majority of all REF projects. REF uses RDT&E funds to work with industry and Other Governmental Agencies (OGAs) in order to further develop high (>6) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) or advanced technologies that often only need small amounts of funding in order to help them achieve a maturity level that is suitable to solve deployed US Army Forces problems with low investments for high payoffs. REF requires RDT&E funds to integrate several different Commercial-Off-The-Shelf/Government-Off-The-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies into one capability that solves the tougher and more complex problems. REF uses RDT&E funds to conduct demonstrations and tests to validate technology solutions.  REF requires RDT&E funds in order to modify existing technologies that were developed for one purpose but now may be suitable to solve another problem. REF Expeditionary Labs use RDT&E funds to develop and adapt technologies that meet immediate requirements forward in the theaters of operation with the active assistance of the Soldier in the solution development process. REF requires RDT&E funds to test technologies in order to ensure suitability and safety before equipping the Soldier- any modified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf/Government-Off-The-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) item has to be tested.","Rapid Equipping Force","Funding is provided for the following effort","12.360","0","The demand for REF 10-liner requirements has continued at FY12 levels based on the increased tempo of transitioning brigades in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with 9 month deployments; the expansion of brigades' operational environments (OE's) that required smaller units to operate in more isolated areas; the expansion of Army Special Operations Forces Village Stability Operations (VSO) efforts; and the introduction of Security Force Advisory Assistance Teams (SFAATs) - a new force structure and role in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  For FY13 the REF projected 259 requirements.

During the same period we expect to see an increase in requirements submitted by Army Special Operations Forces (SOF) in other areas of the world as well as from brigades employed in more global roles such as the regionally aligned Brigade Combat Teams and their logistical support elements.  REF's Expeditionary Labs are deployed to provide engineer support directly to Battalion and Brigade Forward Operating Bases/Combat Outposts/Patrol Bases and work side-by-side with Soldiers as they execute their missions.  Engineers connect directly to Army Department of Defense (DoD) and National Labs to conduct prototype design while including the users' immediate feedback. We also expect to play a much more deliberate role in providing support to the Army's Global Response Force (GRF) as they prepare for a wider range of response missions.

We expect to increase our engagement within the Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) in order to address capability gaps generated by geographical and environmental constraints and improve our understanding of evolving threats and operating conditions within the respective ASCC areas of operations. REF's Expeditionary Labs are deployed to provide engineer support directly to Soldiers as they execute their missions in austere environments within a smaller logistical footprint. Engineers connect directly to Army DoD and National Labs to conduct prototype design while including the user's immediate feedback.

We also expect to play a much more deliberate role in providing support to the Army's Global Response Force (GRF) as they prepare for a wider range of response missions. We anticipate increased coordination with Army Technology enabled Capabilities Demonstrations (TeCD) and Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstrations in order to leverage developed residual technologies to rapidly address indentified critical capability gaps and gain immediate feedback through limited user evaluations.

REF supports COCOM/ASCC based emerging rapid equipment requirements.  Army Senior Leadership has determined the REF will be an enduring organization (Base funded) per Headquarters Department of the Army Deptuy Chief of Staff memo SUBJECT: Implementation Plan for Stabilization of the Rapid Equipping Force (REF) signed by:  Joseph W. Westphal dated 30 January 2014.  The REF FY15 RDT&E Request of $6.120 million (Base) and $4.500 million (OCO) integrates coordinates deploys and provides urgent material capabilities to deployed and pre-deploying units in support of Joint and Army Forces Commanders to enhance the combat effectiveness of the operating force and enable the defeat of asymmetric threats. The emphasis for RDT&E funding is on Testing and Evaluation that supports projects in the areas of Force Protection; Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Detection and Defeat; Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities; and Tactical Command; Control and Communication tools. RDT&E funding also provides the REF the flexibility to invest in near-term innovative solutions. RDT&E funds are necessary in the vast majority of all REF projects. REF uses RDT&E funds to work with industry and Other Governmental Agencies (OGAs) in order to further develop high (>6) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) or advanced technologies that often only need small amounts of funding in order to help them achieve a maturity level that is suitable to solve deployed US Army Forces problems with low investments for high payoffs. REF requires RDT&E funds to integrate several different Commercial-Off-The-Shelf/Government-Off-The-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies into one capability that solves the tougher and more complex problems. REF uses RDT&E funds to conduct demonstrations and tests to validate technology solutions.  REF requires RDT&E funds in order to modify existing technologies that were developed for one purpose but now may be suitable to solve another problem. REF Expeditionary Labs use RDT&E funds to develop and adapt technologies that meet immediate requirements forward in the theaters of operation with the active assistance of the Soldier in the solution development process. REF requires RDT&E funds to test technologies in order to ensure suitability and safety before equipping the Soldier- any modified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf/Government-Off-The-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) item has to be tested.","Rapid Equipping Force","Funding is provided for the following effort","12.360","0","The demand for REF 10-liner requirements has continued at FY12 levels based on the increased tempo of transitioning brigades in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with 9 month deployments; the expansion of brigades' operational environments (OE's) that required smaller units to operate in more isolated areas; the expansion of Army Special Operations Forces Village Stability Operations (VSO) efforts; and the introduction of Security Force Advisory Assistance Teams (SFAATs) - a new force structure and role in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  For FY13 the REF projected 259 requirements. At the end of FY13 the REF had 311 total requirements – 186 were OCO requirements - this is 36 OCO requirements more than projected.","6.500","0","REF mission expands to perform Direct Support (DS) to globally deployed Soldiers Army Service Component Commands of the Combatant Commands regionally aligned Brigade Combat Teams and other Department of Defense (DoD) organizations.  During the same period we expect to see an increase in requirements submitted by Army Special Operations Forces (SOF) in other areas of the world as well as from brigades employed in more global roles such as the regionally aligned Brigade Combat Teams and their logistical support elements.  REF's Expeditionary Labs are deployed to provide engineer support directly to Battalion and Brigade Forward Operating Bases/Combat Outposts/Patrol Bases and work side-by-side with Soldiers as they execute their missions.  Engineers connect directly to Army Department of Defense (DoD) and National Labs to conduct prototype design while including the users' immediate feedback. We also expect to play a much more deliberate role in providing support to the Army's Global Response Force (GRF) as they prepare for a wider range of response missions.  For FY14 the REF projected 210 requirements (120 Base 90 OCO).  After seven months (30 April 2014) into the FY the REF is at 236 requirements – of which 202 are OCO requirements.  At this pace the REF will have 348 total OCO requirements by the end of FY14 – this is 258 requirements over the projected.","10.620","6.120","The REF partners with the Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) and Army SOF community to perform Direct Support (DS) to globally deployed Soldiers and regionally aligned Brigade Combat Teams. We anticipate an increased need for flexibility to develop technological solutions supporting the reduced numbers of Soldiers operating globally in order to fill force protection gaps in the face of a smaller and more lethal terrorism threat. We expect to increase our engagement within the Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) in order to address capability gaps generated by geographical and environmental constraints and improve our understanding of evolving threats and operating conditions within the respective ASCC areas of operations. REF's Expeditionary Labs are deployed to provide engineer support directly to Soldiers as they execute their missions in austere environments within a smaller logistical footprint. Engineers connect directly to Army DoD and National Labs to conduct prototype design while including the user's immediate feedback. We expect to insert emerging technologies into ASCC level exercises in order to validate concept of operations (CONOPS) and Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTP).  We also expect to play a much more deliberate role in providing support to the Army's Global Response Force (GRF) as they prepare for a wider range of response missions. We anticipate increased coordination with Army Technology enabled Capabilities Demonstrations (TeCD) and Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstrations in order to leverage developed residual technologies to rapidly address indentified critical capability gaps and gain immediate feedback through limited user evaluations.  In accordance with REFs participation in the OSD led quick reaction capability effort the Army determined the REF would provide the Army's warm base capability with 71 requirements in FY15.","4.500","For FY15 the REF is projecting 31 of the 71 requirements to be from the OCO geographical area IAW current plans to continue to support the residual force in Afghanistan as well as US Army forces in other OCO designated geographic areas listed in the 9 September 2010 Office of Management and Budget document titled "Criteria for War/Overseas Contingency Operation Funding Requests."  The planned average cost per requirement was ~$1.1M (FY 08-12 average). For FY15 the REF projects 71 requirements in the following REF Integrated Priority List (RIPL): 1.

The REF focus is on rapidly placing game-changing capabilities into Soldiers' hands. This mission is accomplished in one of two ways: rapidly adapting Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) equipment to meet operational needs and developing emerging deployable capability via interaction with research and development organizations and academia. All capabilities are safety tested prior to insertion into operational environments.  Training and sustainment is provided for every capability until it is transitioned to an approved program of record or terminated through the Capabilities Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) process. Operational assessments are conducted to provide feedback in support of Army equipping and fielding decisions.  REF capabilities routinely serve to bridge specific Operational Needs Statement (ONS) Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) and Joint Emergent Operational Needs Statement (JEONS) gaps to meet urgent requirements.","N/A",
