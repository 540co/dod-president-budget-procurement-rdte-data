It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission.  The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels regardless of service component to operate as one system.The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network robotic and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability lethality and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are:  (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible robust and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  The Maritime Systems project will identify develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Naval forces play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.","","","","","",

Space-based sensors also expand the battle space of all BMD ships operating in the northern hemisphere with increased raid size handling and threat range capability. With the two Space Tracking & Surveillance System (STSS) demonstration satellites (launched in 2009) the Agency regularly and consistently demonstrated space-based remote sensor and fire control integration initially in April 2011 in Flight Test Marine (FTM)-15 and most recently in May 2012 in FTM-16 Event 2A.  These successes are informing the design integration and operations of the Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS). The PTSS is a space and ground segment system that will provide persistent sensor coverage of enemy ballistic missiles. The PTSS is designed to be an integrated part of the BMDS: one that receives cues from all acquisition sensors and provides outputs to the BMDS battle manager & missile systems. The program mitigates cost schedule and performance risk by: 1) simplifying the design by focusing on the BMDS mission 2) incorporating components and subsystems with high technology readiness levels and on-orbit pedigrees and 3) involving industry and the military services up front & early to inform the design for producibility operations and sustainment. The PTSS has inherent capability for other missions such as Space Situational Awareness. The Agency expects that capability to be exploited by the joint warfighter when the PTSS is not engaged in a missile defense mission. The Combatant Commands and Services have a need for a persistent ability to provide fire-control quality tracking of a raid of ballistic missiles over their entire trajectory for both homeland and regional defense scenarios specifically improve birth-to-death tracking identification and targeting including the capability to detect track discriminate and counter large dense raids and structured attacks. Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) systems acquire and track the boost and early post-boost phases of a missile`s trajectory but the PTSS is required to continue to track ballistic missiles through their accent apogee and until they reenter into the earth`s atmosphere. Goals and objectives for the PTSS are:    - Develop an operational missile tracking capability from space which will close the BMDS fire control loop specifically the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and Ground Based Interceptor weapon systems by way of the BMDS battle manager.    - Reduce operational fire control risk by co-locating the national lab design teams for PTSS and Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and by embedding US Navy and US Air Force operations and sustainment experts in the PTSS hybrid program office.    - Focus on tracking raids of regional Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missiles and Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles from today`s regional threats.    - Develop and test the development satellite articles and the integrated ground system with the BMDS.    - Ensure early industry involvement by awarding contracts to join the Integrated Systems Engineering Team (ISET) during the development satellite article design. Six Industry partners (Ball Boeing Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman Orbital and Raytheon) contribute to the national lab development effort to improve the Precision Tracking Space System design for manufacturability and reduce the production risk.    - Use data from the on-orbit Space Tracking & Surveillance System (STSS) demonstration satellite testing events    - Benchmark models and simulations.    - Allocate requirements interface controls and evaluate operations concepts.    - Leverage experience gained from STSS test events to demonstrate capability and insight into Command Control Communication Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance linkages and hand off to the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense fire control system.    - Develop a government owned design to foster production competition over the life of the program.The Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS) contributes to defense of the U.S. homeland and regional missile defense including large raid protection.

The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective thus maximizing efficiencies ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating establishing and maintaining 2018 and 2023 year technology development plans and roadmaps 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate Program Executive Offices (PEO) for insertion in their Insensitive Munition (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.   The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technical Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technical Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior DoD and DOE laboratory representatives and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight policy direction and priorities during its annual meeting.The Insensitive Munitions effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with Insensitive Munitions requirements established in United States Code Title 10 Chapter 141 Section 2389 and DoDI 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads 4) Anti-Armor Warheads and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG) under tri-service leadership have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  These IM technologies alone or in combination will be incorporated in hardware simulating real-world munitions to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.The Enabling Fuze Advanced Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development (GDF) of the Force the Secretary of Defense Memorandum DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration weapons and programs based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&T) communities.  In this way promising multi-point initiation architectures high reliability fuze architectures survivable components modular fuze packaging and components produced based on ease of manufacturing can be integrated into munitions applications and its ability to address required capability needs will be validated.  Mature fuze technologies will be transitioned to Weapon PEO’s and/or Industry thereby decreasing program costs and schedule risk while facilitating technology into potentially broader range of munitions applications.The JFTP investments focus on four specific capability areas that have been identified by the Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and as validated by the PEOs and the Service S&T communities.

As the DoD increases the capability and capacity to generate increasing amounts of data from numerous sensors in the battlespace the issue of handling very large data sets has become more challenging.  From a technical perspective data creation speeds have outpaced the speed and ability to transport store and process the data created.  S&T investigation into new and novel ways to manage and exploit this data is required to more efficiently use sensor assets and effectively use information in a timely fashion.The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Data to Decisions program (PEs 0602663D8Z and 0603663D8Z) uniquely addresses three specific gap areas not addressed by Component S&T:  minimal dedicated Data to Decisions research to support Joint and emerging mission areas; DoD needs a mechanism to increase responsiveness of Component Data to Decisions research and lower the time-to-solution across a broad DoD-wide user base; and limited investment in multi-disciplinary research investigations of Data to Decisions issues and solutions.  The OSD Data to Decisions program pulls together research efforts to address shortfalls within the context of Joint and emerging missions to ensure that the distinctive needs of these joint analysts and decision makers are addressed by DoD science and technology.  As an example irregular warfare non-state terrorism movements and uncertain environmental patterns that trigger major weather disasters are producing a reality for military and government leaders where traditional physics-based sensors alone are insufficient to plan current and future actions in a region of interest or need.  Component Data to Decisions efforts focus on developing technology to overcome a particular challenge within a mission or to advance a particular priority area of that Component.  As a result the R&E Database has over 388 references to Decision Support programs; all of which are designed to address a specific need over the course of several years.  However there exists no other program in the DoD that focuses on technology development efforts to speed the delivery of the Component solutions and lessons learned to a DoD-wide user base.  The OSD Data to Decisions program provides the common platform (access to datasets infrastructure and metrics) to integrate and evaluate the technology development and research methods to support various missions driven by the challenge problems.  This ability to rapidly evaluate technology development and research methods will allow technology transfer for mission analysis not previously foreseen and lower the time-to solution across DoD by rigorously analyzing technical performance for more immediate use.  Traditional approaches within research seek to advance machine systems for a specific mission effect resulting in large complex data sets.  While necessary for sensor system improvements potential Data to Decisions solutions require a coupling of automated data analysis with human analysts operators and decision makers in order to reduce time and limit the number of people required.  Many research studies workshops and analysis have stated that solutions to data issues are multi-disciplinary.  The OSD Data to Decisions program is in the unique position to reach across Components and research disciplines to blend promising research in new ways in response to cross-service Challenge Problem statements.  For Challenge Problems contextual understanding will result from research combining human sciences with computer processing techniques to take advantage of a person’s cognitive ability to fuse and assimilate multiple sources and types of information for new insights.","Change from FY 2013 to FY 2014 reflects a realignment of the program from the Data to Decisions Applied Research program element (PE) 0602663D8Z to higher Department of Defense (DoD) priorities.The goals of this program will be shifted to the DoD Components under the direction of the Research and Engineering (R&E) Executive Committee and will conform with the DoD Data to Decision Priority Steering Council roadmaps.  Historically the Joint Data Management program was restructured to evolve into the revised Data to Decisions Applied Research program a FY 2012 new start in support of the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review mission:  Succeed in counterinsurgency stability and counterterrorism operations.  In addition this program addresses a signed Secretary of Defense S&T priority Data to Decisions which reduces the cycle time and manpower requirements for analysis and use of large data sets.","","","","",

G-TSCMIS will consolidate improve upon and replace legacy TSCMIS solutions hosted at over 20 Department of Defense (DoD) Services Agencies and Combatant Commands (CCDRs).  It will provide a comprehensive picture of whole-of-government SC activities and will contribute to planning more effective cooperative security activities to align or meet desired outcomes in support of SC end states.  The program is an evolutionary rapid Information Technology (IT) acquisition pilot program as described in FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 804 that provides users at every user command with greater capability through several iterations and releases that are developed and implemented over time.  The Department of Navy (DoN) was assigned acquisition lead for the effort by Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF). G-TSCMIS is a fully interoperable component of Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) and the DoD Joint C2 (JC2) Capability.  The effort will support the strategic planning of CCDRs by providing access to reports of programs activities events funding assessments and status of achieving defined end states.  G-TSCMIS will provide visualization assessment reporting and data management throughout the conduct of SC activities planning and execution phases.  Information from the SC activities will be binned by separate SC programs budget lines/funding streams equipment drawdown etc.  This will enable users at the tactical level to focus on specific programs participating forces events and activities while users at the strategic level will be able to access summary reports of geographic regions resource requirements or total expenditure of funds by source.  G-TSCMIS support to DoD's SC reporting requirements is mandated by federal law for many SC programs and activities.  To adhere to U.S. regulations G-TSCMIS reports will be tailored to include programs events and activities by category geographical areas assessments U.S. staffing levels and sources of funding. G-TSCMIS will interface with other systems such as Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS) and Joint Capability Requirements Manager (JCRM). G-TSCMIS must also be interoperable with the other United States Government (USG) foreign assistance and international cooperation information systems.  G-TSCMIS will allow decision makers and analysts to identify redundant investments plan more effective engagements and find gaps and opportunities for building more capable partners.  The program uses multiple rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Milestone B equivalent initial build decision held in Quarter 1 FY 2012 which resulted in approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase.  The initial releases require defined objectives and mature technology.  Based on analysis of required capabilities and resources the Program Office is planning on executing G-TSCMIS in five major releases each with three iterations across the period of FY 2012-FY 2020.","","0.000","","","",

This PE includes application of R&D to expedite prototype development and mission support efforts to sustain and/or modernize operations required for general RDT&E.Project 1:  DoD Enlistment Processing and Testing. The project administers testing programs which enable the Armed Services to select highly qualified military recruits. The DoD uses a single test the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) to determine eligibility of military applicants and to report recruit quality data to Congress. High quality recruits are obtained from administering the ASVAB annually to approximately 600000 applicants for Military Service as part of the DoD Enlistment Testing program and to 1 million students in the DoD Student Testing program. Each Service also uses ASVAB test forms developed in this program as part of their in-service testing programs. New ASVAB test forms and related support materials are implemented approximately every four years. This allows DoD to make measurement improvements as well as decrease the likelihood of test compromise. Ongoing RDT&E efforts include development and evaluation of procedures which (1) reduce or eliminate threats to the validity of the ASVAB test scores generated; (2) improve the efficiency of the test development calibration and validation process; and (3) improve selection and classification decisions made by each Service through more effective use of test score information. In addition periodic assessments are required to provide DoD manpower planners and Congress with information on aptitude trends in the population from which recruits are drawn.Project 2:   Federal Voting Assistance Program.  Phase I of Internet Voting Competition Challenge:  In the first phase submissions will focus on defining security reliability usability and accountability requirements for internet voting systems. Submissions will be open to the public and will be open to public critique. FVAP will review those submissions and critiques and then consolidate them into a single set of requirements for Phase II. o  Phase II of Internet Voting Competition Challenge:  In this phase submission will provide high level designs and detailed hardware and software architectures along with procedures necessary for secure operation. Submissions will be sufficiently detailed so that a reasonably skilled information technologist could implement the system to allow for broader peer review.  However many details such as user interfaces and database layouts will be likely be undefined. As with the first phase submissions will be open for critique. In this phase critiques will focus on identifying areas where designs do not meet the requirements defined in the first phase. The result may be modification of architectures to incorporate ideas from several teams. At the conclusion of this phase the Department will narrow down the set of acceptable architectures. o  RDT&E funding for the internet voting program is discontinued in FY 2014 until the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have established the measurements and standards against which internet voting can be evaluated.  Project 3:The Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service (DCPAS) a DHRA component manages and operates a number of major DoD programs including the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS). DCPDS is the Department's enterprise civilian human resources information system. It ensures a coherent standardized and cost-effective system for the entire Department. DCPDS is built using a commercial off-the-shelf product customized for Federal and Defense requirements. The system is web-enabled and provides flexibility to respond to changes in the Department's civilian human resources (HR) operational requirements.DCPDS supports HR operations and improved business processes with continuous implementation of improved technology meeting cost schedule and performance goals.  Network and system operations span worldwide with 24/7 operations that support 19 Regional Service Centers and over 300 Customer Support Units.  DCPDS will complete its upgrade to the Hewlett Packard Blade architecture for all database servers in 2014. Economic analyses have validated the original estimate of approximately $200M annual savings. The current focus of DCPDS is the expansion of these efficiencies through the consolidation of DCPDS operations to a single data center where DCPDS enterprise operations and all DoD customer regional operations will be located at the Lockheed Martin Denver Data Center by October 2014.  (Army and Air Force will relocate in FY14 to complete DCPDS Consolidation.)Other DCPAS programs supporting the civilian workforce include minimizing involuntary separations assisting laid-off workers maintaining workforce balance and reducing the costs of DoD's workers and  unemployment compensation. DHRA/DCPAS supports the development issuance and maintenance of uniform DoD-wide civilian personnel policy; provides program guidance and technical interpretation for both appropriated and non-appropriated funded civilian HR programs ; manages DoD's Civilian Assistance and Re-Employment (CARE) program including the Priority Placement Program (PPP); investigates and mediates discrimination complaints; conducts grievance investigations; and manages the operation of the enterprise civilian HR information system DCPDS. These programs are supported by an aggressive data automation program to include a communications capability computing equipment and an automation software link to standardize these divergent functions. These funds continue to support these processes.Project 4: :  Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) acts as the authoritative source for identity and personnel information for the DoD Net Centric Enterprise Computing vision of the Department of Defense’s Global Information Grid (GIG 2.0). Based on the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) identities DMDC provides the key attribute service for the Department of Defense (DoD) Identity and Access Management (IdAM) Capability. The Enterprise Identity Attribute Service (EIAS) supports IdAM through the distribution of DoD person and personnel attributes to applications and services in a controlled consistent and secure manner to support ABAC decisions. The controlled authoritative information provided via EIAS can be used to confirm an individual’s identity affiliation to the DoD clearance pay grade/rank organization and occupation series for an authorization decision. A key attribute for decision makers is organization. The Global Force Management Data Initiative (GFM_DI) provides the  organization unique identifiers (OUID) in the EIAS payload. To meet the DoD demand for the OUID DMDC working with J8 and the Service/Agencies has to 1) establish the linkage between a person (EDI_PI) and the OUID 2) provide the OUID attribute in the EIAS payload for access decisions and 3) standardize the organizational attributes required to make access decisionsProject 5: The Neo Tracking System (NTS) / Emergency Tracking Accountability System (ETAS) is a certified and accredited DoD automated system that accounts for and sustains visibility of noncombatant evacuees during a NEO under the authority of DODD 1000.25 DoD Personnel Identity Protection (PIP) Program. NTS is currently being used in the USAFRICOM USCENTCOM USEUCOM USSOUTHCOM and USPACOM Area of Responsibility. The ETAS component is the CONUS domestic version of NTS and is for use by USNORTHCOM during disasters in the CONUS whether natural accidental or acts of terrorism. The primary purpose of the NTS/ETAS is to provide individual accountability of the evacuee by creating and maintaining a database of evacuees assembled during an evacuation operation and subsequently tracking the evacuees' movement throughout the evacuation process.Project 6: The Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker Enterprise Suite (SPOT-ES) is the Department of Defense (DoD) system of record for accountability and visibility of contracts and contractor personnel authorized to operate in a contingency operation.  SPOT-ES provides web based tracking and visibility into contract services personnel and equipment locations; provides a common operational picture for Combatant Commanders; enhances the analytical tools to accurately plan for the quantity of contracted support required for future contingency operations; and collects accurate data for the Office of Management and Budget-directed quarterly census of all contractors supporting contingency operations.","","87.456","","","",

It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapons cargo passenger and/or fuel delivery calculate fuel requirements and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review print and brief the mission plan; and download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics. The Mission Planning Systems (MPS) program is a collaborative program with the Army and Navy to leverage technical solutions and business practices for all Department of Defense (DoD) platforms.  It provides automated mission planning tools and support for fixed and rotary wing aircraft and guided munitions.  It replaced two closed architecture legacy mission planning systems (UNIX-based MPS (UNIX-MPS) and the PC-based Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS)) with a single multi-service open architecture system more commonly referred to as the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).  MPS will compress the mission planning cycle by providing an improved integrated planning environment reducing the time required to respond to changing situations and urgent needs such as striking time sensitive/critical targets and conducting combat search and rescue.  MPS products have the potential to support all DoD fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft and will be shared with other AF programs as well as the Army and Navy.  MPS will deliver significant benefits to command and control performance by enhancing information superiority for the warfighter and by providing unique capabilities in support of both precision engagement and dominant maneuver.  To meet the unique needs of Air Mobility Command (AMC) the Mobility Air Force Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS) component of MPS will provide a centralized net-centric global mobility mission flight planning capability.  This capability will provide significant fuel savings through automated flight route optimization utilizing aircraft performance air traffic management weather and other data. In addition to the above elements of Mission Planning Systems will be utilized to continue development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) in conjunction with the Army.  The JPADS System of Systems (SoS) capability provides a planning and execution capability for DoD airdrop requirements.  It is the primary airdrop mission planning and execution system for all ballistic airdrop mission as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and/or standoff precision delivery.  JPADS enables high-altitude precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces mitigating surface-to-air threats reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) & insurgent attack on ground convoys.  JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather terrain aircraft capabilities threat etc. to accurately deliver payloads to keep the warfighter supplied and in the fight.FY15 funding will continue the MPS software development program.  It will develop pre and in-flight mission planning capabilities for a variety of Air Force aircraft and weapons from legacy mission planning systems to the new MPS.  These weapon systems include but are not limited to the: A-10 B-1B C-5 C-17 C-130 E-3 E-8 F-15 F-16 F-22A RC-135 HH-60 and their associated weapons (e.g. Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Munitions (JASSM) etc.).  FY15 funding will also continue the development of MAFPS to realize fuel savings and other efficiencies.  Additionally it will continue the development of JPADS airdrop software (and other system components) to provide a precision airdrop capability for the C-17 C-130 and other selected platforms as necessary.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","0.000","N35","","",

AWACS provides a real-time picture of friendly neutral and hostile air activity. Its capabilities include all-altitude/all-weather surveillance of the battle space; early warning of enemy actions; a real-time ability to find fix track and assess airborne or maritime threats; and detection location and identification of electronic emitters.1. E-3 Block 40/45 is replacing AWACS 1970's vintage mission systems that are experiencing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues are difficult and expensive to upgrade and limit overall AWACS system performance. The Block 40/45 upgrade will improve integration quality and timeliness of sensor data to the shooter improve Combat Identification (CID) improve AWACS contribution to Time Critical Targeting via Data Link Infrastructure (DLI) improve electronic support measures processing and enable more effective faster upgrades via an open-system Ethernet-based architecture. This upgrade also updates the ground support infrastructure training systems [(Mission Crew Training Set (MCTS) Mission Computing Maintenance Trainer (MCMT) and the Airborne Training Set (ATS)] data links and the Avionics Integration Support Facility (AISF) all located at Tinker Air Force Base.2. E-3 Next Generation Identification Friend or Foe (NGIFF) provides AWACS with enhanced IFF interrogator operation to add a more secure Mode 5 capability. The National Security Agency (NSA) declared IFF Mode 4 unsecure and obsolete on 5 Nov 2003. Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo 047-07 requires IFF Mode 5 interrogation capability by FY14.  The new Mode 5 interrogation capability extends the effective range of the AWACS interrogator while helping discriminate against closely spaced cooperative targets. NGIFF developed and integrated a basic Mode 5 capability on Block 30/35 starting in FY09 and began developing a full Mode 5 capability on Block 40/45 in FY11. Hardware will be common between the Block 30/35 and Block 40/45 platforms. NGIFF will also integrate Mode S a civilian air traffic control capability residing in the NGIFF hardware as funding allows.3. E-3 DMS Replacement of Avionics for Global Operations and Navigation (DRAGON) completes the FAA/International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)/EUROCONTROL (European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation) air traffic control mandated safety of flight capabilities. This program will provide the E-3 fleet with the flight instruments and other avionics for the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) and the surveillance and communication capabilities necessary to maintain continued critical unrestricted access to global airspace. Non-compliance will result in airspace restrictions and denials that will impact AWACS ability to support worldwide responses to situations requiring immediate on-scene Command and Control (C2) Battle Management (BM). The DRAGON modifications replace the existing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) Global Positioning System (GPS) Integrated Navigation System (GINS) with a modern Flight Management System (FMS) that will accommodate new capabilities including Mode 5 IFF and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). Also included as part of the modification is the addition of data link communications voice and data link digital radios and improved visual displays. Emphasis on employment of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) avionics is expected to lower cost reduce the tech refresh cycle and enhance life cycle management. Replacement of critical avionics subsystems that became unsustainable beginning in 2010 is included in the DRAGON program. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of DRAGON is being executed as a Cooperative Program between the US and NATO.4. E-3 Electronic Protection (EP): The EP program funds the development and retrofit of the E-3 AWACS radar processing capability including risk reduction and EMD activities.  EP will provide improved radar processing in a specific flight environment to meet a classified requirement.  Processing will initially address radar modes comprising 90% of operational AWACS radar usage.  EP will install an adjunct processor that works in parallel with the current Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) system.  The EP-processed radar picture will appear on the operator screen in place of the current RSIP output when the EP radar modes are selected.  The program will buy COTS equipment starting in FY17 including initial spares.   5.  E-3 Training Support and Infrastructure (TSI) provides continuing system engineering and management support for AWACS modernization and enhancement. These activities include managing the AWACS developmental infrastructure AWACS Development Integration Test Support (ADITS) support for equipment concurrency modernization planning/analysis trainer/simulator integration and concurrency as well as the Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL) and Advanced Development Lab #2 (ADL-2). The contractor maintained and operated E-3 Radar Systems Integration Lab/Software Development Facility (SIL/SDF) provides US Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and international customers with a functioning E-3 radar configuration to support radar development production and sustainment programs.  TSI efforts allow new support equipment technologies and test strategies to be analyzed to ensure concurrent capability to sustain existing modified and upgraded E-3 equipment. TSI supports trainer/simulator concurrency analysis and requirements definition to ensure trainers and simulators are kept current with the AWACS baseline. The overall Development Test and Evaluation (DT&E) test infrastructure supports development production and sustainment projects and maintains facilities to support AWACS aircraft during system and sub-system testing at Boeing Field WA.  Funding is shared between Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) and production funds.  The TSI assets also support multiple international Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) projects on a maintenance fee basis including projects for France Saudi Arabia United Kingdom Japan and North Atlantic Treaty (NATO) AEW&C efforts.6. E-3 Command and Control Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR): C2ISR system improvements investigate and develop future capabilities of the AWACS weapon system or next C2ISR platform. These efforts also include investigation analysis and development to ensure that AWACS successfully integrates with joint and coalition forces in a net-centric environment. C2ISR primarily supports pre-systems acquisition in the areas of material solution analysis and technology development. This is accomplished by prototyping and demonstrating capabilities required by the warfighter but also includes developing an E-3 Modernization & Sustainment Roadmap that projects user capability needs as well as material solutions for the user needs. 7. E-3 Internet Protocol Enabled Communication (IPEC): IPEC will provide the Block 40/45 E-3 with a wideband communications capability to connect to the Global Information Grid and will support net-centric operations/warfare.  The E-3 lacks an IP-enabled communication capability.  As a result the E-3 is not able to support a shortened digitized kill-chain of time sensitive targets.  IPEC will provide a roll-on/roll-off IP-enabled communications package supporting warfighter identified requirements for higher bandwidth SIPRNet and multi-domain networks.8. E-3 MIDS JTRS (Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System) will use Link 16 to establish a digital kill chain with in-theater combat forces/shooters.  Current 20 year old Class 2 terminal has sustainability/Dimishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues; does not support mandated Crypto Mod (CM) & Freq Remap (FR).  MIDS JTRS resolves DMS issues provides CM & FR  Link 16 enhancements & growth for Next Gen Tactical Data Link (TDL).9. AWACS current Combat Indentification (CID) capability has become unsustainable and requires update to stay current with current and evolving threats.  AWACS will address C2 CID shortfalls by upgrading existing capability to provide a persistent Air Moving Target Indicator (AMTI) Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) combat ID in support of the kill chain and decision superiority.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational Systems Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","3706.552","277","R2Long","",

Future JTC TRS development will provide the capability to network aircrew full mission trainers and training centers with other trainers including the Personnel Recovery training and rehearsal capability. This development effort will also integrate ASOCs with the Joint Theater Air to Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS) trainer for Joint Fires.  The PR capability is envisioned to be a "plug and play" module for the host JTC TRS. The PR capability will provide Para-rescue (PJ) personnel with an immersive LVC environment to plan train and rehearse their employment rescue/recovery and combat trauma care skills.  JTC TRS will host the network connection to conduct distributed training and rehearsal with other Recovery Forces.  The simulator will supplement live field training and live tissue training to provide realistic introductory proficiency currency and upgrade training in a simulated battlefield disaster or humanitarian relief environment for Air Force PJs.b. JTAGSS is a continuation of the ASOC simulation trainer initially funded in 2009 and complements the JTC TRS trainer by providing a total air-ground constructive simulation environment for integrated networked training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop JTAC/CCT and ASOC/SOF (Special Operations Forces) C2 (Command and Control) battle staff skills.  JTAGSS will provide the ASOC SOF and TACP (Tactical Air Control Party) with the vertical and horizontal C2 communications and coordination training and mission rehearsal required for mission effectiveness.   JTAGSS is required to train 400 ASOC personnel with limited to no live training opportunities to align with the AF move to using simulation for stand-alone and distributed training.  There are insufficient exercises and live training events available to meet mandated readiness requirements.  The system will include a secure network connection a constructive simulation environment generator with sharable databases computer work stations that have synthetic reflex agent applications for every ASOC/SOF crew position and an instructor/operator station.  This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts for systems both fielded or approved for full rate production that have been fully validated through formal Operation Utility Evaluation (OUE) and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","","","R2Long","",

It is a fixed-wing high performance single-engine fighter aircraft.  In its 35-year history the F-16 has proven itself in combat in a variety of air-to-air and air-to-surface missions such as offensive and defensive counter-air close air support forward air control air interdiction (day/night and all-weather) and suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD)/destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD).  The F-16 remains the USAF's primary SEAD/DEAD platform.  The aircraft has evolved in its capabilities by capitalizing upon advancements made in computers avionics systems engines and structures technologies.  The F-16 has been selected by more than 20 air forces around the world and foreign military sales (FMS) production continues in the 21st century.  AFLCMC/WWM (the F-16 System Program Office) develops integrates and qualifies systems to enhance the overall performance of the F-16 mission.  Enhancements that are being or will be developed during the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) include:  a. Operational Flight Program (OFP) Development:  Block 40/42/50/52 OFPs (M-series tapes) are updated continually to integrate new precision weapons advanced targeting pods improved avionics and hardware (HW) and software (SW) mods to keep the F-16s their respective training simulators and other hardware Group B subsystems current.  To keep this legacy platform combat capable OFPs are designed for release on a three-year cycle.  Generally three major or minor tapes are under development/testing at any one time.  Extensive ground and flight testing is required to field each M-series tape.  Advanced weapons integration includes Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM) and Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM Laser JDAM) Small Diameter Bomb (SDB and SDB II) Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) AIM-120D Sidewinder (AIM-9X/AIM-9X Block II) and updates to existing weapons.  Weapons integration also includes tasks such as performing risk reduction activities on advanced weapon integration developing and integrating advanced racks pylons adapters and the universal armament interface (UAI) and ensuring continued nuclear surety safety and compatibility with upgrades such as the integration of the B61-12.  Updates to electronic warfare systems allow for incorporation of the latest updates for changing threat environment reducing war-fighter vulnerabilities.  Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) HW block upgrades provides the F-16s with a secure jam resistant high-capacity data communications link with other combat aircraft airborne control aircraft and ground control centers. The new major capabilities currently being integrated via M6.5/M7+ include GPS inertial navigation set (GPS/INS) updates to improve targeting accuracy and GPS security AIM-120D joint mission planning system (JMPS).  As part of the Source of Repair Assignment Process (SORAP) decision the OFP development has transitioned from Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (LM Aero) to Ogden Air Logistics Complex (OO-ALC) 309th Software Maintenance Group (309 SMXG). LM Aero will produce the common USAF/European Participating Air Forces (EPAF) core software tape for USAF M6.5+ that will serve as the baseline for the USAF M7+ OFP. The 309 SMXG has software development responsibility for the M7+ SW/HW candidates for the USAF jets fielding in FY16.  M7.2+ Minor Tape is currently in early stages of program planning candidate definition and test HW procurement to incorporate DoD mandates such as Airborne Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS B-Out) as well as other Combat Air Forces (CAF) candidates including color display and Advanced Defensive Electronic Warfare (EW) System coordination.  M8+ is in early stages of program planning for incorporating Modular Mission Computer (MMC) architecture.  b. F-16 Block 40-52 Legacy Service Life Extension Program (SLEP): A two-phased RDT&E effort which includes Full Scale Durability Test (FSDT) and Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) to support structural modifications to Block 40/42/50/52 F-16 aircraft to increase service life.  FSDT required preliminary structural analysis construction of a test fixture and modification of an aircraft to begin testing. FSDT is required to prove finite element models and to develop the airworthiness certification basis to extend the current Certified Service Life (CSL) from 8000 Equivalent Flight Hours (EFH) to 10000 EFH (Threshold) or 12000 EFH (Objective).  In accordance with the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program and MIL-STD 1530C testing will support Blk 40/42/50/52 structural upgrade program that replaces or reworks known life-limited structure to preclude the onset of widespread fatigue damage maintain safety of flight and enhance aircraft availability beyond 8000 hours.  EMD is required to develop the engineering solutions necessary to resolve the life-limiting structural issues defined in FSDT and develop the airworthiness certification recommendation. The Government will receive a re-procurement technical data package to support production of kits and installs maintenance Technical Orders Time Compliance Technical Orders manufacturing and installation tools and all drawing packages necessary to sustain the SLEP modified aircraft through the extended certified service life.  c. Auto Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto GCAS):  Builds upon the Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) fighter risk reduction program (FRRP) demonstrated capability and results in the Auto GCAS capability being production ready for incorporation in the M6.2+ OFP (Minor Tape) fielding in FY14 with potential for nearly eliminating controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents a leading cause of F-16 loss of pilots and aircraft.    d. EMD Hardware/Advanced Capability Improvements:  EMD HW provides funding to develop test and qualify weapon systems aircraft subsystems replaced or modified due to requirements changes pre-planned product improvements (P3I) diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) and parts obsolescence.  The approach to contracting varies by individual project.  These hardware improvements include but are not limited to flight systems improved navigation multiplex architecture MMC advanced hi-speed digital data communication and throughput and memory upgrades within the aircraft systems. Updates are periodically made to improve performance of subsystems such as embedded GPS inertial navigation set (EGI) air-to-air interrogator (AAI) digital video recorder advanced data transfer equipment (ADTE) and related data transfer and retrieval devices displays and display generators radio/communication gear and data link improvements.  Advanced capability improvements include software integration sensor upgrades radar updates and other self-protection/electronic protection (EP) enhancements 4th/5th gen fighter network communications lab and/or on-aircraft evaluation of potential subsystem changes/capability improvements.  These capability improvements also include integration of targeting pod updates and tech order changes  e.g. SNIPER targeting pod High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) targeting system (HTS) low altitude infrared targeting and navigation LITENING tageting pod etc.  Advanced capabilities also include integration of new replacement hardware for DMS crash survivable data recorder. e. Modular Mission Computer (MMC) / Display Generator Upgrade:  The MMC upgrade resolves short falls in mission computer memory and throughput brought on by the addition of incremental combat capability over the last three OFP cycles.  Funding includes non-recurring engineering (NRE) design development integration and ground/flight test for fielding with the M8+ OFP.  The addition of an Ethernet port facilitates future increments of combat capability (e.g. digital targeting pod video).  The Display Generator Upgrade allows a fully integrated Multi-Function Display System (MFDS) solution including Hands On Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) integration with Sensors of Interest (SOI) format swapping and high definition video on 4"x4" displays; provides improved display formats during dynamic maneuvers; resolves symbol freezing issues due to throughput constraints; and provides a sustainable approach to address growing DMS concerns with the current Programmable Display Processor (PDG).f. F-16 Training Simulators:  The F-16 simulators enable the USAF to exercise and train using the latest available F-16 Fighting Falcon capabilities available to all block configurations while reducing the overall cost of training the Armed Forces to include both aircrew and maintenance trainers.  In order to maintain concurrency with the aircraft OFP this funding supports development test and integration of simulator upgrade efforts such as OFP development.  Reductions in unit flying hour programs through the FYDP increase the need for high fidelity combat crew training devices that are capable of simulating the full range of anticipated combat and combat support missions.  g. The JASSM-ER (Extended Range):  This capability integrates JASSM-ER on F-16 Blk 40/42/50/52 aircraft and includes NRE test assets SEEK EAGLE integration and test.  This capability will be fielded in conjunction with a future OFP delivery.   This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","","","R2Long","",

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. Program Management Administration costs include Federally Funded Research and Development Centers and Advisory and Assistance Service.  AFWWS provides timely accurate consistent and relevant space and terrestrial weather information for global battlespace situational awareness. AFWWS supports worldwide operations of Air Force and Army warfighters Special Operation Forces and other government agencies with weather observing and forecasting capabilities at home station and deployed locations as well as centralized reach-back centers.  AFWWS activities align under four capability areas:  Weather Data Collection Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination Weather Forecasting and Product Tailoring/Warfighter Applications.  This alignment ensures an integrated and systems-oriented approach to program management decisions.  Weather Data Collection provides automated terrestrial and space environmental sensing capabilities at fixed and deployed locations worldwide. Projects include Next Generation Radar and Upper Air Observing Follow-On.  FY15 funding will enhance computations based on dual-polarization technology for improved severe weather detection and rainfall amount forecasting and will begin operationalizing new upper air sounding capability using laser technology.  Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination provides a net-centric infrastructure that assimilates worldwide sources of terrestrial and space weather data and produces decision-quality information for warfighters.  Improved analysis of real-time weather information supports DoD's Warfighting and Enterprise Information Environment Mission Areas as well as DoD's role in transformation of the National Airspace System through the Next Generation Air Transportation System and finally enhances Air Force energy security plans. In FY15 Air Force Weather-Web Services (AFW-WEBS) moves into this capability area from Weather Forecasting to better align its function of integration of net-centric capabilities. FY15 funding will continue development of incremental software enhancements and integration of improved analysis capabilities including processing of data from new environmental sensing satellite sources for DoD Data Center 14866.Weather Forecasting provides advanced scientific numerical weather prediction capabilities for automated high resolution forecast products for mission execution rehearsal and planning. Weather Forecasting includes projects for Numerical Weather Modeling Environmental Data Cube Support System and the Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System.  FY15 funding will continue development of software to integrate advanced terrestrial and space weather forecast capabilities to improve models for warfighter operations.

When applicable this includes joint efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  ATCALS funding focuses on three main efforts as follows: Deployable Instrument Landing System (D-ILS).  D-ILS is a deployable Category I (200ft decision height/2400ft runway visual range) ILS with remote monitoring and maintenance capabilities.  D-ILS will provide precision approach capability in adverse weather conditions for contingency operations and humanitarian or disaster relief operations.  D-ILS will replace the current Air Force mobile Precision Approach Radar (PAR) system used to support operations at deployed locations which were procured in the 1970s are manpower intensive and logistically unsupportable.  On average only 18% (three of 17 systems) of the mobile PAR systems are operational on a daily basis.  D-ILS will support increased operations in the area of responsibility allow phase out of the currently obsolete legacy systems and provide interoperability with the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF).  The D-ILS Capability Development Document (CDD) was approved by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) on 16 Sep 08.  No development funds are requested in FY15.  As discussed under D-ILS accomplishments/plans in Section C the D-ILS development contract was terminated on 6 Nov 13.  Using an updated Systems Requirements Document and lessons learned from the terminated effort a restructured program is now planned and evaluation of responses to an industry request for information is on-going.  At least one production ready deployable system is available for evaluation.  Related OPAF funds are in program element (PE) 0305114F (Weapon System Code 833010).Deployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON).  D-RAPCON will replace the 40 year old AN/MPN-14K and AN/TPN-19 Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and Operations Shelter (OPS) subsystems with state of the art digital systems.  Modification and overhaul of the existing systems has proven to be ineffective due to diminishing manufacturing sources.  The D-RAPCON will be used to provide both a terminal and enroute surveillance capability.  The D-RAPCON will also be used with the D-ILS and a fixed or mobile control tower to provide a complete air traffic control capability.  The D-RAPCON will support tactical military and worldwide humanitarian operations and also provide a capability to support domestic disaster relief.  The primary surveillance radar coverage (non-cooperative targets) is out to 60 nautical miles (nm) and the secondary surveillance radar coverage (cooperative targets) is out to 120 nm.  The D-RAPCON CDD was approved by the AFROC on 8 Feb 11.  FY15 funds continue engineering manufacturing and development (EMD) efforts which include the contractor testing of the preproduction system and the start of developmental testing.  Related OPAF funds are in the PE 0305114F Weapon System Code 833010.  Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  This is an interagency effort designed to enable the transition from a ground infrastructure dominated Air Traffic Management capability for the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) to a capability that leverages advances in Performance Based Navigation (PBN) non-radar based surveillance services and transition from solid-state analogue voice communications to networked digital voice and data exchange.  Per Deputy Secretary of Defense direction (28 Dec 07 Memo) the Air Force is the DoD lead Service for NextGen implementation and architecture development.  NextGen will be built on key elements from existing programs and technologies and on new systems under development.  As these technologies and architectures mature ground system upgrades will be coordinated and fielded concurrently with aircraft avionics capabilities that are acquired and integrated into Air Force aircraft (manned and unmanned).  These efforts will also run in close parallel with the Communication Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) program in PE 0305099F.  FY15 efforts continue proof of concept demonstrations and analysis leading to Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA).  The concept demonstration will explore development of a transportable/scalable sensor agnostic configuration to provide GBSAA Pilot-in-the-loop display services using fixed or deployable radar system inputs.  FY15 funding also continues development/test of new Instrument Procedures Development System (IPDS) software (joint effort with FAA and Services) NextGen Lead Service Office tasks which include preparation of NextGen Concept of Operations and Implementation Plans PBN and ADS-B Benefits/Business Cases a DoD Integrated Work Plan RPA GBSAA Engagement Plan and a DoD NextGen Enterprise Architecture Strategic Roadmap.  Other NextGen efforts include upgrade of surveillance radar and automation systems with new capabilities such as Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe and evaluation of NAS Networked Digital Voice Switch and Next Generation Ground Communications (NEXCOMM) radios in USAF air traffic control facilities and RPA pilot control stations.  In total these efforts will support the seamless integration of RPAs into the National Airspace System and the airspaces of other nations improve the display of aircraft position to air traffic controllers determine future requirements for digital communications with manned and unmanned aircraft and enhance flight safety.

These operations include littoral open ocean and over land surveillance anti-surface warfare over-the-horizon targeting counter-drug operations power projection antisubmarine warfare mining search and rescue and special operations. The missions are supported by the Tactical Operations Centers (formerly Tactical Support Centers) the Mobile Tactical Operations Centers (formerly Mobile Operations Control Centers) and the Joint Mobile Ashore Support Terminal. TacMobile C2 systems are based on the Global Command and Control System - Maritime architecture which is Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment compliant.Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M):  GCCS-M is the Maritime implementation of the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) Family of Systems (FoS).  It supports decision making at all echelons of command with a single integrated scalable C4I system that fuses correlates filters maintains and displays location and attribute information on friendly hostile and neutral land sea and air forces integrated with available intelligence and environmental information.  It operates in near real-time and constantly updates unit positions and other situational awareness data.  GCCS-M also records data in appropriate databases and maintains a history of changes to those records.  System users can then use the data to construct relevant tactical pictures using maps charts topography overlays oceanographic overlays meteorological overlays imagery and all-source intelligence information coordinated into a Common Operational Picture that can be shared locally and with other sites.  Navy commanders review and evaluate the general tactical situation plan actions and operations direct forces synchronize tactical movements and integrate force maneuver with firepower.  The system operates in a variety of environments and supports joint coalition and allied forces.  GCCS-M is implemented Afloat and at Ashore fixed command centers.  Mission Planning:  The Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) is the designated automated mission planning system for the Navy.  JMPS enables weapon system employment by providing the information automated tools and decision aids needed to rapidly plan aircraft weapon or sensor missions load mission data into aircraft and weapons and conduct post-mission analysis.  JMPS is a mission critical system which is a co-development effort between the United States Navy (USN) and United States Air Force (USAF). Common requirements are identified and capabilities are developed and prioritized in an evolutionary approach.  An individual JMPS Mission Planning Environment (MPE) is a combination of the JMPS framework common capabilities and the necessary system hardware required to satisfy mission planning objectives.  Most Tactical Naval Aviation platforms are dependent solely on JMPS to plan precision guided munitions sensor systems tactical data links secure voice communications and basic Safety of Flight functions.  The following type/model/series (T/M/S) naval aircraft are supported by JMPS:  AH-1W F/A-18 A-F E-2C EP-3E EA-6B AV-8B S-3 V-22 Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) EA-18G MV-22 C-2 MH-53E P-3 Aircraft Carrier Intelligence Center (CVIC) SH-60B/F HH-60H CH-53D/E CH-46E UH-1N VH-3/VH-60 AH-1Z UH-1Y MH-60R/S and E-2D. All of the aforementioned T/M/S are required to transition to Microsoft Windows 7 before Microsoft XP support ends April 2014 by using Framework (FW) Version 1.3.5. An extension of Windows XP is planned to allow all naval aircraft to be supported during the transition.  Future JMPS platforms include: MQ-4C (Triton) and H-53K.  The next JMPS architecture version will support net-centric goals by providing route "publish and subscribe" capabilities transition to 64 bit and emerging technology and Information Assurance (IA) requirements.

The Department of Defense (DoD) has defined a DCGS architecture that will be compatible and interoperable across all of the Services' Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems and operations. DCGS accesses and ingests data from space borne airborne subsurface and surface ISR collection assets intelligence databases and intelligence producers. This collected data is shared across a Joint enterprise using the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) and in time the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) to enhance access and sharing of ISR information across Joint forces through the use of common enterprise standards and services. DCGS FoS supports Joint Task Force (JTF)-level and below combat operations with critical intelligence for battle management and information dominance across the full spectrum of operations including peace conflict war and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). DCGS is a cooperative effort between the services agencies and DoD to provide systems capable of receiving processing exploiting and disseminating data from airborne and national reconnaissance platforms. DCGS-N core components include the Analyst Work Station from the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) - Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (I3) Generic Area Limitation Environment (GALE) Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Common Geo-positioning Services (CGS) Image Product Library (IPL) Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB) Joint Concentrator Architecture (JCA) and Track Management Services. The DCGS-N system represents the integration of 1) The processing and exploitation of tactical and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) and Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); 2) Precision target geopositioning mensuration and imagery dissemination capabilities; 3) Selected national IMINT requirements and processing capabilities from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA); and 4) Sharing of Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance and Targeting and Command and Control information via DIB DI2E and Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) standards with a wide range of customers (e.g. Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M)) Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) and many others. The DCGS-N Enterprise Node (DEN) which incorporates current DIB standards and DI2E policy facilitating interoperability and data sharing among the DCGS FoS. DCGS-N ensures compliance with the DoD DCGS network architecture.  The Navy is focusing on establishing an ISR Enterprise way ahead that will emphasize a reach back strategy to provide intelligence products to support deployed ship and shore operations. The Navy will also migrate to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that requires the development integration and testing of a Maritime ISR Enterprise capability development and migration of ISR SOA applications and development and integration to leverage a Common Computing Environment (CCE). Additionally DCGS-N will become the focal point for migration of Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) fusion and analysis (MFAS) tool applications for the Navy. DCGS-N Increment 2 addresses a critical shortfall in Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) capability and capacity to support operational tactical planning and execution across the full range of joint military operations. Existing TCPED shortfalls will be exacerbated by planned Navy Joint and Allied fielding of new Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms. Currently fielded systems provide localized processing capabilities that will be overwhelmed in future years without a significant change in the way the Navy processes exploits and disseminates intelligence data. DCGS-N Increment 2 will deliver all source fusion and analytical capabilities; provide Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) capabilities and integrate Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) capabilities to improve the use and analysis of sensor and platform data. Distributed Common Ground System- Navy (DCGS-N) Increment 2 will be based on an enterprise solution to share this information across commands services and agencies to promote shared situational awareness. DCGS-N Increment 2 consists of multiple releases. The first release provides an enhanced Navy Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) enterprise that converges and builds on the DCGS-N Increment 1 and Maritime Domain Awareness Enterprise Nodes; leverages the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E); is compliant with the Common Computing Environment (CCE); federates ISR and TCPED workflow and production improving throughput through automation; exploits new and evolving unmanned systems sensor data; provides Multi-Intelligence (Multi-INT) cross-queuing and modular tools. The second release enhances afloat ISR capabilities by providing a set of software centric tools providing Multi-INT fusion and analysis behavior prediction and intelligent knowledge management designed to operate in disconnected or denied communications environment. Follow-on releases will be developed based on Fleet requirements.Intelligence Carry-On Program (ICOP) is a suite of multi-source intelligence and analytical capabilities which includes an integrated Three-Dimensional (3-D) operational picture displaying intelligence and other data sources to provide a richer and more complete picture of the battle space on Unit Level platforms.

The popular name Triton was approved for the MQ-4C UAS in June 2012 designating the RQ-4 Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) as the MQ-4C Triton. The MQ-4C Triton is a high altitude-long endurance UAS designed to provide Fleet and combatant commanders with persistent maritime Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) of nearly all the world's high-density sea-lanes littorals and areas of national interest. Envisioned as an unmanned adjunct to the P-8A Multi-Mission Maritime Aircraft and crucial to the recapitalization of Navy's airborne maritime ISR capability the system will seek to leverage Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force manpower training and maintenance efficiencies.The MQ-4C air vehicle is based on Northrop Grumman's Block 20 Global Hawk and features sensors designed to provide near worldwide coverage through a network of five orbits inside and outside continental United States with sufficient air vehicles to remain airborne for 24 hours a day 7 days a week out to ranges of 2000 nautical miles. Onboard sensors will provide detection classification tracking and identification of maritime targets and include maritime radar electro-optical/infra-red and Electronic Support Measures systems. Additionally the MQ-4C will have a communications relay capability designed to link dispersed forces in the theater of operations and serve as a node in the Navy's FORCEnet strategy. Tactical-level data analysis will occur in real-time at shore-based mission control sites connected to the air vehicle via satellite communications. Further intelligence exploitation can be conducted at Fleet shore-based sites or aboard aircraft carriers and other ships.The MQ-4C Triton UAS will implement phased modifications within the acquisition program to pace capability with rapidly evolving technologies and threats to ensure the Navy maintains persistent ISR dominance through the system's lifecycle and to support the OPNAV N2/N6 Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance and Targeting (ISR&T) transition plan.  Modifications are intended to update Triton's Multi-Intelligence capabilities provide Counter Electronic Attack (CEA) upgrades a more robust electronic support capability and to continue improvements to baseline mission system payloads.  MQ-4C will play a significant role in the Sea Shield and FORCEnet pillars of Sea Power 21. In its Sea Shield role the system will rely on its key attribute of persistence to provide the supported combatant command or fleet commander with unparalleled situational awareness of the maritime battle space as it develops and sustains the common operational tactical picture. The system will also serve as a Fleet response plan enabler while acting as a trip wire for intelligence preparation of the environment. Additionally Triton UAS will be a FORCEnet enabler and relay platform directly connected to both the Global Information Grid and the Distributed Common Ground System-Navy information backbone.","","1512.368","373","","",

The program will replace the current fleet of M109 Family of Vehicles (FoV) consisting of the M109A6 Paladin Self Propelled Howitzer and M992A2 Field Artillery Ammunition Supply Vehicle (FAASV). PIM is an Army Modernization Program that addresses a critical capability gap created by the Non-Line of Sight Cannon termination in June of 2009 as well as obsolescence and size/weight and power (SWaP) issues in the M109 FoV current Fleet. The PIM system integrates current Bradley Fighting Vehicle suspension and drive train items Future Combat Systems (FCS) developed Electric Gun Drive systems and current fleet (M109A6) fire control systems into a new chassis that provides better force protection survivability and increased electrical power over the current fleet.  PIM is a two vehicle system:  Self Propelled Howitzer (SPH) and Carrier Ammunition Tracked (CAT). The SPH has all characteristics listed above.  The CAT utilizes all these same components and traits less those that relate directly to the cannon system. The PIM system replaces the current M109 FoV on a one for one basis in the cannon fires battalions in the Armored Brigade Combat Team Formations and the Echelons above Brigade (EAB). The overall intent is to increase Soldier force protection vehicle survivability provide an appropriate amount of SWaP capacity to add future capabilities reduce life cycle costs and extend the life of the M109 FoV through FY2050.The Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155) also known as the M777A2 provides direct reinforcing general support fires to maneuver forces and direct support artillery. It replaces all howitzers in all missions in the USMC and replaces the M198 howitzer as the general support artillery for light forces in the Army. The LW155 fires unassisted projectiles to a range of 15 miles and assisted projectiles to 19 miles. The addition of the digital fire control system enables the weapon to program and fire the improved Excalibur precision-guided munitions to ranges in excess of 25 miles with better than 10-meter Circular Error Probable (CEP) accuracy. The LW155 is the first ground combat system whose major structures are made of high strength titanium alloy and the system makes extensive use of hydraulics to operate the breech load tray recoil and wheel arms. The combination of titanium structures and the use of hydraulic systems resulted in a significant weight savings of 7000 lbs over the M198 system.  Compared to the M198 the LW155 emplaces three-times faster and displaces four-times faster. It traverses 32 percent more terrain worldwide and is 70 percent more survivable than the M198. It is a successful joint service program between the Marine Corps and Army working together to develop produce field and sustain the howitzer.The LW155 was first introduced into the Marine Corps in April 2005 and the Marines have now fielded the howitzer to all active units. The Army has fielded the howitzer to its Stryker Brigade Combat teams (SBCT) Fires Brigades and National Guard. Fielding of the Infantry Brigade Combat Teams(IBCT) will commence in FY14 and continue through 2018. The LW155 saw extensive action in Afghanistan receiving high marks for its performance.Having now been in the field for almost 10 years the howitzer will be going through obsolescent replacement of electronic components in its digital fire control system.  New start in FY-15.Funding supports engineering studies for capabilities identified in the Joint Operation Requirements Document (JORD) but deferred during Engineering Manufacturing and Development due to technology maturity cost and schedule.  This includes a digital direct fire site for the Digital Fire Control System and low temperature high density power solutions to achieve full operational requirements.","Beginning FY15 0604854A project 516 has been moved to new APE 0210609A project ED8.","","","","",

The NATO MEADS Management Agency (NAMEADSMA) is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) contracting authority providing management of the MEADS program on behalf of the participating nations and is responsible for managing the system acquisition. The U.S. and Italy signed the D&D MOU on September 24 2004 and September 27 2004 respectively. The NAMEADSMA awarded the MEADS D&D letter contract to MEADS International Inc. on September 28 2004 initiating the MEADS D&D phase. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was amended in March 2005 by the U.S. and Italy to allow the German Parliament additional time for their signature decision and on April 22 2005 Germany signed the MOU. NAMEADSMA awarded a $3.4 billion D&D definitized contract to MEADS International Inc. on May 31 2005.  MEADS is designed to provide joint and coalition forces critical asset and defended area protection against multiple and simultaneous attacks by short to medium range ballistic missiles cruise missiles manned and unmanned aerial systems and tactical air-to-surface missiles. MEADS is being developed to have a netted and distributed architecture with modular components to increase survivability and flexibility of employment in a number of operational configurations. The objective MEADS Fire Unit designed to be scalable and tailorable to operational requirements will consist of: two Battle Management Command Control Communication Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) tactical operations center (TOC) enabling distributed system operations and Beyond-Line-of-Site (BLOS) engagements for maximum protection of supported forces by engaging at longer ranges; six near-vertical launchers capable of transporting and launching up to eight missiles; three launcher reloaders; the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE)interceptor; an ultra-high frequency (UHF) Surveillance Radar (SR) that provides 360-degree coverage and near-range to long-range detection of low radar cross-section targets; and two X-band Multifunction Fire Control Radars (MFCR) that provide 360-degree coverage and are designed for high-precision handover to the in-flight missile discrimination capabilities and short-range target detection and horizon search.The U.S. rendered a MEADS program decision in Feb 2011 to continue the D&D phase focusing remaining activities to implement a "demonstration of capabilities" through Mar 2014 with the remaining MOU funds to provide a meaningful capability for Germany and Italy and a possible future option for the U.S.  Based on this decision NAMEADSMA developed a new D&D detailed program schedule and the Board of Directors (BoD) approved it via a signed contract amendment on 31 October 2011.The PAC-3 system is continuously being improved via hardware and software changes. The latest missile improvement is the MSE and has been accepted as the baseline missile for MEADS.  It is being developed by the U.S. for PATRIOT to meet U.S. operational requirements. The MSE will provide a more agile and lethal interceptor that increases the engagement envelope/defended area of PATRIOT and the MEADS systems. The MSE improves upon the current PAC-3 missile capability with a higher performance solid rocket motor modified lethality enhancer more responsive control surfaces upgraded guidance software and insensitive munitions improvements.

Lessons learned from the two STSS-D satellites are guiding decisions on the development of a fiscally sustainable continuously available future operational constellation and ground communications/processing system. STSS-D is providing risk reduction for future MDA space-layer options models algorithms sensors and spacecraft development by providing background and clutter scene characterization complex target signatures interface definition communications architectures and performance across acquisition tracking and discrimination. STSS-D is also providing definition to BMDS Concept of Operations timelines and performance requirements for sensor cuing and weapons engagement such as Aegis Launch On/Engage On from remote space sensors. STSS-D will emphasize continued research and development to address the more sophisticated threats the Agency expects to encounter in the far term. The greatest protection against missile defense threats of all ranges remains a highly available early missile tracking capability from space. Space sensors provide the most cost effective and operationally suitable means of providing global persistent surveillance and engagement directly addressing the number one missile defense priority need for Combatant Commanders. STSS-D is a capability development activity for the demonstration of technologies to support development and capability delivery of future MDA space-layer options.  In addition the STSS-D satellites have demonstrated the ability of a space sensor to provide high precision real time tracking of missiles and midcourse objects thus enabling simultaneous regional theater and strategic missile defense systems to be cued to track well beyond their organic detection capability. Data from on-going STSS-D testing has validated the ability to track cold midcourse objects from space and close the fire control loop with BMDS interceptors. During several MDA flight tests STSS-D has provided data in real-time that has met the Aegis Missile Defense Systems' Quality of Service (QoS) data requirements for Remote Engagement Authorized (REA). Finally STSS-D provides a new infrared sensor phenomenology for the BMDS that will demonstrate the benefit of future MDA space-layer capabilities when combined with radars that will provide robustness against current and advanced countermeasures. The Missile Defense Agency has developed and is testing two STSS-D satellites to demonstrate key functions of space sensors in support of risk reduction for future MDA space-layer options. STSS-D Element Level testing is funded as part of a capabilities development program and reflected in the Program Element submission. Element testing is based on an integrated comprehensive and phased test program. Element systems subsystems and components were tested early in development prior to conducting Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) level testing. Key data from the STSS-D satellites efforts continue to provide lessons learned as MDA pursues longer term space sensor needs. - STSS-D Satellites have demonstrated the capability of satellites to track ballistic missiles and the ability to provide accurate tracking information to the BMDS battle manager to close the fire control loop with BMDS interceptors thus extending the effective range of BMDS interceptors and other sensors- Space-based Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) sensors will extend coverage to a global level - Space-based sensors are not limited by basing rights issues or deployment decisions and will allow cost effective coverage of countries and large areas not accessible from ground based sensors. - Space based visible and infrared (IR) sensors will complement radars and contribute to a sensor architecture more robust to countermeasures - Space-based sensors will enable near continuous threat observation and tracking from launch to intercept covering threats by augmenting the coverage of the BMDS radars and providing state vectors to Command and Control Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) to enable interceptor fire control via multiple BMDS assets (Aegis Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)) Goals for Space Tracking and Surveillance System Demonstration (STSS-D) Satellites - Risk reduction for future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) space-layer architectures by demonstrating Aegis Engage on Remote - Risk reduction for future MDA space-layer architectures by demonstrating the ability to cue or be cued- Demonstrate C2BMC interfaces sensor registration communication chains and latencies to support future MDA space-layer concept of operations development Near Field Infrared Experiment (NFIRE) The NFIRE technology project was designed to collect near field phenomenology data for use in developing plume to hard body handover algorithms for boost phase interceptor programs. MDA used this data to validate the models and simulations that are fundamental to developing the guidance and endgame homing algorithms. NFIRE is now focused on future MDA space-layer sensors risk reduction and other BMDS element development support by collecting background clutter and target signatures for modeling and algorithm development and validation. A secondary objective of the experiment has been to collect hyper-temporal short wave infrared and visible data for assessing early launch detection and tracking capability. The experiment includes three plume signature mission types: targets of opportunity dedicated fly-bys and ground observations. The dedicated fly-by experiments have been accomplished. The NFIRE satellite also carries a Laser Communication Terminal which has been and continues to be used to conduct communication experiments with the German Terra SAR-X satellite. These experiments test low earth orbit satellite-to-ground and satellite-to-satellite capabilities of the terminal for potential incorporation into the BMDS. Data products are utilized by multiple programs to improve missile engagement performance.

NDEP’s portfolio provides short medium and long-term solutions to the perfect storm of workforce challenges which include: (1) impending retirement of 33 percent of DoD’s STEM workforce; (2) low college readiness rate and interest in STEM majors; and (3) challenges that DoD like other Federal employers face in recruiting and retaining high-quality STEM talent in a competitive environment.NDEP aligns to the DoD Science and Technology (S&T) priorities and the integrated STEM/Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MIs) program synchronized with the Federal 5-Year STEM Strategic Plan the DoD STEM Strategic and Implementation Plans and the DoD Strategic Workforce Plan (in progress).  NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation as required by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.Science Mathematics and Research for Transformation (SMART) awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 academic STEM disciplines and moves graduates directly into DoD's workforce following graduation.  Internships engage SMART scholars in hands-on authentic research and work experiences in DoD facilities thereby enhancing their educational experience and building a public service commitment to the Department’s mission.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005 SMART has supported ~1455 students from bachelor to doctoral levels and to date ~900 have completed program studies and transitioned into the DoD workforce.  SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of high-quality U.S. technical talent prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD ready to apply their technical knowledge skills and abilities to fulfill DoD’s mission. National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) currently supports 29 world-class researchers (NSSEFF Fellows) in scientific areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional future talent.  The NSSEFF Fellows work with ~100 undergraduate students ~270 graduate students and ~150 post-doctoral scholars at their respective academic institutions.  Three cohorts of NSSEFF Fellows with the first selected in FY 2008 provides a critical resource for connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise. Fellows’ work spans all seven DoD S&T priorities and defines a broad set of emerging scientific research areas critical to the development of future DoD technologies.  NSSEFF Fellows serve as speakers at DoD events reviewers on panels for DoD science and as collaborators with scientists and engineers at DoD’s laboratories and other research facilities.  The NSSEFF program is realigned to PE 0601110D8Z Basic Research Initiatives in FY 2015.NDEP Pre-Kindergarten (PK)-12 engages develops and attracts STEM talent for future DoD military and civilian workforce needs via 68 local sites and nine national organizations.  NDEP PK-12 leverages the DoD’s STEM expertise to connect students teachers schools and public sector and industry partners with DoD subject matter experts (SMEs) primarily in those communities adjacent to DoD laboratories and bases where the talent pool resides.  Authentic STEM experiences for teachers and students include hands-on activities that are aligned with DoD’s technical workforce requirements.  Since FY 2007 NDEP PK-12 has increased the number of DoD facilities that directly engage local education authorities (LEAs) to: (1) build student interest in STEM fields and disciplines and in careers specific to DoD; (2) develop DoD-relevant science engineering and mathematics skills; and (3) provide future talent to fulfill DoD’s demand for highly skilled STEM professionals.

The Minerva Research Initiative is a university-based social science basic research program directed from within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and executed by the Services consistent with the January 2012 priorities document "Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense" and the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) requirements.  This program seeks to build a deeper understanding of the social cultural and political forces that shape regions of the world of strategic importance to the United States.  Deeper understanding of the cultural and political environments where threats such as radical actors and regime disruptions develop supports more effective strategic and operational policy decisions.The Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR) program funds initiatives to implement the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) strategic plan for defense basic research.  This plan defines specific and quantifiable actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of creating high-payoff transformative scientific breakthroughs for DoD.  The SSBR initiatives support the five aims of: (1) providing scientific leadership; (2) attracting the Nation’s best Scientists and Engineers (S&Es); (3) ensuring the coherence and balance of the Basic Research portfolio; (4) fostering connections between DoD performers and DoD; and (5) improving the efficiency of the defense research business environment.The National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program supports world-class researchers in scientific areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional talent.  NSSEFF provides a critical resource for connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise.  Fellows’ work spans all seven DoD S&T priorities and defines a broad set of emerging scientific areas.  Fellows serve as speakers at DoD events reviewers on panels for DoD science and as collaborators with DoD laboratory scientists and engineers.","The National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program is realigned from the National Defense Education Program (NDEP) program element (PE) 0601120D8Z to this PE beginning in FY 2015.This program element (PE) incorporates Minerva Research Initiative activities which include university-led basic research in social science and sponsored research faculty chair positions at defense education institutions and activities to implement the basic research office strategic plan for the Department of Defense (DoD).","","","","",

Projects are distributed among 10 mission categories in line with the interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG): Advanced Analytics and Capabilities Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat; Investigative Support and Forensics; Personnel Protection Physical Security; Surveillance Collection and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support;  Training Technology Development; and a new working group Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats.  The CTTS program is a diverse advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility or effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements.  It includes technology capability development proof-of-principle demonstrations in field applications and coordination to transition from development to operational use.  CTTS manages approximately 450 individual projects in support of Defense federal state local and international customers and partners. The CTTS program justified in the R-2 exhibit identifies the projects fully or partially funded by Congressional appropriations for the CTTS program.  However the Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office (CTTSO) develops technology and provides support using external funds provided by other DoD and other Federal Departments and International partnerships. These projects and support activities are not necessarily reflected in this justification R-2; but the number of activities do reflect positively on the trust and competence that CTTSO has earned throughout the Department and interagency to rapidly conduct critical RDT&E and provide innovative products.  In FY 2013 CTTS focused on DoD requirements that supported military forces in demanding or hostile environments such as Afghanistan Yemen Africa the Philippines Mexico and Colombia; by rapidly developing and delivering leading edge products such as tactical sensors and unmanned vehicles personal and physical protection user friendly apps for analytical tools and reference guides and weapons sights and ammo modifications.  Several of the highly successful products include Legacy human source information programs in Afghanistan and Mexico the Lighthouse and PALANTIR information collection and analysis systems the Enhanced Mortar Targeting System (EMTAS) and Insider Threat Situation Awareness Training. For U.S. federal state and local law enforcement and first responders CTTS improved personal protection equipment for chemical biological radiological nuclear and high explosive protection; as well as developed apps for interactive reference data to assist in identifying and neutralizing threat agents in the field and in laboratories.  CTTS also hosted interagency and foreign partner information exchange seminars and capability exercises to share and enhance response techniques and procedures for first responders.  FY14 plans for CTTS will continue to address combating terrorism requirements from Defense federal state local and international customers and partners at home and abroad.  As the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan accelerates CTTS will continue to address force protection needs for the remaining forces.  Additionally CTTS will increasingly address technology requirements requested from USSOCOM’s field components as they increase their regional operations tempo in other parts of the world. Special emphasis will be for the Theater SOF in Africa and to support Theater SOF in the Pacific in support of the National Strategy to shift focus towards the Pacific.  Specifically CTTS will address personnel and physical security for small forces deployed to austere and hostile environments. In parallel CTTS is increasing its support of the USMC as they reconstitute and improve the capacity and capabilities of the Marine Expeditionary Units.  Another area of increased emphasis that has become even more concerning will be the protection of U.S. personnel to include State Department personnel in embassy and consulate locations overseas that need increased security.  CTTS will continue to actively support the Department’s Homeland Defense mission at NORTHCOM including Defense support of civil authorities interagency coordination Special Operations support and security cooperation.  Consistent with that focus this office will also work to address Department of Defense Security requirements for advanced technology and capabilities that will (1) enhance security along the U.S. Southwest Border and (2) proactively address improvised devices and other chemical biological nuclear and radiological threats in a domestic environment.","","74.563","","R2Long","",

U.S. strategic guidance confirms that coalitions and relationships with international partners are high priorities for the nation and the Department of Defense.The Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) responds to this guidance by supporting DoD organizations that:  1) work with foreign partners to collaboratively address strategic technology gaps for current and future missions; 2) develop interoperability solutions for coalition operations; and 3) develop and strengthen defense relationships. CWP is the only Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) program with this mission. CWP supplements a U.S. Government proponent’s funding for cooperative efforts ensuring U.S. funds are sufficient to complete the engagement with the foreign partner(s).  When CWP funds are used to help fund a cooperative project that project leverages technical and financial contributions of the foreign partner(s) and speeds up the development and delivery of technical solutions to the warfighter.  In its thirteen-year history CWP has leveraged $4 of foreign partner funding for every $1 of U.S. Government investment and $3 of other U.S. Government funding for every $1 CWP has invested in cooperative projects. CWP funding enables DoD project teams to move a technology into the next stage of development or to complete and transition a technology to operational forces.

Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability readiness and safety and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD has been estimated at over 23 billion each year. The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010. (U) The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&L)) designated a Director Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies materials and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus technology development demonstration and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.   In addition the University Corrosion Collaboration (now the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC)) was formed as a collaboration between universities academies and research laboratories focused on corrosion technology research and development to provide solutions to long-term complex corrosion prevention and control problems including metallic-non-metallic interactions advanced surface coatings and treatments for non-traditional use of materials . This advanced corrosion research has been funded since FY 2008 and performed by teams from TCC participating organizations.In FY 2009 the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.(U) The Corrosion Prevention Control Integrated Product Team membership consists of both the equipment and infrastructure corrosion control experts from the Services the Joint Staff the Coast Guard and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  The Services are given technology development demonstration and transition project submission instructions evaluation procedures and selection criteria.  The CPC project selection board chaired by the Director Corrosion Policy and Oversight reviews the projects and makes recommendations to the USD(AT&L) for final approval.  Likewise members of the TCC are notified of advanced research requirements and provided instructions for submitting white papers and subsequent project proposals to the Science and Technology Working Integrated Product Team (WIPT) for evaluation selection and funding.(U) The former DoD Corrosion Executive issued a policy letter that states: "Basic systems design materials and processes selection and intrinsic corrosion-prevention strategies establish the corrosion susceptibility of Defense material.  The early stages of acquisition provide our best opportunity to make effective trade-offs among the many competing design criteria. . ."  The Congress and former DoD Corrosion Executive made it clear that research and development into materials and methods to prevent or mitigate corrosion should receive high priority.  Since Congress has clearly established this program as one of its highest priorities and has reiterated its expectations regarding funding levels and methods our budget request is designed to reflect both fiscal realities of one or more on many proposed projects over the next five to ten years. These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of storage tanks and other mission support facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of electrical and avionics equipment.  Likewise an array of highly effective rapid cure coatings that are easy to apply and can forestall corrosion for many years on aircraft and ships are being developed.  Other vital projects being considered include sealants wash down systems sensors and prognostic technologies that have joint service applications and potential to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects over a wide range of systems.  The FY 2014 budget request will provide a critically needed resource to trigger even larger investment and cost avoidance.","","34.249","","","",

It generally fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance. This mission has two key aspects.  First to develop and/or demonstrate and rapidly transition into use operational energy technologies or practices that will improve the Department’s military capabilities and/or reduce its costs. Second to establish within the military Services sustainable institutional capacity to continue to research develop and adopt operational energy innovations. OECIF funds serve as “seed money” to consolidate or start promising operational energy programs directions or changes to be sustained by the Services; accordingly OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs rather than one-off projects.P456 the Hybrid Energy Storage Module co-sponsored by ASD(R&E) and ASD(OEPP) develops advanced technology in energy storage to maximize performance and reliability and enable future high power weapons and sensor systems on legacy and next generation vehicles aircraft and ships. The goals of this program are to (1) demonstrate energy storage systems with high power and energy densities scalable to all power levels that reduce total logistics demand increase platform ability to sustain operations during engagement and (2) reduce maintenance. Once demonstration is complete this technology will be sustained by the Services. This program is closely coordinated with the Advanced Management and Protection of Energy-storage Devices (AMPED) program of the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E). AMPED technology will be used to potentially extend the operational performance benefits and safety for these applications beyond the hybrid storage module baseline design configurations.","","23.909","","","",

The diverse and complex Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) – nuclear biological and chemical threats – mission space requires an integrated approach towards capability development. Capability development must be based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The broad CWMD military strategic objectives and mission areas encompass many nontraditional capabilities for the Warfighter and CWMD is not an isolated mission set unique to DoD – it is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense. Accordingly developing an overall CWMD capability should and must leverage complementary capabilities through integration and synchronization. A global CWMD situational awareness capability will be established and deployed worldwide via current communications systems and common operating pictures in support of this mission.  This program will incorporate portfolio management tools and comprehensive analyses to enable a balanced and integrated CWMD systems portfolio an optimized CWMD force structure and the integration with and utilization of existing military assets to fill intelligence sensor and reconnaissance gaps in CWMD.This program also responds to the strategic needs outlined in the President's initiative stated in his April 2009 speech in Prague; the US Combatant Commands integrated priorities and requirements; the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review; and the FY12-16 Defense Planning and Programming Guidance by providing improved timeliness and relevance through modernizing CWMD support to the Combatant Commands Office of the Secretary of Defense Joint Staff Intelligence Community (IC) and other U.S. Government agencies as required.

Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements onto contracts; and research development test and evaluation activities. Defense exportability features plays a critically important role in United States Government/DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits by providing these resources up front then collecting ‘fair share’ non-recurring cost recoupment the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems. Funding is increased in FY14 to expand the number of systems included in the Defense Exportability Pilot Program that are used to define and implement DEF ‘best practice’ program management system engineering and program protection measures in the DoD acquisition process. Failure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs delayed delivery and higher risk of  sensitive technology compromise due to ad-hoc sales late in production.  Early development of export variants including systems design approaches to integrate adequate domestic and exportable anti-tamper (AT) protection and differential capability (DC) requirements to lower production costs increase quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends and enhance US industry share of the global marketplace.","","1.915","","","",

Operating forces have a critical need for defense against worldwide proliferation of CB warfare capabilities and for medical treatment of CB casualties.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) CB Defense initiatives both medical and non-medical.  This program element supports the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) of medical and physical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Projects within BA5 are structured to consolidate Joint and Service-unique tasks within four commodity areas: contamination avoidance individual and collective force protection decontamination and medical countermeasures.  This consolidation provides for development and operational testing of equipment for Joint Service use and for Service-unique requirements.  Contamination avoidance efforts under this system development program will provide U.S. forces with real-time hazard assessment capabilities.  They include multi-agent point and remote chemical detection for ground aircraft and shipboard applications; automated warning and reporting systems; integrated radiation detection and monitoring equipment; and enhanced battlefield reconnaissance capabilities.  Force protection efforts will increase protection levels while decreasing physical and psychological burdens imposed by protective equipment.  The Secretary of Defense is responsible for research development acquisition and deployment of medical countermeasure equipment and materiel to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD unlike those developed to support the U.S. population must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasize prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this SDD such as vaccines and chemical prophylaxis conserves fighting strength decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation and satisfy the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available efforts on this SDD support pre-hospitalization treatment en-route care hospital care and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include CB diagnostics and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic threats and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  The Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  The Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process ("One Portfolio").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research development acquisition and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research development and acquisition because of its unique facilities testing capabilities and trained and experienced personnel.  The projects in this program element support efforts in the engineering and manufacturing phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 5.","","","","","",

The DoD Teleport program has fielded system capabilities incrementally using a multi-generational approach with Generation 1 and 2 Full Deployment authorized by DoD Chief Information Officer on February 18 2011. DoD Teleport Generation 3 consists of three phases; Phases 1 and 2 are in Production and Deployment while Phase 3 is in Engineering and Manufacturing Development. Each DoD Teleport investment increases the warfighter’s ability to communicate with a world-wide net-centric set of information capabilities which is vital for the DoD to maintain a persistent presence among its adversaries.Currently the Teleport system operates as an upgrade of satellite communication capabilities at selected DoD satellite communications gateways. This system provides deployed warfighters with seamless worldwide multi-band SATCOM connectivity to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Service Delivery Nodes and legacy tactical command control communications computers and intelligence systems. It also provides centralized integration capabilities contingency capacity and common interfaces to access the DISN.DoD Teleport's goal is to provide secure seamless interoperable and economical upgrades to DoD SATCOM Gateways and meet the growing throughput requirements of the deployed warfighter.The primary beneficiaries of the DoD Teleport investment are the DoD Combatant Commanders Military Departments Defense Agencies and the warfighter. DoD Teleport Generation 3 is designed to meet the growing demands of the warfighter through the execution of the following phases:Phase 1: Gateway Advanced Extremely High Frequency [Extended Data Rate] terminals provides tactical users with a 350% bandwidth increase in survivable antijam communications through all peacetime and combat operations by installing Navy Multiband Terminals (NMT) at select Teleport sites. In addition to enhanced throughput the NMT maintains compatibility with legacy waveforms and current tactical terminals.Phase 2: Gateway Wideband Global SATCOM X/Ka-band terminals provides enhanced Wideband Global System (WGS) X/Ka capability to warfighters worldwide by installing terminals from the Modernization of Enterprise Terminal (MET) program at DoD Teleport and other gateway sites. This gateway enhancement allows Teleport to replace end-of-life Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) terminals while remaining interoperable with tactical WGS X/Ka-band users. The MET enhancement provides a 300% Ka-band capacity increase and an 1100% X-band capacity increase to current enterprise terminal X/Ka capabilities. Additionally it enables the DoD Teleport system to maintain operational availability consistent with Generation 2 requirements and reduce the overall life-cycle cost of X/Ka capabilities across the DoD.Phase 3: Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) to Legacy Ultra High Frequency (UHF) systems interoperability will provide interoperability between MUOS users and legacy UHF users by installing MUOS-to-Legacy UHF SATCOM Gateway Component (MLGC) suites of equipment at DoD Teleport sites. MUOS is the next generation DoD UHF SATCOM system that will provide the warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services utilizing the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access waveform for use in the military UHF SATCOM band. MLGC suites will provide critical continuity and interoperability as DoD tactical satellite users transition from legacy waveforms and radios to the Joint Tactical Radio System.","","29.922","","","",

Future JSTARS Recap efforts not in this program element include Air Vehicle & Avionics Systems; Data Voice & Advanced Communications Systems; and Systems Engineering & Integration (SE&I).  For further details on these future efforts see PE 0307581F.Activities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning/execution and future program planning.JSTARS Recap:The JSTARS Recap program was initiated to satisfy the JSTARS Mission Area capability gaps and life-cycle affordability challenges as defined in the Synthetic Aperture Radar/Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI); JSTARS Mission Area Analysis of Alternative (AoA) and the SAR/MTI BMC2 Initial Capabilities Document (ICD). The JSTARS Recap program consists of multiple efforts for the development and integration of all sub-systems necessary to satisfy the requirements documented in the ICD AOA and upon completion the Capability Development Document (CDD). The efforts include but are not limited to: BMC2 System and Sensor Systems; as well as related OSA development or refinement activities to improve AF weapon system life-cycle affordability. These efforts are detailed below.1. BMC2 System - The BMC2 System development effort builds upon a broad body of work in OSA by evaluating and applying lessons learned from system designs across many areas such as Air Operations Centers (AOC) AWACS Block 40/45 and the Open Mission Systems (OMS) Working Group. The BMC2 System will provide an on-board BMC2 solution that meets the Joint/Air Force Requirements as defined in the AoA ICD and CDD using an evolutionary approach made possible by an OSA design that firmly defines interfaces and messaging standards thereby enabling rapid technology insertion based on mission need and funds availability. The BMC2 System development effort will also inform the AF OSA concept and frameworks with regard to applicability and efficacy of on-board BMC2 mission systems.2. Sensor Systems - The Sensor Systems development effort intends to leverage the government owned platform-independent radar OSA enterprise specification to develop a modern radar that meets the Joint/Air Force Requirements as defined in the AoA ICD and CDD. JSTARS Recap is the first planned Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) to leverage this body of work. JSTARS Recap also takes into considerations lessons learned from the Dismount Detection Radar (DDR) Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) program which was a pathfinder for OSA radar in a small pod configured for surface surveillance missions. The JSTARS Recap Sensor Systems development effort will not only satisfy the requirements of the JSTARS Recap but also intends to provide critical feedback to an OSA radar concept and framework with regard to applicability and efficacy in a wide area surface surveillance mission. Other sensor systems may include but are not limited to Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and multi/hyper-spectral.Beginning in FY 2012 PE 0604283F funds the development of the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) which will replace the current legacy AN/TPS-75 radar.  3DELRR will be the principal United States Air Force (USAF) long-range ground-based sensor for detecting identifying tracking and reporting aerial targets for the Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) through the Theater Air Control System (TACS).  3DELRR will respond to the operational need to detect and report highly maneuverable small radar cross section targets to enable battlefield awareness while at the same time mitigating the reliability maintainability and sustainability issues plaguing the AN/TPS-75 radar system.  The 3DELRR will provide air controllers with a precise real-time air picture of sufficient quality to conduct control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions.  It will replace the aging USAF AN/TPS-75 radar system as the AN/TPS-75 is incapable of detecting some current and emerging threats.  In addition as the AN/TPS-75 is reaching the end of its service life it is more difficult and costly to maintain.  The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is considering 3DELRR as a potential replacement for the AN/TPS-59 at the end of its service life to support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Commander through the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS).  3DELRR will address system sustainability transportability and operational availability shortfalls while providing long-range surveillance detection and tracking of Air Breathing Targets (ABTs) and potentially Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBMs).  This capability will support the USAF contribution to the primary roles of the Airspace Control Authority (ACA) and the Area Air Defense Commander (AADC) and enhance the USAF contributions to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) mission area. This new radar will provide the USAF Control and Reporting Center (CRC) and if purchased by the USMC the Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC) with real-time data to display air activity.  The Pre-Engineering & Manufacturing Development (Pre-EMD) efforts of the 3DELRR Program began in FY 2012 and continued through FY 2013.  Acquisition activities included but were not limited to: full and open source selection to award up to three competing contracts; requirements refinement; completion of the preliminary design development; continued software and hardware subsystem-level development; modeling and simulation to support the system development; implementation of mitigation techniques to combat existing and emerging system threats (including cyber warfare) test planning and implementation of the program protection plan. A Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Capability Demonstration C Event were conducted during this timeframe to ensure success in the development of a preliminary system design.  Activities also included studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning as well as Milestone (MS) B documentation and preparation for a MS B review.","In FY 2013 PE 0604283F includes Congressional funding added for the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) Recapitilization (Recap).  This program is in Budget Activity 04 Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P).

This development activity will replace three standby flight indicators (attitude indicator altimeter and airspeed indicator) with a more reliable/supportable commercial off-the-shelf display that combines all necessary flight information into one device.   If the primary flight instruments are lost SCAI will continue to provide the primary flight information needed to fly the aircraft.  Standby instrumentation must be functional and reliable in the event of primary flight display failure and is a Mission-Essential Subsystem List (MESL) item required for flight.  Upgrades to the B-1B flight test aircraft are included in the modernization programs to keep the test flight systems current.  RDT&E funded test jets are currently configured with Engineering Manufacture and Development (EMD) Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) for CITS FIDL and VSDU.  Replacement of the EMD LRUs is required to bring two flight test aircraft to fleet representative configuration.  Maintenance and logistic support from the manufacturer is required until the Air Force supply chain is established.  Replacement of the LRUs will ensure maximum supportability maintainability and reliability for continued and future flight tests.  Additionally program funds cover engineering/planning studies related engineering efforts and auxiliary equipment needed for development programs that have not yet fielded.  Cost includes Program Management Administrative (PMA) costs and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements including efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities safety supportability maintainability reliability and total ownership cost.  All B-1B development programs support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases.

Historically aircraft systems change missions tactics and environments (including new fuels) to meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the engines through actual use and Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these field problems.  Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types/maturity of engines not by the total engine quantity.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory engines operational.  Engine CIP through "Lead the Fleet" operational use and accelerated mission testing identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts.  Engine CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when manufacturers incorporate Engine CIP improvements into production engines.  Engine CIP ensures continued improvements in engine R&M which reduce out year support costs.

The AMSD provides expertise to the Air Staff Major Command (MAJCOM) and platform program offices manned and un-manned on meeting civil CNS/ATM performance standards necessary to operate in the US National Airspace System (NAS) and international civil airspace.   This centralized capability supplements the MAJCOMs and over 50 AF platform program offices with resident technical CNS/ATM expertise.The AMSD monitors and participates in government/industry technical forums responsible for international civil aviation standards for operations in sovereign airspace worldwide.  AMSD analyzes civil developing standards and works to protect AF interest.  Once documents are finalized CNS/ATM experts identify specific technical and engineering criteria for AF stakeholders in Generic Performance Matrices (GPM).  The Air Staff and MAJCOMs determine how the AF will address these civil standards for each platform to best perform the specific AF mission.  When a material solution is required CNS/ATM experts consider the platform design; and work with the platform program office to tailor the GPMs as needed to meet civil standards - saving time reducing cost and risk.  Once the integration and testing is completed the AMSD verifies and validates that CNS/ATM performance meets the standards necessary to operate in civil airspace.  This is an iterative process to address both changes in civil airspace standards and shifts in AF military operational requirements.The AMSD manages Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for centralized procurement of CNS/ATM and Navigational Safety products.  These contracts are used by platform programs across the AF and Department of Defense (DoD) other federal agencies and in support of foreign military sales; they provide the benefits of quantity cost savings industry-unique warranty clauses and reduced contracting actions by platforms.

The radar aperture was intended to provide track data directly to users in-theater.The Medium Altitude Global ISR and Communications (MAGIC) project develops a multiple-day medium altitude ISR unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to provide long endurance surveillance with a multiple sensor payload.  This concept was initiated by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) as a Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) in the 3rd Quarter FY 2010 with a competition between five defense industry partners.  Aurora Flight Sciences' Orion Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) concept was chosen as the JCTD candidate by OSD/Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E) per the recommendation of the Combatant Commands.  The MAGIC/Orion RPA initiative was subsequently released from the JCTD process and transitioned to the Air Force as the sponsor of this developmental initiative in the 3rd Quarter FY 2011.  The Air Force is scheduling the second flight series for Aurora Flight Sciences' Orion RPA after having completed a first flight at NAWS China Lake CA on 24 Aug 2013.

USNDS supports NUDET detection requirements across five mission areas: Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) Nuclear Force Management (NFM) Space Control (SC) Treaty Monitoring (TM) and a classified mission.The USNDS program is jointly sponsored and funded by the Department of Defense (DoD) through the US Air Force (AF) and the Department of Energy (DOE) through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its Nuclear Detonation Detection (NA-22) office respectively.  NNSA/NA-22 supplies at no cost to DoD USNDS space sensors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the AF's USNDS Program Office which is responsible for all acquisition and systems engineering integration and test (SEIT) activities on space vehicles (SVs) to include Global Positioning System (GPS) and additional hosts and their supporting ground control segments.  The AF directly funds the development of the USNDS ground segment (described below).DoD funds their contribution to the NDS program in Program Element (PE) 0305913F with RDT&E OPAF and O&M dollars.  USNDS consists of space sensors and complex ground segments. The space segment sensors funded by DOE consists of three nuclear detection sensor payloads: the Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) payload for Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites the Global Burst Detection (GBD) payload for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) platforms (GPS satellites) and the Space Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) payload for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) platforms (classified GEO host).  Together these sensors and associated communications capability provided by the host satellites comprise the global NUDET space segment detection capability for the USNDS.  Space sensors communicate NUDET indications to the fixed ground segment (the RADEC Data Processor (RDP) and the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS)) the deployable mobile ground segment (survivable Ground NDS Terminals (GNTs)) and the survivable/endurable Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs) when fielded.  These ground systems perform data analysis and provide a decision support tool to the Air Force controllers concerning probability of NUDET occurrence.  The ground segment provides ground receiving analysis and reporting capabilities to national authorities commands and forward users as well as Department of State (DOS) for Treaty Monitoring and Verification mission.  The ground control segment is being modernized and continuously improved through an incremental evolution acquisition approach.The upgrade to the GNT is the survivable/endurable Universal Ground Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) Terminal (UGNT) which is funded with AF RDT&E in this PE.  The UGNT provides NUDET Detection Reports to end users through survivable and endurable USNDS communications via Milstar/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) circuits.   The GNT supports ITW/AA and NFM missions.  The UGNT program modifies the baseline of the GNT program and deploys as an integral part of the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Survivable / Endurable Evolution (S2E2) Mobile Ground System (SMGS) units also in support of ITW/AA and NFM.  The UGNT when integrated with the SMGS will perform NUDET event processing with fused NDS data from GPS and DSP.  SMGS capability refers to the result of the S2E2 upgrade program for the MGS mission processing capability including the integration of UGNT.  The intended end state of UGNT integration is delivery of enhanced missile warning and NUDET detection capabilities that meet survivable/endurable ITW/AA requirements directed by the President SECDEF Joint Staff and USSTRATCOM delivering long-term cost effective multi-role multi-mission space effects to the war fighter across the range of military operations.This budget line includes systems engineering research and development on-orbit and field testing and end-to-end verification of USNDS space sensors ground analysis and reporting systems in support of the five USNDS mission areas.

By direction of the Navy Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) PEO IWS was assigned overall responsibility and authority to direct the Navy's OA effort until that duty transferred to DASN (RDTE) in 2011. The Core OA funding line has remained with PEO IWS.  That policy established a need to coordinate acquisition strategies develop guidance and tools and develop analysis of alternatives to determine OA software reuse practices within and across the Navy Communities of Interest (COI - Surface Subsurface Air Space C4I USMC and ONR).  This project facilitates a strategic shift in the acquisition business process to facilitate cooperative competition in cross-domain/COI business relationships.  This improves innovation and economies of scale throughout the Navy and Marine Corps.  This leadership effort has identified the business case and potential return on investment for moving the Navy towards an open systems approach supported the development of open systems technologies and integrated best business and technical practices for open systems development within Naval acquisition.  Naval OA ensures Navy-wide system architectures become extensible and scalable in function capacity and workload to meet Joint warfighting requirements.  This also includes the identification and development of common software components functions reuse methodologies and extensible product lines.  In summary this funding supports the management of a reuse repository and reuse information exchange portal and the evolving business systems engineering and cultural changes required across all Naval programs as they migrate to function in a Joint net-centric warfare environment.","","61.228","180","","",

CEC is highly resistant to jamming and provides accurate gridlocking between CUs. Each CU independently employs high capacity parallel processing and advanced algorithms to combine all distributed sensor data into a fire control quality track picture which is the same for all CUs. CEC data is presented as a superset of the best AAW sensor capabilities from each CU all of which are integrated into a single input to each CU's combat weapons system. CEC significantly improves our Battle Force defense in depth including both local area and ship defense capabilities against current and future AAW threats. Moreover CEC provides critical connectivity and integration of over-land air defense systems capable of countering emerging air threats including land attack cruise missiles in a complex littoral environment.Each military Service funds CEC development for their combat systems.  The CEC Program Office oversees CEC development for all services.CEC consists of the Data Distribution System (DDS) the Cooperative Engagement Processor (CEP) and interface with Combat Systems and sensors. The DDS encodes and distributes own-ship sensor and engagement data and is a high capacity jam resistant directive system providing a precision gridlocking and high throughput of data. The CEP is a high capacity distributed processor that processes force levels of data in near real-time. The data is passed to the ship's combat system as high quality data for which the ship can cue its onboard sensors or use the data to engage targets without actually tracking them. The Navy implemented a Signal Data Processor (SDP) approach to modify the current equipment to meet reduced size weight cost power and cooling objectives. This SDP approach also supports continuity for interoperability improvements and program protection as well as supporting open architecture initiatives and comms independence. The SDP hardware complies with Category 3 Open Architecture Computing Environment (OACE) standards.  The SDP-S is being fielded fleet-wide to all US Navy USMC US Army and FMS CEC units.A family of antennas approach will be used to satisfy CEC requirements with lower life cycle costs (procurement installation and maintenance) and reduced weight (on mast and below deck).  These antennas enable future capability as well as providing a solution extensible to additional platforms.  This effort for development and production of Common Array Block (CAB) antennas was competitively awarded in late FY2013.In support of Interoperability CEC will continue to work collaboratively with other Combat Systems programs (AWS E-2C E-2D SSDS CDLMS C2P and SGS/AC) to develop the software and implement design corrections and system changes. CEC will analyze the interactions of interoperability issues and impacts and provide collaboration for development of CEC and other system changes develop the long term solutions including the engineering process to validate small parts of developmental software ideas and utilize M&S to validate design approaches in the systems engineering realm.","","383.709","582","","",

Mission Description and Budget Item JustificationThe Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) is an Acquisition Category 1D program with joint partners for requirements and acquisition including the USAF USN/ USMC USA USCG and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  JPALS is the next generation global positioning system (GPS)-based precision approach and landing system for the DoD and is intended to provide a rapidly deployable adverse weather adverse terrain day/night precision approach and landing capability for fixed and rotary wing manned and unmanned aircraft.On 16 March 2007 the JROCM approved the JPALS Capability Development Document and designated the Navy as the Lead Service.  The Analysis of Alternatives was finalized in 3Q FY07. Milestone B was met 14Jul08.  At Milestone B the Milestone Decision Authority separated Increment (Inc) 1 into Inc 1A and Inc 1B. On 19Jan10 the JROC approved Inc 2 for the Land-Based System and designated the Air Force as the lead component for the Land-Based System.The DoN PALC Roadmap Study documents direction to re-scope JPALS to a single increment.  As a result JPALS Inc 1B was reduced in scope to support the F-35 Lightning II and Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) programs as their primary landing system on aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships.  Accordingly improvements will be made to JPALS to provide autoland capability for manned and unmanned aircraft therefore investments in aircraft software and avionics will continue although retrofit of existing aircraft was removed from program requirements.  In addition JPALS Inc 2 was cancelled.  The remaining re-scoped JPALS program efforts provide a strong technology basis for evolution should a requirement for JPALS on existing aircraft fixed air bases or expeditionary air fields re-emerge in the future.JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY:  This program is funded under ADVANCED COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND PROTOTYPES because it includes all efforts necessary to evaluate integrated technologies representative models or prototype systems in high fidelity and realistic operating environment.","The JPALS Increments (Inc) 1A and 1B programs are being combined into project 2329 beginning in FY15.  Increment 1B (Project 3228) will now only contain FY10 - FY14 funds with FY14 being a year of transition to the JPALS re-plan brought about by the Precision Approach Landing Capability (PALC) Roadmap Study  DoN Resources and Requirements Review Board (R3B) decision dated 03Jul13.  JPALS Increment 1B funds in FY15 and out have been realigned IAW approved service priorities and in part will fund the PALC Roadmap investments in recapitalization and refurbishment of legacy landing systems.  Improvements will be made to JPALS software and avionics to provide manned and unmanned aircraft with autoland capabilities.  As a result of these PALC changes JPALS Inc 2 (Project 3354) has been cancelled.FY 2014 funding in both Project 3228 and 3354 will be used to finance the single increment of JPALS with FY 2014 funding carrying over to finance FY 2015 requirements on the single increment of JPALS.  The FY15-FY19 budget JPALS budget request has been reduced to properly support the FY15-FY19 JPALS requirements.","662.723","238","","",

This suite consists of an S-Band radar (AMDR-S) an X-band radar and a Radar Suite Controller (RSC).  Funding will develop AMDR-S and RSC and integrate these components with an available X band radar.  AMDR will provide multi-mission capabilities simultaneously supporting both long range exoatmospheric detection tracking and discrimination of ballistic missiles as well as Area and Self Defense against air and surface threats. For the Ballistic Missile Defense capability increased radar sensitivity and bandwidth over current radar systems are needed to detect track and support engagements of advanced ballistic missile threats at the required ranges concurrent with Area and Self Defense against Air and Surface threats. For the Area Air Defense and Self Defense capability increased sensitivity and clutter capability is needed to detect react to and engage stressing Very Low Observable/Very Low Flyer (VLO/VLF) threats in the presence of heavy land sea and rain clutter. This effort provides for the development of an active phased array radar with the required capabilities to address the evolving threat. The AMDR suite will obtain performance and technology enhancements throughout its service life based upon an approach that includes modularity of hardware and software a scalable design and Open Architecture (OA) compliance.Periscope Detection:  The CVN Periscope Detection Radar program AN/SPS-74(V) develops and delivers the capability which provides automated detection and discrimination of submarine periscopes using advanced algorithms.  This enables discrimination of periscopes from surface contacts buoys small boats floating mines etc.  This effort was initially based on an Advanced Development Model (ADM) developed in PE 0603553N Surface Antisubmarine Warfare.  VCNO Memorandum Ser N09/12U100544 dtd 17 Dec 2012 directs cancellation of the AN/SPS-74 Program.  FY12 and FY13 funding developed the Periscope Detection and Discrimination (PDD) interface for the AN/SPQ-9B Radar. FY13 funding also developed a Land Based Test Asset to demonstrate new solid state technology that lowers the required power and removes the highest failing components improving system reliability and stability while greatly reducing the production life and life costs.Dual Band Radar (DBR) Upgrades: Funding is for Dual Band Radar (DBR) System upgrades to implement cost savings initiatives for Volume Search Radar (VSR) modifications supportability analysis and associated logistics product updates; future upgrades/technology insertion efforts for Multi-Function Radar (MFR)/VSR as a part of the DBR suite on CVN 78 Class ships and the MFR on DDG 1000 Class ships.  Funding is also required to resolve the hardware and software issues discovered during the various test events to include: DTB2-411 Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) testing Land Based Testing and pertinent At-Sea test events. The upgrades will include all aspects of the radar system/subsystems including hardware and software. Specific subsystem areas include the Array Transmit/Receive (T/R) module Receiver/Exciter Signal Data Processor Radome and power/cooling systems. Upgrades and technology insertions are required to maintain the level of force protection needed for ship defense against all threats envisioned in the littoral environment.  The supportability analysis and logistic products associated with these upgrades will also be developed and updated. DBR Battle Force Tactical Trainer (BFTT)/Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC)/Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) Interface:  FY12-14 requirement supports the design and development of the software interface between DBR and AN/USQ-46 BFTT CEC and SEWIP to enhance CVN 78 combat readiness.  DBR CVN 78 Testing and Certification: FY13-FY17 requirement supports DBR At-Sea Test and Evaluation (T&E) Environmental Testing and DBR Systems Certification for CVN 78. Multi-Mission Signal Processor (MMSP): The development of Multi-Mission Signal Processor (MMSP) provides Anti-Air Warfare (AAW)/Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Multi-mission capability for DDG 51 class ships as part of Aegis Modernization Program.  This capability will be utilized for DDG 113 and follow new construction and Aegis Ashore.  Modifies SPY-1D Transmitters to enable dual beam for reduced frame times and better reaction time and provides stability for all D (V) waveforms and avoid operational degradation.  The SPY-1 radar system detects tracks and supports engagements of a broader range of threats.  MMSP improves performance in littoral ducted clutter environments and in electronic attack (EA) and chaff environments and provides greater commonality in computer programs and equipment. This effort also provides for the development of a Solid State Switch Assembly (SSSA) through an ONR/MANTECH project MMSP Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) refresh radar capability upgrades reliability improvements and ship-based Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR).Advanced Radar Technology (ART):  Funds the development and integration of existing and new radar technologies into the Navy's sensors to enhance performance and/or ensure sensor operations and sustainment throughout the lifecycle of the sensor and platforms on which installed.Improved Capabilities for SPY-1 Radar: These Reliability Maintainability and Availability (RM&A) improvements are intended to reduce cascading failures mitigate obsolescence issues and improve reliability in support of Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) and Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) missions; while still providing AN/SPY-1 Radar Total Ownership Cost Reductions.  Improvements will yield reductions in annual fleet maintenance costs.Advanced Radar Innovation Fund/Advanced Radar Research: Funds the development and integration of existing and new technologies into the Navy's sensors to enhance performance and ensure sensor operations and sustainment throughout the lifecycle of the sensor and platforms on which installed.","","932.493","P384","","",

The NMT system provides an increase in single service capability from 1.5 Megabits per second (Mbps) to 8 Mbps increases the number of coverage areas and retains Anti-Jam/Low Probability of Intercept (AJ/LPI) protection characteristics.  It is compatible with today's Navy Low Data Rate/Medium Data Rate (LDR/MDR) terminals and will sustain the Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) architecture by providing connectivity across the spectrum of mission areas to include land air and naval warfare special operations strategic nuclear operations strategic defense theater missile defense and space operations and intelligence.  The NMT system will replenish and improve on Navy terminal capabilities of the Military Strategic Tactical & Relay System (MILSTAR) Defense Satellite Communications System  (DSCS) Wideband Global Satellite (WGS) and Global Broadcast System (GBS).  The new system will equip the warfighters with the assured jam resistant secure communications as described in the joint AEHF satellite communications system and WGS Operational Requirements Documents (ORD).  The NMT will provide multiband Satellite Communications (SATCOM) capability for ship submarine and shore platforms.The Joint Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) Network Integrated Control System (JMINI CS) is a legacy system that commenced in 1998. JMINI CS is a Navy-led Joint-interest program providing integrated dynamic and centralized control of non-processed UHF MILSATCOM 5/25 kHz Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) and Demand Assigned Single Access (DASA) channels to maximize existing highly sought after SATCOM resources.  The system also provides decentralized web-based management of those resources for use as a situational awareness tool for Combatant Commanders Global SATCOM Support Centers and Regional SATCOM Support Centers.  The system is expected to operate well beyond the original 2015 End of Life (EoL) date to 2033.  The JMINI CS Program will perform concept development and exploration  to identify  cost-effective solutions to address multiple life cycle support issues in order to minimize loss of service to the fleet.  The effort will involve evaluation development laboratory and integration testing of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) hardware and software to replace obsolete components or subsystems while maintaining interoperability with existing systems. Maritime Integrated Broadcast Service (MIBS)  (formerly Tactical Data Information Exchange Subsystem Broadcast (TADIXS-B)) Program Charter is to deliver Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) data to operational and tactical decision makers aboard United States Navy ships shore headquarters and other joint platforms.  It will provide means to disseminate organically derived data from Navy platforms to other  tactical operational and strategic users in theatre. MIBS provides the Navy a capability to deliver near real time data enhancing the Common Operational Picture (COP) to support operations in all warfare areas including: Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) Anti-Surface Warfare (ASW) Undersea Warfare (USW) Electronic Warfare (EW).

MISSION: RTT programs transition technology from any source including those not traditionally associated with defense technology. An effective and robust integration of commercial and military technologies can reduce costs and improve naval capabilities by keeping pace with the fast moving changes in technologies and operational needs. The RTT program is comprised of three elements: The Rapid Technology Transition (RTT) program the Technology Insertion Program for Savings (TIPS) and the Rapid Development and Deployment (RDD) program. The RTT and TIPS programs are structured to bring transition deals to closure quickly and to provide execution year funding for a rapid start bridging the gap until the program of record can fund the completion of the technology insertion. The RDD program is structured to quickly develop a prototype solution that will be deployed in theater for Naval forces engaged in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).The mission of the RTT program is to increase the rate that new innovative and potentially disruptive technologies are inserted into Department of Navy (DON) acquisition programs and the hands of the warfighter. The mission of the TIPS program is to increase the rate that new cutting edge technologies are inserted into DON acquisition programs in order to significantly reduce operations and maintenance support costs.The RDD program provides for the rapid development and fielding of prototype solutions to meet urgent operational needs. The RDD process applies when existing DON processes cannot meet urgent operational needs. Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) have generated rapidly evolving military needs that require responsive materiel solutions. Rapid transition opportunities occur when a sufficiently mature technology is identified that can meet a particular need on a timetable which matches that of an acquisition program and is supported by a business case which justifies the associated cost and schedule risk. The combination of circumstances which create such opportunities can appear and disappear well inside the Program Objectives Memorandum (POM) cycle. These programs are designed to be proactive in identifying opportunities and to work with resource sponsors fleet and force users and Program Managers (PMs) in constructing viable technology transition deals one at a time. To ensure the widest possible awareness of emergent commercial technology opportunities these programs interact with the industry and coordinate closely with Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) to maintain awareness of insertion opportunities. Utilizing existing authorities RTT applies execution year funds where necessary to "jump-start" transitions so they can be inserted and validated by Sea Trial experiments leading directly to deployment and/or demonstrations of high risk/high payoff technologies. This Program Element is the only Navy program that addresses current urgent requirements that are required by the fleet within a 18-24 month period. As such planning and execution are accomplished within the same fiscal year which causes a non-traditional financial execution profile for the program. The program therefore does not meet traditional execution benchmarks.Higher Navy priorities result in the termination of the RTT program in 2014.The  Technology Insertion Program for Savings (TIPS) transitions technology from any source including those not traditionally associated with defense technology.

It includes Battle Force Tactical Network (BFTN) and Joint Aerial Layer Network-Maritime (JALN-M). The Battle Force Tactical Network (BFTN) on each surface subsurface air or fixed US Navy platform utilizes previously installed/existing Line of Sight (LOS)/Extended Line of Sight (ELOS) radios (a.k.a. Radio Frequency (RF)) to create a secure gateway that inter-connects all users into a common RF Tactical Network (a.k.a. wireless). This Network separately supports US-Only and Allied/Coalition users' tactical data information exchanges on each platform (node) between and/or across separately dispersed RF Networks even if Satellite Communications (SATCOM) channels to shore are lost during an Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) event.Joint Aerial Layer Network-Maritime (JALN-M) is the Navy implementation of the JALN architecture which provides assured communications in any environment especially A2AD.  With disruption or loss of Space tier communications JALN-M establishes and/or restores connectivity within the High Capacity Backbone (HCB) tier the Distribution Access Range Extension (DARE) tier and the Transition tier in accordance with the JALN Initial Capabilities Document and the JALN Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Final Report.  JALN-M is a robust assured communications capability providing joint connectivity via the HCB and Navy platform connectivity via a pseudo satellite DARE capability.  JALN-M will use the Extended Data Rate (XDR) waveform for intra-battle group DARE communications a Common Data Link (CDL) waveform for the HCB cross-link capability and will leverage enhanced Ultra High Frequency/High Frequency (UHF/HF) waveforms for coalition connectivity.     FY15 BFTN efforts will support system demonstration operational tests (i.e. Technical Evaluation Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E)) and design enhancements to the baseline system that includes higher data rates for increased network speeds to support expanded range of applications beyond email chat correspondence and web access. The engineering change will also incorporate intelligent modems and controllers that will automatically manage flow of information offset jamming and an increase in channel quantities that will quadruple the number of BFTN network paths; thereby increasing speed and shore interoperation/reliability of service. This engineering change is also intended to address obsolescence and end of life impacts of rapidly advancing network technologies.FY15 JALN-M efforts will continue to support the goal of developing six (6) JALN-M Prototype payloads through the leveraging of  the results of  both HCB and Airborne XDR flight demonstrations.

Tri-Service coordination and cooperative efforts are focused in four principal medical areas: Combat Casualty Care Military Operational Medicine Militarily Relevant Infectious Diseases and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine.  Promising medical technologies are refined and validated through extensive testing which is closely monitored by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as part of their processes for licensing new medical products. The FDA requires medical products to undergo extensive preclinical testing in animals and/or other models to obtain preliminary effectiveness and safety information before they can be tested in human clinical trials. Clinical trials are conducted in three phases to prove the safety of a drug vaccine or device for the targeted disease or medical condition starting in Phase 1 with a small number of healthy volunteers. Following Phase 1 Phase 2 clinical trials to provide expanded safety data and evaluate the effectiveness of a drug vaccine or medical device in a larger population of patients having the targeted disease or medical condition. Each successive phase includes larger numbers of human subjects and requires FDA cognizance prior to proceeding. Work conducted in this PE primarily focuses on late stages of technology maturation activities required to conduct Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Some high-risk technologies may require additional maturation with FDA guidance prior to initiating these clinical trials. Such things as proof of product stability and purity are necessary to meet FDA standards before entering later stages of testing and prior to transitioning into a formal acquisition program where large Phase 3 pivotal trials will be conducted for licensure. Activities in this PE may include completion of preclinical animal studies and Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies involving human subjects according to FDA and EPA requirements. Promising medical technologies that are not regulated by the FDA are modeled prototyped and tested in relevant environments.Blast research and research into maturing field rations in this PE are fully coordinated with the United States Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center.  This coordination enables improved body armor design and rations for Soldiers. Additionally the activities funded in this PE are externally peer reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee. The ASBREM Committee serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses biomedical research and development community as well as its associated enabling research areas.Project 810 maturates and demonstrates FDA-regulated medical countermeasures such as drugs vaccines and diagnostic systems to naturally occurring infectious diseases and wound infections of military importance as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis.  The project also supports testing of personal protective measures such as repellents and insecticides regulated by the EPA. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.Project 840 validates studies on safety and effectiveness of drugs biologics (products derived from living organisms) medical devices and medical procedures intended to minimize immediate and long-term effects from battlefield injuries; advanced technology development and clinical studies for treatment of ocular and visual system traumatic injury; and restoration of function and appearance by regenerating skin muscle and bone tissue in battle-injured casualties. Additionally this project develops and realistically tests improved occupant protection systems through medical research to characterize mechanisms of injuries sustained by occupants of ground-combat vehicles subjected to underbody blast events determine human tolerance limits to underbody blast forces and develop tools to predict injuries to ground-combat vehicle occupants exposed to underbody blast forces.Project FH4 maturates validates and supports enhanced Force Health Protection of Soldiers against threats in military operations and training. Health-monitoring tools are matured to rapidly identify deployment stressors that affect the health of Joint Forces. These databases and systems enhance the DoDs ability to monitor and protect against adverse changes in health especially mental health effects caused by changes in brain function. Force Health Protection work is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The program is maturing the development of global health monitoring (e.g. development of neuropsychological evaluation methodologies) validating clinical signs and symptoms correlating to medical records diagnosed diseases and mortality rates. The key databases supporting this program are the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow for the examination of interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.Project MM3 supports the Medical and Survivability technology areas with laboratory validation studies and field demonstrations of biomedical products designed to counteract myriad environmental and physiological stressors as well as materiel hazards encountered in training and operational environments to protect sustain and enhance Soldier performance. The key efforts are to demonstrate and transition technologies as well as validate tools associated with Soldier survivability injury assessment and prediction assessments for post-concussive syndrome and enhancing performance during continuous operations. The three main thrust areas are (1) Physiological Health and Environmental Protection (2) Injury Prevention and Reduction and (3) Psychological Health and Resilience. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services.Work funded in this project PE is fully coordinated with efforts undertaken in PE 0602787A and the Defense Health Program.

These programs will ensure continued battlefield overmatch and lethality of U.S. maneuver forces against the full range of modern battlefield threats.  To achieve this Weapons and Munitions Engineering Development Program will identify and develop promising technologies through competitive development and streamlined acquisition procedures.M829E4: The M829E4 cartridge is an Abrams delivered Line of Sight (LOS) munition that will provide capability for the current force Armored Brigade Combat Team's (ABCT) commander to conduct decisive operations and destroy current and future enemy Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) equipped with Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and Active Protective System (APS) at ranges from 0-2km (T) and 0-4km (O).  The M829E4 equips ABCT commanders with a unique capability which will increase the ABCT's lethality and ability to seize the initiative during unified land operations.  After an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase I competitive shoot off in FY 2011 Alliant Techsystems (ATK) was awarded the option to continue with Phase II until its conclusion in FY 2015.  FY 2012 supported the continuation of Phase II of the M829E4 cartridge.  FY 2013 funding supported design finalization design verification fabrication and initial testing of Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) hardware.  The full performance of the M829E4 is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification.  FY 2014 supports conducting hardware and performance testing mandated Live Fire Test & Evaluation (LFT&E) and completion of Milestone C.  FY 2015 supports qualifying a second source for the composite sabot material.  The current single source supplier for this material has significantly increased the cost for this material more than doubled and expressed intentions of possibly getting out of this business.  Qualification of a second source will result in competitive pricing and driving down the unit price cost as well as mitigate the risk of the current supplier exiting as a supplier of this material.One Way Luminescence (OWL): Current legacy small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are comprised of a pyrotechnic tracer mix that allows enemy forces to visually see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter.   The objective of the OWL program is to develop and field a full day/night tracer technology to replace the current M62 pyrotechnic trace cartridge with a new trace cartridge that is only visible to the shooter and those soldiers in close proximity.Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP): The Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP) program is a direct fire line of sight 120mm large caliber munition to be developed for the Abrams Main Battle Tank.  It has three modes of operation including point detonate delay and airburst.  AMP is the material solution for breaching reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50m to 2000m (T) and 50m to 4500m (O) a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition.  In addition to added capability AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions thereby addressing the users' battlecarry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including ATGM teams reinforced walls personnel light armor bunkers and obstacles.  The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification the same required by the M829E4.  FY 2015 supports multiple contract awards for competing prototypes in Phase I of II for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).Medium Caliber Ammunition: The Target Practice Day Night Thermal (TP-DNT) cartridges are 40mm grenade training cartridges.  The low velocity variant is for training with the M203/M320 grenade launchers; the high velocity variant is for training with the Mk19 grenade machine gun.  Both cartridges will provide the Warfighter with a non-dud producing environmentally friendly training cartridge that provides a visual impact signature seen day or night by the naked eye through night vision devices and thermal weapon sights.  These cartridges will replace the 40mm Target Practice M918/M385A1 (Mixed Belt) cartridges and the 40mm M781 cartridges.  It is expected that the unit price for high velocity cartridges will be lower than the Mixed Belt cartridges.  Funding for FY 2015 activities transitions to PE 0604802/Project EC1.Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP): The overall program objective is to develop and field an Advanced Armor Piercing (ADVAP) 7.62mm cartridge in order to defeat threat targets and provide overmatch capability versus a broad spectrum of hard targets into the future.Tunable Pyrotechnic Aircraft Countermeasure: This project will support research development and testing to field new expendable countermeasure munitions that will protect Army aircraft from advanced and current guided-missile threats. Advances in the capability of threat systems to counter current decoys necessitate development of new expendable countermeasures. This program is considered essential to provide Army Aircraft protection against surface-to-air weapon systems.Ammunition Logistics Prototyping: This project supports the future force by improving the distribution management reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development integration and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations to include retrograde while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling distribution and management (strategic and tactical) prognostics diagnostics and asset visibility explosives safety and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization.

Past improvements include a Digital Data Link capability introduced in 2010 which provides data link relay capability and integrated gimbaled payloads.  Future enhancements will follow the natural progression of technology and exploitation of improved payloads to meet Warfighter needs.  Improved system enhancements will support Army modernization initiatives and the service emphasis on Squad-Foundation of the Decisive Force.  Development of a government purpose rights control device compatible with current and future SUAS platforms and integrated into tactical networks is required.  Compatibility for SUAS with Net Warrior elements will support seamless transmission of data between squad members and adjacent and higher commands.  A communications relay capability for SUAS will extend the operational connectivity of the squad when ground based communications cannot support the ranges due to terrain or atmospherics.  The relay capability supports the Aerial Layer Network Transport Initial Capabilities Document for low altitude requirements.  Development of a sensor to shooter capability will link forward edge combatants to organic and supporting fires networks with rapid dissemination of target information and imagery.  Efforts to reduce the workload required to operate the SUAS will free the soldiers to perform their primary mission while retaining the advantages afforded by the SUAS.

On 17 September 2009 the President announced an overarching plan to provide regional missile defense to U.S. deployed forces allies and partners in Europe called the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA). The United States will also pursue phased adaptive approaches in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East by building on current efforts. The PAA envisions tailoring U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities to specific theater needs to enhance integrated regional missile defenses to protect defended assets against medium intermediate and ultimately intercontinental range ballistic missiles. Within this policy a European PAA specifically addresses a timeline to deploy a mix of afloat and land-based BMD capabilities. Aegis Ashore represents one of these land-based capabilities. Phase I of EPAA (completed December 2011): Focuses on the protection against short and medium-range ballistic missiles. As part of phase I which has been completed the United States has deployed multi-mission Aegis ships with BMD capability and the SM-3 Block IA missile. Phase I also included establishing separate forward-based transportable surveillance radar (AN/TPY-2)in Turkey to provide a cue to multi-mission Aegis ships with BMD capability and to future Aegis Ashore sites for launch on remote engagements. Phase II of EPAA (2015): Deploys the first land-based BMD configuration (Aegis Ashore) in Romania and deploys the SM-3 Block IB on land at the Aegis Ashore site and at sea on multi-mission Aegis ships with BMD capability. Phase III of EPAA (2018): Deploys a second land based Aegis Ashore in Poland and introduces an upgraded Standard Missile the SM-3 Block IIA. This missile brings improved coverage against medium and intermediate range ballistic threats and extends coverage to the bulk of the European continent. Aegis Ashore is a key component of Phases II and III in the European PAA and will provide Aegis Missile Defense capability against short and medium range ballistic missiles in an ashore configuration. It will be similar to the Aegis At-Sea BMD capability inherent in the DDG-113 series of the Arleigh Burke Class Destroyers to facilitate training and logistical support by the lead service Navy. Aegis Ashore essentially re-hosts the required BMD components of a Navy Destroyer in an ashore configuration to include SPY radar Vertical Launch System computing infrastructure Command Control Communications Computers and Intelligence (C4I) systems and operator consoles. It will provide sophisticated engagement strategies. Aegis Ashore can adapt to the threat and can be deployed/redeployed worldwide to areas needed to provide persistent coverage for the Geographic Combatant Commanders. The initial Aegis Ashore Missile Defense System (AAMDS) will be deployed to Romania in FY 2015. A second AAMDS will be deployed to Poland in FY 2018 as part of the European Phased Adaptive Approach.Missile Defense Agency (MDA) approved the acquisition strategy in FY 2010.

The account underwrites two related activities supporting development of the Department's joint warfighting capability.  These resources are a slim residual of much larger accounts supporting unique warfare capability analyses for joint customers including major combatant commander staffs and the Joint Staff.  These analyses and assessments deliver independent perspectives on ways to align Service and Agency investments and potential solutions for capability gaps created by evolving threats not aligned to single Component missions.  Iterative military budget reductions to joint mission support programs significantly increased demand for JWP support from joint staffs and “units in the field” assigned to joint missions. The JWP resources are dedicated to analytic support for joint capability analysis and joint customers.  JWP provides a safety net for analytic support responding to emergent joint capability requirements and capability gaps for identifying potential material solutions.  Typical projects funded with JWP include translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements identification of candidate solutions via experimentation translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources dedicated to direct support joint commands provides analytic expertise not normally allocated via formal staffing billets.  In this activity JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.  JWP resources also support Mission Area Portfolio Assessments (MAPA) and the development of tools supporting joint analytic efforts.The balance of JWP funds contributes resources to examination of potential remedies for joint mission capability gaps.  These early assessments of potential capability gap solutions can accelerate engineering development subsequent field experiments and capability demonstrations in field conditions.  This segment of JWP often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine Organization Training Material Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.  The resources sustain a small segment of civilian operation research analysis (currently hosted by the Institute for Defense Analysis – IDA and the Naval Postgraduate School - NPS).

Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01 promulgate capabilities-based requirements and acquisition processes. The JSAD program enables collaborative efforts to achieve these goals with a focus on Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs). These efforts include warfighting capability-based analyses; assessments of joint capability areas and joint integrating concepts; development of system-related data; integrated roadmaps to support acquisition investment decisions; and assessments of MDAPs and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS) in a capability area context.  Activities in the JSAD project are divided into three areas:  (1) capability-based analysis; (2) roadmaps; and (3) support tools and guidance. Capability-based analysis provides analysis of the different technology functionality and integration impacts of systems on warfighting capability.  Acquisition roadmaps guide systems development and associated investment plans.  JSAD support tools and guidance initiatives develop systems data and tools exploit modeling and simulation and architecture efforts to improve DoDs overall assessment capability.  These efforts guide the development and improve the testing and fielding of integrated systems of systems in order to achieve Joint mission capabilities.  The QDR also lays out the need for an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches. This means:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning  programming budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance management and execution levels.  To accomplish this direction there needs to be a focused  goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from systems acquisition to capabilities-based portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This  program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above in order to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals.  The program is broken up into two focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives) and consolidates work previously performed under various other Program Elements.","","4.545","","","",

This is in part due to Department of Defense response to a changing threat environment where there is an expansion of the types of sensors deployed new types of information collected and different features used to classify these new threats.  From a technical perspective data creation speeds have outpaced the speed and ability to transport store and process the data created.  Science and Technology (S&T) investigation into new and novel ways to manage and exploit this data is required to more efficiently use sensor assets and effectively use information in a timely fashion.The OSD Data to Decisions program (PEs 0602663D8Z and 0603663D8Z) uniquely address three specific gap areas not addressed by Component S&T:  minimal dedicated Data to Decisions research to support joint and emerging mission areas; DoD needs a mechanism to increase responsiveness of Component Data to Decisions research and lower the time-to-solution across a broad DoD-wide user base; and limited investment in multi-disciplinary research investigations of Data to Decisions issues and solutions.  The OSD Data to Decisions program pulls together research efforts to address shortfalls within the context of Joint and emerging missions to ensure that the distinctive needs of these joint analysts and decision makers are addressed by DoD science and technology.  As an example irregular warfare non-state terrorism movements and uncertain environmental patterns that trigger major weather disasters are producing a reality for military and government leaders where traditional physics-based sensors alone are insufficient to plan current and future actions in a region on interest or need.  Component Data to Decisions efforts focus on developing technology to overcome a particular challenge within a mission or to advance a particular priority area of that Component.  As a result the R&E Database has over 388 references to Decision Support programs all of which are designed to address a specific need over the course of several years.  However there exists no other program in the DoD that focuses on technology development efforts to speed the delivery of the Component solutions and lessons learned to a DoD-wide user base.  The OSD Data to Decisions program provides the common platform (access to datasets infrastructure and metrics) to integrate and evaluate the technology development and research methods to support various missions driven by the challenge problems.  This ability to rapidly evaluate technology development and research methods will allow technology transfer for mission analysis not previously foreseen and lower the time-to solution across DoD by rigorously analyzing technical performance for more immediate use.  Traditional approaches within research seek to advance machine systems for a specific mission effect resulting in large complex data sets.  While necessary for sensor system improvements potential Data to Decisions solutions require a coupling of automated data analysis with human analysts operators and decision makers in order to reduce time and limit the number of people required.  Many research studies workshop and analysis have stated that solutions to data issues are multi-disciplinary.  The OSD Data to Decisions program is in the unique position to reach across Components and research disciplines to blend promising research in new ways in response to Challenge Problem statements.  For Challenge Problems contextual understanding will result from research combining human sciences with computer processing techniques to take advantage of a person’s cognitive ability to fuse and assimilate multiple sources and types of information for new insights.","Change from FY 2013 to FY 2014 reflects a realignment of the program from the Data to Decisions Advanced Development PE 0603663D8Z to higher Department of Defense (DoD) priorities.  The goals of this program will be shifted to the DoD Components under the direction of the Research and Engineering (R&E) Executive Committee and will conform with the DoD Data to Decision Priority Steering Council roadmaps.  Historically the Joint Data Management program was restructured to evolve into the revised Data to Decisions program in support of the FY 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review mission:  succeed in counterinsurgency stability and counterterrorism operations.  In addition this program addresses a signed Secretary of Defense S&T priority Data to Decisions which reduces the cycle time and manpower requirements for analysis and use of large data sets.","","","","",

This program element supports the Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) of medical and non-medical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) medical and non-medical CB Defense initiatives.  DoD missions for civil support operations have recently expanded and have resulted in providing focus to develop technologies to support CB counterterrorism initiatives.  ADC&P is conducted for an array of chemical biological and toxin detection and warning systems providing early warning collector concentrators generic detection improved reagents and decontamination systems using solutions that will remove and/or detoxify contaminated materiel without damaging combat equipment personnel or the environment.  CB sensors and diagnostics enhance the Departments environmental and medical surveillance efforts by improving the monitoring and surveillance of threats and forces preparing for and engaged in military operations.  These efforts are required to enable military commanders and the Military Health System to prevent treat and mitigate threats to individual Service Members and military units.  Integration of CB sensor and diagnostic data from the programs in this ACD&P will also be usable within the homeland security and Federal public health common operating pictures.  The Department of Defense is responsible for research development acquisition and deployment of medical countermeasures to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD unlike those developed to support U.S. population must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasizes prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this ACD&P such as vaccines against the most likely biological threat agents and traditional / non-traditional chemical agent prophylaxis conserves fighting strength decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation and satisfies the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available efforts on this ACD&P support pre-hospitalization treatment en-route care hospital care and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include improvements to CB diagnostics and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic agents and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  DoD is the only Federal activity conducting ACD&P on these prophylactic diagnostic and therapeutic CB medical countermeasures.  The Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  The Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process ("One Portfolio").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research development acquisition and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research development and acquisition because of its unique facilities testing capabilities and trained and experienced personnel.  ACD&P also supports the development of updated test capabilities to evaluate Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Defense systems.  Also included is the Techbase Technology Transition effort which validates high-risk/high-payoff technologies that could significantly improve Warfighter capabilities.  The projects in this program element support efforts in the technology development phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 4.","","","","","",

AEHF is a cooperative program that includes International Partners (Canada the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of the Netherlands).    Space Vehicle-1 (SV-1) launched on 14 August 2010.  SV-1 experienced a propulsion anomaly and was raised to its geostationary orbit using alternative orbit raising techniques.  SV-1 completed on-orbit test and transitioned to operations in March 2012.  SV-2 launched on 4 May 2012 successfully completed on-orbit testing in October 2012 and is under operational control as of 7 Nov 2012. With SV-1 and SV-2 launched the AEHF program has nearly completed its development phase and is now addressing obsolescence production continuity supplier stability and industrial base issues.  AEHF SV 5-6 are being procured using the Department of Defense (DoD) Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) concept.  The ESP concept is a procurement approach which seeks stable production and efficient sub-contractor product management through the block buy of two space vehicles at one time (as described in Advanced EHF MILSATCOM P-40 Exhibit).  In addition the ESP concept includes use of RDT&E funding for a MILSATCOM Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) to fund engineering activities to reduce future production costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements improve capabilities through insertion of new technologies and replace obsolete parts crypto and materials.

Through FY05 Polar Satellite Communications funded three low data rate (LDR) Milstar payloads on three classified host satellites as an expedited interim solution for protected connectivity requirements in the north polar region (i.e. Interim Polar System (IPS)).  Two satellites with hosted payloads are required to provide the necessary 24-hour coverage.  The third payload went into operations in November 2008 to sustain the 24-hour coverage.  In FY06 the DoD began funding the next generation Polar Satellite Communications capability with two more polar payloads via the same host vehicle type (i.e. Enhanced Polar System (EPS)).  The host spacecraft and the polar communications payloads required design modifications that replaced obsolete components and took advantage of the more capable Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) technology including the eXtended Data Rate (XDR) waveform.  The EPS Capability Development Document (CDD) approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in September 2006 is based on a two-payload hosted XDR program with operational availability in CY15 and CY17.  The EPS system is comprised of four segments: Payload Ground Control Gateway and Terminal (acquired by each Service's Terminal Program Office).  In FY11 the EPS CDD was updated to provide a stand-alone ground capability that was no longer fully integrated with AEHF.

It allows acquisition program managers (the developers and providers) and warfighters (the end users) to integrate prototype and demonstrate candidate technologies and assess them in an operational environment.  As a result the warfighters can assess the capability first-hand and accurately fund the follow-on acquisition program during the next budgeting cycle.  TTP includes research and development funds for the following transition activities: prototyping of promising high-priority concepts and technologies in an operational environment to lower acquisition risk by raising the technology readiness level; performing pre-acquisition systems engineering to facilitate transition from a demonstration program into acquisition programs of record; assessing interface requirements of candidate concepts technologies and demonstration projects to better understand true engineering costs resulting from insertion of new technologies into the Air Force architecture; and capturing data through information technology tools and databases to help formulate strategies and gather proposals for development that have the potential to perform Department of Defense (DoD) missions.

PCL delivers vital one-of-a-kind research development test and evaluation (RDT&E) expertise directly to the warfighter capability developer and allied/coalition forces.From its inception in 1985 PCL constantly advances the state-of-the-art for developmental smart munitions seekers/sensors and their platforms.  PCL also focuses its capability against today's networked weapons emerging weapon concepts and helps develop innovative targeting technologies to be employed against a wide variety of vehicle targets theater air defense units and an extensive array of associated equipment.  Combat systems and support equipment exhibit physical characteristics (i.e. signatures) and present certain vulnerabilities which can be exploited by various targeting technologies leading to the elimination or incapacitation of the threat through the application of force (e.g. smart munitions or directed energy) or application of intelligence surveillance reconnaissance (ISR) methods.  PCL collects physical functional and signature attributes of real foreign threat systems and related equipment; these data feed high-fidelity models used to predict detection classification vulnerability and effectiveness performance for ISR sensor and weapon system design.  PCL collects high resolution signature data using a variety of ground air and space-based sensors against both new and existing (obtained sustained and maintained to be signature representative) foreign targets; with and without the presence of camouflage concealment and deception materials; and operated using enemy tactics/CONOPS.  The resulting highly reliable realistic  data directly supports munitions/targeting development programs and helps mitigate overall acquisition risk. PCL serves as a major focal point for joint signature exploitation collection and dissemination amongst the DoD and intelligence community (IC). PCL is a prime contributor in the time critical process to rapidly exploit assess and determine US and allied weapon/targeting performance against high value targets.

The term NAVWAR is sometimes equated with "PNT Superiority."  The Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) was established by DEPSECDEF Memo 17 November 2004 as the DoD Center of Excellence tasked to integrate and coordinate NAVWAR PNT capabilities across electronic spectrum cyberspace and space operations.  NAVWAR leverages various techniques and technologies from these mission areas to negate or prevent hostile use of PNT information and protect unimpeded use of PNT information by U.S. Allied and Coalition Forces while not unduly disrupting peaceful use outside an area of operation.  The JNWC develops and maintains the Department's premier collection of NAVWAR knowledge and provides subject matter expertise support to warfighters Department decision makers the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure) and the Coalition.  NAVWAR expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs) modeling and simulation analysis and exercise and training support. In recent years the Global Positioning System (GPS) has become one of the most critical enablers of modern advanced technology warfare. In an era where everything from advanced weapons systems and networks to basic goods and services are tracked guided or disciplined by PNT systems such as GPS NAVWAR is an ever increasing capability of interest and concern especially if PNT systems are interrupted or lost. Likewise as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) proliferate it becomes necessary to consider not only denying adversary use of GPS but also negating adversary use of alternate GNSS systems for PNT.  Recent revisions to National Defense Strategy and Defense Planning Guidance require Combatant Commands to account for denied / degraded PNT environments in deliberate planning.  Projecting force in the Asia-Pacific Region and other theaters of operation requires an understanding  of how evolving global asymmetric anti-access / area denial (A2/AD) threats may affect joint warfighting functions.  JNWC-conducted POFAs are a key element in evaluating Coalition NAVWAR capabilities and vulnerabilities and adversary capabilities and vulnerabilities both crucial to executing PNT superiority mission sets in potentially denied / degraded PNT environments.  JNWC helps develop defensive and offensive PNT capabilities by focusing on four Joint Mission Essential Tasks (JMETS):1. Enable Defensive PNT Operations: enable operations that will protect blue force PNT capabilities.2. Enable Offensive PNT Operations: enable PNT superiority capabilities that can take advantage of GNSS vulnerabilities. 3. Establish and Maintain PNT Situational Awareness (SA): assess current and projected blue force and red force PNT related capabilities.4. Develop and Execute NAVWAR Operational Assessments and Analysis for Future NAVWAR Operations and conduct field assessments to evaluate blue force and red force capabilities and vulnerabilities.The JNWC executes its assigned mission responsibilities through three lines of operation (LOO):1. Create Knowledge for PNT Superiority: PNT operational field assessments studies and analysis assessment and dissemination of PNT related intelligence and managing the PNT Superiority data repository2. Operationalize PNT Superiority: Joint Force and Contingency Operations support to Combatant Commands Services and other customers through outreach; creating and demonstrating operational capability for PNT Superiority in the near term3. Institutionalize PNT Superiority: Acquisition policy doctrine and coalition support; creating  the environment for robust PNT Superiority capability in the futureThis program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","The Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) was established per DepSecDef Memorandum titled "Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) Implementation Guidance" dated 17 November 2004. The memorandum directedCDR/USSTRATCOM to "Establish a joint center for NAVWAR that leverages on the expertise and infrastructure of the Joint GPS Combat Effectiveness Joint Test & Evaluation program as part of the foundation tobetter integrate and coordinate NAVWAR Capabilities across the Department." JNWC's core RDT&E mission is to conduct Positioning Navigation Timing (PNT) Operational Field Assessments (POFA) to providethe essential discovery and basic knowledge building blocks for all other JNWC missions. POFAs use Combatant Command assets employed against representative threats of specific OPLANs CONPLANs andDefense Planning Scenarios to determine the impact of and/or mitigation measures required to operate in an Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD) Contested PNT Environment. JNWC leverages the $3M/year POFAs todevelop national-level NAVWAR guidance develop joint Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) non-material solutions and to upgrade capabilities. The intent of POFAs is to provide timely information for neartermTTP development and realistic training in degraded space support environments. POFAs directly benefit and enhance US and coalition capabilities to operate in A2/AD contested PNT environments as thoseexpected in the Air Sea Battle Concept.","","","R2Long","",

The system is designed to be modular and open-ended.  Mission-specific equipment is employed in a 'plug-and-play' mission kit concept allowing specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.  The MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is a single-engine turbo-prop Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) designed to operate over-the-horizon at medium-to-high altitude for long endurance sorties.  The aircraft is designed primarily to prosecute critical emerging Time-Sensitive-Targets (TSTs) as a radar Electro-optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and laser designator-based attack asset with on-board hard-kill capability (hunter-killer).  It also performs Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance and Target Acquisition (ISR TA).  In the hunter-killer role the aircraft employs fused multi-spectral sensors to find fix and track ground targets using Automatic Target Cueing (ATC) high definition EO/IR metric sensor and other capabilities and assesses post-strike results.  The MQ-9 system is continuing to develop field capability through incremental upgrades.  Future capabilities development activity includes airframe and airframe system improvements such as: increasing the maximum gross takeoff weight capability of the aircraft from 10500 to 11700lbs; increasing the operational range and endurance of the baseline MQ-9 aircraft (adding external fuel tanks and/or airframe modifications such as wing extensions); incorporating an anti-ice/de-ice capability to transit light icing conditions (will involve wing/tail modifications as well as turbine inlet heating); propulsion system improvements; enhancing MQ-9 systems to include Automatic Takeoff and Landing Capability (ATLC); integrated redundant avionics; modifying the system to include provisions for a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) exportable version of the weapon system; Predator Primary Data Link (PPDL) communication system upgrades and communications upgrades to include data link encryption IP networking and Beyond Line-of-Sight comm upgrades; navigation system upgrades; electrical system upgrades; incorporation of Elevated Temperature Wet (ETW) materials; secure voice and data communications including SATCOM upgrades; sensor/stores management computer improvement; MIL-STD-1760 advanced weapons data bus; Universal Armament and Sensor Interface and Miniature Munitions/Store Interface; advanced sensor and weapon payloads; improved human-machine interface (HMI); integrating precision weapons (e.g. AGM-114 Hellfire missile GBU-12/38/49 guided bombs and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) variants); hardware and software upgrades to the ground control station for MQ-9 operations; completing airworthiness certification; weapon system certification and accreditation; and producing applicable training devices that emulate weapon system functionality and capabilities.  The MQ-9 program will continue to support other payload and capability development activities funded in other program elements (e.g. SIGINT communications Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) leveraging Gorgon Stare Quick Reaction Capability advanced Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED) Dismount Detection Radar (DDR) missile defense hyperspectral and other sensors and weapons) and address reliability maintainability sustainability and safety issues.  Activities also include trade studies analyses preliminary systems engineering system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution and studies supporting analysis and investment in future MQ-9 program planning.   The GCS common with the MQ-1 Predator functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communications.  The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support Remote Split Operations (RSO).  The GCS has the capability to perform mission planning; provides a means for manual control; allows personnel to launch recover and monitor aircraft payloads and system communications status; incorporates secure data links to send aircraft and payload commands and receive system telemetry and payload data; monitors threats to the aircraft; displays the common operational picture; and provides support functions.  Launch and Recovery GCS (LRGCS) allows for servicing systems checks maintenance launch and recovery of aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed facility GCS and conducting operations within line-of-sight range of the LRGCS.  GCS upgrades will be developed and fielded in coordination with improvements to MQ-9 system capabilities and in response to evolving operational and information assurance/certification and accreditation requirements.  Key efforts include GCS upgrades that add new LINUX processors high definition monitors ergonomic improvements improved human-machine interfaces open systems architecture and improved crew habitability. In addition the GCS upgrade effort also includes development/integration of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Command and Control (C2) Initiative (UCI) government-owned standard to enable improved capabilities for situational awareness and multi-mission management monitoring and oversight in the GCS.

The employment of this system interdicts our adversary's use of the electronic battlespace and is a key active component in the information battlespace and prosecution of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  EC-130H COMPASS CALL's sophisticated electronic combat system is capable of surgical denial or disruption of adversary radio frequency (RF) communications systems and sensors.  The system was fielded in 1983 and to date has evolved through the Baseline 2 configuration.  Due to the rapid advances in electronic attack technology the EC-130H COMPASS CALL was designed to be easily modified and must continue to modernize and evolve to keep pace with adversary tactics and emerging technologies.  Continuous system development is required to maintain battlespace superiority.  The EC-130H COMPASS CALL program employs an incremental development and fielding strategy that puts capability into the warfighter's hands as soon as practical and ensures each iteration of the weapon system is effective against the highest priority threats.  To sustain that process requires a steady stream of system development funds.  Development funds are required to accomplish subsystem additions and improvements such as the digital signal analysis and exciter subsystem (AXE) the Special Purpose Emitter Array (SPEAR) new modern communications receiver technologies new IR and counter radar technologies the Human-to-Machine Interface (HMI) digital cockpit avionics with multi-function displays (glass cockpits) network centric operations phased array transmit and receive apertures and other classified hardware and software developments necessary to counter military and commercial communications evolutions command and control operations enhancements and new/emerging sensor developments.  Funding in FY 2015 is required to support RDT&E efforts for Baseline 3 (BL3) upgrades to the EC-130H COMPASS CALL fleet and ground systems/simulators.  The BL2 and BL3 programmed requirements have advanced significantly over the two previously fielded baselines.  BL2 and BL3 upgrades will help cover the electronic attack shortfall in the coming years.  Obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) are addressed with each baseline upgrade as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.  The two Compass Call Mission Crew Simulators (CCMCS) are upgraded per the Baseline schedule to ensure training capacity keeps pace and matches the operational and technological upgrades delivered in the fielded aircraft.  The Weapons System Trainer (WST) scheduled to deliver in 2nd Quarter FY 2014 will mirror the capabilities of the fielded aircraft as well.Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.  Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to OCO the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging requirements.

This equipment must be continually updated to provide state-of-the-art capabilities to detect and neutralize criminal activities targeted against the AF and DoD. In an era of advancing technology reduced manning and increasingly high level fraud environmental crime and computer crime investigations technical investigative equipment must be continuously updated to enable AFOSI special agents to have the most cost effective and best possible means of thwarting criminal acts. The evolution of a new wave of computer crimes has made AFOSI responsible for the collection investigative analysis national level law enforcement coordination and dissemination of hacker activity and intrusion incidents for the Air Force. AFOSI's computer crime equipment must stay on the leading edge of technology to collect criminal information as well as pursue and apprehend criminals through a global medium. AFOSI must continually update its existing high tech computer surveillance equipment to support ongoing and future investigative operations to identify hackers and hacker groups as well as potential hostile government activities targeting Air Force communication and control systems.    Critical Infrastructure Protection identifies weaknesses in the Air Force Critical infrastructure highlights critical countermeasures and acquires and deploys cost-effective solutions.  The intent is to provide an Air Force-wide review of current infrastructure vulnerabilities; prioritize AF protection planning and integrate with existing programs; identify gaps based on AF needs; direct studies to refine AF requirements.

The DCGS Family of Systems including AF DCGS was directed to migrate to a net-centric DoD Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) enterprise enabling the Services to operate and share intelligence products more effectively in a joint environment.  All Services must pursue a common path based on a set of common enterprise services consistent with the Department's net-centric vision while maintaining flexibility to support the full range of warfighter missions.  Specifically DoD charged the Air Force to lead the development upgrade integration and test of common DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) enterprise services.  The DIB is a set of enterprise standards and services that enable interoperability and component reuse.  All the military services are mandated to incorporate DIB interoperability standards and commit to DIB architecture as the migration path to common DCGS enterprise services. The Distributed Common Ground Systems-Imagery (DCGS-I) Testbed is an integration and test environment used by the Services and Agency DCGS program offices to conduct integration of DCGS components and test interoperability interfaces with new sensors applications and net-centric operations. This testbed also supports the integration and testing of DoD DCGS components prior to introduction into the operational environment.  Periodic upgrades ensure the Testbed stays current with DCGS standards and architecture.Support to OUSD(I) AF DCGS and NATO interoperability efforts is also provided through this program element. This includes development testing and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint allied and coalition interoperability. The Common Imagery Processor effort develops a common imagery sensor processing capability within the DCGS architecture.  The imagery processor accepts airborne imagery data processes it into an exploitable format and provides it to other elements within the weapon system and the DCGS Enterprise. Current efforts are transitioning the legacy imagery processor from a hardware/software capability to a virtual software capability thereby improving enterprise processing capabilities.

The primary objective of this PE is to develop and demonstrate the technologies needed to meet the Marine Corps unique responsibility of training and equipping the Marine Air/Ground Task Force (MAGTF) for Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  In the post-September 11 world irregular warfare (IW) has emerged as the dominant form of warfare confronting the United States its allies and its partners; accordingly this PE has been structured to account for distributed long-duration operations including unconventional warfare counterterrorism counterinsurgency and stabilization and reconstruction operations.  IW emphasizes the use of indirect non-conventional methods and means to subvert attrite and exhaust an adversary or render irrelevant rather than defeat him through direct conventional military confrontation.   IW is now institutionalized in Marine Corps planning investment and capability development.  This PE provides the knowledge base to support Advanced Technology Development (6.3) and is the technology base for future expeditionary warfare capabilities.  This PE supports the Expeditionary Force Development System of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) and responds directly to the Marine Corps Science and Technology (S&T) process as well as supporting related Littoral and Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare capabilities developed by the Navy's Mission Capability Program.  The Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly.  The FNC program explores and demonstrates technologies that enable Sea Strike Sea Shield Sea Basing FORCEnet and Force Health Protection pillars Space Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and the Enterprise and Platform Enablers.  The FNC program comprises Enabling Capabilities (ECs) which develop and deliver quantifiable products (i.e. prototype systems knowledge products and technology improvements) in response to validated requirements for insertion into acquisition programs of record after meeting agreed upon exit criteria within five years. The core 6.2 program also supports Discovery and Invention (D&I) and Innovation and Transformation (I&T).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap this investment will achieve key transformational capabilities required by the Sea Power 21 Pillars as well as enable Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM) Persistent Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  The Marine Corps Service Campaign Plan (MCSCP) is the lens through which USMC S&T priorities are acted upon to guide the future development of the Total Force.Due to the number of efforts in this PE the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.","","0.000","","","",

This effort centers around modifying the current mission computer to obtain sufficient capacity/capability to support integration of new system capabilities with margin for growth by replacing the Core Processing Module (CPM) cards.  Also the effort includes replacement of the weather radar with a commercial off-the-shelf color weather radar.  Mission systems equipment includes but is not limited to a redesign of the C-5 lavatory system. Examples of other mission systems equipment include troop seats crew entry door and ladder and interior trim.  The current C-5 CMC has reached maximum capacity and cannot integrate required aircraft systems and capabilities to include the weather radar; flight management system (FMS); and communication navigation surveillance (CNS)/air traffic management (ATM) requirements.  These requirements include capabilities such as the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out) and identification friend or foe (IFF) mode 5.  The new CMC will allow for current and future throughput growth of additional processing requirements to meet CY 2020 CNS/ATM mandates.The modification helps to maintain aircraft availability as the new color weather radar replaces the current APS-133 weather radar system which is experiencing severe diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues.  Failure to replace the CMC to support a new weather radar will create a significant operational impact due to parts obsolescence of the current weather radar.

Marine Aviation Logistics Support Program II (MALSP II) Expeditionary Pack up Kit (EPUK):  Funding supports the evaluation development testing and integration of software and hardware solutions for expeditionary requisitioning and supply chain management across all US Marine Corp Aviation activities.  Marine Aviation Logistics is changing to MALSP II to meet current and future operational requirements - in support of the NAE Strategic Plan Marine Corps Vision & Strategy 2025 and the USMC Long War Concept.  MALSP II will allow aviation logisticians to decrease total infrastructure and resource inventories forward by moving the preponderance of the Maintenance and Supply workload to the CONUS Parent MALS and reducing the total forward Aviation Logistics footprint (personnel equipment facilities and spares).  EPUK as part of Marine Aviation Logistics Enterprise IT (MAL-EIT) system is an automated wireless hardware / software solution that is a key enabler in integrating US Marine Corp Aviation Combat Element (ACE) and Logistics Combat Element (LCE) logistics systems to make the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) more responsive agile flexible and lethal with the ability to support and sustain operations in austere expeditionary environments and across the Range of Military Operations (ROMO).3185 Joint Air Logistic Information System (JALIS) - A critical element of the DoD CONUS and OCONUS Air Logistics assets.  JALIS is an operational scheduling aircraft management and data analysis system that allows DoD organizations to submit airlift requirements for passengers and cargo; air logistics flying units to communicate their aircraft availability in a real time graphic display; and designated scheduling organizations to compare airlift requirements to available aircraft and create mission assignments.9406 Maintenance Data Warehouse/NAVAIR DECKPLATE - The development of the Decision Knowledge Programming for Logistics Analysis and Technical Evaluation (DECKPLATE) program is the next generation data warehouse for aircraft maintenance flight and usage data.  It provides a web-based interface to a single source of information currently being stored in multiple Naval Aviation Logistics Data Analysis (NALDA) systems.  Through the use of analysis query and reporting tools the user has the capabilities to effectively obtain readiness data in a near real-time environment as well as historical data for trend analysis and records reconstruction.  DECKPLATE supports the mission of the warfighter who requires a single source of near real-time aviation data in which to base critical readiness decisions.  This requires collecting data from authoritative sources into a data warehouse.  Because the warfighter only needs to access one database the time consuming task of collecting various pieces of data form various sources will be reduced and ultimately eliminated.  This improves data quality because it reduces the possibility of two systems providing identical data elements but slightly different data.  Data availability is improved through continuous near real-time feeds from the data sources giving the warfighter the most current information to base decisions.  In addition this also accomplishes a reduction in legacy systems mandated by OPNAV.  JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION because it includes those projects that have passed Milestone B approval and are conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirement prior to full-rate production decision.","","121.540","","","",

Two contracts were awarded: one contract was awarded to BAE Systems Land & Armaments Limited Partnership (L.P.) and one was awarded to General Dynamics Land Systems Inc. Revisions to the GCV strategy were approved via an ADM that was signed on 16 January 2013. The Army's exploration of the capabilities trade-space prior to finalizing requirements led to a modified set of requirements that required additional preliminary design effort. The ADM directed the TD phase to be extended by six months (for a total of 30 months) and envisioned a MS B in late FY2014. The GCV Project Manager took steps to incorporate these decisions into the program by issuing Undefinitized Change Orders to both contractors in April 2013. The following funding requirements/justifications reflect these decisions.Fiscal constraints and competing demands during budget uncertainty forced the Army to make hard choices between near-term readiness and modernizing current systems to meet near term capability gaps and developing the GCV.  Given fiscal constraints and where we are in current technology the Army concludes this is not the right time to develop the GCV and will end the program following the Technology Development phase.  We have benefitted from our investment in GCV and will use the insights gained to inform technology maturation efforts in support of a strategy for the Army's future Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) modernization program.The funding in FY2015 will support continuing advanced concept development trade studies technology maturation technical / operational / affordability analyses and perhaps limited prototyping to assess future designs that integrate emerging S&T technologies.","","","","","",

DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors other information sources all Warfighting Functions and the Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (ICITE).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed and Mobile configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested a continuing series of software releases will be integrated into Army Common/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process.The Army Acquisition Executive designated to PEO IEW&S and DCGS-A as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead.  As such DCGS-A is defining the architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition Logistics and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.DCGS-A consolidates enhances and modernizes the Tasking Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities formerly found in nine Army intelligence programs of record (Common Ground Station (CGS) Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) Counterintelligence & Interrogator Operations Workstation (CI&I OPS WS) All Source Analysis System (ASAS) Enhanced TracWolf (ETW) Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS) Integrated Meteorological System (IMETS) Tactical Exploitation System (TES) and Prophet Control) and two Quick Reaction Capabilities (Joint Intelligence Operations Center – Iraq (JIOC-I) and Imagery Work Station(IWS)).  DCGS-A provides these technologically advanced PED capabilities in tailored and scalable mobile and fixed configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  The program develops software packages to be embedded in mission command and other select systems to provide required ISR/analytic capabilities.  DCGS-A is a critical Army priority.DCGS-A software is tailored by echelon and scalable to each unit's mission.  DCGS-A provides commanders and staffs the ability to maintain an accurate and up to date understanding of the operational environment.  The DCGS-A contribution to commanders' visualization and situational awareness rapid planning and the synchronization of all warfighting functions enable Army units to operate within the enemy's decision cycle.  This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from humanitarian to major combat operations.The DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a sanctuary based processing environment.  The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers where the data is stored.  This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems.  Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12/Full Deployment Decision in 1QFY13 the program is deploying DCGS-A Increment 1 Release 1 Software Baseline capability throughout the Army.FY15 Base funding in the amount of $9.270 million for 956 will be used for the continued development and testing of the DCGS-A Increment 1 Software Releases as well as the continued development and testing of the of the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) as it fits into the Army's overarching Common Operating Environment (COE) construct.   The COE has been directed by the ASA(ALT) and concurred by the Army G3/5/7 as a priority effort to align all Army networks procurements and enhancements under one COE vision.  Funds used for efforts associated with the development of the CPCE/COE will include the continued merger/collapse of capabilities across multiple Battlefield Functional Areas (BFAs) and the consolidation of hardware used across the BFAs.  Funds used for efforts associated with the development of the software will include continued advancements in the Standard Sharable Geospatial Foundation to support the Tactical Common Operating Picture as well as further investment into capabilities and widget development supporting All Source Intelligence Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) and emerging architectural and infrastructure enhancements.  Furthermore the program will update the commercial technologies to the latest version(s) to enable industry developed enhanced features. Testing activities requiring these funds will include Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) for Release 3; Participation in Network Integration Evaluation and Exercises such as: Empire Challenge ULCHI Freedom Guardian and Joint Interoperability Certification test(s) for each software release. The result of these activities all serve to prove out the capabilities in Increment 1 Release 3 and COE Version 3 (COE V3).FY15 Base funding in the amount of $10.885 million for D07 will continue the iterative DCGS-A software releases that will increase the Processing Exploitation and Dissemination capability our Army requires.  Increment 2 of the DCGS-A program will continue critical updates to the All Source Intelligence and the overarching Intelligence Processing capability to the Army through the Cloud Computing capability.  This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment while maintaining the incremental software updates required to remain current.","","","","","",

Additional initiatives will continue to focus on the transition of technologies directly supporting emerging requirements and the Army's Current and Future Force.  CSP is being procured for the Gray Eagle UAS program and has potential application to other platforms.   Project 11B:   The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor currently under development for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology and as the adversaries use of technology changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs).  The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals standard military signals and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection recognition identification direction finding and high confidence geo-location.  The TSP system operates in two modes passive and active to provide an enhanced Aerial Precision Geolocation (APG) capability.Project 123:   The Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops integrates and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow Hunter and Gray Eagle programs and provides modeling and simulation support. The MUSE is a real-time operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC/SIL and MUSE enhancements.

The SM-3 Block IIA missile will expand available battlespace and include Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) and selected longer-range threats and when combined with additional weapon system modifications will enable an Engage-on-Remote (EoR) capability. SM-3 Block IIA and Aegis BMD 5.1 will further extend Aegis BMDs range capability by capitalizing on globally-deployed BMDS sensor assets. The certification and deployment will take place by FY 2018. BMD Systems Engineering:Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Systems Engineering integrates element development and Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP) work to optimize the capability of the BMDS. Modeling and simulation (M&S) activities support all phases of Aegis BMD`s development including development of Aegis Weapon System (AWS) and SM-3 variants flight test missions ground tests war games exercises and performance assessment. Models and simulations are tailored to the specific need of a component in its current phase of development ranging from low-to-medium fidelity analysis supporting concept definition studies to high-fidelity models used to support engineering development or testing and are integrated into the BMD Digital Simulations Architecture. Proving Missile Defense: Working with the Services` Operational Test Agencies (OTA) with the support of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has developed a test program to improve confidence in missile defense capabilities under development and ensure the capabilities transferred to the war fighter are operationally effective and suitable. As part of the Agency`s rigorous test program System Pre-Flight predictions provide confidence in test execution by predicting element performance and exercising element interfaces. System Post Flight Reconstruction replicates the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) configuration and actual environmental conditions and target dynamics observed in flight to anchor modeling and simulation results. Testing includes SM-3 intercept using Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) as a remote sensor. The Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP) is event-oriented and extends until the collection of all identified data is completed to ensure adequate data is collected to support Verification Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) for Missile Defense Modeling and Simulation (M&S).

The C2BMC enables the BMDS to manage complex threats -- near simultaneous enemy missile shots aimed at theater regional or homeland assets. The systems linked through C2BMC include Phased Array Tracking Radar Intercept on Target (PATRIOT) Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Ground Based Midcourse Defense (GMD); and sensors such as the Army Navy/Ground Transportable Radar Surveillance model 2 (AN/TPY-2) radar Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX) Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and (BMDS) Overhead Persistent Infra-Red (OPIR) Architecture (BOA). The C2BMC Program will ship a C2BMC Deployable Interface Node (CDIN) in support of a second forward based AN/TPY-2 to the Pacific Command. The C2BMC program will install communications support Hardware-in-the-Loop (HWIL) integration testing provide operations and sustainment and training. Based on the Missile Defense Agency's defined architectures and system specifications the C2BMC program will provide the warfighter the capability to plan the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) fight while concurrently tracking all potential ballistic missile threats and pairing any sensor with any shooter to defeat ballistic missile threats at any range in any phase in all theaters. C2BMC battle management via the Global Engagement Manager (GEM) will deliver full AN/TPY-2 X-Band radar sensor control and capabilities for improved threat object correlation which calculates a common threat track from multiple sensors through data fusion with sufficient data accuracy and timeliness for BMDS weapon elements to enable successful engagements via Link-16 and satellite communications. The C2BMC program also works to increase coalition partners' capabilities. This Program Element includes support for the Discrimination Improvements for Homeland Defense (DIHD) effort. The goal of this effort is to develop and field an integrated set of Element capabilities to improve BMDS reliability lethality and discrimination.

This effort will encompass a DIHD Near-Term capability fielding and a DIHD Mid-Term capability fieldingThe C2BMC Program will expand defense of the United States allies and deployed forces by continuing work that enables a coordinated missile defense against short - to long - range threats in multiple regions/theaters. One of the best ways to dissuade deter and defeat ballistic missile threats is through integrated ballistic missile defense capabilities: weapons; sensors; and command and control battle management and communications. A potential or actual attack may cross regions and may fly higher and faster than stand-alone autonomous capabilities operated by a single Military Service can defend against. Integrated Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities draw on space- land- and sea-based assets operated by multiple Services to provide the best sensor information about the enemy missiles location and track a more diverse and effective set of weapon options to be used by the Combatant Commander to defeat the attack; with all connected by a unifying Command and Control Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) system. As a result an effort funded in a program element may be critical to the success of efforts in other program elements.

The suite of remote ground-based sensors provide early warning midcourse and terminal ballistic missile defense threat data enabling layered detection and tracking of ballistic missile targets providing fire-control quality position velocity and discrimination data through Command and Control Battle Management Communications (C2BMC). Overlapping sensor coverage of geographically diverse sensors provides improved threat track data as well as reducing the loss of any one sensor and reducing the potential impact of countermeasures. The extended coverage and accuracy provided by a network of layered sensors increases the defensive footprint and reduces the number of target engagements required thereby conserving interceptor inventory and ensuring a high probability of successful engagement. Networked forward-based sensors enables C2BMC to pair the best sensor coverage with the best available weapon system to provide the most effective defense against ballistic missile threats. This Program Element includes support for the Discrimination Improvements for Homeland Defense (DIHD) effort. The goal of this effort is to develop and field an integrated set of Element capabilities to improve BMDS reliability lethality and discrimination.  The end result will be a deployed future BMDS architecture more capable of discriminating and destroying a reentry vehicle with a high degree of confidence that will improve Warfighter shot doctrine and preserve inventory.  This effort will encompass a DIHD Near-Term capability fielding and a DIHD Mid-Term capability fielding.  The BMD Sensors Program contributes to regional missile defense through the following activities: Development delivery and deployment or redeployment of remote forward based Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance and Control (AN/TPY-2) radars to include radars for tests or operations. Radars provide early warning track and discrimination data through all phases of ballistic missile flight. Through the BMDS C2BMC and coalition data links the AN/TPY-2 provides fire control data to enable remote Standard Missile (SM)-3 engagements by Aegis BMD to allow earlier engagement by the Arrow Weapon System and to cue deployed THAAD and U.S. and partner PATRIOT batteries. Provides the enhancements/development of AN/TPY-2 software across the fleet of radars. Lessons learned from each radar are addressed in new software builds that are developed tested and subsequently installed at each radar. AN/TPY-2 radars can be configured to operate either as a THAAD Fire Unit Radar (terminal mode) or Forward-Based Radar. These radars are transportable adding flexibility to respond to geographical changes in threats. The AN/TPY-2 used in a forward-based role provides detection and tracking during the boost phase. This significantly reduces the uncertainty in target discrimination and reaction time increasing the probability of a successful BMDS engagement. In forward-based mode the AN/TPY-2 also provides acquisition and track data via the BMDS C2BMC and Link 16 to the Aegis missile defense system for cueing. The AN/TPY-2 used in terminal mode is an integral component of the THAAD Battery. The THAAD battery radar is capable of tracking multiple threats and multiple interceptors during engagements in the terminal phase. It provides surveillance acquisition track discrimination interceptor communications and hit assessment data collection for the fire control. The current and planned utilization of the AN/TPY-2 radars supports GMD THAAD and the Aegis Weapon System via C2BMC. The Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) network of sensors also includes the COBRA DANE Radar at Eareckson Air Force Station in Alaska and the Upgraded Early Warning Radars (UEWR) at Beale Air Force Base CA Fylingdales Royal Air Force United Kingdom and at Thule Air Force Base in Greenland. These Ultra High Frequency Early Warning Radars (EWR) have been upgraded to include missile defense functionality. This upgrade expands the capabilities of the U.S. to include defense against limited long-range threats. The Clear EWR located at Clear Air Force Station AK and the Cape Cod EWR Located at Cape Cod Air Force Station MA are also being upgraded to include missile defense functionality. Upgrade activities began in FY 2012 and are expected to be completed in FY 2017. The addition of the Clear UEWR and Cape Cod UEWRs the BMDS sensor architecture will improve BMDS sensor coverage and provide new engagement options against long-range missile threats. The BMD Vision Study conducted by MDA with USSTRATCOM identified the need to enhance the discrimination capabilities of our sensors and weapon systems.  The BMD Sensors Program meets this need through the following activities:One of the critical areas identified in the study to be addressed by the future BMDS was the need to provide a more robust discrimination capability to support the defense of the Homeland.  As part of the BMDS Integrated Discrimination strategy the addition of a Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) to the BMDS would address this critical need through providing persistent 24/7 precision tracking and discrimination capability.  The development  integration and fielding of the LRDR will  provide an improved persistent midcourse Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) discrimination capability in the Pacific architecture optimize the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) interceptor inventory and address evolving threats.  In addition the radar will provide larger hit assessment coverage potentially supporting improved warfighting capability to manage the GBI inventory and improving the capacity of the BMDS.In addition there is an Enhanced Discrimination and sensors program that will improve discrimination capabilities of the AN/TPY-02 Cobra Dane Sea Based X-Band and the UEWR radars against the long range missile threat.    The BMDS Sensors Program also contributes to the testing and proving of the U.S. missile defense systems through the following activities: -Participation in BMDS flight and ground test campaigns -Modeling and simulation (M&S) efforts to include: enhanced sensor models development of Radio Frequency scene generators integration of digital simulations into the BMDS M&S architecture and Verification Validation and Accreditation of radar models.MD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management costs in support of the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).","The FY 2014 increase reflects the congressional plus up for enhanced discrimination capability.

A robust “detect and track” capability of "dark" (i.e. non-emitting) maritime targets.  This is accomplished through automated data fusion of an existing suite of sensors supporting the Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) function.  This capability was successfully transitioned into the Sealink Advanced Analysis system at Office of Naval Intelligence and is now used by multiple agencies to provide a MDA capability.2. An operational internet-based open-access Arctic-focused environmental research and decision-support system that enables local regional and international cooperation and coordination on long-term environmental planning and near-term actions in response to climatic and environmental changes occurring in the Arctic Region.3. A vastly improved capability for U.S. NATO and Coalition naval forces boarding operations data collection and sharing of time-critical boarding and biometrics information during an international operational assessment in April 2013.• The JCTD Program enables coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources; approximately one-third of JCTD projects involve some degree of coalition partner participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom Canada Australia and the Republic of Korea. • The JCTD Program enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects such as projects with the Department of Homeland Security State Transportation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  • The JCTD Program enables rapid response to new DoD priorities before Service PPBE cycles can respond.  For example the DoD has established priorities for Anti-Access/Area-Denial Building Partner Capacity understanding human terrain and nuclear forensics.  The JCTD Program quickly responded to the new priorities and is providing initial capabilities that are transitioning to the warfighter today.MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  • Capabilities delivered and technologies transitioned have been key metrics:1. JCTDs typically transition capability within 24 - 36 months with initial spiral products and deliverables in less than 24 months.  2. The JCTD program has been achieving transition rates of over 80 percent well in excess of the DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D Performance Measure 3.5.1-2D goal of 40 percent.  The JCTD Program defines transition as all or components of the demonstrated JCTD going to a new or existing Program(s) of Record providing fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater or commodity-type capabilities entered onto GSA schedule for procurement by DoD users.  In FY 2013 12 of 12 completed JCTDs successfully transitioned.","Historically the Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) Program has worked primarily with the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) and Services to identify DoD priorities and accelerated the development and demonstration of technical solutions.  However with the end of current conflicts there has been a strategic shift to a more balanced approach that will continue to address COCOM needs in conjunction with initiating broader longer-term JCTDs to address DoD’s strategic initiatives to mitigate emergent threats address affordability and interoperability of defense systems.  The JCTD Program will begin to employ developmental and operational prototypes to address these longer-term DoD priorities.The shift in the JCTD Program will also result in a shift in Program metrics.  JCTDs supporting the DoD’s strategic initiatives will tend to be longer and larger with less focus on transition and partner funding.  Overall we envision initiating fewer yet more impactful JCTD projects. In FY 2015 Disruptive Demonstrations (Project P264) funding will be transferred from Program Element (PE) 0603648D8Z (Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD)) to PE 0603289D8Z (Advanced Innovative Analysis & Concepts).","192.297","","","",

The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment to this effort.  The DoD funds budgeted in this justification are matched dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation DoD’s relatively small annual investment leverages DOE’s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills advanced scientific equipment and facilities and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services’ needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration development and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.The JMP seeks to develop:  improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions design and evaluation including evaluation of vulnerability (for example: design of insensitive munitions (IM)); novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation and materials characterizations; higher power and safer energetic materials (EMs)(e.g. explosives and propellants); miniaturized lower-cost and higher reliability fuzes initiators power systems and sensors; design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons—such as penetrators—that are hardened against high impact loads; and tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.The JMP is aligned with Department strategic plans and policies such as:•	Advancing munitions for contingency operations particularly for the reduction of unintended collateral effects.•	Reducing time and cost for acquisition of munitions.•	Rapidly transitioning science and technology (S&T) to support the warfighter in today’s conflicts.•	Establishing future core capabilities and maintaining our national S&T capabilities through joint investment and interagency cooperation and teaming.•	Aiding in recruiting and retaining high-caliber scientists and engineers at DoD S&T organizations.•	Developing advanced munitions technologies to support the increased role of conventional weapons to deter and respond to non-nuclear attack as described in the Nuclear Posture Review report.•	Developing safer munitions that are compliant with IM standards to meet statutory and Department policy requirements.The JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers. This community develops technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) which is comprised of over 25 senior executives from the Army Navy Air Force Special Operations Command the Defense Threat Reduction Agency OSD and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content relevance and progress.  The TCGs conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCGs to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD needs.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.The JMP has a long history of successful transitions and significant Return on Investment (ROI).•	The JMP is the primary provider of high performance physics-based structural mechanics computer codes used by DoD.  The Department expects this heavy reliance on DOE codes to grow for several reasons including: preference for using DOE codes because they are export-controlled; DOE codes are scalable incorporate multiphysics modules run on massively parallel computer systems and the Department can obtain source codes to modify the tools for individual Service needs.  According to the FY 2014 High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) Requirements Analysis Report the DOE computer codes are used for over 82 percent of all (classified and unclassified) structural mechanics simulations and for virtually all of the classified calculations run by DoD on HPCMP platforms.  The CPU (central processing unit) hours for CTH alone grew by eight fold between FY12 to FY14 (from 63 million CPU hours to 584 CPU hours).•	A significant number of defense industrial contractors also use the DOE structural mechanics computer codes.•	Cheetah a standalone thermochemical computer code is the most widely used code by DoD and defense contractors for predicting performance of energetic materials.•	The Army Research & Engineering Development Center (ARDEC) has stated that the DOE computer codes are now routinely used to design all new warheads.  The use of these tools has reduced the number of validation tests required for each new warhead from about five to one with concomitant cost and time savings.  For example DOE codes were used to analyze the fusible plug for Excalibur saving the department close to $2 million dollars.•	The Army Research Laboratory has used DOE computer codes to develop and deploy new armor solutions to Iraq and Afghanistan with unprecedented speed.•	New munitions’ case material and explosive fill technologies provide the warfighter with a lethal and low collateral damage capability.  These technologies have been transitioned to the Focused Lethality Munition variant of the Small Diameter Bomb which is currently fielded.  The technologies are also the basis for a new GBU 129 weapon that is currently under rapid development to meet a Joint Urgent Operational Need requirement for a low-collateral Mk-82 class weapon.•	The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has supported applications of JMP technologies including:  new compact lightweight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) efforts; pre-deployment training of military personnel by DOE explosive experts on how to recognize feed stocks and processes for homemade explosives; and use of massively parallel multiphysics computer codes to understand how explosive blast waves cause brain injury and how to mitigate these injuries.•	An erosive initiator technology developed under the JMP has been transitioned to the Services for use in selectable output weapons and self-destruct capabilities.•	A novel approach to controlling the sensitivity and therefore the initiability of explosives using microwave energy as well two new insensitive energetic materials have transitioned to development projects in the Joint IM Technology and Joint Fuze Technology Programs.•	Reliability analysis tools were used by Army Missile Command to assess Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM) and Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wire command data-linked guided Missile (TOW).•	Robotic demilitarization processing systems were installed at several locations including a system at Hawthorne Army Depot to recover copper shape charge liners Comp A5 and grenade bodies.The JMP works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Warheads and Energetics Consortium (NWEC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors. In addition to the computer codes mentioned earlier the JMP has transitioned case technology for low-collateral weapons low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology for smaller less expensive fuze electronic components and erosive initiator technology for selectable effects weapons to defense industrial suppliers.The integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions’ technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process. The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers. Executive and technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation both within their respective departments and between departments. The highly challenging technical objectives of the approximately 35 JMP projects require multi-year efforts and sustained long-term investments to achieve success.The JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas: Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling; Energetic Materials; Initiators Fuzes and Sensors; Warhead and Penetration Technology; and Munitions Lifecycle Technologies.","","19.538","","R2Long","",

The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the DoD’s “Testing in a Joint Environment Roadmap” to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to “test like we fight.”  JMETC provides a persistent distributed test and evaluation (T&E) capability; supporting system development interoperability testing and cyber testing; that otherwise would not be readily available to Service/Component acquisition programs.  USD (AT&L) directed TRMC to take responsibility for operations and resources of the National Cyber Range (NCR) beginning October 1 2012. The Director of TRMC assigned NCR to JMETC.  The JMETC program is funded within the RDT&E Management Support Budget Activity because it is intended to provide test capability in support of RDT&E programs.  JMETC creates a common corporate capability to link live systems with virtual and constructive representations in order to generate a realistic joint mission test environment for the system(s) being tested.  To support the DoD guidance on cyber defense and attack operations the JMETC environment includes a distributed cyberspace interoperability testing capability for systems under test.  JMETC is a widely applicable persistent service provider for the Department’s acquisition and net-centric programs.  Key JMETC products include readily available connectivity over existing networks standardized data transport solutions tools and utilities for planning and conducting distributed integrations DoD corporate distributed testing expertise and a reuse repository.  This common integration capability through the use of the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) provides compatibility between JMETC and the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) streamlining reuse of technical resources across the test and training communities.  In turn this integration capability enables combined test and training exercises.        By linking distributed facilities JMETC allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  This enables a customer-defined joint mission test environment for systems engineering and testing extensible to training and experimentation in a timely and cost effective manner.        JMETC’s institutional funding builds maintains and operates the JMETC infrastructure and pays for persistent availability of national connectivity for testing; data communications middleware; identification and development of interface standards; common software tools and components; and a reuse repository.  It also funds JMETC program management facilities equipment operating costs and special studies and analysis related to distributed test capabilities and infrastructure.  Key attributes of the JMETC include:  persistency; interoperability; reuse; various combinations of distributed capabilities (reconfigurable infrastructure to meet customer requirements to include distributed cyber testing); modeling and simulation (M&S) linkage; Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) test resource integration; and distributed test support to satisfy both Service and Joint needs.  System engineering training and experimentation all benefit from a corporate JMETC developed for T&E.       The Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is the Department’s lead for the JMETC program and oversees both its development and its operations.","","10.215","","R2Long","",

The Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service Defense and other government agencies T&E needs maximize opportunities for joint efforts and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities.  CTEIP focuses investments on projects that will have high productivity returns on investment.  Projects under the CTEIP Program Element (PE) support two basic tasks: investments to improve the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Project (REP)).JIM projects address critically needed T&E investments in the major functional areas of: air combat; armament and munitions; Command Control Communication Computer and Intelligence (C4I) and networks; common range instrumentation; electronic combat; land combat; sea combat; space combat; threat simulators; and test environments.  Examples of project subject matter include: highly accurate time-space-position information network enhanced telemetry miniaturized flight safety systems realistic urban test environments ground testing for manned and unmanned aerial platforms and satellites and end-to-end testing of infrared countermeasure and electronic warfare systems.  CTEIP continues as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and links between test and training ranges.CTEIP has provided special focus to institutionalize the use of modeling and simulation (M&S) as a practical test tool; to link ranges through internetting to enhance inter-range and inter-Service cooperation and resource sharing; and to ensure development and acquisition of common instrumentation necessary for a more efficient test infrastructure.Analyses of alternative solutions are conducted for each investment project to validate T&E requirements to define integrated support systems and to determine overall cost effectiveness of the proposed test investments.  The use of Department of Defense (DoD)-wide processes for requirement validation prioritization and risk assessment ensures an effective test resource investment program.The REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major high priority defense acquisition programs.  These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness short timelines between system design maturity and scheduled OT and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) or system-of-systems testing.  Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning and ensures their availability and legacy for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.This Research Category 6.4 PE includes special studies analyses and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure and supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD component weapon system test requirements.","","156.249","","R2Long","",

The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) establishes a capabilities-based adaptive near real-time readiness information system for the DoD. This system is being designed to measure the readiness of military forces and supporting infrastructure to meet missions and goals assigned by the Secretary of Defense. DRRS hosts information and applications used to support the Geographic and Functional Combatant Commanders.The transformation of readiness reporting into a new more comprehensive system presents a number of significant challenges. First there are thousands of new potential reporting entities to include in DRRS such as Combatant Commands Joint Task Forces Services Active and Reserve component units installations depots ports and major elements of the industrial base. These entities must not only define and implement reporting based on specific readiness metrics but they must make their readiness status continuously available in near real time to DRRS. Second the shift from resource centric readiness reporting to a mission/ capabilities based reporting system oriented towards the National Military Strategy (NMS) makes substantially more complex demands on readiness reporting. DRRS allows the Department to assess readiness globally based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements. Finally the challenges associated with sourcing and evaluating the readiness of our forces engaged in on-going real operations mean that force managers need applications that will query the entire Department for suitable available organizations to meet current needs. The need for these applications and the underlying data are a top priority for the DRRS project.The realization of DRRS requires integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that supports distributed collaborative and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment. The primary technical goal is the creation of a highly reliable and securely integrated readiness data environment to leverage and extend current readiness information systems. This system is based on intelligent agents dynamic databases semantic middleware and publish/subscribe concepts; providing a logically uniform view into the multiple databases and information sources that feed DRRS. Through this type of advanced information environment the DRRS dramatically expands the range of readiness information available to manage the force. This environment supports a suite of analysis tools that allow users to explore the consequences of readiness deficiencies in terms of the ability to generate forces and assess transportation feasibility as it pertains to specific scenarios. These tools and tool suites harness the power of the information environment to make possible the kind of quick-turnaround excursion-driven readiness assessment that is at the heart of DRRS.","","6.598","","","",

Starting in FY 2013 the JASP and JTCG/ME programs were realigned from the Operational Test Activities and Analyses program element (0605814OTE) to the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program element (0605131OTE).  The JASP focuses on survivability improvements supporting aircraft acquisition and JTCG/ME focuses on the lethality of currently fielded weapons systems; therefore the two programs are more appropriately budgeted within the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program element.This Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E).  The primary objective of LFT&E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or if not available acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.This Program Element also supports DoD’s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&E related initiatives.  JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons both U.S. and foreign for their lethality against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD’s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Aeronautical Systems Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&E to improve military aircraft survivability develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&S) facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG) which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT) is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&E and is also an Executive Agent for the Survivability Vulnerability Information Analysis Center (SURVIAC) the repository for aircraft survivability information.The Joint Logistics Commanders Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME) was chartered more than 40 years ago to serve as DoD’s focal point for munitions effectiveness information.  This has taken the form of widely used Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) which address all major non-nuclear U.S. weapons.  JTCG/ME authenticates weapons effectiveness data for use in operational weaponeering strike mission planning training systems acquisition weapon procurement and combat modeling and simulation.  JMEMs are used by the Armed Forces of the U.S. NATO and other allies to plan operational missions support training and tactics development and support force-level analyses.  JTCG/ME also develops and standardizes methodologies for evaluation of munitions effectiveness and maintains databases for target vulnerability munitions lethality and weapon system accuracy.  The JMEM requirements and development processes continues to be driven by operational lessons learned (Enduring Freedom Iraqi Freedom and Odyssey Dawn) and the needs of Combatant Commands Services Military Targeting Committee and Operational Users Working Groups input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. This program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&E JASP and JTCG/ME programs.","","12.126","","","",

JT&E projects are test and evaluation activities conducted in a joint military environment that develop process improvements.  These multi-Service projects chartered by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and coordinated with the Joint Staff appropriate combatant commanders and the Services provide nonmaterial solutions that improve: joint interoperability of Service systems technical and operational concepts joint operational issues  development and validation of joint test methodologies and test data for validating models simulations and test beds.  The JT&E projects address relevant joint war fighting issues in a joint test and evaluation environment by developing and providing new TTPs to improve joint test capabilities and methodologies.Threat Systems based on a memorandum of agreement between the Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) and the Defense Intelligence Agency provides DOT&E support in the areas of threat resource analysis intelligence support and threat systems investments. Threat Systems provides threat resource analyses on the availability capabilities and limitations of threat representations (threat simulators targets models U.S. surrogates and foreign materiel) and analysis of test resources used for operational testing to support DOT&E’s assessment of the adequacy of testing for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&E and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Technology and Logistics (OUSD(AT&L)).

These investments directly support the new defense strategy and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force. The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)- Joint Simulation System (JSS)- Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC)- U.S. Forces Korea Training & Exercise Support (USFK)- Air Force JNTC- Navy JNTCJNTC:  Investment in the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program will enable Service and Combatant Commands (CCMD)  to train as they operate.  This investment will develop a cloud-enabled joint training environment building on previous development of Scenario Management Tools for planning and executing joint training.  In 2016 this investment will enable access at the point of need (Service and CCMD trainers) for planning and executing joint training.  This investment will increase the relevance and realism of training by providing training capabilities which replicate the contemporary and future operating environment.  This program also enables the Department of Defense (DOD) to be responsive to the warfighters’ pace of changing operational concepts threat environments and best practices.JSS:  The Joint Simulation System (JSS) will decompose harvest and reuse DoD investment in joint simulations to develop cloud-enabled modular services (CEMS) reaching Initial Operating Capability in FY16.  JSS will enhance existing Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation (JCATS) and Joint Theater Level Simulation (JTLS) to meet CCMDs’ training requirements.  JSS will provide design and development of web-based applications used as services in CEMS environment.JKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the DOD unique and authoritative source for online joint training.  JKDDC JKO is tasked to develop a Joint Individual Training Toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products and services.  Products and services are developed in response to OSD(P&R) CE2T2 Program Goals & Objectives guidance CJCS High Interest Training Items Joint Staff J7 training priorities and JKDDC JKO Stakeholder (CCMDs Services and Combat Support Agencies) prioritized training requirements.  JKDDC JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum joint professional military education and tailored common training standards to Service members for tasks that are jointly executed resulting in trained capable and interoperable joint forces.  JKO research and development will improve:  -  Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desk top modeling and simulation based training: These capabilities train and prepare tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to CCMD theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets. Specifically C/JTF ‘battle staffs’ will be adequately trained as individuals and the staffs collectively based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise.  -  JKO mobile “pilot” courseware training device development:  This facilitates the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable hand-held platforms.  -  JKO Learning Management System (LCMS): JKO LCMS development is required to deliver JKO courses and track/report students’ completions more efficiently.  -  Develop the future virtual worlds learning environment.  It will provide training and learning to promote adaptability and agility in the workforce through an interactive immersive virtual gaming environment.      USFK:  The U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) Training & Exercise Support program is developing simulations capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations.  Interoperability with the Republic of Korea-developed Korean Simulation System is a critical and unique requirement of this USFK RDT&E program.  This solution will be capable of interoperating in a common battle space that realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences tactical to strategic in Korean theater exercises.  While supporting USFK’s specific requirements this solution will contain enhancements that will benefit other combatant commander training programs that use the aging Joint Live Virtual and Constructive (JLVC) simulations and the emerging JLVC 2020 simulations.Air Force JNTC:  The Air Force JNTC funding is providing a focused upgrade to developing models for space based capabilities and integrated them into the JLVC environment.  The Air Force is also supporting development of cross domain solutions allowing for the linking of systems with differing security requirements which significantly extend the breadth of the training audiences to additional joint and coalition participants.  Navy JNTC:  These funds enable Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate LVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. Navy program activities include conducting research development test and evaluation and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems developing cross-domain architectures for US and Coalition Forces as well as ensuring sister service modeling/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a common unified standard.","","74.789","","","",

DTIC a DoD Field Activity is the DoD’s singular executive agent and designated source for DoD-funded scientific technical engineering and industry-related information.  DTIC operates DoD Information Analysis Centers focused on Defense Systems Cyber Security and Homeland Defense and Security.   DTIC captures preserves protects and shares research and development (R&D) information assets and connects communities.   These activities and results advance research by providing department level mapping of activities and results to researchers warfighters research and engineering (R&E) management and decision makers.  DTIC manages this mapping through five key areas:1) Document and preserve what works what has promise (reuse and additional investments).2) Determine dead-ends that do not merit additional investment (avoid waste).3) Facilitate and encourage engagement among cross-cutting Communities of Interest (bring together experts across the Acquisition Enterprise and warfighter community driving requirements).4) Present overarching picture of activity that optimizes decision-makers’ ability to coordinate and orchestrate multiple efforts into integrated capabilities (employ assets to highest priority efforts and coordinate efforts across services).5) Protect intellectual property (IP) and industry proprietary data assets entrusted to DTIC’s stewardship (access to those DoD trusts protection from those we don’t).DTIC must accomplish its mission in an environment of Department-wide budget reductions while increasing our value.  DTIC is leading the Department in efforts to provide Open Access to DoD funded journal articles and research data.  We must ensure our activities are efficient and effective meet users’ expectations and employ industry best practices and standards while protecting from cyber threats.DoD’s $120 Billion annual investment in research development and procurement support current and future capabilities to defeat our adversaries and protect national security.  The results of these efforts are a national asset that DTIC preserves and facilitates their reuse across the Acquisition Enterprise.  Approximately 21% of the 4 million records in DTIC’s information holdings are sensitive DoD only federal government only and industry proprietary.  DTIC is the only enterprise source for both publicly accessible and DoD sensitive material in a single location.The Information Analysis Center (IAC) Program Office at DTIC provides core funding management and oversight of the IACs.  The IACs are chartered by DoD to collect analyze and disseminate worldwide scientific and technical information in specialized fields.  The IAC program is in a multi-year restructuring from ten IACs to three reducing customer costs and reflecting new DoD technical interest areas.  The new structure will focus on three technology groupings to include Cyber Security and Information Systems Homeland Defense and Security and Defense Systems.  As part of the Department’s Better Buying Power initiative new multi-award contracts are being put into place improving competition small-business presence and reducing government costs.  The restructured IAC Program will improve affordability productivity and standardization within defense acquisition programs.  Providing the Acquisition Enterprise access to thousands of industry Subject Matter Experts DTIC’s IACs perform well over a billion dollars of customer funded research and prototyping support annually.  The results of the work are a rich source of material in DTIC’s information asset collections and are available to users across the Department (and other federal agencies e.g. Department of Energy Department of Homeland Security).This Program Element (PE) supports DTIC mission operations.  DTIC focuses on core mission and buys space Human Resources Financial Management and civilian payroll services from expert and efficient providers:  funding provides for salaries and benefits of government civilian personnel assigned to DTIC; training professional development and travel for DTIC personnel; support agreements for Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) facility-related services; Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) financial activities and Human Resource (HR) services; Defense Information Services Agency (DISA) communications support; annual maintenance and licensing requirements; supplies equipment hardware/software; and support contracts for Information Technology services Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI) system integration and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliance efforts in concert with the Department’s Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) program.

This mission has been defined by the 2002 Unified Command Plan (UCP) changes 1 and 2.  To enable completion of these missions USSTRATCOM is modernizing the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as Strategic War Planning System (SWPS)) and establishing a unified national architecture integrating disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) data into a single Internet Protocol (IP)-based system known as the Global Sensor Integrated Network (GSIN) to provide redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership.  When the ISPAN modernization is complete the system will support the warfighter in both deliberate and adaptive planning environments while allowing the National Command Authorities to employ the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons.  The ISPAN system will continue to evolve as weapon systems are matured new systems are developed and the threat changes particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).   The nation's strategic Command and Control (C2) sensors and other planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes.  GSIN establishes a unified national architecture integrating disparate MW/MD systems into a single IP-based system that will provide redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership.  GSIN nets together all sensors from tactical to strategic (including the Nation's most modern and capable assets) taking advantage of their larger numbers improved algorithms mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts.

SBIRS EMD:  The Space-Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) primary mission is to provide initial warning of a ballistic missile attack on the US its deployed forces and its allies. SBIRS will enhance detection and improve reporting of intercontinental ballistic missile launches submarine launched ballistic missile launches and tactical ballistic missile launches. SBIRS supports Missile Defense Battlespace Awareness and Technical Intelligence missions by providing reliable accurate and timely data to Unified Combatant Commanders Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders the intelligence community and other users. SBIRS provides increased detection and tracking performance in order to meet requirements in Air Force Space Command's Operational Requirements Document. The SBIRS system includes both space and ground elements. The space segment consists of Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites payloads hosted on satellites in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) and Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites. The ground segment consists of both fixed and mobile data processing elements communications infrastructure and relay ground stations serving all SBIRS space elements. The HEO-1 and HEO-2 payloads are on-orbit and certified for Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) missile warning operations and technical intelligence operations. The GEO-1 and GEO-2 satellites have completed AFSPC and USSTRATCOM operational acceptance.  GEO-1 received ITW/AA certification in August 2013  The GEO-2 satellite received ITW/AA certification in December 2013. Ground segment development continues through FY18.  The baseline requirement document is the 1996 SBIRS ORD.2. SMI: Future SBIRS Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) satellites will be procured using the Department of Defense (DOD) Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) concept. ESP is an approach which seeks stable production and efficient sub-contractor product management through the block buy of two space vehicles at one time (please see SBIRS P-40 Exhibit). A portion of the savings realized from ESP block buys are programmed for investment into OPIR Space Modernization Initiative (SMI); the current OPIR SMI project was established in this manner in the FY12 President's Budget. The primary objective of SMI is to enable and inform future decisions to maintain and evolve a capable resilient and affordable OPIR architecture by maturing technologies and mitigating risk areas to facilitate OPIR modernization to be executed within the Department's constrained resources.  SMI supports the Program of Record by assessing future parts and material obsolescence and future affordability and capability design modifications.  SMI funds engineering activities to reduce future system and production costs through manufacturing and producibility enhancements and through technology insertion. SMI will also mature potential technology upgrades at the component and system level for future space and ground architecture affordability and capability enhancements. The SBIRS OPIR SMI plan includes studies and risk reduction activities to evolve the current Program of Record SBIRS GEO satellites reduce production schedules and reduce system costs. SMI funded data exploitation efforts include OPIR mission data processing data fusion data publication algorithm development network connectivity and sensor performance assessments. The data exploitation efforts will identify affordable responsive and resilient measures to improve battlespace awareness data dissemination to the warfighter. SMI Architecture and Component Study efforts will assess future architecture alternatives for viability affordability capability and resilience. The SMI Hosted Payloads and Wide Field of View Testbeds efforts will explore technology maturation qualification of new components and subsystem/component prototyping to evolve the OPIR architecture.3. Evolved SBIRS Follow-on: Knowledge gained from the SBIRS SMI projects will inform a future Defense Acquisition Board(DAB)decision for the Evolved SBIRS effort.  DAB alternatives are expected to include 1) continued production of SBIRS PoR design; 2) an evolved satellite and ground system derived from the SBIRS POR designs; 3) an evolved satellite and ground system that includes a combination of PoR derivatives and new systems; or 4)a disaggregated OPIR system.  The Evolved SBIRS effort will implement the DAB directed program alternative begining with FY18 funding.

Armed with a W80 warhead it is designed to evade air and ground-based defenses in order to strike targets at any location within any enemy's territory.  The ALCM is designed for B-52H internal and external carriage.  The purpose of this program is to ensure ALCM sustainability through 2030 in support of Air Force strategic nuclear deterrence and global strike mission requirements.An ALCM Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) was developed to support ALCM Service Life through 2030.  The results of SLEP studies identified system components and support equipment that will become non-supportable prior to 2030.  Service life extension of this critical weapon is essential to meet United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) deliberate planning commitments. Development funds are required to add capabilities to assist in identifying candidate components for future SLEP efforts.The Aging and Surveillance program for ALCM continuously assesses critical components such as those in the safe arm and fuze subsystem navigation/guidance system and electrical/power distribution system.  The program identifies aging trends prior to failures in fielded components that would result in fleet-wide reliability and supportability problems.  Development funds are required to update software test procedures and test equipment.  FY15 funding will complete the Guided Missile Flight Controller sub-component testing and allow for the development of test capabilities for additional ALCM components.  As part of the build phase of the sustaining engineering approach the program has developed a plan for ALCM sustainment using a computer-aided decision making process called the ALCM Sustainment Enhancement Toolbox (ASET).  The first phase of ASET is the ALCM Report Recommendation Tool (ARRT).  FY15 funds are required to continue developing test procedures to implement the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS)-directed requirement for High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) testing for nuclear systems.BA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","","","R2Long","",

The PMOU went into effect in Sept 2009 when 15 nations including the United States financially committed to support procurement and delivery of the NATO Commander's number one priority to the warfighter.  Canada withdrew in August 2011 leaving 14 participating nations.  Poland recently requested accession which will bring the participating nations back to 15.  In FY 2012 OSD transferred the NATO AGS project to the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for management and execution. The NATO AGS project funds the U.S. share of the cost for NATO to acquire an air-to-ground ground surveillance capability improvements to the radar and U.S. support of NATO AGS-related activities. Operations and continuing support will be funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package funded within the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). The AGS system will be a NATO-owned and operated airborne ground surveillance capability that provides continuous wide area surveillance information in all weather conditions for use at the strategic operational and tactical levels of command. Interoperable with other national assets AGS will provide NATO decision makers with near real time continuous information and situational awareness concerning friendly neutral and opposing ground and maritime forces to support mission planning and execution including force protection and targeting. The NATO AGS Program includes:  an air segment consisting of five (5) NATO-developed air vehicles incorporating elements of the USN Triton (previously Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS)) command and control architecture and the U.S. Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) radar; a unique exportable configuration; a ground segment for data exploitation and distribution that consists of fixed-based site and transportable/mobile ground stations; establishment and operation of a management organization; development of operations and support concepts; and definition and establishment of an initial support capability.  As part of the U.S. government agreement with NATO AGS Management Agency (NAGSMA) the U.S. will integrate Maritime Moving Target and Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar capability into the MP-RTIP radar for NATO AGS. This design and development includes correcting deficiencies flight testing on the modes and system level performance validation. System level configuration changes include a unique configuration to allow for export of the system. Deliveries are planned for 2016-2017. Follow-on sustainment and operations will be supported by all 28 NATO nations through their contributions of funding to the program. Mission elements will support two orbits. The Main Operating Base (MOB) air vehicles and mission C2 will be located at Naval Air Station Sigonella Italy. Exploitation at the MOB will be developed by Selex. EADS and Selex will develop the transportable and mobile general ground stations.  The program managed by NAGSMA is composed of design development demonstration and production as well as Initial In-Service Support (IISS). While the current program includes IISS the current Direct Commercial Sale (DCS) contract with Northrop Grumman does not include these tasks.The DCS contract between Northrop Grumman and NAGSMA was signed on 20 May 2012. This funding is the U.S. cost share for the acquisition of the NATO airborne ground surveillance capability as well as the cost share associated with the IISS. IISS and In-Service Support (ISS) will be contracted under separate action. It is anticipated that ISS costs will be commonly funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package using the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP).

The consistent accuracy unaffected by location or weather and available in real time significantly improves effectiveness of reconnaissance weapons delivery mine countermeasures and rapid deployment for all services. GPS must comply with Title 10 United States Code (USC) 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures that continued sustainment and operations of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 51 USC sec 50112 which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.The system is composed of three segments: user equipment (funded under PE 0305164F) space (funded under this PE and PE 0305165F) and a control network (funded under PE 0305165F and PE 0603423F). The satellites broadcast high accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals which are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. This equipment computes the platform position and velocity and provides steering vectors to target locations or navigation waypoints. The control segment provides daily updates to the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to maintain system precision in three dimensions to 16 meters spherical error probable worldwide. Additionally GPS supports the United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) mission and provides strategic and tactical support to the following Department of Defense (DoD) missions: Joint Operations by providing capabilities for Positioning Navigation and Timing (PNT); Command Control Communications and Intelligence; Special Operations; Military Operations in Urban Terrain; Defense-Wide Mission Support; Air Mobility; and Space Launch Orbital Support.GPS III is the next generation Space Vehicle (SV) to join the GPS constellation. GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements including a new civil (L1C) Galileo- compatible signal and enhanced anti-jam power. SV11 will add two additional secondary payloads Search and Rescue/GPS (SAR/GPS) and Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA). The SAR/GPS payload provided by Canada will fill a validated National Search and Rescue Committee requirement to provide enduring space-based distress alerting capability to detect locate and relay distress alerts to fulfill its responsibilities under international agreements for Search and Rescue. SAR integration costs are funded by the Coast Guard. LRA built by the Naval Research Lab (NRL) is a passive reflector that will improve accuracy and provide better ephemeris data. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) funds the integration costs of LRA.RDT&E AF PE 0305265F funds GPS III and will support research development test and evaluation of GPS III SV01-02 and risk-reducing simulators through a structured systems engineering approach that matures and delivers space vehicles for launch. Space Modernization Initiatives (SMI) focuses on space vehicle affordability and capability addresses future requirements and resilience needs and expands the industrial base to enhance future competition. For example this includes the initial systems design work for incorporating space vehicle technology improvements on items such as second source atomic clocks smart solar cells that provide 30% more efficiency alternate transmitter assembly that provides increased power efficiency at a reduced recurring cost lithium ion batteries which address battery obsolescence issues and offer substantial weight savings and a dual space-ground link system (SGLS)/Unified S-Band (USB) communication channel to be compliant with the USB interface. RDT&E funds will also be used for GPS III SV09+ risk reduction towards obsolescence and affordability initiatives. GPS III SVs 03-08 are in the Production and Deployment Phase. The Air Force is seeking authorization to exercise the option for SV09-10 under the current contract as technical equivalents of GPS III SV01-08.  The Air Force is also assessing the business case for the future use of a multi-year procurement (MYP) strategy for GPS III.Additionally the program includes engineering studies and analyses trade studies system development test and evaluation efforts integrated logistics support products on-orbit support and mission operations supporting civil and military applications that protect U.S. military and allies' use of GPS.This program is a Budget Activity 7 - Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","1708.619","292","","",

TACP members deploy with Army maneuver units and provide a Command and Control (C2) link for Close Air Support (CAS) Joint Fires Support airlift and Air Force surveillance/reconnaissance missions.  TACPs are equipped with a variety of targeting and communications systems which interface with ground maneuver forces CAS aircraft joint fire assets C2 aircraft/agencies and Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms and agencies. TACPs detect targets coordinate with C2 authorities and pass precise targeting information to close air support aircraft and fires support units to ensure accurate and timely targeting in the employment of joint fires support.  The actions TACPs perform not only shorten the kill chain but also reduce the potential for fratricide and collateral damage in civilian-occupied areas.  TACPs also provide ground communications during federal emergency relief operations and homeland defense initiatives. TACPs support Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and have seen significantly increased mission effectiveness during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New Dawn.  The purpose of the TACP-M program is to provide net-centric data communications battlespace awareness and targeting capabilities to TACPs operating in operations centers vehicles and while conducting dismounted operations.   Data communications including streaming video reduce reliance on voice transmissions and enable machine-to-machine data exchange between TACPs and C2 nodes CAS aircraft Army units and other TACP units.  Reliable data communications support interoperability improve battlespace awareness (BA) increase targeting accuracy reduce kill chain decision time improve data flow/information exchange and reduce the potential for fratricide and collateral damage in civilian occupied areas. TACPs use software communication architecture (SCA)-certifiedJoint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) approved software-defined radios and ancillary components that provide reliable voice and data communications on UHF SATCOM UHF/VHF LOS SINCGARS and will soon on evolving networking waveforms such as Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS)   TACP-M is a buy-to-budget program with requirements based on ACC's evolving combat needs and the capabilities available in the commercial market.  As a result requirements are frequently adjusted to accommodate warfighter needs while working within available funding.  TACP-M is divided into three segments:  software mounted capabilities and dismounted capabilities. The mounted segment is further divided into stationary and mobile elements. The software segment provides the Close Air Support System (CASS) software with interfaces to all TACP-M components and joint interoperability with CAS aircraft (A-10 F-16 F/A-18 AV-8B etc) remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) artillery fire support systems network-enabled weapons and C2 nodes.  To enable data communications with those systems / nodes CASS incorporates several communications protocols including Variable Message Format (VMF) Link 16 Marine Tactical System (MTS) and U.S. Message Text Format (USMTF).   CASS versions 1.4.2 and 1.4.4 are currently fielded.  The contract for CASS v1.4.5 was awarded on 24 Oct 13 and will provide advanced communication and targeting capability on mobile computing devices for Dismounted TACPs as well as provide significant interoperability improvements in software used in vehicles and operations centers.  Future upgrades necessary to maintain interoperability with CAS aircraft joint fire support systems and emerging data networking waveforms will be guided by the TACP CASS Information System Initial Capabilities Document(IS ICD)which was approved by the Air Force Requirement Oversight Council (AFROC) Functional Capabilities Board (FCB) and Joint Capabilities Board (JCB) in 1st Qtr FY14.The dismounted segment consists of integrated non-developmental commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components carried by dismounted TACPs.  These include laser range finders thermal imagers laser designators  manpack and handheld radios ruggedized tactical computers streaming video receivers and other required equipment. The Mounted (Fixed) segment integrates computer and communications equipment into re-locatable vehicle rack or transit-case mounted systems for use in Tactical Operations Center (TOC) or Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) locations.  It includes the ASOC Gateway mounted in a High Mobility Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) shelter the Gateway Lite mounted in relocatable racks or transit cases and the Dismounted Communications Package (DCP) mounted in transit cases.The Mounted (Mobile) segment integrates radios computers and ancillary equipment into mobile tactical vehicles such as new TACP M1145 and M1165 Armored HMMWV variations the Army Stryker armored vehicle and future Army vehicles.  Following the termination of the Vehicular Communications System (VCS) in FY11 existing capability gaps in TACP vehicle-mounted communications systems have grown. The TACP-Modernization ICD approved by the JROC in Sep 2012 identified significant on-the-move tactical voice data and video capability gaps in TACP tactical vehicles.  A subsequent DOTMLPF Study verified that Mounted (Mobile) data communications requirements can be provided by modular non-developmental COTS components integrated into TACP vehicles.  Current TACP-M team efforts are focused on incrementally providing new mounted capabilities as funding and technology allow. In Mar 2011-Feb 2012 the TACP-M program fielded a Dismounted Communications Package which provided a robust and re-locatable transit-case mounted communications system for TACPs operating in TOC locations.  In Mar 2011-Jun 2013 the TACP-M program integrated and fielded the GRC-259 mission equipment package which provided improved on-the-move tactical communications and blue force tracking capabilities for the Army Stryker Light Armored Vehicles.  In August 2013 the TACP-M program fielded the Voice Communications Package (VCP) which provided TACPs / JTACs with limited 2-channel on-the-move voice-only communications capabilities for M1165 HMMWVs.  The next increment Mobile Communications System Increment 0 is planned to add data communications and video receiver capabilities to VCP-equipped M1165 HMMWVs.  This will be followed by a more robust capability that provide essential communications links to C2 and fire support systems on 4 or 5 channels using emerging / new Army and Joint Aerial Layer Networking waveforms to M1145 HMMWVs (MCS Inc 1).  Additional MCS increments will provide essential communications datalinks and targeting capabilities for mounted systems to include current and future TACP vehicles.In FY15 the TACP-M program is implementing a multi-award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract to aid in the competitive contracting of Mobile Communication System and other platform integration efforts.  The contract will also support studies and analysis risk reduction training and sustainment activities to support planning and execution of current and future program activities.This program is in Budget Activity 07 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","","","R2Long","",

The antennas are distributed around the globe at eight locations to ensure global coverage for 170 satellites in various orbits.  The AFSC conducts an average of 450 satellite contacts per day supporting Positioning Navigation and Timing (PNT); Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); Missile Warning; Communications; Weather; Launch Vehicle Support; Research and Development (R&D) in support of Department of Defense (DoD) Intelligence Community (IC) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operations.  While most of the 450 satellite contacts/day are routine command and control activities the AFSCN is also used for satellite emergencies (e.g. tumbling satellite) because its high power antennas are often the only earthbound assets that can contact a non-responsive satellite to re-establish command & control.  In FY13 alone the AFSCN supported 10 space vehicle emergencies resulting in the preservation of $6B worth of satellites.In addition to routine and emergency satellite operations C2 the AFSCN provides support to launch vehicle and early orbit operations ensuring worldwide antennas receive telemetry as the rocket travels through the atmosphere and and transmit commands to a newly orbiting satellite to initiate early orbit checkout.  Finally the AFSCN provides Compatibility Testing (FCT) to eusuresatellites and rockets can communicate via the AFSCN before the satellite is launched.These funds are used to develop next-generation tools to improve the AFSCN and ensure the capability is available to support DoD Intelligence and civil users through 2020.  MISSION PLANNING UPGRADE: the Air Force will complete the Electronic Scheduling and Dissemination (ESD) 3.0 program enabling worldwide antenna system scheduling to support all 170 satellites.  Satellite operators will be able to request contact time with their satellites via the shared AFSCN antennas and ESD 3.0 will de-conflict overlapping requests create a schedule and publish real-time to all users. FY15 funds support transition and operational turnover of ESD 3.0.SATELLITE ANOMALY RECOVERY AND SUPPORT UPGRADE: The Air Force will complete development testing of the enhanced High Power Amplifier (eHPA) first article.  The AFSCN is in jeopardy of losing the emergency high power satellite contact capability due to obsolete parts used in the legacy AFSCN system.  The eHPA program will develop a new high power amplifier that resolves the obsolescence issue well into the 2020's.UNIFIED S-BAND UPGRADE:  The Air Force is adjusting the AFSCN for spectrum-sharing with industry and preparing to migrate away from the current L-Band uplink/S-Band downlink spectrum to the Unified S-Band (USB) spectrum.  RDT&E funds support a first article integration of USB into the AFSCN to begin supporting users that are migrating to USB.  The first article will complete the development integration test and demonstration of USB on the AFSCN as a pathfinder for contemplated future AFSCN USB modifications.This effort is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because it supports a fielded system.","","","","R2Long","",

The F-15C continues to provide air superiority with an undefeated and unmatched aerial combat record. The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems such as advanced imaging and targeting systems to meet the requirement for all-weather deep penetration and night / under-the-weather air-to-surface attack. A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad upgrades to the F-15 (avionics armament airframe and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality survivability and supportability). Projected to remain in service past 2035 avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability. This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors). The proliferation of fourth generation enemy aircraft sophisticated "double-digit" anti-aircraft missile systems and other enemy systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability. The F-15 Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) will replace the F-15's functionally obsolete self-defense Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) to enhance weapon system situational awareness and survivability against enemy threats. F-15 EPAWSS will also improve reliability and sustainability.

It directly supports Air Force Joint Coalition composite training and rehearsal concept development and acquisition and testing through model and simulation development as well as the integration of these across and within Live Virtual and Constructive (LVC) environments.  This program focuses on support of Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2) acquisition excellence initiatives and foundational capabilities needed for interoperability accessibility reuse and scalability.  It allows the authoritative portrayal of new and emerging Air Force capabilities within DoD and coalition LVC environments; as well as reciprocating their capabilities within our Air Force LVC environments.  LVC environments today are used as the most cost effective and practical means to meet mission needs.  In support of the DoD T2 initiative USAF M&S program thrust areas develop and modernize models and simulations that are the constructive backbone of Air Force and joint training and rehearsal.  Once these models and simulations are developed they are integrated across training LVC environments for use by Major and Combatant Commands.  This development and integration is imperative to ensure that air space and cyberspace training and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic interoperable and readily available tools data and services.  These in turn enable joint coalition and interagency training required to prepare forces for combat by generating the air and space picture for the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) and Joint Force Commander in combat exercises; training over 50000 personnel per year in exercises (e.g. Ulchi Freedom Guardian Red & Blue Flags Unified Endeavor etc).  These programs also provide the current foundational environment that enables warfighters to interact with high-fidelity tactical cockpit simulators which replicate high demand/low density platforms that are often unavailable for training due to real-world operations; while simultaneously linking it to warfighters using their current command and control systems 1000 miles away and the constructive simulations being run from key operational wargaming and simulation centers worldwide. USAF M&S is integral to inter-agency Homeland Defense (HLD) exercises chartered to train combat units tasked to protect the Homeland including the National Capital Region (exercise Amalgam Arrow); this generates equipment and manpower efficiencies by using simulations which reduce fuel consumption aircraft wear and tear and manpower costs.  In support of the DoD drive to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its enterprise-wide acquisition business processes the USAF M&S Program Element develops and supports enhancements to models simulations tools and the LVC infrastructure to provide for system-of-systems M&S capabilities across the lifecycle reduce developmental costs and minimize risks. These capabilities support the acquisition process from concept development through test and evaluation.

The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.As a key component of naval expeditionary forces the Marine Corps has unique and technologically stressing requirements because of its expeditionary mission and intensive operational tempo Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) structure and conduct of maneuver warfare.  Critical requirements in this PE are: Command Control Communications Computers (C4); Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); maneuver techniques and means; force protection; logistic sustainment; human performance training and education; and firepower. There are ongoing actions to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies and concepts in operational environments. Joint service efforts are aligned with Defense Technology Objectives and Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives. In addition there is funding for experimentation in warfighting concepts as well as operational assessment of emerging technologies to include technical support of operating forces to assess military utility of selected technologies. This PE specifically supports: continued development of enhanced warfighting capabilities through field experiments with Marine operating forces; rapid response to low- mid- and high-intensity conflicts in the Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO); methods for countering irregular threats; and expansion of seabasing and naval force packaging capabilities. The investment directly assists in fulfilling the forward presence requirements of Sea Shield and the transformational capabilities prescribed by Sea Strike. The Future Naval Capability (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly. This PE is largely focused on demonstration of products and capabilities from the knowledge base and Discovery and Invention (D&I) phases of Naval S&T. As Naval partners the Navy and Marine Corps S&T Team strive to transition technologies that will implement objectives outlined in the Naval Operations Concept. This PE also funds technical solutions designed to increase Naval force capability such as the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command. Investments in S&T provide the opportunities for future capabilities and will prevent technological surprise. The PE as a whole will advance the amphibious and expeditionary capabilities for the Combatant Commanders helping to meet their emerging challenges by enhancing Naval S&T contributions to the long commitment to the OCO. The Marine Corps Service Campaign Plan (MCSCP) is the lens through which USMC S&T priorities are acted upon in order to support the future development of the Total Force.Due to the number of efforts in this PE the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.","","0.000","","","",

Within this vision Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) remains a Navy core competency in a dynamic and uncertain maritime environment.  U.S. adversaries continue to develop asymmetric capabilities and capacities to deter disrupt or delay the entry of U.S. and allied naval forces and pose a constant challenge as we implement the Maritime Strategy.  Evolving submarine technologies offer enhanced stealth speed endurance weapons and operational proficiency trends foretelling that the adversary submarine of the future will have a significantly larger sphere of influence while presenting less vulnerability to ASW forces.  The effective offensive engagement range of the adversary submarine of the future will continue to match or outrange individual U.S. and multinational platform sensors and weapons in many tactical environments.  Submarines are an increasing threat to all Naval and Allied ships particularly modern diesel subs and faster torpedoes.  Not only can the presence of potential hostile submarines delay naval combatant action until they are located and neutralized submarines can also disrupt all seaborne logistics supply for any ground campaign as well as maritime commerce.  ASW forces must be effective in all operating environments ranging from the deep open ocean to the littorals and are key to countering adversarial anti-access and area denial strategies.The objective of this Program Element (PE) is to significantly improve existing Surface Ship Undersea Warfare (USW) sonar system capabilities through quick and affordable development/integration of emergent transformational technologies in support of Littoral ASW Theater ASW Mine Reconnaissance and overall Sea Shield efforts required to pace the threat.  Detection and classification play uniquely vital roles in the success of any ASW campaign.  To be effective against increasingly stealthy threats in an often ambiguous undersea environment future sensors must be environmentally adaptive have very low false alarm rates and exploit the full range of current and future submarine detection vulnerabilities.Project 1916's primary mission is to improve AN/SQQ-89(V) Measures Of Performance (MOP) by enhancing detection tracking classification passive active torpedo Detection Classification and Localization (DCL) and sonobuoy data processing and display capabilities and increasing acoustic sensor frequency bandwidth (Operational Requirements Document #667-76-05 titled 'AN/SQQ-89 Improvement Program' Test and Evaluation Master Plan 802-2 (TEMP 802-2)). Improvements to system simulation stimulation Information Assurance (IA) software and network architectures and safety are included.  This project takes advantage of the AN/SQQ-89(V) Open System Architecture (OSA) and Acoustic Rapid Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Insertion (ARCI) initiatives to integrate a torpedo DCL and ASW sonar combat system capability improvements.  This COTS-based Surface Ship ASW combat system the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 is currently planned as a backfit program for both CG47 (select CG59-73 Baseline 3 and 4 ships) and DDG51 (All DDG and follow FLT I/II/IIA) class ships.  The Open Architecture (OA) (level 3 compliant) of the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 system drives the Advanced Capability Build (ACB) spiral development process and provides budget flexibility to make COTS/OA technology solutions and ARCI-type initiatives affordable.  This will be accomplished via the incorporation of select Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and emergent transformational ASW technologies delivered to the AN/SQQ-89(V) prime integrator every two years.  ASW technology implementation will take advantage of improvements developed under the submarine Advanced Processing Build (APB) program and will in turn share unique improvements developed under this program with the submarine and surveillance ASW communities.  This project will also contribute to the development of Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) ASW Mission Packages.Project 1916 also includes funding for the Surface Ship Enhanced Measurement Program (SSEMP) which will measure the performance of existing and new Surface Ship ASW combat systems and enables data-based assessment of the capabilities and shortfalls in the performance of these systems in realistic scenarios.","","135.262","","","",

Project 0766 provides for Integrated Undersea Surveillance Systems (IUSS) Research and Development Projects under the Maritime Surveillance Systems (MSS) Program Office (PEO SUB PMS 485).  IUSS provides the Navy with its primary means of submarine detection both nuclear and diesel.  A portion of project 0766 (FSS) is classified with details available at a higher classification level. Project 0344 funds the Shallow Water Surveillance System (SWSS) project to develop and demonstrate the technology to enable autonomous installation of a passive acoustic array with processing and communications gear. The IUSS Research and Development project (0766) funds SURTASS Passive and SURTASS Low Frequency Active (LFA) developments.  SURTASS provides the mobile tactical arm of the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System providing long range detection and cueing for tactical weapons platforms against both diesel and nuclear powered submarines.  SURTASS LFA provides an active adjunct capability for IUSS passive and tactical sensors to assist in countering the quieter diesel and nuclear threats of the 1990s and beyond.  The LFA tasks are directed at detection of slow quiet threats in harsh littoral waters.In order to continue with reductions in life cycle costs and continue with system-wide consolidation a short-term goal is to develop a common IUSS processor based on NAVSEA's Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (ARCI) program with a cyclical tech refresh of hardware and software in conjunction with the submarine Advanced Processor Build (APB) process.  The IUSS Integrated Common Processor (ICP) has the capability to process and display data from all fixed and mobile underwater systems.  The IUSS ICP will be used for all new system installations and replace the legacy systems as they reach end of life and require upgrading.  Additionally SURTASS has consolidated on the TB-29A Twin-line array a variant of the Submarine TB-29A Long line array.  This reduced the number of array variants employed by SURTASS from 3 to 1 and enabled development and logistics cost savings by leveraging off the submarine TB-29A program.The Shallow Water Surveillance System (SWSS) project (0344) funds the development and demonstration of the Increment 1B system with technology to enable autonomous classification and reporting of specific submarine targets of interest.","","302.818","","","",

The Material Development Decision (MDD) was approved on July 30th 2013. Positioning Navigation and Timing (PNT) is a critical enabler of many Army systems. The current capability Global Positioning System (GPS) is a fixed frequency system which is vulnerable to current and emerging threats and field conditions which means that PNT access and integrity to the Warfighter cannot be guaranteed. This situation degrades mission performance to an unacceptable level. Therefore current Army systems cannot operate at the required PNT Assurance Levels with GPS alone.  Assured PNT consists of a set of mutually dependent products that provide a cumulative effect to enable the Assured PNT capability. The Assured PNT program focuses on platform distribution of PNT scalable PNT architectures that pace the threat and the ability to upgrade to future technologies including Military Code (M-Code) at a much lower cost than the current architecture of GPS user equipment (UE). M-code was designed to further improve the anti-jamming and secure access of the military GPS signals.Assured PNT is a family of solutions which includes four subprograms: (1) The Pseudolites subprogram provides PNT Assurance in GPS denied environments by providing terrestrial radio navigation (GPS-like) service in electronically or physically challenged environments using a higher power signal. The Pseudolites subprogram enables continued operations of PNT-enabled systems such as Blue Force Tracker Communications Networks and Precision Guided Munitions; (2) The Mounted PNT subprogram is the integration of multiple sensors and provides PNT platform distribution. The Mounted PNT subprogram incorporates a System of Systems architecture that acquires protects and distributes secure PNT on stationary and vehicular platforms. The mounted materiel solution is a modular scalable form-factor that paces the threats and enables PNT on the Vehicle Integration for Command Control Communications Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance/Electronic Warfare (C4ISR/EW) Interoperability also known as VICTORY and Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) Architecture; (3) The Dismounted PNT subprogram is the integration of multiple sensors for platform distribution of PNT on the Soldier. The Dismounted PNT subprogram incorporates a System of Systems architecture that acquires protects and distributes secure PNT wirelessly on the soldier; (4) The Anti-Jam subprogram provides GPS signal protection and PNT Assurance in challenged environments through anti-jam technologies. Anti-jam enables tactical capabilities through assured signal acquisition in challenged environments. FY 2015 Base funds in the amount of $9.930 million are provided as a new start for the Assured PNT Program to initiate the development of PNT system solutions for combating electronically and physically challenged electromagnetic environments.","","","","","",

The FAAD C2 system provides alerting data to air defense gunners airspace battle management and up-linking of mission operations.  Situational awareness and targeting data is provided on threat aircraft cruise missiles and unmanned aerial systems (UAS).  FAAD C2 software is a key component of the Air Defense and Airspace Management (ADAM) Cell that is being fielded to Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) Multi-Functional Support Brigades and Division Headquarters as part of the Army's modularity concept.  FAAD C2 is also a principal air defense system within the Homeland Defense Program. Soldiers from activated Army National Guard AMD battalions operate the FAAD C2 systems in the National Capital Region and other locations.The Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control System (AMDPCS) is an Army Objective Force System that provides integration of AMD operations at all echelons. AMDPCS systems are deployed with Air Defense Artillery (ADA) brigades Army Air and Missile Defense Commands (AAMDCs) and ADAM Cells at the Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) Multi Functional Support Brigades and Divisions/Corps. AMDPCS systems also provide air defense capabilities to Homeland Defense systems. The fielding of ADAM Cells is essential in fulfilling the Army's Modularity requirement.  ADAM Cells provide the Commander at BCTs Brigades and Divisions with air defense situational awareness and airspace management capabilities. They also provide the interoperability link with Joint multinational and coalition forces.  AMDPCS components are vital in the transformation of ADA units and the activation of the AMD Battalions and AMD Composite Battalions. AMDPCS has three major components: (1) Air and Missile Defense Workstation (AMDWS) is an automated defense and staff planning tool that displays the common tactical and operational 3-dimentional air picture; (2) Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI) is a communications data link processor and display system that provides near-real time 3-dimensional joint airspace situational awareness and fire direction command and control for AMD forces; (3) Army Air Defense shelter configurations use automated data processing equipment tactical communications Common Hardware Systems standard vehicles and tactical power to provide AMD unit commanders and staffs with the capabilities to plan missions direct forces and control the airspace. Counter-Rocket Artillery Mortar (C-RAM) is an evolutionary non-developmental program initiated by the Army Chief of Staff in response to the indirect fire (IDF) threat and a validated Operational Needs Statement (ONS).

SIIRCM is an integrated warning and countermeasure system to enhance aircraft survivability against IR-guided threat missile systems. The Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) is a core element of the SIIRCM concept. CMWS is an integrated ultraviolet (UV) missile warning system with an Improved Countermeasure Dispenser (ICMD) serving as a subsystem to a host aircraft. The CMWS program is a UV missile warning system that cues both flare and laser-based countermeasures to defeat incoming IR-seeking missiles and will alert aircrews to the presence of certain incoming unguided munitions. The B-Kit consists of the components which perform the missile detection and aircrew notification unguided munitions detection and aircrew notification false alarm rejection and countermeasure employment/cueing functions of the system. The CMWS Electronic Control Unit (ECU) receives UV missile detection data from Electro-Optic Missile Sensors (EOMS) and sends a missile alert signal to warn aircrews via on-board avionics. Tier 1 threat missiles detected and tracked by the CMWS are subsequently defeated by a combination of missile seeker countermeasures including decoy flares and IR Laser Jamming (currently ATIRCM-equipped CH-47 platform only). In addition the CMWS ECU receives from the EOMS unguided munitions detection data which it also passes to the aircrew through aural and visual alerts. The aircrew then applies the appropriate Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to break contact or engage the enemy with own-ship ordnance. The CMWS Generation 3 (Gen 3) ECU in conjunction with ongoing software development efforts will address outstanding material release conditions to achieve a Full Material Release (FMR) for CMWS and ensure protection against emerging IR-guided missile threats. The A-Kit for CMWS includes mounting hardware wiring harnesses cables and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft. The A-Kit ensures the mission kit is functionally and physically operational with a specific host aircraft type.EE3:The objective of the Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Development project is to improve Radio Frequency (RF) ASE for Army aviation. The APR-39 Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) detects categorizes and prioritizes Radio Frequency (RF) emitters and provides a visual / aural alert to aircrew members warning them of targeting by RF-guided weapons. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved Phases 1 and 2 of a 3-phased path forward. Phase 1 serves as an obsolescence / sustainment upgrade to the Processor Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) of the AN/APR-39A(V) Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) implemented to ensure that the currently fielded system remains viable until affordable improved RF ASE capability can be pursued in Phases 2 and 3. Phase 2 RWR Modernization adopts the ongoing United States Navy Class I RWR Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) commonly referred to as the APR-39D(V)2 system. APR-39D(V)2 will significantly improve the near-spherical RF threat coverage automatic detection and identification of threat types bearing and lethality. Under Phase 2 the Army will develop enhancements to the APR-39D(V)2 including integrated suite control functionality threat correlation and off-boarding capability and hardware modifications required to maintain planned integrated jamming growth capability. Phase 3 adds active Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) jamming capability for selected aircraft; Materiel Development Decision (MDD) for this ECM jamming capability phase is not expected until later in the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).EB4:The Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) is an infrared (IR) countermeasure system that interfaces with a Missile Warning System (MWS) to provide near spherical coverage of the host platform in order to defeat IR threat missiles. The CIRCM will provide the sole acquisition of future laser-based IR countermeasure systems for all rotary-wing tilt-rotor and small fixed-wing aircraft across the Department of Defense. The US Army's concept of CIRCM is part of the Suite of Integrated Infrared Countermeasures (SIIRCM). The core components of the SIIRCM concept are: a Missile Warning System (MWS) IR expendables countermeasures (flares) and a laser-based IRCM.

Its function is to support test and evaluation of major Army and DoD acquisition programs and to provide space operations (surveillance and object identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and space programs.  Programs supported include Army missile defense Air Force and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army Air Force and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonic developmental tests; Missile Defense Agency (MDA) demonstration/validation tests;  USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (inc contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and NASA Space Shuttle and orbital debris experiments.  USAKA/RTS is a government-managed/contractor-operated (GMCO) site and is dependent upon its associated support contractors for operations and maintenance (O&M).  Program funds contractors to accomplish O&M for both the RTS instrumentation suite and installation/base operations and provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optics cable system.  Funding is required to maintain O&M support while accepting moderate risk of continued degradation of USAKA/RTS infrastructure (housing offices and facilities) higher future repair costs and reduced logistical support capability.  The instrumentation suite consists of a number of sophisticated one-of-a-kind radar optical telemetry command/control/communications safety and data reduction systems.  These systems include the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site (KREMS); Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker (SRADOT) long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by nine antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis/reduction hardware/software.  The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar (ALTAIR) and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment (TRADEX) radars located at USAKA/RTS are two of only three radars world-wide that have deep-space tracking capability.  The Millimeter Wave Radar (MMW) is the most powerful imaging radar in the world.  Funding enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army Air Force Navy and MDA which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at USAKA/RTS.  This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of USAKA/RTS.

Products result from investigating analyzing assessing and reporting on the survivability of Soldiers and on the survivability lethality and vulnerability (SLV) of the highest priority Army systems whether those systems are employed during stability support defensive or offensive missions.  Developed through measurement experiment test support and modeling and simulation (M&S) the products funded by this project are used in many ways to make the Army force more survivable.  The project provides quantitative lethality and survivability analyses and data for fielded and developmental systems as the Army makes the required choices to decisively transform into a modular Brigade Combat Team (BCT) based organization.  Products concern Army fire support systems direct fire munitions; Army air defense and missile defense systems; Army aviation systems including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; network communications and other network enabled battle command and communication systems; and selected joint services systems particularly relevant to the Army's joint and expeditionary role.  Products also include analysis and data concerning individual Soldier items including protective equipment such as helmets and vests.  These survivability products are leveraged into rapid-equipping initiatives and other technical support for operational forces involved in the current fight.  Continued development of these products also guarantees preservation of the Army's vitally needed technical corporate memory for expert survivability advice.Survivability analyses funded by this project are conducted across the spectrum of battlefield threats to include guns missiles mines and other methods of inflicting physical damage; jammers countermeasures and other electronic warfare techniques; cybersecurity and computer network operations; and directed energy weapons.  This survivability information enables developers users and decision makers to perform credible survivability tradeoffs for both Soldiers and materiel.  These technical survivability details enable properly informed decisions concerning systems and tactics that maximize both the combat power and survivability of Army forces.  Survivability data and analysis results funded by this project are efficiently leveraged for many different Army uses reducing total cost to the Army by eliminating the need for duplicative capabilities funded by individual system developers.  Central funding of this mission assures the Army accurate and consistent treatment of survivability across all classes of systems across all formal system Evaluations and across the Army's AR 5-5 studies process.  Work program is prioritized principally by the ATEC/AEC and is used by them in the Army's formal Evaluation process in such a way that ATEC can comply with its legally mandated responsibility to assess system survivability along with effectiveness and suitability.  Program Managers (PM) and the Program Executive Officers (PEO) use the survivability analyses and data funded by this project to make design decisions that are optimized for survivability to direct specific weapon system development efforts that are needed for survivability enhancement and to structure product improvement programs. Soldier survivability data and analysis is leveraged to support the survivability portion of the HQDA G1 MANPRINT program.  TRADOC combat developers exploit the survivability products funded by this project to initiate and improve survivability/lethality requirements and to develop and refine doctrine and tactics.  Also the quantitative analytical results funded by the project are leveraged as core inputs to formal AR 5-5 studies and other studies as directed by Army leaders.  While the Army is at war analytical results funded by this project are also directly leveraged for survivability support to current operations.  Finally for particularly urgent or controversial survivability issues data and analysis funded by this project are used directly by senior Army decision makers to assure technically sound program/production decisions.    This project also supports cybersecurity survivability analysis of Army battle command/networked systems as well as Army network architectures and technology.  Supports ATEC and other electronic warfare vulnerability testers and evaluators by developing and providing highly technical specialized field countermeasure environments that threat forces may employ against Army communications networks air defense and other systems.  In conjunction with PMs and Army intelligence agencies analyzes technical vulnerabilities of foreign weapons network related systems and intelligence Electronic Warfare (EW) systems to U.S. Army EW systems.  Without the survivability products funded by this project ATEC would not have a technically credible account of survivability issues at milestone decision points and systems could be fielded with unknown vulnerabilities leading to unnecessary US casualties.  PMs would make design choices that failed to properly optimize survivability TRADOC would generate requirements that were not technically credible and the Army studies process would rest on an inaccurate and inconsistent basis.","FY15 reduction attributed to realignment to other higher priority Army programs.","","","","",

The Information Assurance and Survivability project is developing the technology required to make emerging information system capabilities (such as wireless and mobile code/mobile systems) inherently secure and to protect DoD's mission-critical systems against attack upon or through the supporting information infrastructure.  These technologies will enable our critical systems to provide continuous correct operation even when they are attacked and will lead to generations of stronger protection higher performance and more cost-effective security and survivability solutions scalable to several thousand sites.       The Language Technology project will develop and test powerful new Human Language Technology that will provide critical capabilities for a wide range of national security needs.  This technology will enable systems to a) automatically translate and exploit large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a variety of means; b) to have two-way (foreign-language-to-English and English-to-foreign-language) translation; c) enable automated transcription and translation of foreign speech and text along with content summarization; and d) enable exploitation of captured foreign language hard-copy documents.     The Cyber Technology project supports long term national security requirements through the development and demonstration of technology to increase the security of military information systems.  This involves networking people platforms weapons sensors and decision aids to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.  The results are networked forces that operate with increased speed and synchronization and are capable of achieving massed effects without the physical massing of forces as required in the past.","","","","","",

Systemic software issues are significant contributors to poor program execution and reliance on software-intensive mobile and net based products and systems has been increasing (e.g. Joint Tactical Radio System DDG-1000 Joint Strike Fighter F-22 and Army Modernization).  As stated in the 2010 National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences report entitled Critical Code “It is dangerous to conclude that we are reaching a plateau in capability and technology for software producibility.”  The report notes that software is “…unconstrained by traditional physical engineering limitations…” and what we can accomplish is derived “…from [the] human intellectual capacity to conceptualize and understand systems….”  With growing global parity in software engineering the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Program Element (PE) addresses the critical need to research develop and rapidly transition state-of-the-art software technology tools development environments and best practices to improve the engineering management fielding evolution acquisition and sustainment of software-intensive DoD systems.  The SEI PE’s program of work seeks to coordinate across the Department and the Services and leverages expertise in industry and academia to enable the development of joint capabilities.Software is more pervasive than ever and computer programs are growing in size and complexity.  Designing managing and securing integrated complex and large-scale mission-critical systems are abilities that the DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) have not yet mastered.  To address this the P781 project within this PE funds research and development within the SEI Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) and to access particular expertise in the Services industry and academia.The SEI FFRDC is the DoD’s dedicated source for software research and development.  It is an institute which enables the exploitation of emerging software technology by bringing engineering management and security discipline to software acquisition development and evolution.  The SEI FFRDC focuses on software technology areas judged to be of the highest payoff in meeting defense needs.  To ensure that the DoD retains a differential advantage over potential adversaries funding at the SEI FFRDC will include a new Budget Activity 2 funding line beginning in FY 2014.  The reduction in P781 in this line beginning in FY 2014 is offset by the creation of the new line the SEI Applied Research PE.  The creation of this new line represents a pivot toward more fundamental research that will enable the DoD to address longer-term challenges in software technology and engineering.  The SEI Applied Research PE will also increase the collaboration opportunities for the SEI FFRDC with academia and attract top research talent to the SEI.  Private sector investment has created rapid advances in information technologies but the pace of transition to DoD applications is often very slow or the commercial applications do not meet DoD unique needs e.g. high assurance software or large-scale integrated systems.  The DoD needs to create opportunities to discover emerging technologies to evaluate their potential to fit DoD needs and where appropriate conduct critical tests of the technologies under DoD conditions.  The P783 project within this PE funds the Software Producibility Initiative.  The Software Producibility Initiative works across the Services industry and academia to research and transition software science and tools that address the capacity to design produce assure and evolve software-intensive systems in a predictable manner while effectively managing risk cost schedule quality and complexity.","","","","","",

Additionally RRTO works to leverage technology developed outside of the DoD in the commercial sector academia international arenas and small non-traditional businesses to address specific DoD needs areas as identified by Combatant Commanders Military Service organizations other Defense agencies and interagency organizations.  Typical RRF programs are 6-18 months in duration and aim to mature a capability to demonstration.  The RRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 40 percent for demonstration programs (DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D).      The Architecture and Integration (RAI) program objectives are to enhance and expand rapid technology architecture and assessment capabilities in general; and to enhance the Joint Experimentation Range Complex (JERC) Stiletto maritime test platform and the Thunderstorm Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) exercise series.  The JERC provides a venue to evaluate a wide range of new technologies in a dessert environment.  RAI funding also supports Stiletto a maritime test vessel that routinely hosts numerous new technologies for evaluation in a maritime environment.  Thunderstorm an ongoing ISR exercise series is also supported by this budget line.  Thunderstorm brings emerging ISR technologies together in a common architecture for exercise and operational demonstration.  Due to the draw down in Afghanistan in FY 2014 projects in RAI are either being concluded or aligned to other QRSP programs   The Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) Program objectives focus on responding to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) that have been submitted by Combatant Commanders and validated by the Joint Staff.  In addition the JRAC’s objectives are to manage the delivery of capabilities as requested by the Combatant Command (COCOM) in a time frame acceptable to the COCOM.  Efforts in most instances are conducted outside of the processes described in the Defense Acquisition System in DoD Directive 5000.1 and utilize contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.The Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) cell program objective is to support all COCOMs Joint Force Commanders and other government agencies by assessing complex operational/technical challenges which require multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the United States Government academia and the private sector the SMA cell develops solution options to COCOM generated challenging problems and informs the command’s senior leadership.  Each SMA cell effort is initiated at the request of COCOM senior leadership.  Priorities for SMA Cell programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy for Operations.  Products are typically produced within six months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the COCOM’s senior leaders.","The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP) Program Element is being recast with a focus on producing risk-reducing prototypes designed to address Combatant Command (COCOM) threats.  QRSP efforts will support the Department goal to provide a Hedge Against Technical Uncertainty by leveraging insights gained through mission-focused efforts and by fostering collaboration among government laboratories academia and commercial research.  The QRSP portfolio will develop technology that anticipates adversaries’ capabilities through short-term innovative science and engineering initiatives.","63.029","","","",

The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective thus maximizing efficiencies ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating establishing and maintaining 2018 and 2023 year technology development plans and roadmaps 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEOs for insertion in their Insensitive Munitions (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) laboratory representatives and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight policy direction and priorities during its annual meeting.The Insensitive Munitions (IM) effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with requirements established in United States Code Title 10 Chapter 141 Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion (HPP) 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion (MSP) 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads (BFW) 4) Anti-Armor Warheads (AAW) and 5) Gun Propulsion (GP).  MATGs under tri-service leadership have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies alone or in combination will be developed and tested at the small-scale and for eventual incorporation in hardware simulating real-world munitions to demonstrate their utility and feasibility. The Enabling Fuze Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force (GDF) the Secretary of Defense Memorandum DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will develop fuzing technologies and mature them for transition into advanced technology (6.3) programs and/or design tools and protocols for weapon fuzing.  In this way the Service and Industrial base weapon and fuze will be able to heavily leverage and apply these emerging and promising technologies in fuzing modeling and simulation tools multi-point initiation high reliability fuze architectures survivable components modular fuze packaging and fuze sensor. The Joint Fuze Technology Program investments focus on four specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and will be validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&T) communities.  These capability areas are:  1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing 3) High Reliability Fuzing and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.","","20.298","","","",

These range from improvised devices constructed from commercially available electronic and industrial components to dedicated military devices that could be used in ways that diminish our technological advantage in conflicts with nation-states.  The surprisingly fast appearance of these threats is accelerating and is now happening quicker than the requirements and acquisition process can respond.The use of asymmetric devices is well understood by terrorists and nation-states alike.  Using man portable air defense systems mortars and improvised explosive devices actuated by electronic components terrorists have attacked both air and ground forces and pose a threat in any region due to their portability.  Unmanned aircraft systems also strongly enabled by electronic components are proliferating and pose a threat both as military capability and as potential terrorist weapons delivery mechanism.  Technological surprise and speed of appearance are two asymmetries that highlight the need to rapidly develop and field Electronic Warfare Information Operations and Asymmetric Warfare capabilities capable of neutralizing such threats in ways that are both fiscally and temporally responsive.  This program element investigates means to rapidly mitigate asymmetric threats by integrating advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in innovative ways and rapidly demonstrating new technological capabilities to augment and/or reduce risk when inserted into service programs of record.  Efforts will also look for methods to employ asymmetric principles against our adversaries.Beginning in FY 2014 the Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) project reorganized to be in better alignment with Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering electronic warfare research priorities.  Particularly JEAT established three pillars that will support the JEAT approach to innovation:  1) experimentation/demonstration 2) advanced technology development/verification and 3) innovative technology exploration.  The overarching JEAT philosophy is to be adaptive and to help lead the pace of rapid electronic systems development and the evolving threat picture.","","","","","",

DCMA’s contract management mission provides contract administration services (CAS) to our military services worldwide and contingency contract support in theater.  DCMA provides CAS on more than 324000 prime contracts being performed at more than 18500 contractor locations.  The face value of these agency-managed contracts exceeds $1963 billion and the agency manages more than one million financial transactions annually to authorize disbursement of approximately $155 billion.  DCMA performs its mission through the employment of Information Technology Systems  most of which allow internal DCMA and external DCMA users to collect aggregate and analyze DoD contract information.  Without investment in these systems DCMA would not be able to effectively administer and report on the health on the contracts and contractor’s performing the work.DCMA’s strategic vision is to be DoD's leading experts in Quality Assurance; Cost Schedule and Supply Chain Predictability; and Contract Administration; enabling our military service and DoD Agency partners to achieve contract objectives.  Their ability to achieve contract objectives in a timely and effective manner in part hinges on DCMA’s ongoing efforts to continualy enhance and modernize its Information Technology portfolio in order to research develop and  implement either more efficient solutions or solutions that will provide our contract partners the ability to realize business process efficiencies.  With minimal investment in DCMA toolsets the Department has and can continue to realize efficiencies not just with DCMA but tremendous efficiensies through effective standardized contract management.  DCMA is continuously executing a strategy to modernize and consolidate all web-based applications in concert with a new Enterprise Architecture framework that adheres strictly to the Business Enterprise Architecure (BEA). Investment in newer modern technologies that utilize business process driven frameworks will greatly improve not only the quality of the DCMA contract information but allow DCMA to realize internal process efficiencies. The web-based capabilities support DCMA's unique mission and provide cross functional capabilities that support the full range of acquisition and contract management. The capabilities help DCMA acquisition workforce access real time data; thus enabling them to make sound contract management and business decisions. The objective behind the web-based capabilities is to provide mission-effective and efficient solutions to unique sets of problems that slow down or hinder performance based contract management for DCMA and other DoD support components. FY 2013 Actual:  In FY 2013($11.574) DCMA enabled real time dashboard reporting and alerts for critical mission financial and business support areas; streamlined Contract Administration processes and interfaces improving data exchange across the DoD Acquisition Enterprise; improved resource allocation through workload visualization resource compliance skill set identification and technology requirements; and helped to increase DoD’s buying power through Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) visibility of contractor business systems indirect expense rates and other negotiation information.FY 2014-2015 Plan:  In FY 2014 ($13.812) and FY 2015 ($12.530) DCMA’s primary focus is centered on the reengineering of DCMA’s Contract Administration and Line of Service business processes and the toolsets that provide the needed capabilities.  Our goal is to streamline business processes and consolidate toolsets that enable those capabilities to reduce operations and sustainment costs for the Department and where applicable for DCMA.  In order to accomplish this goal DCMA will need to invest in the research purchase and development of the new capabilities.","","108.385","","","",

The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) uniquely accomplishes this mission for the Department by providing both a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics parts that are no longer available from or bid by commercial sources but are essential to combat operations. This is a critical capability in an atmosphere of increasing worldwide supply chain risks with threats to defense microelectronics. The threats include risks such as counterfeiting Trojan horses unreliability and rapid obsolescence coming from an unpredictable and unsecure supply chain. As fiscal pressures force the Department to maintain its weapon systems longer than originally planned and their extended combat use increases attrition the need for DMEA’s unique capabilities increases.Microelectronics is a crucial technology and central for all operations within the Department. Yet as vital as this technology is to Department operations the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market. The Department frequently requires legacy microelectronics long after commercial foundries have moved on to advanced technology levels. As such the semiconductor industry does not respond to the Department’s unique needs of ultra-low volumes long availability time frames or its high-level security concerns. In these cases DMEA procures a license to produce technologies in-house that are no longer commercially manufactured or are unavailable due to no-bids owing to low volume requirements. These licenses enable DMEA to be the Department’s microelectronics supplier of last resort providing the Department with a long-term trusted and assured source.DMEA provides increasingly rare microelectronics design and fabrication skills to ensure that the Department is provided with systems capable of ensuring technological superiority over potential adversaries. DMEA provides decisive quick turn solutions for defense intelligence special operations cyber and combat missions as well as microelectronic components that are unobtainable in the commercial market. DMEA’s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions—along with its unique technical perspective—allows it to develop manage and implement novel microelectronic solutions to enhance mission capability. DMEA can then use these cutting-edge technology capabilities and products in the solutions it develops for its military clientele. After many years of performing analogous efforts the technical experience mission knowledge and practical judgment that are gained from preceding efforts are often incorporated into subsequent technology maturation projects. DMEA’s capabilities make it a key tool in the intelligent and rapid development and application of advanced technologies to identified military needs.Working alongside industry DMEA has created a model partnership that provides this capability for the Department. DMEA’s unique flexible foundry supports the Department with a wide variety of integrated circuits using various processes that were developed by commercial manufacturers and which are now assured to remain in one location for as long as they are needed. To obtain these processes DMEA works closely with U.S. semiconductor industry partners to acquire process licenses. These Government-held licenses allow for the transfer to DMEA of industry-developed intellectual property (IP) and the related processes for Department needs. These licenses ensure no commercial conflicts by including industry’s right to bid first on resulting production volumes. DMEA always looks to industry first to see if it can provide the required components. If not only then does DMEA provide the necessary prototypes and low volume production. A critical element required to make this business model work effectively is protection of the industry partners’ valuable IP and processes. DMEA is Government owned and operated providing the structure and confidence that an industry partner’s IP is protected from potential competitors. This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring installing and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems combat operations and support needs. As such DMEA serves the Department other US Agencies industry and Allied nations.DMEA assists hundreds of programs every year. DMEA has provided its unique engineering assistance and capabilities to older systems current systems and even to programs not yet in the production phase. This includes the F-18 Super Hornet F-22 Raptor F-35 RQ-4 Global Hawk MQ-9 Reaper AEGIS Advanced Surface Missile System Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) among many other programs. DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Ops Cyber Intelligence and the Radiation-Hard communities.","","86.881","","","",

In partnership with the CCMDs and Services JCD&E mitigates operational risk by establishing procedural models to conduct emergent concepts that are not yet instantiated in conventional force generation.  The results are briefed to Functional Capability Boards (FCB) who integrate solutions into their functional investment plans.Based on leadership guidance JS J7 shed themselves of the experimentation functions originally outlined in the Joint Experimentation R2.  While JS J7 divested this piece the other portions such as concept development and wargaming were retained. The shift in focus aligns more closely with those functions under BA6 RDT&E Management Support.  As a result this line was zeroed and the remaining requirement was realigned to PE 0204571J Joint Staff Analytical Support.","","0.000","","R2Long","",

The SSDP is a Joint Department of Defense (DoD) and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) organization established to function as the center of excellence for options and strategies (materiel non-materiel cross-Title cross-domain) leading to a more resilient and enduring National Security Space (NSS) Enterprise.  Formerly known as the Space Protection Program (SPP) the SSDP was chartered by the DoD and ODNI to expand the existing authorities and roles/responsibilities of the SPP; effectively integrating and unifying space protection efforts on a National level to better meet the evolving threat to our NSS systems and capabilities.  The SSDP Operates under the authority of the Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF) and Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence (PDDNI) to lead and collaborate on space protection vulnerability susceptibility and mitigation assessments of NSS services for the purpose of identifying and introducing protection recommendations into existing requirements budgeting acquisition and operational development processes.  This unique mission provides an ongoing and crucial core protection competency that advances specific projects/activities (including cyber) to deliver comprehensive economical and actionable solutions for both programmatic and operational domains.  The SSDP scope spans multiple space missions and stakeholders including the DoD Intelligence Community (IC) civil commercial and international space entities that support NSS missions in both peacetime and throughout all phases of conflict.  The program works within existing processes spanning requirements budgeting acquisition and operational development to carry-out its protection mission.  It is focused on being responsive to NSS stakeholders in providing technical and operational assessments of emergent threat concepts and developing near- and far-term plans to address strategies threats and vulnerabilities.  In the context of its projects and activities the SSDP employs a cooperative objective and enterprise-level approach to implement the capabilities plans and options to deter defend against and if necessary defeat efforts to interfere with or attack U.S. or allied space systems in an increasingly constrained and hostile environment.  SSDP projects/activities center on identifying solutions to current space protection needs with a common sense approach to balancing near-term results with long-term acquisition architecture and strategic objectives.  Given the ever-changing elements of the space protection landscape the SSDP is designed to remain flexible and responsive to fluctuating NSS priorities and objectives.  Protection projects/activities in one year are typically dependent upon or advised by the results/findings or progress made on tasks in the preceding FY and must remain responsive to annual DEPSECDEF and PDDNI - approved SSDP Work Plans that take such variability into consideration.  As such SSDP FY15 projects/activities will be structured to address the priorities and objectives of the SSDP Work Plan and meet the National space survivability and protection needs as directed by the DEPSECDEF and the PDDNI.  In order to ensure resiliency in a contested space environment FY15 efforts will leverage available resources to support NSS survivability requirements and address protection issues options and strategies in the priority articulated in the annual SSDP Work Plan.  SSDP will translate resilience protection endurance and survivability into protection strategy/policy and threat mitigation projects and/or activities in specific mission areas to inform/impact budget and program formulation influence the development of system or segment requirements provide technical parameters to systems and capabilities improve Concept of Operations (CONOPS) / Tatics Techniques and Procedures (TTP) for operational systems shape and inform protection-related policies and identify areas for additional collection and/or analysis by the IC to feed threat mitigation efforts.The FY15 President Budget request represents the resources required to operate and execute a synchronized and effective space protection effort for the Nation; fulfilling a unique objective and independent role that considers comprehensive enterprise-level space and non-space material and non-material solutions across NSS systems and architectures.  The FY15 request preserves the skill-set knowledge base and multi-organizational construct required to remain ahead of the threat and to evolve programmatic direction and operational CONOPS across multiple orbital regimes in a way that minimizes duplication and inefficiency.  This essentially enables the SSDP to deliver the research analysis studies tools and capabilities necessary to identify prioritize develop and implement the most effective and economical solutions to preserve NSS capabilities.

The initial KC-46 increment will replace roughly a third of the current capability with the purchase of 179 aircraft.  The Air Force completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in Apr 2006 to determine the most appropriate strategy to recapitalize the aging fleet of KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft.  Based on this analysis the Air Force concluded that a strategy of full and open competition to select a commercial derivative replacement tanker aircraft would result in a best value tanker contract.  To initiate the first phase of the KC-135 replacement the KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010 and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010.  The KC-46 program held a Milestone B Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011 received approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) from OUSD(AT&L) on 24 Feb 2011 and awarded the KC-46 EMD contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft.  The KC-46 will provide the capability to fuel joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will also augment the airlift fleet with cargo passenger and aeromedical evacuation capabilities.  The KC-46 will be able to operate in day/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment employment sustainment and redeployment of U.S. joint allied and coalition forces.  The KC-46 will have communication navigation and surveillance equipment for world-wide operations; will have the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; will have the ability to operate in up to medium threat environments with self-defense/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and will have necessary battle space awareness to mitigate survivability threats.The KC-46 development effort will also procure the necessary ground and flight test assets to support development/operational test.  The program plans to procure four RDT&E aircraft for integration and demonstration of capability that will ultimately be operationally fielded after a successful operational test phase.  In addition aircrew and maintenance training systems will be developed and procured using KC-46 funding.  The Aircrew Training System (ATS) entered source selection on 31 May 2012 and a contract was awarded on 1 May 2013 to FlightSafety Services Corp.  The ATS contract will provide aircrew training devices to include Weapon System Trainers (WST) Boom Operator Trainers (BOT) Fuselage Trainers (FuT) and Part-Task Trainers (PTT) at each Main Operating Base (MOB) and the Formal Training Unit (FTU).

It will replace the aging USAF AN/TPS-75 radar system as the AN/TPS-75 is incapable of detecting some current and emerging threats.  In addition as the AN/TPS-75 is reaching the end of its service life it is more difficult and costly to maintain.  The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is considering 3DELRR as a potential replacement for the AN/TPS-59 at the end of its service life to support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Commander through the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS).  3DELRR will address system sustainability transportability and operational availability shortfalls while providing long-range surveillance detection and tracking of Air Breathing Targets (ABTs) and potentially Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBMs).

This program provides funding for the development and integration of electronic warfare training capabilities to include P5 Combat Training Systems (P5CTS) threat emitters communication jammers instrumentation equipment/systems and evolutionary upgrades to facilitate standardization and integration across all platforms to include coalition and 5th Generation aircraft.  The P5 Combat Training System a collaborative development between USAF and USN provides air combat training systems for the services at operational locations worldwide.  Increments include: hardware and software upgrades; an encrypted software communications architecture compliant data link to facilitate interoperability in a security environment and training with 5th Generation aircraft; internal pod replacement subsystems; integration of new aircraft Operational Flight Programs. This program also includes the development of advanced threat emitters. The Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) continues the development of a comprehensive suite of threat signals for aircrew tactics and electronic combat training for simulated penetrations of hostile airspace. This program complements existing range threat simulators by emulating signals that simulate current and future air defense and threat radars. JTE awarded a follow-on production contract to improve the current baseline by removing obsolescence and proprietary software to enable full organic sustainment. The follow-on production contract includes the development of a non-proprietary software baseline and the procurement of that source code in addition to JTE systems Mobile Command and Control Units (MC2U) Fixed Command and Control Units (FC2U) and additional spares. Consistent with an evolutionary acquisition strategy and documented ACC training requirements development will continue with next generation threat systems. Future developments will continue to add additional capability to the warfighter's training ranges. The Advanced Radar Threat System (ARTS) program formerly named JTE Increment 2 will develop design build and test threat system simulators based on advanced foreign fielded surface-to-air missile (SAM) radar threat systems. ARTS is designed to be used at Department of Defense (DoD) training ranges for aircrew training and tactics development to increase combat effectiveness and aircrew survivability by training aircrews to engage or defend against an advanced SAM threat before encountering it in actual combat. Various aircraft platforms may train against ARTS but the most stringent requirements placed on ARTS design come from 5th generation aircraft capabilities. The ARTS-Variant 1 (ARTS-V1) is focused on strategic long-range re-locatable radar threat systems while ARTS-Variant 2 (ARTS-V2) is focused on tactical mobile short/medium-range radar threat systems. Since a similar ARTS-V1 capability is being developed through the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program ARTS-V2 development is being accelerated. It was originally to start development after ARTS-V1 was in procurement. This program also funds development of replacement components for Legacy Range Threat Systems (due to obsolescence) to extend the system's service life .  Legacy Systems include the Multiple Threat Emitter System (MUTES) the Miniature Multiple Threat Emitter System (Mini-MUTES) the Modular Threat Emitter (MTE) system the Tactical Radar Threat Generator (TRTG) system the Band Simulator the Common Electronic Attack Receiver (CEAR) and the Unmanned Modular Threat Emitter (UMTE) system. Additionally this program funds ongoing analyses studies risk reduction efforts and technology development to enhance range systems such as combat training range equipment integration into a Live Virtual Constructive architecture communication and GPS jammers weapon drop scoring systems and infrastructure networks. These enhancements add a critical dimension to exercises and optimize warfighter training.This program is in Budget Activity 5 - Systems Development and Demonstration because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements.","","","","R2Long","",

The term NAVWAR is sometimes equated with "PNT Superiority".  The Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) was established by DEPSECDEF Memo 17 November 2004 as the DoD Center of Excellence tasked to integrate and coordinate NAVWAR PNT capabilities across electronic spectrum cyberspace and space operations.  NAVWAR leverages various techniques and technologies from these mission areas to negate or prevent hostile use of PNT information and protect unimpeded use of PNT information by U.S. Allied and Coalition Forces while not unduly disrupting peaceful use outside an area of operation. The JNWC develops and maintains the Department's premier collection of NAVWAR knowledge and provides subject matter expertise support to warfighters Department decision makers the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure) and the Coalition.  NAVWAR expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs) modeling and simulation analysis and exercise and training support. In recent years the Global Positioning System (GPS) has become one of the most critical enablers of modern advanced technology warfare. In an era where everything from advanced weapons systems and networks to basic goods and services are tracked guided or disciplined by PNT systems such as GPS NAVWAR is an ever increasing capability of interest and concern especially if PNT systems are interrupted or lost. Likewise as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) proliferate it becomes necessary to consider not only denying adversary use of GPS but also negating adversary use of alternate GNSS systems for PNT.  Recent revisions to National Defense Strategy and Defense Planning Guidance require Combatant Commands to account for denied / degraded PNT environments in deliberate planning. Projecting force in the Asia-Pacific Region and other theaters of operation requires an understanding  of how evolving global asymmetric anti-access / area denial (A2/AD) threats may affect joint warfighting functions.  JNWC-conducted POFAs are a key element in evaluating Coalition NAVWAR capabilities and vulnerabilities and adversary capabilities and vulnerabilities both crucial to executing PNT superiority mission sets in potentially denied / degraded PNT environments.  JNWC helps develop defensive and offensive PNT capabilities by focusing on four Joint Mission Essential Tasks (JMETS):1.

The GPS Enterprise consists of Space Ground Control Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) and User Equipment Segments.  The government is responsible for the integration of the GPS Segments such that they provide worldwide GPS capability to support the warfighter and over a billion national security civil allied and commercial GPS users.  The GPS Enterprise Integrator project includes the efforts associated with the Government's prime contract tasks necessary to accomplish this critical integrating function with the entire GPS user community.  The Enterprise Integrator maintains the GPS current architecture and system definition controls and validates interfaces ensures compatibility of Generation II and III systems and develops/manages plans for execution and fielding of the GPS Enterprise.  Further the Enterprise Integrator provides modeling simulation and technical analyses of impacts for Government-directed enterprise-level trades among the GPS segments leading to definition management maintenance and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents to build and ensure the integrity of the enterprise technical baseline and perform system requirements verification.In addition the GPS Enterprise Integrator project funds the technical evolution risk reduction enterprise-level testing and delivery of all GPS Enterprise capabilities.  Examples for Generation II include electronic protection and additional civil signals; for Generation III additional anti-jamming protection.  To accomplish this the GPS Enterprise Integrator delivers Test and Verification capabilities Requirements and Interface Management and Systems Integration support across the Space Control and User Segments.  In this capacity the Enterprise Integrator is responsible for managing this cross-program work to provide these and other capabilities.  GPS Enterprise Integrator's analyses guide government decisions to ensure efficient and effective synchronization and execution across all Generation II and III GPS programs.  For Enterprise-wide integration to be successful the Integrator: works with the GPS and NDS prime contractor teams to develop plans for early risk reduction System Integration Demonstrations to ensure system interfaces and functionality meet user and system requirements; ensures all equipment and documentation is ready when needed; integrates and analyzes enterprise schedules conducts formal test and verification including Requirement Verification Plans; and System Test Plans and Procedures.  GPS Enterprise Integrator performs all these efforts across all GPS programs in all acquisition phases.  The government owns the Enterprise system requirements and integration and highly leverages the Enterprise Integrator team to eliminate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions.  This enhances the government control oversight and program accountability.This program is in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that were fielded or received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","","1696.500","456","","",

Examples include but are not limited to upgrades to outdated avionics computers mission planning interfaces to Joint Mission Planning Software (JMPS) Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS) upgrades to the EW suite and studies and analysis. All B-52 development projects support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases.B-52 COMBAT NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (CONECT) (BPAC 675050)The B-52 CONECT acquisition project supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with tactical datalink and voice communications capabilities along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. The CONECT upgrade includes new Multi-Functional Color Displays (MFCDs) and a digital interphone system which will survive and function through the nuclear environment to enhance crew interaction and situational awareness. To enable net centric operations the CONECT upgrade integrates: on-board client/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions; UHF Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability via ARC-210 Warrior radio to exchange J-Series messaging within theater; Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR); limited Internet Protocol (IP) based UHF BLOS link supporting voice e-mail and file transfers; and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink to significantly enhance close air support (CAS) missions. This integrated suite will provide the B-52 fleet with a machine-to-machine data transfer capability supporting aircraft re-tasking and retargeting of Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM) and J-series weapons across the range of B-52 military operations and missions. This requirement's Capability Development Document (CDD) was validated by the Air Force Requirement's Oversight Capability Council (AFROCC) on 18 March 2004.Trainers and Upgrades for CONECTIn order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration the CONECT project will update existing trainers or use computer-based training to add CONECT functionality to meet user-training requirements and update/maintain the SIL for the WSTs.B-52 1760 INTERNAL WEAPONS BAY UPGRADE (IWBU) (BPAC 675048)The 1760 IWBU requires the integration of the 1760 weapons capability into the bomb bay on 78 B-52H aircraft which includes two Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA) utilizing 44 Common Strategic Rotary Launcher (CSRLs) converted into Conventional Rotary Launchers (CRLs) where three of the CRLs will be modified under Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) for test purposes. This requirement's Capability Development Document (CDD) was validated by the AFROCC in April 2013. The 1760 IWBU project provides internal and external carriage for eight weapons and consists of two sub increments: 1.1 and 1.2.Increment 1.1 consists of internal carriage of eight Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and variants to include Laser JDAM (LJDAM) on a rotary launcher. Additionally this increment develops the capability for external carriage for 16 LJDAM.Increment 1.2 develops the capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) and its variants to include JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) and eight Miniature Air Launched Decoys (MALD) and its variants to include MALD Jammer (MALD-J). This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 12 JASSM-ER.B-52 MODE S/5 IFF (BPAC 675049)Mode S/5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) is part of the Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) effort and will develop and integrate modern IFF technology into the B-52 to enable it to operate in the evolving air traffic environment. This effort is driven by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandates to comply with performance standards to allow the B-52 to operate safely in controlled airspaces. Aircraft not equipped with appropriate capabilities will not be able to operate in airspace where new separation standards and air traffic management procedures are implemented. An additional benefit is the significant fuel savings that will result in being able to fly at optimum and more efficient routes and altitudes. DoD mandates Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 047-07 (signed March 2007) and JROCM 122-08 (signed June 2008) dictate replacement of the B-52's APX-64 IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) Transponder with a modern Mode S/5 transponder.  This requirement was validated by Air Force Form 1067 signed in November 2011.B-52 ANTI-SKID REPLACEMENT (BPAC 675051)The B-52 Anti-skid system is used to maintain control of aircraft during landings and taxi operations. The B-52 Anti-skid system prevents aircraft skidding by sensing the exact amount of brake pressure needed for safe braking under all runway conditions without tire damage. Previous B-52 Anti-skid supportability analysis completed in 2006 by General Atomics indicated a supportability end date of 2011 based on parts obsolescence a lack of test equipment and a lack of repair personnel. Parts obsolescence continues to be a major supportability factor. However since the previous analysis test equipment and new depot maintenance procedures to refurbish previously failed Anti-skid detectors have been put in place in order to provide spares through 2015 when the replacement will be available. The Anti-skid Replacement project develops and installs a new system. This effort includes an upgrade of the maintenance trainers. This requirement was validated by Air Force Form 1067 signed in July 2009.ARMS CONTROL ACTIVITIES (Funding is in the ARMS Control PE 0305145F)Arms Control Activities under the New START Treaty drives the need to modify a number of B-52s to a conventional only role by removing the Code Enable Switch and associated equipment. This effort requires a complete design to remove the equipment from the aircraft and install metal plates prohibiting reinstallation of removed equipment to comply with treaty protocols.These projects are in Budget Activity 7 Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.","In FY 2015 675048 1760 IWBU includes new start efforts.","","","","",

Stores are carried in countless different loading combinations determined by operational and training scenarios missions tactics and weapon development programs. Aircraft stores combinations change as operational plans and tactics change and as new stores are developed and fielded. Before operational training or test use the Air Force must certify these configurations for safe loading carriage and separation (jettison and normal release) as well as verify ballistics accuracy under the user-certified carriage and employment parameters. The Air Force SEEK EAGLE program completes certification recommendations and recommended flight clearances through any combination of engineering analysis wind tunnel testing modeling and simulation and ground/flight test and evaluation. The SEEK EAGLE effort encompasses eight disciplines: Fit and Function Flutter Loads Stability and Control Electromagnetic Compatibility/Interference (EMC/EMI) Separations Ballistics and Safe Escape.In support of certification the program recommends about 1000 aircraft/store combinations for flight each year with analysis and testing requiring from weeks to years depending on the complexity. Integrated solutions for combat aircrew weapon delivery planning problems are developed and provided to combat forces via Combat Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS) and Joint Safe Escape Analysis Solution (JSEAS).  SEEK EAGLE works in coordination with the Air Force Safety Center to provide Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) analysis and certification recommendations of ordnance systems containing electro-explosive devices. The program is also responsible for inserting new and emerging technologies into the SEEK EAGLE process as well as providing resources for the sustainment of a viable Air Force aircraft/store certification capability.SEEK EAGLE funds are currently budgeted to support certification testing and analysis for new and inventory stores including but not limited to: Small Diameter Bomb I & II (SDB) Laser Joint Direct Attack Munitions (LJDAM) Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) Air Intercept Missile (AIM-9X) Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AIM-120D) Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) BRU-57 (Smart Bomb Rack) BRU-61 (SDB Bomb Rack) Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD) Sniper Targeting Pod with video data link LITENING Targeting Pod with video data link laser guided bombs F-22 supersonic tank B61 (Mod 12) penetrator warhead upgrades (BLU-111/BLU-117) practice bomb and aircraft instrumentation pod modifications.

There are two development programs the CAT program develops a canisterized Anti-Torpedo Torpedo (ATT) as an ACAT II program.  The TWS develops the required torpedo detection classification and localization (TDCL) ship systems as an ACAT III program.  The AN/SLQ-25X solicitation was cancelled due to a more cost effective technical solution of interfacing the TWS to NIXIE system.The program will develop and field six Surface Ship Torpedo Defense prototype (TWS/CAT) Engineering Design Model (EDM) systems on CVNs. Each prototype consists of one TWS and eight CATs. The six systems were accelerated due to the lack of hard-kill torpedo defense on HVUs which has been exacerbated by recent real-world events and evolving threats. The systems provide a hard-kill torpedo defense capability in advance of the IOC as part of the program of record. The program delivered one hybrid prototype system in FY13 on USS GHW BUSH.   The next prototype is expected to deliver in FY14; This system will be delivered in a roll-on/roll-off (RO-RO) configuration and installed on USS Roosevelt.

Operational uses of sub-nodal analysis tools would include but are not be limited to determining which nodes of the adversary's CommandControlCommunications Computers Intelligence (C4I) network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects and modeling execution plans to determine the need to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points in order to redirect activities based on changing battlefield conditions. NCCT software applications employ Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate sensor cross-cues and collection activities. NCCT correlation and fusion services ingest collection data to produce a single composite track (geo-location and identification) for high-value targets. NCCT research and development funding supports evolutionary development of the NCCT message set and network management systems (Operations Interfaces Network Controller Fusion Engines Data Guard Interface to Command & Control and Interface to Overhead Intelligence Operations) the migration of the NCCT technologies to emerging network centric technologies (Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and web services) and satisfying DoD standards and Information Assurance requirements.  NCCT Core Technology develops the hardware and software to horizontally integrate Joint and Coalition dissimilar Battle Management Command & Control (BMC2) and ISR assets and systems into integrated target tracks shared across networked platforms.

Prospective Coalition Joint or Service systems are required to fund their respective integration unique core technology improvements/upgrades to support system integration.Information Operations Battle Management (IOBM) and the SUTER Program System (SPS) develop concepts Tactics/Techniques/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network. SPS's planning execution and assessment capability is implemented in a distributed operations architecture taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR non-kinetic and/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets. Impacting these target sets can be achieved by "attacking" or influencing/shaping links nodes or end points in the network to include: RF and terrestrial links switches routers hubs servers IP addresses cell phones antennas radars microwave relays SATCOM receivers transceivers etc. The three main pieces of the SPS CONOPS include: first the use of SPS's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second the SPS's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs JIOWC etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third via SPS's combined network Common Operating Picture (COP) all involved "players" monitor the plan's execution provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities provide continuous assessment/updates of the execution of the plan and within authorities (Rules of Engagement/ROEs) re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions. SPS is the technology that assists COCOMs and Components to exercise synchronized dynamic Command and Control (C2) of ISR kinetic and non-kinetic Joint operations against conventional and terrorist threat networks. SPS provides decision makers and operators supporting airborne ship-borne cyber and land- based C2ISR platforms and at supporting locations continuous Predictive Battle-space Awareness (PBA) of the information superiority fight.

This program conducts Interoperability Assessments that are required to certify Aircraft Carriers Amphibious Assault Ships and Surface Combatants in accordance with the Naval Warfare System Certification Policy (NWSCP) NAVSEAINST 9410.2A NAVAIR 5230.20 SPAWAR 5234.1.The SFI Program ensures overall strike force interoperability is characterized and assessed. NAVSEA is assigned central United States Navy (USN) responsibility for interoperability directing the development of policy and architecture for Strike Force warfare systems engineering and implementation of a common warfare systems engineering process. There are three priorities within the Strike Force Interoperability Program:  1) Support Fleet As-Is state which includes Navigation System Certification (NAVCERT) Interoperability Capabilities & Limitations and Interoperability Tactical Information Coordinator Technical Aids (TIC TECHAIDs); 2) Ship system modernization (non-HME) including warfighting capability & other C5I upgrades. This includes C5IMP Baseline Management and Non-Aegis Combat System Integration Testing; and 3) Ship Warfare System Certification & Force Level Assessments. This includes Warfare Systems Certification Interoperability Certification Force Level Interoperability Analysis Assessments and reports recommending force level interoperability improvements to the program offices for implementation at the systems level. In addition to these core efforts this program also aims to improve the efficiency of testing processes through the Automated Test and Re-test (ATRT) program and engages in efforts designed to ensure the U.S. Navy is interoperable with Joint and Coalition forces through the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD).Project 0164 Combat System Integration:This project consist of five key pillars executed within the SFI program beginning in FY13: 1) Command & Control Communications Computer Combat Systems and Intelligence Modernization Process (C5IMP) and Fleet Readiness. The C5IMP validates the introduction of new systems into the Fleet and ensures system maturity prior to installation thereby reducing risk and enhancing readiness and effectiveness of deploying ships and strike groups; 2) Warfare Systems Certification which is essential to validating the maturity and operational performance of warfare systems prior to fleet delivery and deployment; 3) Navigation Certification (NAVCERT) and Electronic Charting and Display System - Navy (ECDIS-N) certification which certifies ship electronic charting capability and certifies the accurate transmission of navigation data to combat and weapons systems; 4) Combat Systems Integration Testing (CSIT) formerly known as Warfare Systems Integration and Interoperability Testing (WSI2T) which is essential in the identification of critical integration and interoperability issues.  CSIT also provides Objective Quality Evidence (OQE) for warfare system certification decisions for installation and deployment; and 5) Interoperability Certification and Assessment the independent assessment of Strike Group Warfare Systems operational performance.  Interoperability Assessments examine force level engagement threads aircraft control air battle-space management and operational displays.  Assessments of deploying ships in Strike Force configurations are accomplished through the utilization of the Navy's Distributed Engineering Plant (DEP) which is the cornerstone for the Distributed Integration & Interoperability Assessment Capability (DIIAC) Concept.  It is a U.S. Fleet Forces Command and Commander In Chief U.S Pacific Fleet (COMPACFLT) requirement that all Strike Forces undergo Interoperability Assessment testing in the DEP prior to deployment.  Interoperability Certification results are used to develop fleet tactical tools (Capabilities & Limitations (C&L) and Tactical Information Coordinator Technical Aids (TIC TECHAIDs)) which ensure that operators understand the interoperability capabilities and limitations of their combat systems.

Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) forum it promotes interoperability with the Navies of nine participating nations (Australia Canada France Germany Italy Netherlands Spain United Kingdom and the United States).  This project funds participation in several Project Arrangements and includes maritime contribution to the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European Pacific and Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations.  Specifically the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with "Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.The MTMD forum provides protection against the proliferation of short medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the creation of an interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD)capability among coalition nations.  This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats. MTMD supports USN participation in several MTMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:(1)  Battle Management Command Control Communications Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps.(2)  Modeling & Simulation (M&S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.(3)  Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.(4)  Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.(5)  Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.(6)  Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.Project 9B88 Automated Test and Retest (ATRT):The Navy through Automated Test and Re-Test (ATRT) is developing an automated test/analysis capability which is applicable at phases within system development and integration which provides reproducible and quantitative evaluation of system performance with reduced levels of effort and schedule in order to support one of the Navy's priority initiatives of reduction of Total Ownership Cost (TOC).

Analysis and demonstration have established that surface SSD based on single-sensor detection point-to-point control architecture is inadequate against current and projected Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats.  The supersonic seaskimming ASCM reduces the effective battle space to the horizon and the available reaction time-line to less than 30 seconds from first opportunity to detect until the ASCM impacts its target ship.  Against such a threat multi-sensor integration is required for effective detection and parallel processing is essential to reduce reaction time to acceptable levels and to provide vital coordination/integration of hardkill and softkill assets. These SSD projects address and coordinate the detect and control functions necessary to meet the rigorous SSD requirements. Quick Reaction Combat Capability (QRCC PU2178) / Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) Training Improvement Program (PU3358): Multi-sensor integration parallel processing and the coordination of hard-kill / soft-kill capabilities in an automated doctrine-based response to the ASCM threats are the cornerstones of SSDS being developed through QRCC (PU 2178) efforts. In addition this project provides for the central system engineering management for the integration of advanced sensor weapon and C4I upgrades and the test and certification of the Integrated Combat System (ICS).  The SSDS Training Improvement Program (PU 3358) is for the integration of Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC) improvements into the SSDS Advanced Capability Build (ACB) and Technology Insertion (TI) efforts under QRCC (PU 2178).The Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) is the core combat system control element for the Quick Reaction Combat Capability (QRCC) in aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships.  SSDS integrates a diverse set of fire control loop sensors and weapons and C4I systems for each ship class (CVN68/78 LHA6 LHD1 LPD17 and LSD41/49).  SSDS MK2 provides the capabilities for integrated air and missile defense multi-warfare situational awareness combat direction and joint interoperability via the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) and Tactical Digital Information Link (TADIL)-J (Link 16).  SSDS MK2 is being fielded with the new construction carriers (CVN78 class) and amphibious ships (LHA6 LPD17 classes).  SSDS MK2 is replacing the Advanced Combat Direction System (ACDS) in the LHD1 class and SSDS MK1 in the LSD 41/49 class as fleet modernization initiatives.SSDS MK2 integrates new combat system war-fighting capabilities and improvements on phased basis via ACB TI the Fire Control Loop Improvement Project (FCLIP) and Accelerated Mid-Term Interoperability Improvement Project (AMIIP).  New hardware TI baselines are required every four years to refresh the Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) assemblies to sustain system production and to support the incorporation of new ACB capabilities.  Each individual ship is planned for a TI upgrade on an eight year interval to replace obsolescent COTS hardware and support the fielding of the ACB capabilities.Integrated Swimmer Defense (ISD PU3306) scope is to provide the Navy Expeditionary security forces with capabilities of a portable marine integrated swimmer defense system (ISDS) to engage combat swimmers/divers or unknown individuals underwater once they have been detected.Non-Lethal Weapons (PU 3172) provides a long range laser warning and dazzle systems for use in the maritime environment.

Each squadron is organized by Boat Detachments Security Detachments and Command and Control (C2) divisions. The C2 Division is comprised of Sensor Detachments (SENSDET) operating the Radar Sonar Surveillance Center (RSSC) and Communications Detachments (COMMSDET) operating the Mobile Ashore Support Terminal (MAST IIIs) each separately funded. The Radar Sonar Surveillance Center (RSSC) is the only land-based and rapidly deployable mobile Navy system with the ability to conduct surface and subsurface surveillance in coastal and littoral areas. The system provides detailed contact information via various C4I systems to the tactical area commander based on radar visual thermal electronic and underwater acoustic sensor information. Missions supported with the MIUW-RSSCs are: OCONUS and INCONUS Force Protection protecting port areas high value assets and surveilling the near shore areas. The MAST III is the C4ISR hub for the NCW Commander. MAST IIIs deploy to support Force Protection/Force Security Officer for Commander Amphibious Group in its Harbor Defense and Coastal Sea Control missions.As stated in the Maritime Expeditionary Security Force (MESF) CONOPS dated 11 April 2007: The MESF organization will be established through realignment of the CRF organizations (CRF Squadrons Mobile Inshore Undersea Warfare Units Inshore Boat Units Mobile Security Squadrons Mobile Security Detachments Embarked Security Detachments and Embarked Security Teams) into the CRF structure. Further realignment will result in the integration of intelligence VBSS and additional waterborne and security detachments to support new mission capability and provide additional NCC / JFMCC capacity. In addition to enhancing readiness of the current force CRF will deploy adaptive force packages (AFPs) tailored for the specific missions to achieve greater efficiency and combat readiness than the current CRF force. By establishing a professional warfare community and dedicated Maritime Expeditionary Security Force capable of meeting the full range of security requirements CRF closes a critical gap essential to full mission readiness for MSO. CRF provides a structure that establishes a single integrated maritime security force with one standard for training certification employment and tactics techniques and procedures (TTP).  This funding supports the future direction of the CRF as it is being determined externally by world events and internally by the progress of DoD initiatives modernize forces and capabilities.. CRF force will be agile tailorable and scalable and will use applied technology to quickly detect deter or interdict potential threats to DoN assets in the littoral environment. Next generation surface and subsurface surveillance systems as well as enhanced C4I capabilities are required to meet these operational objectives. These capabilities must be interoperable with higher and adjacent echelons of command (to include coalition allies) as well as with supporting elements to include joint forces.The Expeditionary Warfare Decision System (EWDS) (formerly Tactically Integrated Sensors (TIS)) software constitutes an upgrade to the MAST-RSSC and is being executed as a separate Abbreviated Acquisition Program. The AAP will enable the deployment of a currently fielded Program of Record (POR) combat system (AN/SQQ-34C) known as Tactically Integrated Sensors (TIS) to the CRF units. TIS system restores the acoustic surveillance capability that has been eroded from the current RSSC suite. Additionally future mult-spectal technologies are being looked at as enabling capabilities to expand the situational awareness of the littoral region providing additional tactical decision aids to the local area commander.This funding supports the Identity Dominance System (IDS) as key enabler in support of the Joint Personnel Identity (JPI) program. OPNAV N957 conducted the NCW CBA and MES ICD. MESF forces have a mobile security mission that requires methodologies procedures equipment and the communications capacity to identify individuals who represent a potential threat as a means to deter and eliminate individuals from conducting asymmetric/non-traditional attacks upon friendly forces high value assets and coastal areas that NCW is charged with protecting. The Vessel Boarding Search and Seizure (VBSS) teams conducting Expanded Maritime Interception Operations also have a similar requirement to identify individuals. The development of a device to support identity functions is captured in the Identity Dominance System Capability Development Document (IDS CDD). IDS will be used in the following environments: aboard ship and ashore in ports the littorals and extended inland field environments worldwide. IDS will be employed in maritime and very austere ashore environments and carried by individuals who are part of ship boarding parties and dismounted patrols. These mission and environmental demands dictate a portable lightweight rugged and reliable system with intuitive and user friendly features. IDS biometric modalities may differ by mission profile requiring the authoritative response to the On-Scene Commander/Boarding Officer on whether to detain or further investigate an individual of interest.Coastal Riverine Force will integrate and employ a variety of surface and air assets special vehicles weapons and appropriately trained personnel. Mission assets needed to support the operational capabilities will vary widely dependant on the Host Nations involved. The Riverine Squadron will deploy with inherent but limited force protection capabilities. The Modular Unmanned Scouting Craft Littoral (MUSCL) is man-portable "X-Class" Unmanned Surface Vehicle providing enhanced surveillance and reconnaissance capability to Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) Riverine forces.This program provides efforts in support of the Navy Expeditionary Warfare Division (formerly known as Navy Irregular Warfare (IW) Office).  It provides for the identification and assessment of available technologies to confront expeditionary challenges including irregular warfare urgent/emergent and unfulfilled needs of the warfighter.  It provides for the validation and combat demonstration of identified technologies and/or packages of technologies to meet Oversea Contingency Operation (OCO) goals.  It also provides funding necessary to attract additional investment and sustainment of demonstrated capabilities.  The goal of the Navy Expeditionary Warfare Innovations Branch office is to: identify those requirements necessary to meet the immediate warfighter needs; integrate those existing unique and/or related capabilities that can best meet those warfighter needs; test those integrated capabilities; and then demonstrate in real time and/or during planned deployments all within an 8 month period. Combatant Craft Replacements will provide second generation Riverine Multi Mission Craft that will replace in-service Riverine Patrol Boats (RPBs) and Riverine Assault Boats (RABs).  Combatant Craft replacements will: conduct inland waterway patrol and interdiction to preserve the rivers for friendly use as lines of communications; deny the use of rivers and waterways to waterborne and immediate shore sited hostile forces by barrier and interdiction operations;  and with augmentation of ground and air forces locate and destroy hostile forces within a riparian area.  Specific mission and capabilities will be identified in an NECC developed/OPNAV N95 approved Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).  RDT&E funding will fund feasibility studies and procurement of mock-ups and prototype craft to demonstrate capabilities prior to production craft procurement.","","36.404","","","",

It includes the Advanced Tactical Data Link Systems (ATDLS) Integration Programs specifically Link 16 Network Command and Control Processor (C2P) and Link Monitoring and Management Tool (LMMT); and Network Tactical Common Data Link (NTCDL) Program which provides the ability to transmit/receive real-time Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) data simultaneously from multiple sources (surface air sub-surface man-portable) and exchange command and control information (voice data imagery and Full Motion Video (FMV)) across dissimilar Joint Service Coalition and civil networks. The Program Element also develops and tests tactical data link capability to distribute other data types to new and existing platforms.JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under Operational Systems Development because it encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for upgrade of existing operational systems.NTCDL provides warfighters with the capability to support multiple simultaneous networked operations with currently fielded CDL-equipped platforms (e.g. F/A-18 P-3 and MH-60R) in addition to next generation manned and unmanned platforms (e.g. P-8 Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike ( UCLASS) and Fire Scout). NTCDL is a tiered capability providing a modular scalable multiple-link networked communications. NTCDL benefits the fleet by providing horizon extension for line-of-sight sensor systems for use in time critical strike missions. NTCDL supports Anti-Access/Area of Denial (A2AD) through its relay capability and supports Tasking Collection Processing Exploitation Dissemination (TCPED) through its ISR networking capability.  Additionally NTCDL supports Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR) efforts through its ability to share ISR data across dissimilar Joint Service Coalition and Civil organizations.The Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) program consists of two products MIDS Low Volume Terminal (LVT) and MIDS Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). MIDS-LVT provides Link 16 capability to platforms that were unable to employ Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) due to space and weight constraints. The MIDS-LVT effort is multinational (U.S. France Germany Italy and Spain) with joint Service participation (Navy Army and Air Force). The Department of Defense (DoD) established the program to design develop and deliver low volume lightweight tactical information system terminals for U.S. and Allied fighter aircraft bombers helicopters ships and ground sites. MIDS-LVT provides interoperability with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) users significantly increasing force effectiveness and minimizing hostile actions and friend-on-friend engagements. The terminal design is smaller lighter highly reliable interoperable with JTIDS Class 2 terminal compatible with all the participants' designated platforms affordable and re-configurable to individual user needs and budgets. MIDS JTRS designed as a Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) and executed as an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to the production MIDS-LVT configuration completed qualification in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. It facilitated the Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) JTRS incremental approach for fielding advanced JTRS transformational networking capability and transformed the MIDS-LVT into a 4-channel Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant Joint Tactical Radio. A form-fit-function replacement to MIDS-LVT MIDS JTRS also adds three programmable 2 Megahertz (MHz) to 2 Gigahertz (GHz) channels capable of hosting the JTRS legacy and networking waveforms. In addition to the Link 16 Tactical Air Navigation and voice functionality found in MIDS-LVT MIDS JTRS has four channels and adds capabilities such as Link 16 Enhanced Throughput four nets Concurrent Multi-Netting (CMN) with Concurrent Contention Receive (CCR) (CMN-4) Link 16 Frequency Re-mapping (FR) software programmability and Cryptographic Modernization (CM). With CMN-4 MIDS JTRS also utilizes Tactical Targeting Network Technology for MIDS JTRS Naval Integrated Fire Control Counter Air and From the Air Advanced Tactical Data Links.  These capabilities provide Joint Airborne Network-Tactical Edge functionality to run advanced mission applications in a cross-platform/cross-domain tactical network enterprise and the ability to simultaneously participate in four Link 16 Nets.","","588.372","554","","",

The budget enables Acquisition Category (ACAT) III development to address Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) defined capability-based requirements and mission needs. This program is tied to development programs that leverage a joint United States/Australia Armaments Cooperative Project (ACP) to develop MK-48 ADCAP CBASS; and Future Naval Capability (FNC) technologies developed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR).Countermeasure (CM) sophistication and availability on the open market directly affects ADCAP kill proficiency and its ability to counter rapidly evolving threats. The focus of the MK-48 ADCAP torpedo program from FY 2001 and out shifted from being primarily concentrated on software block upgrade efforts towards coordinated hardware upgrades rapid Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) insertion and APBs to rapidly upgrade the ADCAP to counter evolving threats and maintain robust performance. The CBASS program developed and fielded a broadband sonar capable of identifying CMs and discriminating them from the target. CBASS Phase I achieved IOC in FY 2006 and Phase II was achieved in 2013.  The Commonwealth of Australia Royal Navy (RAN) is jointly participating to develop CBASS APB5 to improve shallow water performance and signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) extension November 2009.  The MOA extension expires Nov 2019.The MK-48 ADCAP torpedo program focuses on two specific areas near term; torpedo APBs and hardware tech insertions. The CNO continues to stress shallow water (less than 600 feet) as a critical operating area to counter third world diesel electric submarines. Torpedo testing in shallow water has demonstrated that in-service ADCAP has less than full capability in this difficult environment. However this testing in conjunction with laboratory simulation efforts has shown that significant performance improvements can be made by implementing changes to weapon tactics and software algorithms. Development implementation and testing of these changes is being accomplished under the torpedo APB program. The APB program also leverages the RAN joint torpedo program and FNC technologies developed by the ONR in the areas of torpedo broadband signal processing tactics processing and alertment. The torpedo tech insertion program will leverage the MK-54 Lightweight Torpedo (LWT) algorithms. Further hardware investment involves development of Guidance & Control (G&C) replacement required to support production and development of automated test equipment replacement to improve comprehensive system testing of full up CBASS torpedoes.The torpedo technology insertion program will provide for evolutionary torpedo improvements and upgrades (including the transition and testing of advanced technologies from the research and development community).  This approach will incorporate developmental testing of the FNC transitioning technologies for ADCAP upgrades in the areas of torpedo sensors weapon/platform connectivity warhead lethality speed and endurance. These efforts will continue torpedo development investment at a lower cost and shorter term than traditional torpedo programs.APB5 software upgrades are currently in process for MK-48 ADCAP torpedoes.  Both FNC technologies and MK-54 LWT developments will be transitioned into ADCAP through APBs and technology insertion packages. Priorities for APBs and technology insertion are: (1) improved torpedo effectiveness through advanced processing algorithms (2) advanced counter-countermeasure capability and (3) a new array to improve torpedo effectiveness.","","206.635","","","",

Data from the MQ-8 will be provided through standard Department of Defense Command Control Communications Computers and ISR.A Fire Scout system is comprised of air vehicles payloads (electro-optical/infra-red/laser designator-range finder) Ground Control Station (with TCS and TCDL integrated for interoperability) UAV Common Automatic Recovery System (UCARS) for automatic take-off and landings and associated spares and support equipment.  A total of 56 systems are planned to support training maintenance test and Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) requirements.  A limited number of land-based ground control stations supplement the system to support shore based operations such as pre-deployment or acceptance functional check flights. These land based ground control stations will also support depot level maintenance/post-maintenance activities.The MQ-8 system is post Milestone C (MS C) which was approved in May 2007.  MS C authorized entry into Low Rate Initial Production. The system is currently deployed on Navy Guided Missile Frigates (FFGs).   The Navy has truncated MQ-8B procurement with the last LRIP buy in FY11.  21 of the 23 LRIP aircraft (90%) have been delivered. Once delivery is complete the 23 aircraft will support 8 Fire Scout systems.  MQ-8B airframes will continue to support maritime based ISR from FFGs support LCS DT/OT events and LCS deployments. MQ-8B airframes will sunset through attrition. The MQ-8C Endurance Upgrade Rapid Deployment Capability (RDC) provides additional mission endurance payload-weight-power increased reliability and improved maintenance to the Fire Scout System.  The Navy plans to transition the MQ-8C capability into the Program of Record.  The MQ-8C is a more cost efficient and capable system that meets both the Joint Emergent Operational Need Statement (JEONS) and the Fire Scout Capability Production Document (CPD).  The Navy plans to procure 48 MQ-8C based systems to support Littoral Combat Ship. This budget transitions the MQ-8C Endurance Upgrade Radar and Weapons capabilities into the Program of Record to meet both the JEONS and CPD requirements with a single system.","","226.502","253","","",

CANES is the technical and infrastructure consolidation of existing separately managed afloat networks including Integrated Shipboard Network Systems (ISNS) Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System - Maritime (CENTRIXS-M) Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Networks and Submarine Local Area Network (SubLAN). These legacy afloat network designs are currently End of Life and CANES will replace these unaffordable and obsolete networks.The fundamental goal of CANES is to bring Infrastructure and Platform as a Service within which current and future iterations of Navy Tactical Network computing and storage capabilities will reside. CANES will provide complete infrastructure inclusive of hardware software processing storage and end user devices for Unclassified Coalition Secret and SCI for all basic network services to a wide variety of Navy surface combatants submarines Maritime Operations Centers and aircraft. In addition hosted applications and systems inclusive of Command and Control Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Information Operations Logistics and Business domains require the CANES infrastructure to operate in the tactical environment. Integrating these applications and systems is accomplished through Application Integration (AI) the engineering process used to evaluate and validate compatibility between CANES and the Navy-validated applications systems and services that will utilize the CANES infrastructure and services. Specific programs such as Distributed Common Ground System - Navy (DCGS-N) Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M) Naval Tactical Command Support System (NTCSS) and Undersea Warfare Decision Support System (USW-DSS) are dependent on the CANES Common Computing Environment (CCE) to field host and sustain their capability because they no longer provide their own hardware. CANES requires that Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) field prior to or concurrently with CANES due to the architectural reliance between the two programs.  CANES will develop updates on a rolling four year hardware baseline and a two year software baseline. CANES is based on the overarching concept of reducing the number of afloat network baselines and providing enhanced efficiency through a single engineering focus on integrated technical solutions. This will allow for streamlined acquisition contracting test events and significant lifecycle efficiencies through consolidation of multiple current configuration management baselines logistics and training efforts into a unified support structure. Platform Sets 1 2 3 and 4 define phases of CANES system development efforts.  Each platform set consists of different ship class design baselines.In FY 2015 CANES RDT&E investment will support the developmental efforts for Technical Insertion (TI) software baseline.  Perform systems engineering efforts to complete functional baselines and updates to technical data packages.  Continue testing events at Enterprise Engineering and Certification (E2C) laboratory for TI software baseline.  Perform Developmental Testing (DT) and Follow-On Test and Evaluation (FOT&E) for force level platforms. Achieve Full Deployment Decision (FDD).  The Communications Automation Program - This project is a continuing program that provides for automation and communications upgrades for Fleet tactical users. It includes Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) and High Frequency Internet Protocol/Sub Network Relay.ADNS is the method by which tactical Navy units transfer Internet Protocol (IP) data to Navy and Department of Defense communities on the Global Information Grid (GIG). ADNS serves as a gateway to enable joint and coalition interoperability for these tactical assets and ensures GIG connectivity. ADNS allows unclassified secret top secret traffic and various joint allied and coalition services to reconnect to the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) ashore via radio paths and pier connectivity.  In FY 2015 ADNS RDT&E investment will support continued interface design development and integration with network applications development of Line-of-sight (LOS) Link DISN integration development of Cipher-Text (CT) piers. Also in FY2015 study efforts will begin with the intention of integrating ADNS into the Joint Aerial Layer Network - Maritime (JALN-M) system.  JALN-M is the Navy implementation that provides network connectivity in areas that have limited or denied Satellite Communications (SATCOM).  ADNS study efforts will include addressing network management intra and inter domain routing Quality of Service (QoS) and Concept of Operations discussions.","","99.779","","","",

Tasks in this Project support research development and test efforts in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phases of these systems.The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) is the transformational system that provides Army Aviation interoperability capability for Future Force and Joint Force operations. The JTRS integration effort provides for the non-recurring engineering required to integrate and qualify the JTRS certified radios with Link 16 and/or other advanced networking waveforms into the AH-64E and Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). Funding in FY 2015 continues integration activities to install and qualify JTRS certified networking radios on the AH-64E and Shadow UAS platforms and also supports continued development of common radio control software and qualified airborne JTRS antennas for use on multiple platforms.  The Shadow UAS solution will be incorporated into the Shadow Communications Relay Payload (CRP) mission equipmment package.  The Improved Data Modem (IDM) is the common solution for digitizing Army Aviation. It performs as an internet controller and gateway to the Tactical Internet and Fire Support internet for Army aircraft. With interfaces supporting a transmit/receive terminal the IDM provides radio connectivity to the ARC-201D/231 ARC-186 ARC-164 and the Blue Force Tracker transceivers. IDM provides a flexible software driven digital messaging system that is interoperable with existing Army and Joint forces battlefield operating systems. The IDM provides Situational Awareness and Variable Message Format messages capability to the cockpit. The Doppler Global Positioning System Navigation System (DGNS) Upgrade program completes system engineering trade studies to reduce space weight and power with the introduction of new navigation support capabilities such as inertial sensor MIL-STD-1553 interface card and Instrument Flight Rules map display. It also prepares Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) to the existing DGNS ASN-128D Line Replaceable Units (LRU) as a result of those trade studies. The effort also derives DGNS compliance matrices for current and planned Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) capabilities for the upcoming decade.  The DGNS upgrade continues with execution of Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) for Computer Display Unit (CDU) and Signal Data Converter (SDC) LRU ECP packages. The ASN-128D CDU Upgrade replaces the current CDU faceplate with a touch screen display provides a moving navigation map capability and optimized pilot interface to augment existing Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) capability and promote safer flight operations.The Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) previously referred to as Apache Block III is a set of standards jointly developed by government and industry consortium members; conformance to this standard is Army Aviation's conduit to compliance with the Common Operating Environment (COE) directive. This will be accomplished through the integration of the selected middleware into Army Aviation Platforms.  This includes the non-recurring engineering for integration test and air worthiness qualification. As part of the Army's migration to a net-centric fighting force it is necessary for aircraft to access certain critical services that enable seamless access and operation on the future force network.The Aviation Data Exploitation Capability (ADEC) is an Army Aviation program to develop integrate and test specific capabilities needed at the Aviation unit level to implement and support improvements within aviation maintenance operations safety and training. ADEC will standardize data and information formats and provide a comprehensive and fully integrated automated information system. ADEC provides a common and interoperable capability required to implement Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance processes. The Aircraft Notebook (ACN) will provide users with an aviation centric suite of software used to streamline the completion of aviation maintenance activities and its documentation. ACN will include The Army Maintenance Management System - Aviation (TAMMS-A) digital logbook functionality and will host and integrate with platform applications such as Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETM) and Ground Station Software (GSS) application. ACN will reduce the Information Technology footprint within an aviation unit by integrating multiple software tools onto one hardware platform.The Brownout Rotorcraft Enhancement System (BORES) previously referred to as Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) is required to reduce personnel and rotocraft losses while conducting both tactical and training missions in environments that restrict or severely reduce the aircrews visibility due to atmospheric obscurants. BORES will improve safety reduce risk and add flexibility to aviation units by enhancing situational awareness through real-time detection and warning of terrain obstacles and hazards.  BORES will consist of integrated rotorcraft pilotage augmentation systems; sensor(s); software; software related hardware; and pilot to system interfaces and cueing devices.  BORES will fuse a synthetic vision avionics backbone with aircraft state data and obscurant penetrating sensor(s) to provide a single rotorcraft capability for ground taxi hover takeoff and landing modes of flight. The Aviation Logistics Enterprise - Platform (ALE-P) will replace the Unit Level Logistics System-Aviation (Enhanced) which has transitioned into sustainment and the Unmanned Aviation Systems-Initiative which currently only provides automated logistics capabilities for the UAS community providing a single Aviation Logistics Information System for all of Army aviation. ALE-P will provide the interface to the Global Combat Support System-Army and other enterprise systems at Logistics Support Activity (LOGSA) Aviation Missile Command (AMCOM) and Program Executive Office (PEO) Aviaton as well as the ACN and ADEC at the unit level. ALE-P will be a system of software and hardware that maintains platform airworthiness records and delivers a Logistics Management and Decision Support System for commanders.","FY13 Congressional Mark -$28.5M/+$17.3M to BORES/DVE Sequestration $5.501MPOM/BES 15-19 reduced FY15 to $37.246M","","","","",

The ATCCS program provides automation in the five battlefield functional areas (BFAs) with the following specific systems: (1) Maneuver Control System (MCS); (2) Effects and Fires Command and Control Systems (EFCCS); (3) All Source Analysis System (ASAS) for Intelligence/Electronic Warfare; (4) Forward Area Air Defense Command Control and Intelligence System (FAADC2I); and (5) Battle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3). To provide an overall technically sound cost effective and operationally responsive approach the design and development of ATCCS must be accomplished on a total systems basis.  The Common Hardware Systems (CHS) program provides tactical state-of-the-art fully qualified interoperable compatible deployable and survivable hardware and computer networking equipment for command control and communications for the United States Army and other Department of Defense (DoD) services. CHS provides technical support common standardized testing and system design / configuration management across Army tactical programs to ensure interoperability and integration of hardware throughout the development of capabilities to facilitate and simplify the selection of common hardware solutions across the operational battlefield and to create efficiencies through streamlined common hardware configurations across the Common Operating Environments (COE)s. CHS also provides worldwide repair maintenance logistics and technical support services through strategically located contractor-operated Regional Support Centers (RSC) for tactical military units and management of a comprehensive 5-year warranty and 72-hour turnaround for repairs.  Common Software(CS) is the program through which the Army develops integrates and tests common software products and/or components used for communication between ABCS Joint and coalition Command and Control (C2) applications. The CS project provides state-of-the-art software technologies and functionality that is used by numerous Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS) and joint systems to eliminate the need for service independent development and duplication of effort. The CS project also manages and performs technology demonstrations of emerging technologies for future use by Army C2 systems. The CS program is a cornerstone in the Army's COE modernization efforts. Funding supports on-going development of common software solutions and the technical evaluation of previously developed software capabilities for integration into the computing environments of the Army COE architecture to include appropriate Mounted and Mobile Computing environments. Efforts will include assessment of software maturity and readiness development/modification of software necessary to integrate integration with common computing environments and validation.

The Sentinel system is used with the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) element and is a key component to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD)architecture via the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) to provide critical air surveillance of the forward areas.Sentinel (AN/MPQ-64A1) consists of a radar-based sensor with its prime mover/power Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) and Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) Command Control and Intelligence (C2I) interfaces.  The radar is deployed in both an air defense role and a force protection role for Counter-Rocket Artillery and Mortar (C-RAM) missions.  The sensor is an advanced three-dimensional battlefield X-Band air defense phased-array radar with an instrumented range of 75 km.  Sentinel is capable of operating day or night in adverse weather conditions in the battlefield environments of dust smoke aerosols and enemy countermeasures.  It provides 360-degree azimuth coverage for acquisition tracking.  Sentinel contributes to the digital battlefield by automatically detecting classifying identifying and reporting targets (cruise missiles unmanned aerial systems rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft). Sentinel acquires targets sufficiently forward of the battle area to allow weapons reaction time and engagement at optimum ranges.  Sentinel's integrated IFF reduces the potential for fratricide of US and Coalition aircraft.  The Research and Development funding supports Sentinel modernization/upgrades hardware/software issue resolution resolution of obsolescence issues engineering studies and cost reduction initiatives.  The funding for Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 through FY2019 development activities addresses the following Sentinel system capability gaps and obsolescence issues identified by the User:  1) Target Detection gap; 2) Target Tracking gap; 3) Net Readiness gap; 4) Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) gap; and 5) Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Defense gap. Battle Space Improvement addresses the Target Detection gap that currently exists with the Sentinel system.  This development effort modifies the radar signal processor algorithms to reduce system processing losses.  The modified algorithms will increase target acquisition and tracking range capability by a minimum of 12 percent against the threat set within the instrumented range band.  This effort also develops modifications to the radar hardware by utilizing an upgraded common signal processing card to the radar signal processor to provide a common hardware and software processing configuration across the Sentinel radar fleet.Stop Stare and Track addresses the Target Tracking Gap.  This development effort provides direct Fire Control Radar (FCR) support in an integrated air and missile defense architecture. In addition this provides significantly improved Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) timeline and performance against all targets to include Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Cruise Missiles Rotary Wing and Fixed Wing aircraft. This upgrade also enables rapid classification of cued Rockets Artillery and Mortars (RAM) UAS Rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft as well as very accurate Point of Origin (POO) and Point of Impact (POI) of RAM targets and enables a robust kill assessment capability of engaged targets.Cross Domain Solution (CDS) Network Interface addresses net readiness and system security concerns. This effort develops a CDS interface to isolate the Sentinel radar from connected networks of lower classification levels.Electronic Attack/Electronic Protect (EA/EP) addresses the electronic countermeasures (ECM) gap.  This effort conducts additional design and testing to verify initial EA/EP results and updates the database and associated software and hardware with more extensive EA/EP signatures to address evolving threats.Signal Data Processor (SDP)/North Finding Module (NFM) addresses the Target Detection Target Tracking and Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) capability gaps and funds the mitigation of the Signal Data Processor (SDP) and North Finding Module (NFM) obsolescence issues.  Signal Data Processor (SDP) cards are estimated to go obsolete every four to six years.Medium Bandwidth Waveform upgrade will address latent tracking issues that currently exist with Sentinel in certain applications.  This development effort modifies firmware as well as software in the Sentinel radar.  This effort will provide better target resolution and more accurate tracking in the slant range coordinate.  This improved target resolution and tracking accuracy will provide improved retention of target identification and more robust tracking that addresses the latent tracking issues.  Mode S upgrade to existing Sentinel Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) will address Sentinel's objective requirement to interrogate IFF mode S which is currently not being met.  Mode S transmissions are a key component of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) surveillance technology being used by the Federal Aviation Administration for tracking aircraft as part of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  In the United States all aircraft required to have transponders (most aircraft) must transition to mode S capable units by 2020.  Without the Mode S upgrade Sentinel will have to rely on these aircraft transponders responding to the legacy mode 3/A interrogations.  The data available in the mode S response will be valuable in identifying the aircraft and correlating Sentinel tracks with civil aviation tracks/data and other track data sources.The Active Electronic Steered Array (AESA) is the next generation of radar technology to replace the current phase and frequency scanned array used by Sentinel today. The AESA effort is to develop and test a new single face rotating AESA Antenna for the Sentinel radar and will be executed as a modification to the existing platform.  The single face AESA Antenna will provide increased capability including extended range for ground-based surveillance and situational awareness faster and more accurate Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) for clearing fires and preventing fratricide improved Fire Control (FC) quality track accuracy and management of larger track loads. The AESA will also provide improved operation in severe/urban clutter.  The system will detect and track small targets such as Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Cruise Missiles in clutter and will detect and track slow targets such as UAS and Rotary Wing (RW) aircraft at low altitudes in clutter.  The system will detect track and classify Rocket Artillery and Mortar (RAM) threats and will support Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) requirements.  The AESA will support advanced Electronic Protect (EP) techniques to address the evolving Electronic Attack (EA) threat.","","","","","",

CATT enables units from crew to the battalion task force level to conduct a wide variety of combat tasks on a realistic interactive synthetic battlefield.  CATT's combination of manned simulators and staff officer workstations enables units to train as a combined arms team in a cost effective manner.  The primary CATT system is the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) which provides the underlying baseline architecture and After Action Review (AAR) for CATT expansions Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and system enhancements.  The Reconfigurable Vehicle Simulator (RVS) and the Dismounted Soldier Training System (DSTS) variants support combat convoy operations and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) tasks.  Synthetic Environment (SE) Core provides for the expansion of the synthetic environment baseline to include enhanced interoperability and the products and infrastructure to support current and future combat operations and mission rehearsal required for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and Unified Land Operations.  The first synthetic environments expanded were in the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and the CCTT for both the Active and Reserve components.  Gaming Technology provides an application to train and rehearse convoy-operations platoon level mounted infantry tactics dismounted operations rules-of-engagement training cross-cultural communications training IED defeat training route clearance ground-air coordination Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) integration and other small unit and individual training and mission rehearsal requirements.  Soldiers can train in a common environment on geotypical or geospecific virtual terrain.  It is also possible to link Gaming technology to actual communication command control computer and intelligence (C4I) systems and other CATT simulation systems to increase the utility and realism of the training.  By practicing skills in CATT units are able to effectively prepare for costly live fire and maneuver exercises as well as train tasks deemed too hazardous to conduct in a live training environment.  Fielded in both fixed site and mobile versions CATT enables both Active and Reserve component units to prepare for real world contingency missions.  By being able to use a wide array of training terrain databases and modify the behavior of the computer generated opposing forces CATT offers an unlimited array of training options to support the Army's many regional combat missions.  The combination of tough field and live fire training and realistic simulation training in CATT is the formula to prepare Soldiers and their Leaders for the uncertainties they face in current combat operations in Afghanistan and their transition to Unified Land Operations.FY 2015 base funding of $.815 million for CCTT enables the P3I for the CCTT Dismounted Soldier Training System (DSTS) in support of Infantry Brigade Combat Teams Stryker Brigade Combat Teams Airborne Ranger Special Forces units and Armor Brigade Combat Teams. FY 2015 base funding of $1.769 million for Games for Training will integrate the flagship product into the Live-Virtual-Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC-ITE). FY 2015 base funding of $28.175 million will continue the efforts of providing expanded development and production for common terrain databases. FY 2015 funds will modify the Terrain Development process for constructive Terrain Database Production continue to enhance OneSAF in the SE Core Architecture and database generation for Regionally Aligned Forces (RAF). Maintaining OneSAF for virtual simulations enables interoperability with the Live Virtual Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC ITE) and reduces cost as individual virtual simulators will no longer develop and maintain separate SAFs. The SE Core Product Line of Common Virtual Components will continue with upgrades integration and refinement and the continued development of common visual models.  FY 2015 base funding of $11.671 million will design develop and test new capabilities to enhance training when using the AVCATT and NCM3 in combined mode including improved communications hoist operations slingload operations visual realism improvements and enhanced After Action Review capabilities.

The AIAMD Program is uniquely structured to enable the development of an overarching SoS capability with all participating Air Defense Artillery (ADA) components functioning interdependently to provide total operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems. The AIAMD program achieves this objective by establishing the AIAMD architecture and developing (1) the IAMD Battle Command Systems (IBCS) Engagement Operations Center (EOC) that provides the common Mission Command capability (2) the Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) capability for fire control connectivity and distributed operations and (3) the common Plug and Fight (P&F) Kits that network enable multiple sensor components weapon components and the IBCS EOC.The AIAMD Program will provide advanced capabilities to the Army and the soldier by allowing transformation to a network-centric system-of-systems capability (also referred to as "Plug and Fight") that integrates AMD sensors and weapons with the IBCS EOC.  The AIAMD SoS architecture will enable extended range and non-line-of-sight engagements to include joint kill chain engagements across the full spectrum of aerial threats providing fire control quality data to the most appropriate weapon to complete the mission successfully.  Further it will mitigate the coverage gaps and the single points of failure that have plagued AMD defense design in the past.  The AIAMD program will provide the user with the ability to train on a single command and control (C2) system that will result in overall training savings.  The AIAMD program will also provide the Army with the ability to procure components that will build to established interfaces allowing them to "connect" to the IFCN alleviating the cost of procuring total system capabilities in the future. As a result of sequestration reductions in FY13 and budget reductions beginning in FY15 the program will defer Initial Operational Capability (IOC) from FY16 to FY18. The FY18 capabilities will be delivered through fielding of the IBCS EOC-based AIAMD architecture including the IBCS EOC Sentinel and Patriot components connected via an IFCN working in an integrated manner.  Additional capabilities include the incorporation of IBCS functionality into Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells ADA Brigade Headquarters and Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC) Headquarters.  Future additional capabilities include incorporation of Theater High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) batteries and composite Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC)/Avenger battalions into the AIAMD architecture.

ASAS provided the means to enhance the commander's timely and comprehensive understanding of enemy deployments capabilities and potential courses of action. The system used standard joint and Army protocols and message formats to interface with selected National joint theater and tactical intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance systems and preprocessors and Army joint and coalition battle command systems. The ASAS Family of Systems migrated into the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) program and Army is using it as the initial platform to provide accelerated DCGS-A capabilities to the force. The Counterintelligence (CI) and Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Automated Reporting and Collection System (CHARCS) is the Army's CI and HUMINT tactical collection and reporting system.  CHARCS provides automation support for information collection reporting investigations source & interrogation operations and document exploitation. The CHARCS automation architecture extends from the individual HUMINT team soldier or CI agent to the Corps Analysis and Control Element (ACE).  CHARCS reports digital data such as maps overlays images video biometrics scanned documents and audio files.  These media are transmitted through secure networks and interfaces with the Distributed Common Ground Systems-Army (DCGS-A) for detailed analysis and creation of finished intelligence products.  Collection and reporting teams at Military Intelligence (MI) battalions and their operational managers are equipped with one of two CHARCS systems.  The first is the AN/PYQ-8 Individual Tactical Reporting Tool (ITRT) which provides collection and processing devices for individual HUMINT team member or CI agents.  The second is the AN/PYQ-3 CI/HUMINT Automated Tool Set (CHATS) which provides the team leader (who normally directs 3-5 team members) tools to process and manage team-collected information and a robust set of devices such as printers scanners cameras and audio recorders to assist the collection mission.  The CHATS is also used by Operational Management Team (OMT) (who normally directs 5-10 collection and reporting teams).  Each CHATS has an associated Mission Support Peripheral Sets and Kits (MS-PSK) or Collection Peripheral Sets and Kits (C-PSK). The Machine Foreign Language Translation System (MFLTS) formerly Sequoyah develops fields and sustains a basic automated foreign speech and text translation capability for Army tactical systems to augment and compliment limited human linguistic resources.  These integrated automated translation capabilities will be applicable across three different system configurations; a hand-held/wearable portable device a laptop/mobile device and in a networked/web-enabled system.  The software modules will translate English from a prioritized list of languages in a prioritized collection of domains (e.g. medical intelligence base security).

It also provides the Brigade Commander with critical battlefield intelligence and targeting information in the rapid cycle time required for success at the tactical level. The TUAV Shadow system air vehicle meets the required operating range of 50 kilometers and remains on station for up to nine hours. The TUAV Shadow system consists of 4 air vehicles (each configured with an Electro Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensor payload) launcher ground control and support equipment including: power generation communications equipment automated recovery equipment one system remote video terminals vehicle mounted shelters and High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles with trailer(s). Each system is equipped with one Maintenance Section Multifunctional (MSM) and is supported at the division level by a Mobile Maintenance Facility (MMF). All 102 Shadow UAS systems have been procured and fielded. Shadow has amassed over 880190 total flight hours most of which were flown in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  Incremental upgrades are required for continued improvement and interoperability. Common Systems Integration is required to ensure interoperability with other manned and unmanned weapon systems to include One System Remote Video Terminal (OSRVT). Continued developmental improvements are required to provide greater interoperability increase operational capability and flexibility to the Brigade Combat Team. Modifications to the airframe avionics payloads ground control equipment and support equipment are based on documented requirements and lessons learned from units operating in OEF and OIF. Justification:  FY2015 RQ-7 UAV Base funding of $16.389 million will be used for capability and reliability improvements specifically: Air Vehicle modifications (Block III Engine) reduced noise signature for engine and Ground Equipment (interoperability) improvements. Additionally funds will be for System Engineering Program Management and System Test and Evaluation support. Funds will also be used to incorporate the Increment II OSRVT Bi-Directional capability ensure interoperability and OSRVT test events.","","","","","",
