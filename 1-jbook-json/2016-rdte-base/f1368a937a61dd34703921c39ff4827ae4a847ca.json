The PSE program is organized to provide PSE RDT&E for Air Force specific needs but as a complement to and in conjunction with the PSE RDT&E programs funded by the DOD Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG). As such this program will obtain, demonstrate, and test PSE in the same manner and to the same standards and architecture as PSEAG funded projects to ensure interoperability with PSEAG developed PSE.  In support of PSE, this RDT&E program includes spectrum planning for radio frequency (RF), communication security (cyber), and information assurance requirements.  This Program Element also includes funding for Force Protection Commercial Off The Shelf (FP COTS) market research, evaluation and testing. The FP COTS testing applies to all available technologies (delay, denial, detection, assessment, communication display, access control and power) which are considered effective for AF physical security use. This program supports the maintenance and test support at Site C 3 and the Cold Weather Test Site (CWTS), as annotated in DoD Directive 3200.11, listing the 46th Test Wing (TW) as a Major Range and Test facility, conducting developmental and operational testing as the primary mission.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full rate production."
