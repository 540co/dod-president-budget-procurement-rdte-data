            "val": "The Operational Test Activities and Analyses (OTA&A) programs are continuing efforts that provide management and oversight of test and evaluation functions and expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD).  The OTA&A programs consist of three activities:  Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E); Threat Systems (TS); and Center for Countermeasures (CCM).\n\nJoint Test and Evaluation projects are test and evaluation activities conducted in a joint military environment that develop process improvements.  These multi-Service projects, chartered by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and coordinated with the Joint Staff, appropriate combatant commanders, and the Services, provide non-materiel solutions that improve:  joint interoperability of Service systems, technical and operational concepts, joint operational issues, development and validation of joint test methodologies, and test data for validating models, simulations, and test beds.  The JT&E projects address relevant joint war fighting issues in a joint test and evaluation environment by developing and providing new tactics, techniques, and procedures to improve joint capabilities and methodologies.\n\nThreat Systems, based on a memorandum of agreement between the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) and the Defense Intelligence Agency, provides DOT&E support in the areas of threat resource analysis, intelligence support and threat systems investments.  Threat Systems provides threat resource analyses on the availability, capabilities and limitations of threat representations (threat simulators, targets, models, U.S. surrogates and foreign materiel) and analysis of test resources used for operational testing to support DOT&E\u2019s assessment of the adequacy of testing for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&E and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.  Threat Systems provides DOT&E assessment officers and other DOT&E activities with program specific threat intelligence support.  Threat Systems also funds management, oversight, and development of common-use threat specifications for threat simulators, threat representative targets, and digital threat models used for test and evaluation.\n\nThe Center, a Joint Service Countermeasure (CM) T&E Activity, directs, coordinates, supports, and conducts independent countermeasure\/counter-countermeasure (CCM) T&E activities of U.S. and foreign weapon systems, subsystems, sensors, and related components. The Center accomplishes this work in support of DOT&E, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) for Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E), weapon system developers, and the Services.  The Center\u2019s testing and analyses directly supports operational effectiveness and suitability evaluations of CM\/CCM systems, such as missile warning and aircraft survivability equipment (ASE), used on rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft.  The Center develops unique CM\/CCM test equipment to support testing in operationally realistic environments. The Center determines effectiveness of precision guided weapon (PGW) systems and subsystems when operating in an environment degraded by CMs.  Analysis and recommendations on CM\/CCM effectiveness are provided to Service Program Offices, DOT&E, DASD (DT&E), and the Services.  The Center also supports Service member exercises, training, and pre-deployment activities with expertise on CM\/CCM technology and capabilities.\n\nThis Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development support and travel funds."

The Joint Deployable Integrated Air and Missile Defense Joint Test closed in June 2014.  The test developed, tested and evaluated tactics, techniques, and procedures to enable the joint task force commander to employ integrated deployable air, cruise missile, and theater ballistic missile defense capabilities.  The Joint Advanced Capability Employment Joint Test closed in August 2014.  The test developed a testable and repeatable methodology for the joint task force commander to employ advanced capabilities to overcome complex targeting challenges. \n\nSix new feasibility studies were conducted in FY 2014, four of which were selected to conduct joint tests.\n\nThreat Systems\n\nIn FY 2014, Threat Systems initiated actions to significantly reduce its DOT&E funded investment program due to budget restrictions.  These reductions affected DOT&E\u2019s ability to make strategic investments to reduce limitations to test due to inadequate threat portrayal.  All other Threat Systems support continued.\n\nThreat Systems continued test planning working group participation and performed technical analyses to identify threat shortfalls; conducted special studies and provided current intelligence support tailored to specific U.S. weapon systems acquisitions; continued managing intelligence \u201cdeep dives\u201d to produce intelligence in sufficient detail to develop new threat test assets; operated and maintained the modeling and simulation configuration control board for threat models and simulation used in test facilities; and, continued the development and implementation of a tri-Service and Allied threat M&S roadmap to ensure infrared countermeasure systems have sufficient threat test assets.  Threat Systems proposed, managed and oversaw threat test assets funded by the Test Resource Management Center that support DOT&E-identified threat shortfalls, identified candidate threat systems from the various intelligence agencies for possible development of models for use in test and evaluation.  Threat Systems also continued efforts to maintain a standard set of threat performance models.\n\nThese activities help DOT&E carry out its Title 10 responsibilities to assess test adequacy and determine whether testing is realistic and suitable, and promotes common solutions to Service threat representation needs.\n\nThe Center\n\nThe Center completed 31 T&E activities and analyzed and reported on more than 30 different systems, with special emphasis on rotary wing survivability, CM\/CCM employment, warning and targeting systems, and PGWs.  Most programs supported received an independent assessment of our data\/findings and test support for their CM\/CCM evaluations.  Approximately 55% of the Center\u2019s efforts were spent on aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) testing; with the majority of these efforts in support of rotary wing aircraft.  About 21% of the Center\u2019s efforts were spent on PGW, foreign systems, and other types of field testing not related to ASE.        Approximately 7% of the Center\u2019s efforts were dedicated to training support, with emphasis on CM\u2013based, pre-deployment training for rotary wing units.  Fifteen percent of the Center\u2019s efforts were spent on internal programs to improve test capabilities and to develop test methodologies for new types of T&E activities.  The Center continued to develop multiple test tools for evaluating ASE infrared countermeasure (IRCM) systems and HFI systems.  In addition, the Center is improving its electronic warfare capability with the development of the high-power Portable Range Threat Simulator that will provide a more comprehensive integrated ASE T&E environment.  Our support was distributed across all the Services, as well as intelligence agencies and research and development activities.  About 2% of the Center\u2019s efforts consisted of providing subject matter expertise and other support not directly related to scheduled test activities. \n\nThe Center provided expertise to many organizations and was actively involved in the following panels:  Joint Expendable Countermeasures (JECM) Integrated Product Team, Joint Infrared Countermeasures Multi Sensing Symposia Working Group (MSS IRCM WG), Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), Foreign Material Exploitation Working Group, Foreign Material Program T&E Subcommittee, Joint Countermeasures T&E Working Group (JCMT&E WG), and JCMT&E WG Hostile Fire Indicator (HFI) subgroup lead."
