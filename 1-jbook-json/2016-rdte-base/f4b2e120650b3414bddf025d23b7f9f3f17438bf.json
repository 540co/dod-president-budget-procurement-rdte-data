            "val": "The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Human Social Culture Behavior (HSCB) Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need.  The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces\u2019 ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools and prototypes.  Work under PE 0603670D8Z is focused on developing and demonstrating general-use, cross-domain tools in two areas: computational modeling; and sociocultural behavior data collection, management, and dissemination.  Research will result in more effective cultural understanding in existing intelligence, influence operations, and operations planning systems; modeling capabilities for forecasting reactions to U.S.\/coalition actions; demonstration of strategic decision making tools that highlight political, religious, cultural, and related factors; tools and technologies enabling more widespread and effective use of sociocultural behavior models in operations and mission rehearsal; and toolsets that can be used as strategic decision making tools to account for sociocultural factors."

In addition to refining and extending those tools, the Program is researching and developing comparable models and tools for analysis and forecasting of other events of interest.  Work in this area also includes modeling to support analysis of alternative courses of action (COA).  This is a challenging objective that requires research, development and integration of constituent technologies.  Integrate and demonstrate decision making support tools useful within programs of record and operational user analysis, planning and execution systems for political, religious, cultural and other factors.  Support specific operational planning tasks for selected government partners via limited technical demonstration in user settings.  In addition, working with operational partners HSCB Program models will be tested in realistic environments by representative users."
