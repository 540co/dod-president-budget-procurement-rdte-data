With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  To assist the DoD in retaining a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries, the SEI Applied Research PE will develop and evaluate the feasibility and practicality of software and computer science concepts with the potential to improve future DoD systems.  The SEI\u2019s program of work coordinates across the Department through Reliance 21, the overarching framework of the DoD\u2019s Science & Technology (S&T) joint planning and coordination process.  This PE directly benefits these DoD S&T Communities of Interest (COI): Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I); Autonomy; Cyber; and Engineered Resilient Systems.  Additionally, this PE benefits every COI to some degree due to the ubiquitous nature of software.  This PE also leverages expertise in government, industry, and academia to enable the development of joint-Service capabilities.\n\nThis PE represents a pivot toward more fundamental research that enables the DoD to address longer-term challenges in software technology and engineering.  The SEI Applied Research PE funds the SEI FFRDC as the leading DoD center for addressing these longer term challenges.  The SEI Applied Research PE bolsters the organic research at the SEI FFRDC, enables stronger collaborations between the SEI FFRDC and academia, attracts top researchers to the SEI, gives the DoD access to top experts in information science, and generally enhances the DoD\u2019s ability to benefit from the military applications of research in software and computer science."

Funding levels in each thrust area may vary from year to year.  Research will address the goal of assisting the DoD to retain a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries in the area of software-intensive systems.  The four main thrust areas are:\n\n1) Measurement techniques for the effectiveness of software technologies and methods.  Modern tools, integrated development environments, and software engineering processes have captured large data sets about development activities.  This thrust seeks to study the metrics that affect cost, schedule, quality, and performance based on real-world observation and experiment.  \n\n2) Design principles and tools for evolvable, scalable ecosystems.  The commercial world has many successful examples of software ecosystems, but the DoD has not capitalized on these to the same extent.  This thrust looks beyond implementing ecosystems in a DoD context and seeks to implement the underlying principles in a way that makes automated creation, evolution, and scaling of ecosystems easier.\n\n3) Models of Computational Behaviors.  System performance depends on end-to-end models of computational behavior that include the user, architecture, source and object code, firmware components, and processor hardware.  This thrust seeks to study emerging ideas that better model end-to-end computational behavior.  \n\n4) Cyber-tradecraft and analytics.  Cyberwarfare is an increasingly important and rapidly evolving dimension on the modern battlefield.  This thrust seeks to investigate methods that will give the DoD enduring advantages in the cyber battlespace such as reverse software engineering, automated code and malware analysis, code-level software resiliency (e.g., randomizing and time variant techniques), and other techniques such as those found in the Software Security Assurance State-of-the-Art Report.  \n\nThe SEI Applied Research PE will also conduct research in multicore computing, architecture-led iterative incremental development (Agile at scale); and emerging software and computer science areas that can act as catalysts for acquiring DoD systems with improved performance."
