The JPO's role is to coordinate sustainment and modernization of IBS terminals compatible with the Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB). The JTT family of systems currently consists of the JTT-Senior and JTT-IBS systems, and they satisfy Radio Frequency (RF) Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) for the IBS Program. The JTT is the official IBS producer system, and ensures continued IBS interoperability to a variety of tactical producers\/consumers across the Joint Services. JPO IBS Terminals performs JTT life cycle program management through fielding and sustainment of recently upgraded JTT equipment which includes technical fixes as needed in the newly upgraded IBS network that now uses new crypto, a new Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB), and the Common Message Format (CMF). Funds support continued technical fixes\/enhancements, configuration management for JTT crypto\/CIB\/CMF capabilities after the FY14 Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of the newly upgraded IBS network enterprise."
