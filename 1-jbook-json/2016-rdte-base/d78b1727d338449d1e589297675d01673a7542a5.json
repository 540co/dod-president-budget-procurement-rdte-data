This test process provides a scientific methodology to ensure the effective disciplined and efficient testing of EW and avionics systems.  Each capability or facility improvement is pursued in concert with the others to avoid duplicate capabilities while at the same time producing the proper mix of test resources needed to support the AF EW Test Process and testing of EW systems which can be used in any action involving the use of electromagnetic and DE to control the electromagnetic spectrum or to attack the enemy.  This PE provides funding for the management and technical oversight of implementation activities, development and improvement of digital EW models, measurement facilities improvements, hardware-in-the-loop test facilities improvements, and installed system test facility improvements.  Support includes requirements definition and analysis, project planning, programming and budgeting, technical oversight, and application of T&E facility Improvement & Modernization (I&M).  Products include studies, analyses, improved Modeling & Simulation (M&S) of threat sources, improved or new T&E capabilties to support EW testing and related documentation.  Additionally, this PE provides funding to support the acquisition and analysis efforts of the Foreign Materiel Program and EW intelligence efforts.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

To manage program risk effectively throughout the weapons system acquisition process, and conduct T&E effectively and efficiently, a broad multi-spectrum, integrated set of T&E capabilities for modeling and simulation through open-air ranges (OAR) is required. The EW Test Process Support task provides for investment management, coordinated technical oversight, and application of EW T&E facilities, including studies, analyses, and related documentation.  The National Radar Cross Section (RCS) Test Facility (NRTF) at Holloman AFB, NM, provides timely, accurate, and secure RCS and antenna measurements for tri-service and joint program offices, DoD laboratories, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and industry.  The NRTF tests fielded and developmental systems and technologies to meet Low Observable (a.k.a. stealth) and EW customer requirements.  The Guided Weapons Evaluation Facility (GWEF), 412 EWG\/OL-HN and the Digital Integrated Air Defense System (DIADS) provide the ability to realistically evaluate hardware components and simulated weapon systems against manned hardware threat representations throughout the acquisition process.  GWEF and 412 EWG\/OL-HN provide simulations of advanced Infrared (IR) & Radio Frequency (RF) semi-active Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs), Air-to-Air Missiles (AAMs), RF missile warning, IR and Laser countermeasure functions; integration of actual threat hardware and ground clutter into advanced threat RF and IR missile simulations.  DIADS provides algorithm based enemy command and control (C2) capabilities plus early warning radar detection, limited ground control intercept features and also allows man-in-the-loop interaction for the enemy C2 positions.  The Advanced Warfare Test and Evaluation Capability (AWTEC) will replace 90's technology with state-of-the-art stimulators to upgrade the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) at Edwards AFB, CA and provides Electromagnetic Interference\/Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMI\/EMC) capabilities at the BAF.  Improvement and modernization efforts within this PE are identified for the EW mission area.  EW provides planning, improvements, and modernization needed for test capabilities to conduct and support the AF EW test process, including DE.  This test process provides a scientific methodology to ensure the effective disciplined and efficient testing of EW and avionics systems."

The GWEF at the 96 TW brought the 9-axis Infrared (IR) Flight Motion Simulator (FMS) up to functional status completing development and calibration efforts. The 96 TW began IR simulator software improvements and upgraded system hardware and interfaces to the IR developmental test lab.  The Digital Integrated Air Defense System (DIADS) fielded a new software release which improved tracker capability and scenario preparation.  DIADS also continued development of advanced jamming capabilities and improved weapon command and control algorithms, and validated architecture and simulation upgrades to advance new capabilities to simulate evolving threats.  The Advanced Warfare Test & Evaluation Capability (AWTEC) completed Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) upgrades providing Electromagnetic Interference\/Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMI\/EMC) test capabilities in the high and low frequency bands and integration of new test control and RF monitoring systems.  AWTEC continued development of Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) software, Advanced Global Navigation System upgrades for the BAF, and awarded a contract to begin upgrading the BAF advanced threat signal generation capabilities to support F-35 and other aircraft platform testing.  AWTEC procured free space carts and continued development and integration of a follow-on Advanced Radar Environment Simulation (ARES) build.  The National Radar Cross Section (RCS) Test Facility (NRTF) completed development and procurement of the Radar VHF\/UHF Measurement System (RVUMS) Antenna Feed Horn system; initiated development and procurement of a new digital receiver system; procured and implemented a high-power transmitter system; and completed design and construction of a new paint booth facility.  NRTF also continued upgrades of the machine\/supply shops facilities, and initiated modularity studies to improve system efficiency and accuracy studies to improve system sensitivity and resolution."

Annually, the MAJCOM commanders establish a list of their top 20 requirements. The MAJCOMs' requirements lists are integrated and prioritized into a classified Air Force requirement list.  Each MAJCOM then approves the FMA Top 20 List and final validation comes from the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff.  System analyses are based on and driven by acquisitions.  The USAF provides assessments and data for threat systems to all DoD components."
