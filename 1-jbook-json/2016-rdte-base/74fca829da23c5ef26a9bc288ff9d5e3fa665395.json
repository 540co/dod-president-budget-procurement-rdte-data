As such, USASMDC\/ARSTRAT is responsible to develop warfighting concepts, conduct warfighting experiments to validate those concepts, identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership & Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions to realize those space related capabilities.  Army Regulation (AR) 10-87 Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and the Direct Reporting Units, dated 4 September 2007 and AR 5-22 The Army Force Modernization Proponent System dated 19 August 2009 designates USASMDC\/ARSTRAT as the Army Force Modernization proponent for Space and High Altitude Capabilities.\n\nProject 990 funds USASMDC\/ARSTRAT to integrate warfighting concepts and technologies, validate concepts, and identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop DOTMLPF solutions to realize those space and high altitude related capabilities. Provide engineering support to the Joint Friendly Force Tracking (J-FFT) Mission Management Center (MMC) through an associated test-bed for both operational and developmental injection and integration of real-time J-FFT information into the Common Operating Picture (COP) for Combatant Commanders, Joint Task Forces (JTFs), and Coalition Partners.  The MMC injects real-time J-FFT information into the Common Operating Picture for COCOMs, JTFs and Coalition partners.  USSTRATCOM, in accordance with CJCSI 3910.01 (reference V.4.) is designated one of three coordinating agencies for J-FFT within DoD.  CJCSI 3910.01 directs eight Force Modernization tasks to USSTRATCOM.  USSTRATCOM SI 534-5 (reference V.6.) and annually published USSTRATCOM operations orders have designated USASMDC\/ARSTRAT as the lead USSTRATCOM component command for Friendly Force Tracking (FFT).\n\nProject EB7 funds classified research efforts.

Continued efforts to enhance the resiliency and effectiveness of critical space-based assets.  These efforts were documented in our FY14 task to develop the Space superiority Capability Development Document, requirements development for JTAGS P3I\/Overhead Persistent Infrared; JCIDS requirements for defensive space control and support transition of RED DOT to an Army program of record.  Other planned activities included: participation in OSD Space Experiment Review Board to prioritize Space Test Program launch opportunities and the \"Army - Air Force Integration Forum 20\"; Lead Space Capability Based Analysis on behalf of TRADOC; Participation in USAF Schriever Wargame 2014 focused on deployment in an Anti-Access \/ Area Denial environment.  SMDC\/ARSTRAT led Army Space 2020 & Beyond wargame seminar as part of Unified Quest 2014 and provided a subject matter expert to NASA's Phantom Eye high altitude \/ long endurance demonstrator program.  Experimented with Global Visual Information System (GVIS), when it was integrated into Stryker vehicles and dismounted, at AEWE Spiral 1, and AFRICOM, USAF and Marine Expeditionary Force experiments. USASMDC\/ARSTRAT participated in Integrated Distributed Operations in Major Combat Operations SIMEX, hosted by the Fires Battlelab and took Winch Assisted Space Platform prototype to Network Integration Experiment 14.2.  SMDC\/ARSTRAT transitioned Combat SkySat to 7th Special Forces Group and continued efforts developing Weather Rock (WxRock) with US Army AFRICOM."

This is necessary to ensure that space, high altitude and cyber capability gaps are identified and capabilities are correctly represented so that the Army's use of these capabilities is explored and where possible, exploited.  Will develop and maintain One Semi-Automated Force (OneSAF) simulation space updates and provide to PEO STRI to be included in OneSAF baseline.  Will develop space modernization strategies and sponsor exploration of future space and high and high altitude warfighting concepts.  USASMDC\/ARSTRAT will continue efforts to enhance the resiliency and effectiveness of critical space-based assets and JCIDS capability development activities for space superiority, high altitude persistent platforms, nano-satellites and tactical launch systems.
