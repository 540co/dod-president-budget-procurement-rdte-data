This project focuses development in wireless transport (e.g. mobile radio based communications systems) to develop new techniques for improving communications in high radio frequency (RF) interference environments such as in the presence of electronic warfare (EW) and to increase the communications capacity of terrestrial and satellite communications (SATCOM) systems. This project also investigates enabling antenna components, materials, designs and configurations to reduce the visual signature of antennas on Soldier, vehicular and airborne platforms and reduce co-site interference on platforms with multiple transceivers such as radios and jammers. Additionally this project investigates cyber security devices, software and techniques to harden wireless communications networks against cyber attacks; and new mobile networking protocols to make wireless, on-the-move (OTM) communications networks more responsive to user needs. This project also investigates network operations software and techniques that improve the ability of the Soldier to manage and maintain complex, dynamic networks; and improved spectrum management software tools to make more efficient use of over-subscribed RF spectrum. This project also provides new technology capabilities to lower the size, weight, power (SWAP) and cost of networking systems deployed on Army platforms through rapid technology improvements in hardware and software convergence.\n\nThis project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."
