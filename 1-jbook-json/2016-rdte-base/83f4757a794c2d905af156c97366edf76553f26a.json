All research areas are subject to long-range planning and technical review by both Air Force and tri-Service scientific planning groups. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research, because this budget activity includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs."

Major thrust areas being investigated in this project are complex electronics and fundamental quantum processes; plasma physics and high energy density non-equilibrium processes; and lasers and optics, electromagnetics, communication, and signal processing. Although the major thrust descriptions that follow are specific sub-areas of focus within this project, there is interest in exploring novel ideas that may bridge these major thrusts as well as those in the other projects within this program."

Major thrust areas being investigated in this project are aero-structure interactions and control; energy, power, and propulsion; and complex materials and structures. Although the major thrust descriptions that follow are specific sub-areas of focus within this project, there is interest in exploring novel ideas that may bridge these major thrusts as well as those in the other projects within this program."

Major thrust areas being investigated in this project are information and complex networks, decision making, dynamical systems, optimization and control, and natural materials and systems. Although the major thrust descriptions that follow are specific sub-areas of focus within this project, there is interest in exploring novel ideas that may bridge these major thrusts as well as those in the other projects within this program."

These professional interactions and collaborations benefit the Air Force by increasing awareness of Air Force basic research priorities in the research community as a whole, and attracting talented scientists and engineers to address Air Force needs. International interactions facilitate future interoperability of coalition systems and foster relationships with future coalition partners. This project also seeks to enhance interactions with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic serving institutions, and other minority institutions."
