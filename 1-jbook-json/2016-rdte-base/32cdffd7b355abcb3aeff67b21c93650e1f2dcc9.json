SCORM is mandated for all Department of Defense (DoD) agencies through DoD Instruction 1322.26.  ADL provides support for users of SCORM, and is also working in collaboration with the Services, other government agencies, industry, and our international partners to develop the next generation training learning architecture (TLA).  The TLA is aimed at modernizing the way we learn by facilitating learning experiences that take advantage of current and emerging technologies based on new specifications and standards built upon web services.  With respect to researching and prototyping new methods of distributed learning, ADL is conducting projects on intelligent tutoring and serious game for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), as well as projects aimed at supporting life-long learning, in the form of a personal assistant for learning (PAL).
