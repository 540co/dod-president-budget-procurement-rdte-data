            "val": "Information Assurance Development supports the implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies into the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specific systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise in as transparent a manner as possible.  This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems. The program assesses, develops and integrates Information Assurance (IA)\/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.\n\nInformation Assurance Development funding supports the technical assessment and specifications documentation of cryptographic, key management and IA capabilities in coordination with the NSA, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and Joint Services, to secure National Security Systems (NSS) and National Security Information (NSI).  Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to develop policies, standards, and fundamental building blocks for Army COMSEC capabilities.  Develop and publish the Cryptographic Modernization strategy to identify, standardize, and govern the insertion of IA capabilities to bridge operational gaps and support the DoD and NSA mandated requirements to enhance network capacity while providing for secure information exchange of voice, video, and data in accordance with the Army Network Campaign Plan.  This will be accomplished by interoperability, standards testing, and IA System of System Network Vulnerability Assessments (IA SoS NVA) of Army Capability Sets for IA\/COMSEC capabilities that provide protections for fixed infrastructure post, camp and station networks. \n\nThe Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities that enable passive and active cyberspace defense operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems.  Big Data Pilot provides an advanced analytics capability capable of ingesting structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from multiple data sources (e.g., Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS), intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, network device log files, trouble tickets, firewalls, proxies, web and applications server log files, etc) and proves situational awareness of cyberspace battlefield.  It provides the computer network defense provider with common analytic platform which informs and reduces risk associated with future material solutions and forms a blueprint for future Big Data Analytics.  Big Data (analysis-of-all DoD Information Network sensor data) provides two optimized and accredited clusters deployed in support of JRSS and Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) with a tools suite accessible to Cyber Mission Forces via secure remote access.  The Army's DCO activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats to and vulnerability of DoD networks and systems. \n\nThe Army Key Management System (AKMS) is the Army's implementation of the NSA Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program automating the functions of COMSEC electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  Supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  The NSA EKMS program is being replaced by the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program.  The AKMS System of Systems (SoS) systems components are the Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Simple Key Loader (SKL).  The transition of the legacy EKMS LCMS to the modern KMI Management Client Nodes (MGC)s began in FY12 and must be completed by the LCMS sunset date of December 2017. AKMS supports the transition to AKMI. \n \nThe Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is the Army's implementation of the NSA KMI ACAT IAM Program.  KMI further automates the functions of COMSEC electronic key management, control, planning and distribution.  AKMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army C4I systems.  KMI provides an integrated, operational environment that brings essential key management functions in-band.  AKMI supports Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives and supports emerging key management requirements.  AKMI achieves an Over the Network Keying (OTNK) solution to support emerging cryptographically modernized systems.  Some components of the AKMS SoS will be replaced under AKMI while others will be modified or adapted to meet the new KMI requirements.  The AKMI SoS includes the MGC Nodes, ACES and the NGLD Family.  \n\nThe Crypto Modernization program supports using NSA developed COMSEC technologies within the Army providing encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise in as transparent a manner as possible.  The Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (CMI) is designed to investigate Courses Of Action (COAs), conduct a Material Solution Analysis (MSA), and execute upgrade activities to ensure all enduring Army communications and data equipment that employs embedded cryptographic hardware will be able to accept and utilize modern cryptographic key."

AKMS supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  The AKMS System of Systems (SoS) systems components are the Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Simple Key Loader (SKL).\n\nThe NSA EKMS program is being replaced by the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program.  The transition of the legacy EKMS LCMS to the modern KMI Management Client Nodes (MGC)s began in FY12 and must be completed by the EKMS Tier 2 sunset date of December 2017.\n\nAKMS supports the transition to Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI).  Some components of the AKMS SoS will be replaced under AKMI while others will be modified or adapted to meet the new AKMI requirements.  Two critical components required for the transition include the development of the Mission Planning Management Support System (MPMSS) and the ability to support Over the Network Keying (OTNK).\n\nMPMSS creates a secure, highly automated interface enabling transparent provisioning of KMI products.  MPMSS capability is developed by NSA but each Service is responsible for interface development and final integration into their infrastructure.  ACES is the initial target for the interface to MPMSS.  NSA will be providing additional capabilities and updates to the MPMSS interface specification through FY17.  The Army must then adjust to these changes delivered by NSA.   \n\nOne major enhancement in the KMI architecture is the ability for OTNK. The end state for the Army is to make all 1.5 million legacy ECUs KMI aware with OTNK.  Within AKMS this capability will be focused on the SKL.  The SKL will act as an interim solution for all legacy ECUs to be recognized on the KMI network until they can be upgraded to be fully KMI aware.  OTNK developments are expected to begin in FY2015 and continue throughout the POM. \n\nTo support this transition, a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine must be developed.  The KOV-21 card used in current Army Tier 3 fill devices has hardware obsolescence issues and does not support OTNK.  Redesigning and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL devices have been initiated.  The redesign of the current KOV-21 card is referred to as the KOV-21 Replacement and is an extension of the KOV-21 card as a technology insertion."

                            "val": "Army Key Management System (AKMS) is an ACAT III Program of Record (POR) under PD Network Enablers (PD Net E).  It is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA)'s Electronic Key Management System (EKMS).  The AKMS allows the Army to manage, control, plan, and distribute electronic key for the 1.5 million End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s necessary to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks. \n\nAKMS was initially approved for Milestone III in FY99.  The AKMS System of Systems originally included Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Data Transfer Device (DTD) (AN-CYZ-10).  In 2QFY02, the PEO C3T Milestone Decision Authority approved the procurement of the Simple Key Loader (SKL) as the replacement for the DTD within the AKMS System of Systems (SoS) POR.  AKMS is a fully fielded POR that undergoes modifications to meet emerging operational needs.\n\nThe NSA EKMS program is being replaced by the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program.  As the DoD Key Management Lead, NSA is dictating the change from EKMS to KMI.  The Army's implementation of the NSA KMI is the Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) program.  Some components of the AKMS SoS will be replaced under AKMI while others will be modified or adapted to meet the new AKMI requirements.  \n\nThe LCMS component of the AKMS SoS (AN\/GYK-49) is fully fielded.  The LCMS is assigned to the COMSEC Account Manager\/COMSEC Custodian.   LCMS most recent hardware refresh was completed in FY12.  The current software baseline is 5.1.0.5 with certain select accounts upgrading to v5.2 based on operational needs.  Further LCMS software releases are not anticipated.  LCMS workstations will be replaced by KMI Management Client (MGC) Nodes before the NSA mandated EKMS Tier 2 sunset of December 2017.  EKMS Common Tier 1 operations and Tier 1 operational support continues to be provided by CECOM.  LCMS hardware is sustained by CSLA until fully replaced by the KMI MGC.\n\nThe ACES component of the AKMS SoS (AN\/GYK-33) current hardware platform is a Dell E6500 non-ruggedized laptop fielded to S6, Spectrum Managers and some COMSEC Account Managers at Battalion level and above.  ACES is undergoing a hardware technology refresh and will be replacing 1\/5 quantity of laptops each year.  The current version of ACES is 3.4.  Software is released on an annual basis and coincides with the Capability Set delivery schedule.  PD Net E currently holds the software development contract.  As the Tier 2.5 component, ACES operates between the LCMS (Tier 2) and the SKL (Tier 3).  It links the key data from the LCMS with mission planning data for a single load by the SKL into the ECUs.  ACES will continue with modifications to support the AKMI System of Systems.  In order to support AKMI, ACES must be modified to seamlessly operate within the KMI architecture.\n\nThe SKL is the primary Army fill device and is the Tier 3 component of the AKMS SoS (AN\/PYQ-10).  The SKL is fully fielded to the Army.  Army holds the sole full rate production procurement contract for the SKL, which is heavily utilized by other DoD and civil services as well as FMS customers.  The SKL repair capability is with the Original Equipment Manufacturer but TYAD is developing an organic depot repair support.  The SKL and its cryptographic engine are facing hardware obsolescence issues. SKL v3.1 in combination with a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine resolves these issues and lays the foundation for the Army's Next Generation Load Device- Medium capability.  The SKL v3.1 modifications will be made to the Army's existing fleet of the fill devices via a modification kit starting in FY15.  The KMI cryptographic engine is reliant on the CERDEC-led RESCUE RDT&E eoffort that began in FY14."

AKMI supports Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives and supports emerging requirements transitioned from the Army Key Management System (AKMS).  KMI automates the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  KMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  \n\nThe AKMI System of Systems (SoS) include the Management Clients (MGC), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family.  KMI provides an integrated, operational environment that brings essential key management personnel and functions in-band.  AKMI achieves an Over the Network Keying (OTNK) solution to support emerging cryptographically modernized systems.\n\nTwo critical components required for the transition of AKMS to AKMI include the development of the Mission Planning Management Support System (MPMSS) and the ability to support OTNK.\n\nMPMSS creates a secure, highly automated interface enabling transparent provisioning of KMI products.  MPMSS capability is developed by NSA but each Service is responsible for interface development and final integration into their infrastructure.  ACES is the initial target for the interface to MPMSS.  \n\nThe developmental efforts for MPMSS are resourced in the 501 project line. \n\nOne major enhancement in the KMI architecture is the ability for OTNK.  The end state for the Army is to make all 1.5 million legacy ECUs KMI aware with OTNK.  The OTNK capabilities within the AKMI SoS will be found in the Next Generation Fill device family as outlined within the NGLD Capabilities Production Document. NGLD will be an enduring solution to bridge the gap until ~1.5 million legacy ECUs can be recognized on the KMI network or until they can be upgraded to be fully KMI aware.  \n\nThe NGLD is reliant on a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine that must be developed.  The KOV-21 card used in current Army Tier 3 fill devices has hardware obsolescence issues and does not support OTNK.  Redesigning and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL devices have been initiated.  The redesign of the current KOV-21 card is referred to as the KOV-21 Replacement and is an extension of the KOV-21 card as a technology insertion."

AKMI is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) ACAT IAM Program of Record.  The AKMI will allow the Army to manage, control, plan, and distribute electronic key for the 1.5 million End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s necessary to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks. \n\nAKMI initial Army Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) was approved 2QFY12.  The AKMI System of Systems (SoS) will include the Management Clients (MGC), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family.  Each component of the AKMI SoS is in a different phase of the acquisition cycle.  \n\nThe NSA KMI Program is replacing the NSA Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program.  As the DoD Key Management Lead, NSA is dictating the change from EKMS to KMI by a sunset date of December 2017.  Components of the AKMI SoS will be retained and adapted from the legacy AKMS program while others will be developed and fielded to meet AKMI requirements.  \n\nThe MGC component of the AKMI SoS (AN\/GYK-72(V)1) is currently being fielded.  The MGC is assigned to the COMSEC Account Manager\/COMSEC Custodian.   MGC low rate initial production began in FY12 and full rate production was achieved in FY13.  The Army has fielded Spiral 1 Spin 1 MGCs to 20 test and pilot accounts.  The remaining Army accounts will be fielded Spiral 2 Spin 1 or Spiral 2 Spin 2 software version before the NSA mandated EKMS Tier 2 sunset of December 2017.  MGC hardware will begin transition to CSLA for sustainment once all accounts are fielded.\n\nThe ACES component of the AKMI SoS (AN\/GYK-33) hardware platform will be a non-ruggedized laptop fielded to S6, Spectrum Managers and some COMSEC Account Managers at Battalion level and above.  ACES will be retained from the legacy AKMS program to support planning requirements and key distribution for KMI.  Software will continued to be released on an annual basis to coincide with the Capability Set delivery schedule.  As the Tier 2.5 component, ACES will operate between the MGC (Tier 2) and the NGLD (Tier 3).  It links the key data from the MGC with mission planning data for a single load by the NGLD into the ECUs.  ACES will require adaptations to meet AKMI requirements and incorporate capabilities provided by the AKMI SoS CONOPS. \n\nThe NGLD family will become the primary Army fill device and Tier 3 component of the AKMI SoS.  The NGLD Capability Production Document (CPD) was signed 4QFY13.  The NGLD CPD calls for a family of 3 devices (small, medium, and large) to meet the AKMI requirements.  The Army is evaluating existing fill devices to determine if they meet the NGLD small requirement.  The Army will gain the NGLD medium capability through the SKL v3.1 in combination with a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine.  The SKL v3.1 will be available in FY15.  The AKMI program is partnering with RDECOM CERDEC to develop a KMI compliant cryptographic engine.  The Army NGLD large strategy is highly reliant on the development of the new KMI compliant cryptographic engine and will drive a final acquisition decision in FY18."

The program assesses, develops and integrates emerging Information Assurance (IA)\/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.\n\nThe Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (CMI) is designed to investigate Courses Of Action (COAs), conduct a Material Solution Analysis (MSA), and execute upgrade activities to ensure all enduring Army communications and data equipment that employs embedded cryptographic hardware will be able to accept and utilize modern cryptographic key."
