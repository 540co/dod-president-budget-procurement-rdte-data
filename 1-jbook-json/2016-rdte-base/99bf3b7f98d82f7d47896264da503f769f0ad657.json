Laser research includes moderate to high power laser devices that are applicable to a wide range of applications, optical technologies to propagate lasers beams from a device, and integration of these technologies.  In SSA, this research uses the Starfire Optical Range and the Maui Space Surveillance System to develop and implement technologies to identify visual characteristics such as status and health of orbiting space objects.  In HPEM, this research examines technologies for applications such as counter-electronics and non-lethal weapons.  Research into other novel DE applications will be conducted.  DE vulnerability\/lethality assessments are conducted and protection technologies are developed.  Research into other advanced non-conventional\/innovative weapons will be conducted.  Tools are developed and used to compare solutions and to determine the most effective and efficient DE technologies to meet Air Force needs.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."
