The ISSP addresses engineering design, development, modeling, simulation, test, and evaluation for the unique cybersecurity challenges associated with dispersed, bandwidth limited, and forward-tactical connected U.S. Navy communications systems.\n \nThis project includes a rapidly evolving design and application engineering effort to modernize cryptographic equipment and ancillaries with state-of-the-art replacements to counter evolving and increasingly sophisticated threats.  Communications Security (COMSEC) and Transmission Security (TRANSEC) evolution are from stand-alone, dedicated devices to embedded modules incorporating National Security Agency (NSA) approved cryptographic engines, loaded with the certified algorithms and key, and interconnected via industry-defined interfaces. This includes the Department of Defense (DoD) Information Networks (DoDIN) capability requirements document for the development of Content Based Encryption (CBE). \n \nIn addition to protecting national security information, the ISSP provides enterprise-wide cyber security for statutorily protected information.  The ISSP must also provide solutions to the most advanced state-sponsored and criminal-intent Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), including those to Platform Information Technology (PIT), weapons systems, Industrial Control Systems (ICS), and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA).\n\nThe ISSP provides dynamic risk-managed cybersecurity solutions to the Navy information infrastructure, not just security devices placed within a network. Extensive effort will be placed on rapidly providing solutions. Few technology areas change as fast as telecommunications and computers; resulting in the need for continuous evaluation, development, and testing of cybersecurity products and cyber defense strategies.

Recognizing the need for future CND capability improvements, CND implements an evolutionary acquisition strategy that delivers CND capabilities in multiple builds and functionality releases that address validated requirements.\n\nNavy Cryptography (Crypto): Modernized crypto devices will replace legacy crypto in accordance with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) mandate (CJCS Instruction 6510) as well as the National Security Agency (NSA) planned decertification, which improves the security of the Navy's data in transit. Strategies followed by other lead agencies include VINSON\/Advanced Narrowband Digital Voice Terminal Crypto Modernization (VACM) and KG-3X which are led by the United States Air Force (USAF).  \n\nKey Management (KM): Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) is a NSA led Joint ACAT I program.  It is the next generation Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) that provides the infrastructure for management, ordering and distribution of key material as well as directly supporting the key requirements of all Crypto modernization efforts.  KMI will follow an increment\/spiral development strategy.  The KMI program will continue to develop alternative architecture implementations for communities within the Navy to implement Intermediary Application (iApp) as a key management solution.\n\nPublic Key Infrastructure (PKI): Department of Defense (DoD) PKI is an ACAT I program led by the NSA and the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) who are the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).  The Navy PKI project supports the DoD-wide implementation of PKI products and services across Navy afloat, non-Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI), and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) networks."

                            "val": "The goal of the Information Assurance (IA) program is to ensure the continued protection of Navy and joint information and information systems from hostile exploitation and attack. ISSP activities address the triad of Defense Information Operations: protection, detection, and reaction. Evolving attack sensing (detection), warning, and response (reaction) responsibilities extend far beyond the traditional ISSP role in protection or Information Systems Security (INFOSEC). Focused on the highly mobile forward deployed subscriber, the Navy's adoption of Network-Centric Warfare (NCW) places demands upon the ISSP, as the number of users expands significantly and the criticality of their use escalates. Today, the ISSP protects an expanding core of services critical to the effective performance of the Navy's mission.\n\nThe rapid rate of change in the underlying commercial and government information infrastructures makes the provision of security an increasingly complex and dynamic problem.  IA technology mix and deployment strategies must evolve quickly to meet rapidly evolving threats and vulnerabilities. No longer can information security be divorced from the information infrastructure. The ISSP enables the Navy's war fighter to trust in the availability, integrity, authentication, privacy, and non-repudiation of information.\n\nThis project includes funds for advanced technology development, test and evaluation of naval information systems security based on leading edge technologies that will improve information assurance (e.g., situational awareness and information infrastructure protection) across all command echelons to tactical units afloat and war fighters ashore.  This effort will provide the research to develop a secure seamless interoperable, common operational environment of networked information systems in the battle space and for monitoring and protecting the information infrastructure from malicious activities. This effort will provide naval forces a secure capability and basis in its achievement of protection from unauthorized access and misuse, and optimized IA resource allocations in the information battle space. This program will also develop core technology to: (1) improve network infrastructure resistance and resiliency to attacks; (2) enable the rapid development and certification of security-aware applications and information technologies in accordance with the Common Criteria for IA and IA-enabled information technology products by the National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Instructions; and (3) measure the effectiveness and efficiency of IA defensive capabilities under naval environments.\n\nThe program will develop common architectural frameworks that facilitate integration of network security capabilities, enable effective seamless interoperation, and contribute to a common consistent picture of the networked environment with respect to information assurance and security. This effort will address the need for a common operational picture for IA, as well as assessment of security technology critical to the success of the mission. This effort will also initiate requirements definition for situational awareness capabilities to support computer network defense in a highly-distributed, homogeneous, and heterogeneous networks including mobile and embedded networked devices. This effort also includes the architectural definition of situational awareness and visualization capabilities to support active computer network defense and support underlying data mining and correlation tools.  This includes addressing the capability to remotely manage and securely control the configurations of network security components to implement changes in real time or near real time. Program will also initiate requirements definition for secure coalition data exchange and interoperation among security levels and classifications, and ensure approaches address various security level technologies as well as emerging architectural methods of providing interoperability across different security levels. Examine multi-level aware applications and technologies including databases, web browsers, routers\/switches, etc. Efforts will also initiate infrastructure protection efforts as the Navy develops network centric architectures and warfare concepts, ensuring an evolutionary development of security architectures and products for IA that addresses Navy infrastructure requirements. IA will ensure the architectures  evolve to provide proper protection as technology, DoD missions, and threats continuously evolve. IA includes defensive protections as well as intrusion monitoring (sensors), warning mechanisms, and response capabilities in the architecture. Ensure the unique security and performance requirements of tactical systems, including those operating various security levels are addressed. Also, the program will initiate the efforts to conceptualize new network centric warfare technology to protect our assets, such as secure network gateways, routers, components and tools that improve the survivability of Navy networks. Last, IA will provide systems security engineering, certification and accreditation support for high-confidence naval information systems and ensure certification and accreditation approaches are consistent with Navy and DoD requirements.\n\nFY16 : Continue development of new network security demands addressing nation-state level sponsored activity. \nIncorporate security services to thwart Denial of Network Service (DNS) attacks, distributed denial of service, botnet and other sophisticated attacks."
