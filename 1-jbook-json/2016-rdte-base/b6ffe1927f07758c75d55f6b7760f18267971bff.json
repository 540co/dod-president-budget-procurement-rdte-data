            "val": "Defense-wide Manufacturing Science and Technology (DMS&T), established within the Manufacturing Technology Program directed in Title 10 USC Section 2521, provides the Department with a comprehensive manufacturing program to achieve the strategic goals of focused technology, improved acquisition across the life cycles, and cost-effective logistics.  By designing for manufacturability early in development, anticipated results will have an impact on increasing reliability and decreasing the life cycle burden of weapon systems. The mission to anticipate and close gaps in defense manufacturing capabilities and drive significant system life cycle affordability benefits makes DMS&T an increasingly important leveraging tool in the current budget environment.\n\t\t\t\nDMS&T will: 1) address manufacturing enterprise game-changing initiatives that are beyond the scope of any one Military Department or Defense Agency or platform and, 2) establish and mature cross-cutting manufacturing processes required for transitioning emerging technologies which impact the time lines, affordability, and productivity of acquisition programs and shorten the deployment cycle times.\n\t\t\t\nThe DMS&T program is fundamental to a coordinated development process.  Concurrent development of manufacturing processes with the S&T development enables the use of emerging technologies.  Key technical areas for investment for DMS&T include Advanced Electronics and Optics Manufacturing, Advanced Materials Manufacturing, and Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing.  Advanced Electronics and Optics addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of applications such as sensors, radars, power generation, switches, and optics for defense applications.  Advanced Materials addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of materials such as composites, metals, ceramics, nanomaterials, metamaterials, and low observables.  Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing addresses advanced manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include the industrial information infrastructure, advanced design\/qualification\/cost tools, supply network integration technologies and management practices, direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, machining; robotics, assembly, and joining.\n\nInstitutes for Manufacturing Innovation program funding is also included in this program element (first addressed in the FY 2015 President\u2019s Budget). Technical innovation and leadership in manufacturing are essential to sustaining the foundations of economic prosperity to enable our military to maintain technological advantage and global dominance. To support these goals, Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation (IMI) will serve as regional hubs to accelerate technological innovation into commercial application and concurrently develop the educational competencies and production processes via shared public-private sectors.  The establishment of the IMIs, supported by resources from multiple U.S. Government agencies, will spur industry cost-share for manufacturing innovation and quickly develop a pathway for technology-focused regional hubs for collaboration among government, industry, and academia that will meet critical government and Warfighter needs. The concept of these institutes is described in the President\u2019s National Science and Technology Council report by the Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office entitled, \u201cNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation: A Preliminary Design,\u201d published in January 2013."

Above-the-shop-floor investments focus on new manufacturing processes that have potential to significantly improve manufacturing efficiencies. Single specific projects address investment opportunities not associated with selected technology initiatives and enable the program to respond to urgent, compelling manufacturing needs and provide seed funding to more high risk-high payoff technologies.\n \t\t\t\nData calls are launched through two methods to identify technology initiatives and single specific issues requiring investment.  One method is through the JDMTP.  The JDMTP is comprised of the ManTech Directors from the Services, Defense Logistics Agency, and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The call is distributed through the ManTech Directors to the four JDMTP sub panels: Metals Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Composites Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Electronics Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, and Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise Subpanel. Potential candidates are evaluated by the JDMTP based on criteria set forth in the call and announcements, and then down-selected for further development prior to final selection.  The other method is through Broad Agency Announcements to industry.  Priority is given to investments that support affordability and producibility of critical enabling manufacturing technologies that cut across multiple platforms.  Investments also balance defense priorities in specialty materials, electronics, propulsion and power, and manufacturing processes including \"above the shop floor\" (lean and business technologies facilitating interoperable manufacturing).  Final projects are selected by the OSD ManTech Director, considering input from the JDMTP and Director of Manufacturing, and as approved by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (MIBP).  Technology initiatives and projects are executed at the Component level."

Key focus areas include direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, advanced manufacturing enterprise, machining, robotics, assembly, and joining.  Will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations while reducing cost, acquisition time, and risk of major defense acquisition programs.\n\nIt is paramount for the U.S. military to improve its own agility and flexibility. The focus is to find a solution to overcome a burdensome acquisition cycle requiring a great amount of cost, time, security, and storage space. Through the use of secure satellite data links or a local parts database, warfighters can access CAD designs for replacement parts, allowing them to repair equipment without the need to establish supply chains or wait for shipments. It allows operators to modify a part's design based on its performance in the field.\n\nEmerging manufacturing technologies undergoing development include:  a large-scale challenge for advanced, interoperable machine tool applications, and methods for exchange of 3D official technical data throughout the supply chain and between the Government and contractors.\n\nField Assisted Sintering Technology (FAST) (FY 2014): Replace comparatively slow, expensive sintering process with the capability to produce fine grained, fully dense materials that are not possible and\/or cost-prohibitive with conventional sintering processes (days to minutes). FAST will significantly reduce cycle time for armor materials over 60%, and the near-net-shaped nature of FAST can reduce machining costs by 90% (and overall item cost by more than 20%).  Applications: EAPS, JAGM(Army), Small Diameter Bomb (Air Force), Next Generation Warheads, ceramic body and vehicle armor, tungsten kinetic energy penetrators, IR windows, heat sinks for electromagnetic propulsion cooling, insensitive munitions UHTC, height temp leading edge.\n\nMTConnect Challenge Phase I (FY 2014): MTConnect is a manufacturing industry standard to facilitate the organized retrieval of process information from numerically controlled machine tools.  This project continues the development and implementation of production interactive solutions to contribute to reduced cycle time throughout the factory; production metrics presented in real time using adaptable dashboards; enable real-time actions and decisions based on real time facts and data; correlate planned operations and processing with actual events for enhanced efficiency in the future; develop knowledge-based correlation of processing events with part quality to improve efficiency and reduce rework. Applications span the broad US Industrial Base.\n\nMTConnect Challenge - Phase II (FY 2015\/2016): Development and implementation of production interactive solutions based on the expansion of MTConnect Challenge will contribute to reduced cycle times and the development of real-time production metrics for adaptable dashboard applications. Applications span academia\u2019s role and the broad US Industrial Base.\n\nHigh Power Ultrasonic Assisted Drilling (FY 2015): This project is jointly resourced with FY 2014 Industrial Base Innovation Fund resources.  Addresses the problem of high costs of drilling various alloys of significant strength, High KSI Steels, IN625, and Composites by developing ultrasonic technology for hole drilling applications to improve productivity and tool life by more than 50%. Potentially impacts all systems that require drilling of holes.\n\nFramework for Assessing Cost and Technology (FACT) (FY 2014-2016): Reduce the system engineering development time by 50% compared to traditional trade off studies, and reduce the cost of manufacturing by 10%-15%. Create M777 stabilizer arm performance\/production models and federate through FACT architecture. Conduct tradeoff analysis between casting and TIG\/MIG welding with delivery of prototype hardware. Expected result: lead time reductions from 12-18 months to 90 days; component cost for the M777 will be reduced by 15%; additional critical M777 and mortar system parts identified. Applications include DoD Systems - Developmental, Block Upgrade, and Legacy Systems.\n\nCyber Security for the Shop Floor \u2013 Phase II (FY 2016): Phase I was initiated using FY 2014 IBIF resources.  Develop a Trusted and Assured supply chain, identify threat vulnerabilities of industrial control systems, provide input to DoD policies, and shape follow-on investment to mitigate threat vulnerabilities. Applications span the US Defense Industrial Base."

                            "val": "Technological innovation and leadership in manufacturing are essential to sustaining the foundations of economic prosperity to enable our military to maintain technological advantage and global dominance. To support these goals, Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation (IMIs), each led by non-profit 501(c) entities, will serve as regional hubs to accelerate technological innovation into commercial applications and concurrently develop the educational competencies and production processes via shared public-private sectors.  Collaborative execution and funding by the Departments of Defense (DoD), Energy (DOE), and Commerce (DoC), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support the establishment of these IMIs will spur industry cost-share for manufacturing innovation and quickly develop a pathway for technology-focused regional hubs for collaboration among government, industry, and academia that will meet critical government and Warfighter needs. The concept of these institutes is described in the President\u2019s National Science and Technology Council report by the Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office entitled, \u201cNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation: A Preliminary Design,\u201d published in January 2013.\n\nEach of the six DoD-led IMIs addressed in this budget is expected to be self-sustaining, without reliance on federal sustainment funding, by the end of the cooperative agreement (CA) period between the federal government and the non-profit-led consortium.  This CA period is typically for five years, with the option to extend the agreement up to two years for the benefit of DoD projects, technical achievement, etc., to fully leverage the minimum 1:1 cost share.  All subsequent (post-CA) federal funding provided to any IMI will be on a specific project basis by the requirements generators, either within or external to DoD.\n\nEach of the six DoD-led IMIs is intended to: \n1) Bring together industry, universities and community colleges, federal agencies, and state and local governments and organizations to create regionally-based but nationally-impactful public-private partnerships underpinning the formation of sustainable manufacturing innovation ecosystems\n2) Accelerate innovation to bridge the gap between Research and Development (R&D) and deployment of technological innovations in domestic production of goods\n3) Invest in industrially relevant manufacturing technologies with broad applications, accelerating innovation within DoD and across all manufacturing sectors to increase U.S. competitiveness\n4) Provide shared assets to help companies access cutting-edge capabilities and equipment \n5) Create an unparalleled environment to educate and train students and workers in advanced manufacturing skills\n6) Focus on maturing the associated manufacturing technologies from Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 4 to 7\n\nThe first and second year of each of these new non-profit business entities is devoted to creating a sustainable business model, with follow-on refinement through the final year, including: growing the membership of each Institute as appropriate; initiating revenue streams (e.g., membership fees, training and workforce development, certification and licensing, etc.); establishing provisional Executive Board and Technical Advisory committees to execute the business of each institute; finalizing Intellectual Property plans; developing technology roadmaps to inform investment strategies; opening industrial commons to provide for shared resource facilities available to all institute members; initiating workforce training programs in each technology area; establishing complementary relationships between IMIs; analyzing the U.S. and Global industrial base in partnership with other government agencies to build upon the institute portfolio and address critical requirements; and further developing national technology roadmaps.\n\nEach established Institute for Manufacturing Innovation was selected through a competitive process.  The executing DoD Service published a formal solicitation for proposals for each IMI, describing extensive proposal evaluation criteria. Non-Profit Organizations and Universities were eligible to bid, and each bidder formed a broad consortium of industry and academic partners for its proposal team. The executing DoD Service used a team of government experts to evaluate each proposal against the evaluation criteria and selected a winning consortium."
