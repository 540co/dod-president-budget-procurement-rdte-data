This research focuses on dual band infrared (IR) FPAs necessary to search, identify and track mobile targets in all day\/night visibility and battlefield conditions and to improve standoff detection in ground-to-ground and air-to-ground operations. This project designs, fabricates and validates very large format IR FPAs needed for sensors to simultaneously provide wide area coverage and the high resolution for situational awareness, persistent surveillance and plume\/gunflash detection. In addition this project develops multispectral and hyperspectral algorithms for on-chip hyperspectral functionality, which offer the ability to perform detection, identification and signature identification at extended ranges as well as the ability to detect targets in \"deep hide\". Reducing size, weight and power (SWaP) is a key research objective for all efforts. In FY11 through FY16 the Army investment in advanced IR FPA technologies is augmented to ensure a world-wide technological and competitive IR sensor advantage for the United States. \n\nThis project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Soldier, Ground and Air portfolios.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC)\/Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, VA."
