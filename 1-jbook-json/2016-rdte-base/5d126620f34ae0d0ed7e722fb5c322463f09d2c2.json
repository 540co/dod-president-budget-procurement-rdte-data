            "val": "The Sensor Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability and battle damage assessment.  \n\nThe Surveillance and Countermeasures Technology project will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability, and battle damage assessment.  Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars.  This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner.  This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems.  In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats.\n\nThe Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor processing technologies and systems necessary for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.  The project is primarily driven by four needs:   1) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; 2) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; 3) detecting and identifying objects of interest\/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and 4) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.\n\nThe Exploitation Systems project develops algorithms, software, and information processing systems to extract information from massive intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) datasets.  In particular, it develops new technologies for detection and discrimination of targets from clutter, classification and fingerprinting of high value targets, localization and tracking over wide areas, and threat network identification and analysis."

This program leverages emerging high-sensitivity focal plane array (FPA) and compact, multiband laser systems technology in the near\/mid\/long-wave infrared bands to enable the development of a multi-function optical system.  Technical challenges include the demonstration of inexpensive, multiband, large-format, photon-counting, high-bandwidth receivers and their integration into a multi-optical sensor suite compatible with airborne assets.  The MOS program seeks to advance the state of the art of components and technology to support an all-optical airborne system that can detect, geolocate, and identify targets at standoff ranges.

The ANS approach relies on three major technology innovations.  The first is development of a new type of inertial measurement unit (IMU) that requires fewer GPS position fixes.  Using cold atom technology, this IMU exceeds the performance of strategic-grade IMUs, with comparable size, weight, and power (SWaP).  The second innovation uses Signals of Opportunity (SoOp) from a variety of ground-, air-, and space-based sources, as well as natural SoOps to reduce dependency on GPS position fixes.  These will be received on the Services' forthcoming software-defined radios and will use specially tailored algorithms to determine position.  The third technology innovation allows SoOp-based position information to be combined with inertial and other sensors to enable flexible navigation systems that can be reconfigured in the field to support any platform or environment.  This capability will enhance new advanced component technology for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) emerging from other programs in the form of Micro Electro-Mechanical System devices, clocks, and new aiding sensors.  Recent advances in mathematics, data abstraction, and network architectures will build upon these capabilities by enabling \"plug-and-play\" integration of both existing and future navigation components and processing to allow real-time reconfiguration of navigation systems.  If successful, major improvements in navigation accuracy and system cost could also be realized.  Early transition partners would include all Services, with emphasis on platforms and users that must operate in multiple environments, such as Naval forces."

Currently, military sensors are designed and developed with unique, mission-specific hardware and software capability requirements in a single, fully integrated device.  This approach significantly increases both the cost and difficulty of meeting continuously changing requirements and upgrades.  Commercial processes, such as those used in the smart phone industry, create reference designs for common system functions and features to accelerate system development time.  This makes changing requirements and completing upgrades far simpler.  Adopting these commercial processes enables a mission-independent, designed-to-cost \"commercial smart core\" that can be combined with an appliqu\u00e9 of mission-specific hardware to provide low cost, independently upgradable, and previously infeasible sensor system distribution capabilities.  The Smart Munitions effort plans to use ADAPT's sensing, processing, communications, and location capabilities to provide positive identification and man-in-the-loop control of distributed, unattended ground sensor systems.  It also seeks to develop a reference design to demonstrate capability and develop tactics for unattended sensors.  This program will transition to the Services."

Countering radar systems is increasingly challenging as digitally programmed radars exhibit novel behaviors and agile waveform characteristics.  ARC will develop new processing techniques and algorithms that adapt in real-time to generate suitable countermeasures.  Using techniques such as state modeling, machine learning, and system probing, ARC will learn the behavior of the threat system, then choose and implement an appropriate countermeasure strategy.

The program goes beyond landing aids in DVE to address all elements of combat to include landing, takeoff, hover\/taxi, enroute, navigation, lethality, and survivability.  Building on previous RF sensors advancements, the program will seek to eliminate many redundant RF elements of current independently developed situational and combat support systems to provide multifunction capability with flexibility of adding new mission functions.  This will reduce the overall size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) of subsystems and protrusive exterior antennas on military aircraft, enabling greater mission capability with reduced vehicle system integration burden.  The program approach includes; 1) Development of synthetic vision for pilots that fuses sensor data with high-resolution terrain databases, 2) Development of Advanced Rotary Multifunction Sensor (ARMS), utilizing silicon-based tile arrays, for agile electronically scanning technology at low SWAP-C, 3) Implementation of software development kit to re-define modes as required by mission or platform needs; ease of adding new modes via software without hardware modifications.  The program is planned for transition to the Army and Marines."

Under clear conditions, targets are easily identified and engaged quite effectively, but in degraded environments the atmosphere can inhibit traditional optical sensors.

Similarly, rotary\/wing blades in urban operations generate copious amounts of dust that prevent circling assets from supplying cover fire for ground forces.  The Video-rate Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) program seeks to develop a real-time spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging sensor that will provide imagery of a region to allow high-resolution fire direction in conditions where optical sensors do not function.

The program will develop and integrate the necessary component technologies including high-energy pulsed lasers, receiver telescopes that have a field of view and depth of field that obviates the need for steering or focusing the optical system, computational imaging algorithms to improve system resolution, and data exploitation and analysis tools.  Advances in laser systems, digital imagers, and novel image processing algorithms will be leveraged to reduce the overall size, weight, and power (SWaP) of imaging systems to allow for soldier portable and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform integration.

As a corollary to time synchronization, this program will also enable GPS independent positioning to maintain precise time synchronization between collaborating mobile users.  Key attributes of this program are global availability; minimal and low cost infrastructure; anti-jamming capability; and performance equal to or better than GPS through recent advances in cold atom-based clocks and optical time transfer.  Other recent advances show that navigation systems using non-traditional sensors can be rapidly configured to provide accurate positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities.  This program will build on these and other PNT technologies, and extend this level of performance to include the underwater environment in addition to surface, indoor, and airborne environments.  Demonstrations on relevant platforms in relevant environments will be used to validate the technology.

The objective of the ATR Technology program is to develop technologies that reduce operation limitations while also providing significant performance improvements, dramatically reduced development times, and reduced life cycle maintenance costs.  Recent breakthroughs in deep learning, sparse representations, manifold learning, and embedded systems offer promise for dramatic improvements in ATR.  Three core areas the program will focus on are: development of on-line adaptive algorithms that enable performance-driven sensing and ATR; recognition technology that enables rapid incorporation of new targets; and technologies that dramatically reduce required data rates, processing times, and the overall hardware and software footprint of ATR systems.

Key system attributes will: 1) provide high-resolution 3D imaging for enhanced identification and targeting, independent of platform or target motion; 2) produce video frame rates to provide well-focused images even when there is platform or target motion; 3) beam steer with a single transmit\/receive chain to reduce system complexity resulting in lower cost, power, and weight; 4) integrate millimeter-wave (mmW)\/terahertz (THz) electronic component advancements from other DARPA programs for transmit and receive functions.  The completion of this program will result in a more readily available, cost-effective imaging radar technology that will work in concert with a wide area surveillance system to provide target identification at video frame rates in all conditions where existing sensors will not work.

When an unknown or advanced RF threat appears, BLADE networked nodes will dynamically characterize the emitter, synthesize an effective countering technique, and evaluate jamming effectiveness by iteratively probing, learning, and adapting to the threat.  An optimization process will tailor real-time responses to specific threats, producing a countermeasure waveform that maximizes jam effectiveness while minimizing the required jamming resources.

The technical approach emphasizes model-based correlation, adversary behavior modeling, threat network analysis tools, resource management tools, a unified data management and processing environment, novel exploitation algorithms and analysis methodologies, and tools to integrate human and machine processing, including visualization, hypothesis manipulation, on-line learning, and distributed social intelligence.  Insight development activities leverage both virtual and physical test bed environments.  The virtual test bed enables evaluation of alternative sensor mixes and algorithms under extended operating conditions.  The physical test bed enables live testing under realistic operational conditions using current and next generation sensing and processing systems.  Insight technology development is coordinated with the following transition sponsors: Army Program Executive Office - Intelligence, Electronic Warfare & Sensors, United States Army Intelligence Center of Excellence, Project Manager Distributed Common Ground System - Army, the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency, National Air and Space Intelligence Center, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
