Domestically, the capabilities were used by Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency management Agency, state National Guards, and a host of other federal, state, and county emergency managers in the U.S. to better prepare for and respond to disasters. PDC\u2019s application, for instance, was one of the primary tools used by the Hawaii State Governor and The Adjutant General for their decision-making as Hurricane Iselle approached the State in 2014. \nInternationally, the Center supported major partners globally, and in particular those in Southeast Asia and the Americas, regions frequently affected by significant earthquakes, storms, floods, and tsunami threats. In all, PDC\u2019s public applications\u2014providing hazard monitoring, alerting, and related information services\u2014were accessed from at least from 120 countries worldwide, and its mobile (iOS and Android) applications exceeded 1.45 million downloads.\n\nEmphasis areas in FY 2014 included:\n\u2022\tImproved Situational Awareness and Decision Support Applications, including planned release of internet-based DisasterAWARE (1 major, 2 main, and 8 minor releases) and mobile DisasterALERT (2 iOS and Android releases) applications\n\u2022\tExpanded national socio-economic risks and vulnerability assessment, and resilience indicators\n\u2022\tProvided location-based notifications, information, and analytical support to DoD and other HA\/DR stakeholders during at least 30 major disasters or events in the US and around the globe\n\u2022\tSupported 15 exercises in 6 Partner Countries across 3 COCOM AORs\n\u2022\tMaintained and expanded content and capabilities of global information services to increase situational awareness and to address humanitarian relief operational needs\n\u2022\tBuilt capacity in stakeholder agencies through exercise and training, and enhance partnerships with USG agencies, their counterparts in key partner nations, and within I\/NGOs to improve outcomes of HA\/DR and related activities"
