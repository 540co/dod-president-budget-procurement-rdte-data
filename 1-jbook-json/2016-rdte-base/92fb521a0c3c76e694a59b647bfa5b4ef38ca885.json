Funds required to support the management of technology transfer associated with technology demonstrated and validated as part of Army EQT projects are included in this program element.  In addition, support to the Army weapon system acquisition community to address generic pollution prevention related requirements are included under the Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition\/Logistics Program.\n\nThe Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition\/Logistics project includes program management for developing acquisition strategies that both achieve system key performance parameters and sustain the environment without permanent and unacceptable change in the natural environment or human health from system concept refinement through disposal.  It includes systematic consideration of environmental impacts, energy use, natural resources, installation impacts, economics, and quality of life.  It provides support to the system acquisition community, e.g., program and project managers, to integrate environmental quality analyses into the system acquisition process.  The goal is to resolve environmental quality issues related to weapon systems that are identified during design, development, testing, operation, or support to reduce Army environmental liabilities and total ownership costs and includes efforts to eliminate the use of hazardous and ozone-depleting materials from weapon systems and facilities and to ensure the availability of Halon 1301 to support weapon system fire suppression requirements.  \n\nThe Unexploded Ordnance Detection and Clearance project, beginning in FY 2004, is being overseen by the Army.  The project had been overseen by Office of the Secretary of Defense in prior years.  This project funds the Unexploded Ordnance Center of Excellence (UXOCOE) to provide for coordination of unexploded ordnance (UXO) technologies across the Department of Defense.\n\nThe Pollution Prevention Tech Support project funds the management support costs to execute the Toxic Metals Reduction and Airborne Lead Reduction environmental quality technology programs."

The focus of ESAL is on improving readiness, improving acquisition processes, reducing supportability burden, and minimizing total ownership cost.  The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment [ASA(IE&E)] has defined the functions of the ESAL project in coordination with the Army Acquisition Executive and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology).  This project provides direct support to the Army acquisition community to pursue environmental sustainability and comply with legal statutes, policies and regulations during the life cycle of Army materiel.  ESAL helps the Army achieve compliance with its weapon systems, industrial base, field and deployed activities directed by international treaties, Federal statutes, Executive Orders, Department of Defense (DoD) and Army policies and regulations."

This project provides for management of RDTE activities conducted under project 0603779A, Environmental Quality Technology Dem\/Val (E21).  The project expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by supporting the demonstration of new materials and processes to fulfill the performance requirements outlined in Material Specifications, Depot Maintenance Work Requirements, Technical Manuals, Drawings and other technical data."
