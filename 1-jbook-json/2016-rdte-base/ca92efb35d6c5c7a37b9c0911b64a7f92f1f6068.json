            "val": "ER2 - This program includes development efforts to upgrade Close Combat technologies, energetics, and munitions, such as counter explosives, grenades, demolitions, shoulder launched munitions, pyrotechnic simulators, non-lethal ammunition\/systems, networked munitions and mines, that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production.  This program will identify, characterize, study, analyze, test and develop technologies to resolve close combat munition reliability, safety, environmental, storage, standardization, obsolescence and manufacturing\/producibility issues.\n\nER5 - Indirect Fire and Fuze Technology: This program will identify, study, analyze and support enhanced lethality, range extension and standardization to improve target engagement effectiveness; increase reliability, safety, and exportability of indirect fires weapons and munitions; and reduce taxpayer costs including elimination of sole source supply of indirect fires ammunition materials as well as studies and analyses of such technology solutions in comparison to current stock pile indirect fire conventional weapons and munitions and their associated production and life cycle support processes. Additionally, environmental impacts of legacy propellants, explosives and metal parts will be studied. Replacement of hazardous materials such as Ammonium Perchlorate, Diphenylamine, Lead, etc. and addition of propellant anti-tubewear additives will remain a focus. This program supports the standardization and interoperability of legacy and new production weapons and ammunition to maximize battlefield interchangeability\/compatibility between domestic US and Allied Nations under the auspices of the international Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU).  Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will potentially increase FMS sales of US products to maintain domestic production and economies of scale.\n\nThis program also supports the identification, study, analysis and development of fuzing technologies and safe and arm devices in production and in the field. This program will implement these technologies into fuzing systems to preclude obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions. The program addresses two major areas: (1) analysis and (2) block upgrades. Analysis efforts will identify second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce cost by providing competition, and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available. It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect and identify latent defects. The second major area is block upgrades, which will identify and perform studies on improvements to fuzes; increase commonality of fuze components and requirements. Block upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuzing design current to avoid obsolescence issues, and add capabilities.\n\n\nER6 - Direct Fire Technology and NATO Ammo Eval: This program funding will be used to support direct fire ammunition from small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade, medium caliber cannon ammunition and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy and general product improvements. In addition, this program assures complete interchangeability of direct fire ammunition and weapons among all the NATO countries with all of the associated logistic, strategic and tactical advantages of the alliance. Project involves development and testing compliance of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGS) and staffing of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC). FY 2016 funds will be used for a more lethal and safer design for 40mm grenades that will be built and tested. An improved 30mm training round for the Apache helicopter will allow pilots to see where the rounds strike. Warhead improvements for the 30mm Apache ammunition are also under development. A number of studies on potential improvements for training ammunition and better primers will be conducted."

Indirect Fire Weapons and Munitions Product Improvement Programs include enhanced lethality, range extension,  improved target engagement; increased reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety; standardization and interoperability with weapons and munitions of Allied Nations; defense exportability features under the auspices of Better Buying Power; reduced taxpayer life-cycle costs; reduction of failure mechanisms and supply chain risk through introduction of new and alternative technology and material solutions; materiel and technology obsolescence mitigation; improvement of manufacturing methods and their associated production and life cycle support processes; new capabilities in response the evolving and emerging threats and countermeasures; and reduction\/elimination of potential environmental and health risks associated with these products and their underlying components, materials, and production processes.   \n\nThis program supports the standardization and interoperability of legacy and new production U.S. weapons and ammunition with Allied Nations to maximize battlefield interchangeability\/compatibility under the auspices of the international Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU).  Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will also potentially increase Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of U.S. indirect fire Weapon and Munition products to maintain critical mass domestic production and affordable taxpayer costs through increased economies of scale.\n\nThis program also supports the identification, study, analysis and development of fuzing technologies and safe and arm devices in production and in the field. This program will implement these technologies into fuzing systems to preclude obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions. The program addresses two major areas: (1) analysis and (2) block upgrades. Analysis efforts will identify second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce cost by providing competition, and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available. It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect and identify latent defects. The second major area is block upgrades, which will identify and perform studies on improvements to fuzes; increase commonality of fuze components and requirements. Block upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuzing design current to avoid obsolescence issues, and add capabilities."

FTI develops second source suppliers and resolve component obsolescence issues to mitigate risk and prevent production interruptions in order to continue to provide safer, more reliable munitions for the Warfighter with significant risk reduction to production fuzes also benefiting the U.S. Taxpayer. FTI will conduct ballistic tests to evaluate proximity sensor improvements that will eliminate the potential of an early M734A1 fuze function due to undesired out-range response and generate the engineering change proposals (ECPs) to incorporate changes into the M734A1 fuze Technical Data Package; will evaluate the omni-directional G-switch performance of the M433 grenade, and evaluate if it will reduce duds, due to improved reliability on soft targets and graze angles. FTI will analyze the design modification to the escapement housing to ensure the M433 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) round and M918 training rounds will decrease the risk of having a defeated safety. FTI will evaluate the design and integration of the Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) G-Switch for setback sensing into the M734A1\/M783 through analysis, bench and sub-scale testing. FTI will conduct tests to evaluate the delay primer improvements and evaluate changes to the explosive content of the delay primer input cup assembly which will reduce the occurrences of instantaneous firings and will subsequently generate an ECP to incorporate into the M734A1 and M783 fuze(TDPs). FTI will evaluate the improvements to the inductive fuze setter and incorporate the changes to the software that will provide cost savings and simplify integration with future weapon platforms."

Project involves development and testing compliance of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGS) and staffing of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC).  \n\nFY 2016 funds will be used for a more lethal and safer design for 40mm grenades that will be built and tested. An improved 30mm training round for the Apache helicopter will allow pilots to see where the rounds strike. Warhead improvements for the 30mm Apache ammunition are also under development. A number of studies on potential improvements for training ammunition and better primers will be conducted."
