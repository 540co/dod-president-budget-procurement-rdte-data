            "val": "This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because it supports the advancement of concepts and technologies to enhance the next generation of tactical systems.  The Tactical Technology program element funds a number of projects in the areas of Naval Warfare, Advanced Land Systems, Advanced Tactical Technology, Aeronautics Technology and Network Centric Enabling Technology.\n\nThe Naval Warfare Technology project develops advanced technologies for application to a broad range of naval requirements.  Enabling and novel technologies include concepts for expanding the envelope of operational naval capabilities such as improved situational awareness over large maritime environments, ship self-defense techniques, novel underwater propulsion modalities, high speed underwater vessels, improved techniques for underwater object detection and discrimination, long endurance unmanned surface vehicles, and high bandwidth communications.\n\nThe Advanced Land Systems project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations.  The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that will enhance the military's effectiveness while decreasing the exposure of U.S. or allied forces to enemy fire.  This project will also explore novel design technologies for the manufacture of ground vehicles and new tools for systems assessments of emerging DARPA technologies.\n\nThe Advanced Tactical Technology project focuses on broad technology areas including: a) compact, efficient, frequency-agile, diode-pumped, solid-state lasers for infrared countermeasures, laser radar, holographic laser sensors, communications, and high-power laser applications; and b) new tactical systems for enhanced air vehicle survivability, precision optics, electronic warfare, and advanced air breathing weapons. \n\nAeronautics Technology efforts will address high payoff opportunities that dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced aeronautical systems and\/or provide revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military mission requirements.  This includes advanced technology studies of revolutionary propulsion and vehicle concepts, sophisticated fabrication methods, and examination of novel materials for aeronautic system applications.\n\nThe Network Centric Enabling Technology project develops network-centric mission applications that integrate information arising from: 1) intelligence networks; 2) open and other external sources; 3) sensors and signal\/image processors; and 4) collection platforms and weapon systems.  Technical challenges include the need to process huge volumes of diverse, incomplete, and uncertain data streams in tactically-relevant timeframes.  The data processing efforts include: conditioning of unstructured data, content analysis, behavioral modeling, pattern-of-life characterization, economic activity analysis, social network analysis, anomaly detection, and visualization.  Operational benefits include deeper understanding of the evolving operational environment tailored to the needs of commanders at every echelon.  Promising technologies are evaluated in the laboratory and demonstrated in the field to facilitate transition."

By establishing the premise that a human is never intended to step on board at any point in the operational cycle, ACTUV concepts can take advantage of an unexplored design space that eliminates or modifies conventional manned ship design constraints in order to achieve disproportionate speed, endurance, and payload fraction.  The resulting unmanned naval vessels must possess sufficient situational awareness and autonomous behavior capability to operate in full compliance with the rules of the road and maritime law to support safe navigation for operational deployments spanning thousands of miles and months of time.  When coupled with innovative sensor technologies, the ACTUV system provides a low cost unmanned system with a fundamentally different operational risk calculus that enables game changing capability to detect and track even the quietest diesel electric submarine threats.  Key technical areas include unmanned naval vessel design methodologies, ship system reliability, high fidelity sensor fusion to provide an accurate world model for autonomous operation, novel application of sensors for ASW tracking, and holistic system integration due to unique optimization opportunities of the ACTUV system."

Building upon and complimenting concepts for maritime situational awareness and ISR developed under the DASH program, budgeted in Project PE 0603766E\/NET-02, the UFP approach centers on pre-deploying deep-ocean nodes years in advance in forward operating areas which can be commanded from standoff to launch to the surface.  \n\nAdvances in miniaturized sensors and processors, growth in the variety of unmanned systems, and advances in autonomy and networking all point toward highly capable, yet affordable, distributed systems.  However, power and logistics to deliver these systems in a timely manner in forward operating areas limit their utility.  The UFP program will remove this barrier to accelerate large-scale unmanned distributed missions.  The presumption is that a wider range of technology options and system solutions will emerge when the barriers to deployment are removed."

The Strategic Mobility program will then shift to a focused technology risk reduction activity designed to systematically address the principal risks for the highest payoff technology set.

This will be accomplished through research and development of novel ground combat and tactical vehicle technology solutions that demonstrate significantly advanced platform mobility, agility, and survivability.  The focus of the GXV program will be on technology development across multiple areas to simultaneously improve military ground vehicle survivability and mobility.  Traditionally, survivability and mobility have to be traded against each other due to the reliance on heavy armor.  The GXV program seeks to break this trend.  Coupled with the development of technologies, the GXV program will define concept vehicles which showcase these developmental technologies.  A modeling and simulation effort will also be undertaken to understand the vehicle design trade space for the concept vehicles using the developmental technologies and to illustrate how these vehicles might be used operationally in combat scenarios.  Technology development areas are likely to include increasing vehicle tactical mobility, survivability through agility, crew augmentation, and signature management, though other relevant technologies may also be pursued."

The concept of overmatch at the squad level includes increased human stand-off, a smaller force density, and adaptive sensing to allow for responses at multiple scales. Squad X will explore advanced wearable force protection, advanced organic squad level direct and indirect trajectory precision weaponry, and non-kinetic precision capabilities.  The end result of the Squad X program is an individual dismount unit outfitted with sensors, weaponry, and supporting technology to achieve one-on-one overmatch as well as the overall integration of unmanned assets alongside the dismounts to create a new Hybrid Squad unit."

The MI mixed teams will be able to execute an expanded mission set from those currently employed.  The MI system concept will allow for a combined set of mounted and dismounted operations and for a larger area of operations over more aggressive timelines than standard infantry units.  To improve operational effectiveness of the warfighter teams when dismounted, the semi-autonomous platforms,  when unmanned, act as multipliers to the squad, such as extended and mobile fire support platforms and allow the MI mixed teams to perform higher risk exposure and access missions. The MI system scale, enabled by smaller off-road platforms, is intended to maintain dismounted warfighter scales for operational deployment.  Platforms are planned for internal transportation within CH-47, CH-53, and V-22 aircraft and are intended to be adaptations of existing\/expected platforms to eliminate the schedule and cost of new platform development."

Such an achievement will represent a significant advance over the state of the art, as existing lasers in this wavelength range are bulky, highly inefficient, and expensive, as there are no available semiconductor lasers that can emit in the UV range <250nm. LUSTER will leverage lessons learned in growing high quality light emitting material from the Compact Mid-Ultraviolet Technology (CMUVT) program.

The program will develop hardware and software to automate select aircrew functions and will employ novel, low impact approaches to interfacing with existing aircraft monitoring and control systems. The program will also develop tractable approaches to rapidly capture crew-station specific skills and aircraft unique behaviors. To accomplish this, ALIAS will leverage recent advances in perception, manipulation, machine learning, reusable software architectures, autonomous systems architecture, and verification and validation.  ALIAS will culminate in a demonstration of the ability to rapidly adapt a single system to multiple aircraft and execute simple missions. This reliability enhancement capability will enable new operational concepts for reuse of existing air assets and allow a reduction in the number of aircrew required."

As was shown by the Nexus 7 experience in Afghanistan, big data presents an opportunity to better understand the true nature of non-traditional threats, track the effectiveness of remedial measures, and develop\/optimize alternative strategies; QMRR extends that work. Recently we have seen the rise of extremely challenging non-traditional threats such as ISIL and Ebola.  In the case of ISIL, in addition to countering their military actions on the battlefield, it is important to limit the effectiveness of their recruitment efforts.  Since ISIL recruiting is largely web-based, this implies the need to monitor ISIL public messaging in social media and private messaging on the dark web.  Ebola presents related, but somewhat different challenges, specifically, finding patterns in the spread of the disease and factors that favor\/mitigate its development.  There is also interest in quantitative methods for countering proliferation of weapons of mass terrorism.  The work conducted under the program will be coordinated with and transitioned to multiple national security agencies."

In the future, the U.S. military will encounter adversary systems that are AI-enabled.  Maintaining \"AI-superiority\" will require AI-enabled systems capable of performing increasingly complex functions with high degrees of reliability and safety.  Significantly, in order for developers and users to feel confident enough to deploy and use AI-enabled systems, these systems must operate with a high degree of transparency.  UMI will develop AI technologies that support transparency by providing supporting rationale and logic sequences to clarify the basis for and reliability of outputs.  In addition, efforts will be made to develop a mathematically rigorous virtual stability theory for AI-enabled systems analogous to the (conventional) stability theory developed for dynamical systems (solutions to systems of differential equations).  Such a virtual stability theory will enable the creation of feedback mechanisms that flag and interrupt anomalous outputs and behaviors.  UMI implementations will be developed and demonstrated in next-generation systems."

Large data stores of enemy photos and video are available but cannot be easily leveraged by a warfighter or analyst attempting to understand a specific new image in a timely fashion.  The VMR program will enable users to gain insights rapidly through application of highly parallelized image analysis techniques that can process the imagery in massive distributed image stores.  VMR technology will serve as a force-multiplier by rapidly and automatically extracting tactically relevant information and alerting the analyst to scenes that warrant the analyst's expert attention."

Social network theory has emerged in recent years as a promising approach for understanding groups of individuals connected through a variety of shared interests and collaborative activities.  For the military, social networks provide a promising model for understanding terrorist cells, insurgent groups, and other stateless actors whose connectedness is established not on the basis of shared geography but rather through the correlation of their participation in coordinated activities such as planning meetings, training\/mission rehearsal sessions, sharing of materiel\/funds transfers, etc.  Nexus 7 supported emerging military missions using both traditional and non-traditional data sources for those areas of the world and mission sets with limited conventional Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.  Examples of additional data sources included foreign news, media, and social network data.  These non-traditional sources were integrated with a wide variety of military structured and unstructured data.  Nexus 7 developed quantitative techniques and tools for processing and analyzing these large data sources as a means for understanding relationships between hostile, neutral, and friendly foreign organizations with the United States."
