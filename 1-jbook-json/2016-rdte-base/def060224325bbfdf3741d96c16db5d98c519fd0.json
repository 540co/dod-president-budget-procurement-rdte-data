            "val": "This program supports the vision of Agile Combat Support (ACS), which is to provide an integrated and interoperable mission-ready total force capable of delivering responsive, persistent, effective, and affordable support across the range of military operations to achieve joint effects. To this end, ACS is challenged to provide lighter, leaner, rapidly-deployable and technologically-advanced materiel and forces; timelier planning and execution capabilities; and more agile, responsive, and efficient sustainment capabilities to the warfighter. Consequently, this program provides capabilities to field, base, protect, support, and sustain air, space, and cyberspace forces with an intentional focus on efficiency and effectiveness. Current projects in this program provide Civil Engineering Readiness (BPAC 652895) and Aeromedical Readiness (BPAC 654910). Civil Engineering Readiness projects enable rapid deployment, defense, and sustainment of airfield operations within established timelines anywhere in the world. Aeromedical Readiness projects provide aerospace medical systems and treatment equipment to meet unique, worldwide warfighter medical operational requirements.   \n\nBA 5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."
