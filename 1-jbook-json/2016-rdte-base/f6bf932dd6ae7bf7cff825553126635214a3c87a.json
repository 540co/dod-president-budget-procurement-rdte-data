In FY 2013-FY 2014, requirements migrated to supporting better buying power, providing an avenue for technology innovation and refresh for legacy defense acquisition programs. \nSome capabilities enabled to date include: 1) the Army Advanced Combat Surveillance Kit, a lightweight, low-power sensor for unattended, localization and tracking of dismounts and vehicles in challenging operational environments;  2) the Navy's Port Security Barrier Intrusion Detection System, which uses an optic-electronic alarm and software system that monitors gates to ensure threats cannot exploit undetected gaps;  3) the Air Force Lightweight Tactical Suitcase Portable Receive Suite, which enables deployed military forces to access global broadcast systems for satellite imagery, weather info, map data, classified and unclassified intelligence; and 4) the US Special Operations Command's Multi-Missile Common Launch Tube, which doubles the number of targets that can be engaged from the same platform, with increased precision that minimizes collateral damage."
