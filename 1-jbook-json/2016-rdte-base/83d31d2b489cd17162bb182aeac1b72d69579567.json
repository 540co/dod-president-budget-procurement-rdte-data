            "val": "To counter the United States\u2019 historic technological advantage, nation-states and terrorists are increasingly developing asymmetric capabilities and systems that are enabled by the significant advances in globally-available commercial electronic components and devices.  These threats range from improvised devices being employed by terrorists that are constructed from commercially available electronic and industrial components to dedicated military systems that could be used in ways that diminish our technological advantage in conflicts with nation-states.  The rate at which these threats are appearing is accelerating and new threats are appearing quicker than traditional Department of Defense (DoD) requirements and acquisition processes can respond. \n\nThe use of asymmetric devices is well understood by both nation-states and terrorists.  Using man portable air defense systems, mortars, and improvised explosive devices employing commercial electronic components, terrorists have attacked both air and ground forces, posing threats in any region due to their easy transportability.  Unmanned aircraft systems employing advanced commercial electronic components are proliferating and pose threats as both military capabilities and as potential weapons delivery mechanisms.  \n\nThe extreme consequences of technological surprise and the accelerating rate of appearance of new threats highlight the need to rapidly develop and field innovative Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations and EW\/Cyber Convergence capabilities that can neutralize threats in fiscally and temporally responsive ways.  We must concurrently develop innovative technologies and approaches that will give us asymmetric advantages over potential adversaries.  \n\nTo proactively address the accelerating threat environment and restore the United States\u2019 technological overmatch capabilities, the Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) program\u2019s overarching philosophy focuses on innovation to accelerate the pace of EW capabilities development.  This program element investigates means to rapidly mitigate new threats by integrating advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in innovative ways and rapidly demonstrate innovative technological capabilities that can be inserted into the Services\u2019 Programs of Record with reduced risk.  JEAT efforts are based on three pillars: 1) Experimentation\/Demonstration, 2) Advanced Technology Development\/Verification, and 3) Innovative Technology Exploration.  \n\nIn FY 2016, two efforts were added by the Department to accelerate the fielding of vitally needed EW warfighting capabilities:  the Advanced EW Technology Maturation Project and the EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation Project.\n\nThe Advanced EW Technology Maturation Project is a one-year effort to demonstrate modular, distributed, configurable EW technologies and systems designs that address requirements identified by the United States Marine Corps (USMC) and U.S. Army.  Additionally, technologies demonstrated in this effort will be transitioned to the USMC to enable an earlier transition of vital warfighting capabilities within the Intrepid Tiger II (IT2) FY 2017 Program of Record.  This effort will specifically mature counter-radar building blocks to provide new, vitally-needed EW capabilities for U.S. Army and USMC air and ground assets while mitigating blue-on-blue and co-site interference impacts. \n\nThe EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation Project is a four-year effort to (1) accelerate the development of innovative countermeasures to new classes of advanced threats that are being developed and fielded by potential adversaries and (2) provide innovative capabilities to counter anti-access\/area denial threats posed by countries possessing modern, advanced integrated air defense systems.  Work area in (1) will enable direct technology transitions to the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy in ongoing Programs of Record.  Research in area (2) will enable earlier fielding, and will explore a variety of non-kinetic technologies, tools and techniques to include converged EW\/Cyber approaches and battle management optimization and visualization technologies.  Five work units are included in this project:  Advanced Airborne Countermeasures Development, Advanced Defensive Countermeasures Development, Non-Kinetic Battle Management and Visualization Technology Development, Advanced EW and EW\/Cyber Exploration and Development, and Ultra Wideband Receiver Development."

This project investigates means to rapidly mitigate new threats by integrating advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in innovative ways and rapidly demonstrate innovative technological capabilities that can be inserted into the Services\u2019 Programs of Record with reduced risk.  Efforts concurrently develop innovative technologies and approaches that will give us asymmetric advantages over potential adversaries.\n\nThree efforts currently comprise this project:  Experimentation\/Demonstration, Advanced Technology Development\/Verification, and Innovative Technology Exploration.  In FY 2015, we are adding a new effort, EW Enterprise Collaboration and Planning, that addresses selection, organization, oversight, and coordination of new and emerging Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) warfare concepts and related efforts within the EW and Countermeasures Office (EW&C) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&E)).  In FY 2016, this area will be expanded to provide analysis and national and international coordination on emerging Information Operations and Electronic Warfare (EW)\/Cyber Convergence topics. \n\nExperimentation\/Demonstration (First effort:  Vigilant Hammer (VH)):\n\nExperimentation\/Demonstration efforts focus on experimenting with and demonstrating technologies and approaches to address compelling issues facing the warfighter. Our first Experimentation\/Demonstration effort, VH, is a recurring multi-year, multi-agency, live, virtual, and constructive field experimentation venue of increasing complexity focused on advancing the state of the art for the detection, classification, geolocation and prosecution of electromagnetic signals of interest using both Department of Defense (DoD) and national resources.  VH is modeled after Joint Electronic Advanced Technology's (JEAT) highly successful BLACK DART, Trident Spectre, and Rotorcraft Aircraft Survivability Equipment Experiment (RASE) venues, and will include both scripted and free play scenarios intended to give participants an opportunity to explore the efficacy of existing and new technological capabilities and approaches to engage emerging EMS threats.  Engagement payloads will be developed and vetted in the Distributed Electronic Effects Development (DEED) laboratory discussed below.  Additional venues that address pressing warfighter concerns like advanced electro-optical threats and millimeter wave threats will be added in future years.\n\nAdvanced Technology Development\/Verification (ATD\/V) (Ongoing effort:  DEED):\n\nATD\/V focuses on research to mature and assess emerging technologies to address compelling EW and converged EW\/Cyber warfighter needs.  Our ongoing ATD\/V effort, DEED, is a laboratory and developmental venue that matures and assesses emerging EW and converged EW\/Cyber technologies to enable, e.g., more effective coordination of sensor and electronic attack capabilities to deliver multi-point, collaborative EW and cyber capabilities to warfighters.  DEED specifically seeks to identify and pair synergistic technologies to develop systems with capabilities that are greater than the sum of the individual parts.\n\nInnovative Technology Exploration (Ongoing effort: Adaptive\/Asymmetric Technology (A\/AT)):\n\nInnovative Technology Exploration encompasses a wide variety of efforts focusing on analyses and studies of emerging asymmetric threats for the Director, EW&C.  Past work includes the Aircraft Survivability Equipment Joint Analysis Team, the Helicopter Survivability Task Force, and advanced analytic studies of the link budget associated with addressing highly advanced, agile threats.  Our ongoing effort in this area, A\/AT, produces studies that are strongly supported by the Services and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and past studies have resulted in significant technology investments by DoD.  \n\nEW Enterprise Collaboration and Planning (EW C&P):\n\nEW C&P supports the activities of the Director, EW&C related to the selection, organization, oversight, and coordination of new and emerging EMS warfare concepts and related efforts.  It includes efforts related to the identification, assessment, formulation of recommendations to address EW-related threat trends impacting sensor, seeker, communications and battle management technologies and countermeasures for these threats; programmatic and budget review and recommendations; and decision support to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD(AT&L)) on selected programs of record including Critical Program Information standards, Foreign Disclosure advice, and Technical Signals Requirements.  This effort further solicits  and provides advisory information between OSD and the Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, Service sponsors and Research Engineers including oversight of an extensive variety of EW-related Research and Development (R&D) activities within the department and world-wide.  EW C&P efforts support all three JEAT pillars."
