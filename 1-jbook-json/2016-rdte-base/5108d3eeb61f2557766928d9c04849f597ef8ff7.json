            "val": "This program element (PE) supports application of knowledge gained through basic research to refine drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, medical practices\/procedures, and other preventive measures essential to the protection and sustainment of Warfighter health. Research is conducted in five principal areas: Combat Casualty Care; Military Operational Medicine; Military Relevant Infectious Diseases Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine; and Systems Biology\/Network Sciences. Research is funded in six projects.  \n\nProject 869 refines knowledge and technologies on screening tools and preventive measures for post-traumatic stress disorder and mild traumatic brain injuries, physiological monitors, and interventions to protect Warfighter's from injuries resulting from operational stress, and exposure to hazardous environments and materials.  Also conducts research on medically valid testing devices (i.e. the test mannequins that are true to the human form and physiologically and anatomically accurate) and predictive models used for the refinement of Warfighter protective equipment. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.  \n\nProject 870 designs and refines medical diagnostic assays\/tests, drugs, and vaccines for protection from and treatment of naturally occurring diseases, wound infections of military importance, as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.  \n\nProject 874 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics (products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and diagnostics for field trauma care systems, resuscitation, life support, and post-evacuation restorative and rehabilitative care. Focus is identifying more effective critical care technologies and protocols to treat severe bleeding, traumatic brain injury and other blast related injuries, and treatments for ocular (eye) injury and visual system dysfunction.  Additional focus areas are laboratory and animal studies of regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, and bone tissue for the care and treatment of combat trauma casualties. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. \n\nProject FH2 conducts applied research focused on sustainment of a healthy Warfighters throughout the entire deployment life cycle.\n\nProject VB4 includes applied research in systems biology of military-relevant diseases such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), coagulopathy (blood clotting disorders), suicide, and chronic pain. Another focus is environmental exposure toxicology (study of the biology of harm from toxic substances in the environment). The goals are to understand mechanisms (processes and pathways), develop molecular and physiological markers (biological molecules as indicators of the body's functions such as immune response) for future diagnostic systems, and identify therapeutic interventions supporting early decisions for therapeutic strategies. The core capability is a data system that integrates iterative (successively building upon data and results) biological tests, computer simulations, and animal studies, providing powerful analyses in support of research across United States Army Medical Research & Materiel Command. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nAll medical applied research is conducted in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA requires thorough testing in animals (preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon transition to 6.3 Advanced Technology Development). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and laboratory test refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves testing in animal models. The EPA also requires thorough testing of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for use.\n\nProgram refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses (DoD) biomedical research and refinement community, as well as their associated enabling research areas.\n\nWork funded in this project PE is fully coordinated with efforts undertaken in PE 0603002A and the Defense Health Program.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD and its overseas laboratories; U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM), Fort Detrick, MD; U.S. Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA; the U.S. Army Dental Trauma Research Detachment and the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR), Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, TX; U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), Fort Rucker, AL; and the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD."

                            "val": "This project conducts applied research for medical countermeasures to naturally occurring infectious diseases that pose a significant threat to the operational effectiveness of forces deployed outside the United States. Effective preventive countermeasures (protective\/therapeutic drugs and vaccines and insect repellents and traps) protect the Force from disease and sustain operations by avoiding the need for evacuations from the theater of operations. Diseases of military importance are malaria, bacterial diarrhea, and viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever and hantavirus). In addition to countermeasures, this project funds refinement of improved diagnostic tools to facilitate early identification of infectious disease threats in an operational environment, informing Commanders of the need to institute preventive actions and improve medical care. Major goals are to integrate genomics (DNA-based) and proteomics (protein-based) as well as other new biotechnologies into the refinement of new concepts for new vaccine, drug, and diagnostics candidates.\n\nResearch conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas:\n\n(1) Drugs to Prevent\/Treat Parasitic (organisms living in or on another organisms) Diseases\n(2) Vaccines for Prevention of Malaria\n(3) Diagnostics and Disease Transmission Control\n(4) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)\n(5) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)\n\nFor the refinement of drugs and biological products, studies in the laboratory and in animal models provide a proof-of-concept for these candidate products, including safety, toxicity (degree to which a substance can damage an organism), and effectiveness, and are necessary to provide evidence to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to justify approval for a product to enter into future human subject testing. Additional non-clinical studies are often needed in applied research even after candidate products enter into human testing during advanced technology development, usually at the direction of the FDA, to assess potential safety issues. Drug and vaccine refinement bears high technical risk. Of those candidates identified as promising in initial screens, the vast majority are eliminated after additional safety, toxicity, and\/or effectiveness testing. Similarly, vaccine candidates have a high failure rate, because animal testing may not be a good predictor of human response, and therefore candidate technologies\/products are often eliminated after going into human trials. Because of this high failure rate, a continuing effort to identify other potential candidates to sustain a working pipeline of countermeasures is critical for replacing those products that fail in testing.  \n\nWork is managed by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.   \n\nPromising medical countermeasures identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project 810.\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.   \n \nWork in this project is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories; the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID), Fort Detrick, MD; and the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories."

This is follow-on research that extends and applies findings from over a decade of research on Gulf War Illnesses and other chronic multi-symptom illnesses that have suspected nerve and behavioral alterations caused by environmental contaminants and deployment stressors. Key databases include the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow us to evaluate interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.\n\nForce Health Protection applied research is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services working on Army projects.\n\nResearch conducted in this project focuses on the following three areas:\n(1) Millennium Cohort Research\n(2) Biomarkers of Exposure and Environmental Biomonitoring\n(3) Physiological Response and Blast and Blunt Trauma Models of Thoracic (Chest) and Pulmonary (Lung) Injuries\n \nPromising efforts identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project FH4.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.    \n \nWork in this project is performed by the U.S. Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, CA; and the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA. \n\nEfforts in this project support the Soldier Portfolio and the principal area of Combat Casualty Care."
