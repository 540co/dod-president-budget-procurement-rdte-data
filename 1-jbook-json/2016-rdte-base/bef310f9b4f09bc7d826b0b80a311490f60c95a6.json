However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it critical to improve the cyber security of DoD networks to counter those threats and assure our missions.  This program focuses on innovative and sustained advanced development in both cyber security and computer network operations to mature new concepts to harden key network and computer components to include: designing new resilient cyber infrastructures; increasing the military\u2019s ability to fight and survive during cyber attacks; disrupting nation-state level attack planning and execution; measuring the state of cyber security for the U.S. government; increasing our understanding of cyber as a war-fighting domain; and providing modeling and simulation of cyberspace operations to explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance, and protection of tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.\n \nThe Cyber Advanced Technology Development program element (PE) was budgeted in the advanced technology development budget activity because it focused on the maturation of successful applied research results, and their development, into demonstrable advanced cyber security capabilities.  The Cyber Advanced Technology Development program built upon the results of matured applied research from the Cyber Applied Research PE (0602668D8Z), and other programs, to develop technology demonstrations for potential transition into capabilities that support the full spectrum of computer network operations.  These approaches included moving from cyber defense to cyber resilience by changing the defensive terrain of our existing digital infrastructure, identifying ways to raise the risk and lower the value of an attack from an advanced persistent cyber threat, and focusing on mission assurance metrics. \n \nThe program focused on science & technology (S&T) to address joint problems in cyber defense and operations.  The focus of the research was on filling capability and technology gaps identified in the Cyber Community of Interest S&T Roadmap, the 2013 Cyber S&T Capability Gap Framework and other assessments conducted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&E))."

Cyber Mission Control covers the ability to orchestrate cyber systems to achieve an overarching mission goal.  To perform dynamic analysis of asset criticality and course of action analysis alternatives, there is a critical need for tools that can map information technology assets to missions and use modeling and simulation, or other techniques.  Inherent in Cyber Mission Control is the ability to automatically derive and fuse information about the characteristics of information technology systems in a manner that allows us to describe, analyze, observe, and control the operation of information technology components.  A key goal of this research area is to have tools that enable commanders to assess and direct different information technology maneuvers in conjunction with mission actions.

There are two technical challenges associated with cyber modeling, simulation, and experimentation: 1) Cyber Modeling and Simulation and 2) Cyber Measurement.  Cyber Modeling and Simulation seeks to develop tools and techniques that enable analytical modeling and multi-scale simulation of complex cyber systems.  Cyber Measurement develops cyber experimentation and test range technology to conduct controlled, repeatable experiments, providing the ability to track the progress of cyber research investments in a quantitative fashion.  This area will explore new analytical methodologies, models, and experimental data sets to establish metrics to measure a system\u2019s state of security, apply the scientific method to establish the foundations of a framework in which cyber security research can be conducted, to test hypotheses with measurable and repeatable results, and the quantitative experimentation and assessment for new cyber technologies.  These new methodologies will enable the exploration of modeling and simulation tools and techniques that can drive innovation in research. Additionally, these methodologies will aid in integrated experimentation by simulating the cyber environment with sufficient fidelity and integrating cyber modeling and simulation with the traditional modeling and simulation related to the kinetic domain."

The objective in the area of embedded and tactical systems is to develop tools and techniques that assure the secure operation of microprocessors within our weapons platforms and systems; enable security in real-time systems; and establish security in disadvantaged, intermittent, and low-bandwidth environments.  This research also seeks to expand and cultivate military-grade techniques for securing and operating with enterprise-style commodity mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and their associated infrastructures.  With the constant evolution of these devices and their respective infrastructures it is of the utmost importance to provide a secure environment where these devices can be effectively utilized, monitored and tracked."
