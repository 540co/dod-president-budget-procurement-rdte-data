            "val": "Project 038 Avenger Product Improvement Program (PIP):  The Avenger Air Defense System is a lightweight, highly mobile surface-to-air missile and gun weapon system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).  The system employs a canopied turret consisting of a gunner position, two gyro-stabilized missile launcher pods containing four STINGER missiles each, a Forward Looking Infrared Receiver (FLIR), a Laser Range Finder (LRF), an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, and a very high rate of fire .50 caliber machine gun.  The gun system is used against ground targets and to cover the Stinger missile dead-zone.  Avenger is capable of day, night and adverse weather operations; can be transported by UH-60L Blackhawk helicopter or C-130 aircraft; is air-droppable and can shoot on the move.  The system can also be operated by remote control from a protected position up to 50 meters away from the fire unit.  \n\nThe Avenger system is operated by a two-man crew to counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs), cruise missiles, attack helicopters, and high performance fixed wing\/rotary wing aircraft. The system fills the line-of-sight rear component of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) system.\n\nThese funds are provided for the Avenger PIP to modify the Avenger to ensure viability and sustainability through the end of the useful life. Avenger will remain in the force through the Fiscal Year (FY) 30 timeframe according to the Long Range Investments Requirements Analysis. Avenger fills a capability gap which will be permanently filled by the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 Intercept (IFPC2-I) which will be fully fielded in FY30. The Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC) will undergo software and hardware upgrades that will enable the system to handle increased targeting capability realized with the latest version of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) early warning system and ensures the system meets the latest Information Assurance (IA) requirements, upgraded analog to digital vehicle intercommunication system and Mode 5 cooperative target identification functions. \n\nProject DT5 Stinger Product Improvement: The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system.  Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low-altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM).  Stinger employs an infrared (heat seeking)\/ultraviolet seeker to guide to the target.  Stinger Block I has extensive infrared counter-countermeasure capabilities and can engage targets from any aspect to include head-on.  The missile utilizes a high-explosive, hit-to-kill warhead.  Stinger can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles, helicopters and UAS.  The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.  \n\nThe Stinger Product Improvement provides design, development, test and integration of a Proximity Fuze into the existing Stinger Block I missiles. The Proximity Fuze will improve system effectiveness against the evolving UAS threat. Unmanned Aerial System Defense (UAS-D) is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3\/5\/7, Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO-CIC) in memo dated 28 May 2013."

Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low-altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM).  Stinger employs an infrared (heat seeking)\/ultraviolet seeker to guide to the target.  Stinger Block I has extensive infrared counter-countermeasure capabilities and can engage targets from any aspect to include head-on.  The missile utilizes a high-explosive, hit-to-kill warhead.  Stinger can be fired from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles, helicopters and UAS.  The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.  \n\nThe Stinger Product Improvement provides design, development, test and integration of a Proximity Fuze into the existing Stinger Block I missiles. The Proximity Fuze will improve system effectiveness against the evolving UAS threat. Unmanned Aerial System Defense (UAS-D) is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3\/5\/7, Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO-CIC) in memo dated 28 May 2013."
