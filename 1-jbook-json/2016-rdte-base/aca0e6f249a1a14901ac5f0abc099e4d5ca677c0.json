FCT also enables more effective competition between U.S. and foreign technologies.\n\nIn FY 2015, FCT funding from PE 0605130D8Z was realigned to PE 0603133D8Z for Budget Activity alignment and emphasis on prototyping."

The original version used a thin steel barrel liner containing the rifling, strengthened with a carbon fiber outer sleeve.  External steel parts were eventually replaced with aluminum alloys or plastics thereby reducing the weapon weight from 36 pounds to 21 pounds.  This M3A1 project will eliminate six pounds (28 percent) from the existing system by replacing the existing steel tube with a titanium alloy tube, and other various components (bolt, trigger, venturi, and ancillary parts) without changing the firing procedures, operations or ammunition.  Since the weapons\u2019 operational characteristics will not be changed, this low risk approach will produce a lighter weight 84mm shoulder-fired weapon without going through a costly and time consuming process to test, qualify, and re-certify an entirely new modernized weapon system.  This is a continuing project previously funded in FY 2014 in PE 0605130D8Z."

The MGLFMS enables instructors to evaluate crew functions, make instantaneous corrections, and provides recording capability for detailed after action reviews.  Foreign data has shown that training with this system significantly increases probability of gunnery crews placing first round on target.  The system also provides an essential tool for instructors to evaluate and make the necessary feedback to ensure the analytical abilities that encompasses all the gunnery skills required for accurate fire.  Several North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies currently train with this same equipment.  This is a continuing project which was previously funded during FY 2014 in PE 0605130D8Z."

Increasing human performance will also utilize cognitive-load assessment technologies to enhance training of tasks with high cognitive load such as in aviation operations, combined arms engagements, mission command, air and missile defense, or multiple intelligence sensor training."
