The project is a program within the overarching Battlefield Airmen Modernization (BA-Mod) Program. BAO Kit will develop, test, train and modernize the existing and future Family of Systems (FoS) that provides a state-of-the-art Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) suite for Air Force Special Operations Command's (AFSOC's) Battlefield Airmen. Efforts in the Special Tactics System Development project focus on reducing the risk of fratricide and substantially reducing size and weight of the equipment carried through three core capabilities: Human Machine Interface (HMI), Line of Sight (LOS) targeting, and Machine to Machine (M2M) C4ISR System.\n\nThis program will develop and enhance technologies for Battlefield Airmen Special Tactics Operators (STO)\/Combat Controllers (CCT) to recognize, identify, range, nominate and designate targets during both day and night operations. BAO Kit will also significantly reduce the time required to find, fix, track, target and engage the enemy by providing highly accurate target grid coordinates in three dimensions, generating target imagery both pre and post-strike, and transmitting target data to Command and Control centers. All BAO Kit systems are light, compact and portable for use by dismounted Battlefield Airmen. FY16 BAO Kit funding will provide significant improvements in operational capability, situational awareness and precision lethality in the battle space and continue to build and enhance the BAO Kit system of systems. These efforts will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increased mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum.\n\nThe Special Tactics (ST) System Development activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.\n\nThe FY2016 funding request was reduced by $0.260 million to account for the availability of prior execution balances."
