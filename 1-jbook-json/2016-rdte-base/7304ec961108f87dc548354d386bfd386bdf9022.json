Insensitive Munitions (IM) is the Navy's focused effort on propellants, propulsion units, explosives, warheads, fuses and pyrotechnics to reduce the severity of cook-off and bullet\/fragment impact reactions, minimizing the probability for sympathetic detonation, both in normal storage and in use, increasing ship and platform survivability and satisfying performance and readiness requirements."
