However, with the end of current conflicts there has been a strategic shift to enable introduction of new capability more affordably through employment of Pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (Pre-EMD) prototypes while addressing the strategic priorities of the Department, and the Chairman\u2019s Risk Assessment in the following areas: Electromagnetic Spectrum Agility; Space Capability Resilience; Autonomous Systems and Multi-Domain Technologies; Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction; and Force Application.  \n\nThe shift in the JCTD Program will also result in a shift in Program metrics.  JCTDs supporting the DoD\u2019s strategic priorities will tend to be longer and larger with increased emphasis on innovation, risk reduction, and affordability.  Overall, we envision initiating fewer yet more strategically decisive JCTD projects.  JCTDs will reinforce key partnerships across the Department, Services, other government agencies, select allies, and industry that allow for expedited development, deployment, and evaluation of capability solutions with potential to address some of the most pressing needs of the Department.  These JCTD partnerships will enable interdepartmental cooperation and capability development with the Departments of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, Justice, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  \n\nIn FY 2015, Disruptive Demonstrations funding (P264) was transferred from the JCTD Program Element (PE) to a new PE 0603289D8Z (Advanced Innovative Analysis & Concepts)."

            "val": "The value and impact of the JCTD program is to cost-effectively address the Department\u2019s strategic priorities to mitigate emergent threats, and address affordability and interoperability of Defense systems through Pre-EMD prototyping.  In FY 2014, the JCTD Program successfully completed the demonstration and transition of several JCTDs that addressed operational warfighting needs of the Department, providing affordable and sustainable solutions.  In addition, the program initiated several key prototyping efforts to address the strategic priorities of the Department.\n\nKey values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:\n\u2022  The JCTD Program has a long history of providing enduring capabilities.  See \u201cSection D.  Acquisition Strategy\u201d for more details on transition.\n\u2022  Recent examples include: \n     1. A robust \u201cdetect and track\u201d capability of \"dark\", i.e., non-emitting, maritime targets.  This is accomplished through automated data fusion of an existing suite of sensors supporting the Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) function.  This capability was successfully transitioned into the Sealink Advanced Analysis system at Office of Naval Intelligence and is now used by multiple agencies to provide a MDA capability.\n     2. Counter-electronics High powered-microwave Advanced Missile Project (CHAMP) that demonstrated the capability of a missile with an integrated High Powered Microwave source to degrade, disrupt, or damage electronic systems.  The results are informing the acquisition system and will be used to address time sensitive capability shortfalls.\n     3. Jetpack fifth to fourth supports Combatant Commanders' airborne gateway needs to distribute fifth Generation data to fourth Generation fighters by translating 5th Generation tactical data link messages into Link-16 messages that can be viewed by fourth Generation aircraft.  It is a critical force multiplier enabling 4th Generation aircraft to participate in a collaborative targeting environment that will be transitioning to our forces.\n\u2022  The JCTD Program enables coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources; approximately one-fifth of JCTD projects involve some degree of coalition partner participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations, the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the Republic of Korea. \n\u2022  The JCTD Program also enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects with the Department of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  \n\nMEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  \n\u2022  JCTDs will demonstrate capability objectives within 24 - 48 months. \n\u2022  The JCTD program achieved transition rates of the following:  70 percent transitioned to a new or existing Program(s) of Record, 24 percent transitioned to fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater.  In FY 2014, 17 of 18 completed JCTDs successfully transitioned."

Jetpack fifth to fourth supports Combatant Commanders' airborne gateway needs to distribute fifth Generation data to fourth Generation fighters by translating 5th Generation tactical data link messages into Link-16 messages that can be viewed by fourth Generation aircraft.  It is a critical force multiplier enabling 4th Generation aircraft to participate in a collaborative targeting environment that will be transitioning to our forces.\n\u2022  The JCTD Program enables coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources; approximately one-fifth of JCTD projects involve some degree of coalition partner participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations, the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the Republic of Korea. \n\u2022  The JCTD Program also enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects with the Department of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  \n\nMEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  \n\u2022  JCTDs will demonstrate capability objectives within 24 - 48 months. \n\u2022  The JCTD program achieved transition rates of the following:  70 percent transitioned to a new or existing Program(s) of Record, 24 percent transitioned to fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater.  In FY 2014, 17 of 18 completed JCTDs successfully transitioned."

BWA also predicts greater performance and signal strength at several different positions versus current whip antennas, including the limiting prone position.  BWA replaces four current distinct whip antennas, totaling over five pounds, necessary to cover the same communication band.  BWA weighs three pounds creating a lighter load and increasing operator maneuverability by dispersing weight around the waist.

(2) JCTD Pre-Transition:  In some cases, Service or Agency partner transition funding is not available for one to two years following the JCTD assessment phase due to Service or Agency commitments.  In such cases, where there is a clear transition and the need to sustain the capability for a short time prior to availability of Service or Agency transition funds the JCTD Pre-Transition fund may be used to meet that need.

The Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the system has been formulated to integrate LCMD into the existing National Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) architecture and will prioritize the use of existing components and systems already fielded.  LCMD is not designed as a replacement to existing BMD systems, but rather as a lower cost complementary\/augmentative component to forward-deployed BMD assets.  The LCMD capability will augment current BMD systems and mitigate threat vulnerabilities to U.S. personnel and strategic assets.  Initial LCMD architecture, specifications, performance and critical technologies were defined, analyzed, and tested in FY 2014 under the Emerging Capabilities and Technology Development Program Element (PE) 0603699D8Z."
