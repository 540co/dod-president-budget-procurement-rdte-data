DLA sources and provides nearly 100 percent of the consumable items the military forces need to operate \u2013 including food, fuel and energy, uniforms, medical supplies, as well as construction and barrier equipment. DLA supplies more than 85 percent of the military\u2019s spare parts, provides logistics information data and products, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and offers document automation and production services. DLA\u2019s Research and Development (R&D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are available in order to accomplish the Agency\u2019s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure, using the best commercial and government sources, and applying most effective business processes.  The Logistics R&D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at lower costs, than would be otherwise attainable.  The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits.  \n\nIn December 2013, the DLA Director called for greater flexibility within the R&D program in support of the Agency\u2019s efforts to achieve its\u2019 mission.  As a result, the R&D program is evolving from single supply chain efforts to   Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs) that will support DLA\u2019s efforts to achieve the improvements needed to maintain mission readiness and continue fiscal stewardship while supporting the Department\u2019s transition to peacetime operations."

                "val": "The Medical On-line Business Analytics capability will be delayed depriving DLA of the ability to properly plan and monitor orders to critical medical customers.  The Supply Chain management project reductions means additional anti-counterfeiting technology will not be fully developed and implemented, increasing the risk that counterfeit parts will enter the DOD supply system. In addition, emerging additive manufacturing technology will not be available for low volume parts.  The Strategic Distribution and Reutilization reductions mean that DLA support to the COCOM\u2019s deployments will be more costly because they will not be able to access regional suppliers through the IBEX2 system.  Reductions to the Energy readiness program mean cost increases to the Services for fuel because fewer alternative fuel additives will be available.  Finally, the reductions to the Defense Logistics Information project means DLA will not be capable of taking advantage of major advancements in Computer Aided Design\/Computer Aided Manufacturing.   \n\nFY2016 \u2013 FY2020 Restructuring: In December 2013, the DLA Director called for changes to the R&D program that would allow greater flexibility to support the Agency\u2019s mission.  As a result, the R&D program is evolving from single supply chain efforts to a few overarching Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs) that will support its efforts to achieve the needed improvements in order to maintain mission readiness and fiscal stewardship as the Department continues transition to peacetime operations. The three Strategic Focus Areas are: \n\n1. Analytic and Decision Support:  R&D efforts undertaken to develop and implement advanced analytical tools, modeling, and simulation of logistics and supply chain processes.  These tools will improve DLA forecasting and procurement strategy decisions and lead to faster and more flexible response to emerging market and customer requirements. \n2. Logistics Processes: R&D efforts undertaken to develop and implement advanced technology in the internal DLA logistics processes. To qualify for R&D funding, the R&D effort must develop and apply technology and processes over and above current baseline IT systems and continuous improvements efforts. \n3. Innovative Products and Services for Customers: R&D efforts undertaken to develop new products and services for DLA customers including helping to achieve the operational energy strategy goals of increasing sources of supply, developing and implementing alternative fuels and emerging,  out of cycle requirements that always occur and new products and services developed by DLA.  \n\nFY2016 \u2013 FY2020  Reprogramming to Industrial Preparedness \u2013 Manufacturing Technology Program (P.E. 0708011S) \nThis change will better align the technical work with the OSD Manufacturing Technology Program initiative for the Model Based Enterprise (MBE).  The MBE will help DOD move to a completely digital environment for design and engineering data needed to conceive, design, build and support weapon systems.  The MBE is important because much of the data currently developed during the design and production weapon system life cycle is lost and has to be recreated."

This change will better align the technical work with the OSD Manufacturing Technology Program initiative for the Model Based Enterprise (MBE).  The MBE will help DOD move to a completely digital environment for design and engineering data needed to conceive, design, build and support weapon systems. \n\nThe Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) program objective is to research, identify, and implement potential or existing technologies using high-risk, high-payoff tools, methods, techniques, and products.  The DLIR program partners with commercial industry to perform short-term projects (STPs) in various logistics business areas which align with the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s (DLA\u2019s) strategic vision. DLIR improves functional and business processes using the latest technologies available, which support the nation\u2019s warfighter. The technical areas of interest are: 1.) Development of Logistics Data Interoperability & Availability. Enhances the functionality and compatibility of data in a complex data environment using supply chain relationships and lifecycle management to allow flexible visibility.  2.)  Next Generation Automated Electronic Commerce and Sourcing.  The Next Generation Automated Electronic Commerce and Sourcing technical area of interest focuses on employing the best of breed processes, practices, and technology to enable and\/or streamline electronic commerce from the customer\u2019s point-of-need to point-of-satisfaction.\n\nDLIR is working several short term projects in the first area of interest only. They are positioning DLA to move towards a model-based enterprise (MBE), using and acquiring 3-Dimensional model-based data instead of 2-Dimensional hardcopy for weapon system sustainment and support."

We expect this project to produce an effective decision making tool for DLA\u2019s Industrial Capabilities Programs allowing program management to evaluate the effect of placing buffer stocks at various levels within the supply chain.  Anticipate completion by Sept 2011."

Specifically, Cost of Quality processes, increasing use of DOD organic manufacturing capabilities, reduction of ESA reviews caused by Critical Item Reviews.\n\nSelected process improvements cover processes outside the scope of the Technical\/Quality (T\/Q) Function including identifying improved methods for improving support for Low demand parts, accurate material receipt processes and eCommerce and catalog items as an alternative to stocking items.  \n\nMedical Processes will expand work in critical mechanisms to guarantee product quality of temperature-sensitive medical materiel distributed to our customers, and identify the most efficient and cost-effective means to deliver those medical products in accordance with FDA-labeled and other regulatory requirements.  \n\nDistribution and Disposition logistics processes deal with improving distribution and disposition capabilities, operational effectiveness, and efficiency. While numerous technologies and applications have been developed and exploited, DLA has not kept pace with the commercial industry in regards to modernizing its technology systems infrastructure, processes, or mobilizing information for personnel, customers, and processes."

The Supply Chain Management Roadmap addresses emerging and out of cycle requirements that always occur and new products and services developed by DLA.   \n\n\nIncluded in the budget ($1.250M) is the Print on Demand (POD) project for Mapping Enterprise Business System (MEBS) enhancements.\nDLA Headquarters\/CC mandated the POD process to establish a web-based tool for DLA Document Services to receive, order and print maps on demand.  \n\nThe enhancements improve system capabilities by implementing new and improved program data, user interface, and rules to integrate the POD business process.  These enhancements will greatly improve map services to the warfighter while significantly reducing lead times and lowering overhead costs attributed to printing, storage and shipping.  The POD Project will require an RMD to transfer funds to a new program element prior to the PB16 submission."
