FCT projects are nominated by the Services and U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) each year.   Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements, a thorough market survey, and development of a viable acquisition strategy.  \n\nSince the program's inception in 1980, OSD has initiated 671 projects; 601 projects have been completed to date.  Of the 312 evaluations that met the sponsors' requirements, 243 led to procurements worth approximately $11.000 billion in FY 2011 constant year dollars.  With an OSD investment of about $1.170 billion, the FCT Program realized an estimated research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) cost avoidance of $7.800 billion in FY 2011 constant year dollars.\n\nThe FCT Program is a catalyst for teaming or other business relationships between foreign and U.S. industries.  Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of the qualified foreign item in the U.S. Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the U.S. defense market and the resultant strengthening of the \"two-way street\" in Defense procurement.  The result often means the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies throughout the U. S.  To date, companies across 33 states benefited from FCT projects."

Possible candidates are the Ground Combat Vehicle (GVC), the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), and foreign military sales M2 Bradley systems.  This project will evaluate aluminum alloys AA7017-T6, AA2139-T8, and AA2195-BT.  The project will also evaluate the weld-ability of the alloys for verification of improved ballistics and structural performance versus current armors.  In addition to improved mechanical properties, preliminary data indicates these alloys also display improved resistance to stress corrosion cracking.  The improved ballistics and resistance to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) make AA7017 a promising replacement for current corrosion prone aluminum alloys while maintaining good weld ability.  The AA2195 and AA2139 alloys deliver increased protection levels beyond the current armor alloys, but are only approved for use as bolt-on or appliqu\u00e9 supplemental armors.  Further verifications are needed to achieve full weldable status."

Since the program's inception in 1980, Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) has invested about $1.170 billion in FY2012 constant year dollars to initiate 671 projects; 601 projects have been completed to date.  Of the 312 evaluations that met the sponsors' requirements, 243 led to procurements worth over $11.000 billion. In FY 2012, FCT had a transition rate of 79 percent for completed projects, exceeding the objective of 30 percent for demonstration programs."
