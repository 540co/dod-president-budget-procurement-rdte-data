The PE permits accelerating domain support processes through rapid proof of concept development and early implementation.  \nRAI-NC provides funding for Net Centric initiatives that directly support and facilitate the transformation of the DoD enterprise.  This effort is consistent with the Department\u2019s strategic goals to:  enable net-centric operations and warfare, reduce costs; improve efficiency; increase effectiveness by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of process redesign; business systems modernization; strategic sourcing; infrastructure reductions; and optimal-sized inventories.  The scope of Rapid Acquisition Incentives \u2013 Net Centricity encompasses defense policies, processes, people, technologies, and systems that guide, perform, or support aspects of warfighter support processes within the Department.  Successful implementation will result in more reliable, accurate, and timely net-centric management information upon which managers can make more effective business decisions in a timely manner for the Department.  Successful initiatives with supporting business cases demonstrating the achieved goals and outcomes and mission area support will be allowed to enter full deployment.  This program is funded under BA-6, Management Support because it includes studies and analyses in support of R&D efforts."
