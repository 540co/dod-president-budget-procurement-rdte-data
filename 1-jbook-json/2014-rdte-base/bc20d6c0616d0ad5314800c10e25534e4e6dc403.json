Developed a proposed methodology for conducting a system safety assessment to calculate the accepted risk for operating UAS within the National Airspace System.  Through a series of workshops captured Services\u2019 UAS airspace integration lessons learned. Coordinated performance requirements and safety guidelines within appropriate standards development organizations (SDOs). Developed UAS Airspace Integration (AI) Use Cases based upon the current AI CONOPs and operational assessments of current and planned UAS AI Terminal Area and Lateral Transit operations.  Developed an Operational Capability Tracking Tool for assessing progress of the airspace integration activities needed to support a predefined set of UAS operational capabilities. \n\nModeling & Simulation (M&S) - Provided modeling, simulation and analysis (MS&A) to the FY2012 requirements and standards efforts, as well as the safety analysis activities.  Completed development of a Common Intruder Database, with representative radar cross section models. Developed a deterministic tool for evaluating sense and avoid algorithms and CONOPS.\n\nGBSAA \u2013 The Army completed development of system level requirements for their GBSAA system.  The GBSAA IPT used these requirements as a starting point and with Service participation focused on development and demonstration of a common set of requirements for a universal GBSAA solution.  The collaborative effort included a workshop to identify commonalities among the Services\u2019 processes for Software Certification for Airworthiness.  The Army continued development of GBSAA technology and demonstrated their Phase 1 and 2 GBSAA systems in June 2012 utilizing the Army Test Bed at Dugway Proving Grounds."
