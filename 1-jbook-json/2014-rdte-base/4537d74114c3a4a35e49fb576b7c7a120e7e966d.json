The DOSI provides oversight, guidance and program management support for Defense OPSEC education, training, exercises, career force management, operational and programmatic assessment, capability development, intelligence, planning, analysis and operational employment in Defense military operations.  RDT&E funds support the development, establishment and integration of OPSEC capabilities, next generation technologies, and Department activities. The objectives of the OPSEC Initiative are to:\n\n1. Establish governance structures, processes and procedures for development and oversight of infrastructure, policy, authorities, and warfighter advocacy across the Joint community and the defense support agencies and for OPSEC intelligence integration that will focus on the incorporation of special intelligence requirements; intelligence and threat repository support; Open Source Intelligence, Human Intelligence, Counterintelligence and Signals Intelligence support; and intelligence support to Military Deception in Support of OPSEC (DISO).\n2. Develop a concept for integrating OPSEC into critical plans, operations and activities that will clearly articulate OPSEC requirements and the means for fulfilling them.\n3. Establish an OPSEC force structure to meet the Department\u2019s requirements by evaluating existing force structures, focusing on billets, personnel identifications and tracking, allocation, and operational employment.\n4. Create an integrated OPSEC education, training and exercise program that can be incorporated with MILDEC and other information-related capabilities and that focuses on exercise support and formal education curricula review and development.\n5. Develop a Technology and Tools Research, Testing, and Development Program to identify emerging physical, technical, and administrative technologies and tools.\n6. Fully integrate OPSEC and MILDEC so that they synchronize efficiently and effectively.\n7. Incorporate OPSEC and MILDEC as an integrated whole with other information-related capabilities such as Military Information Support Operations (MISO), Electronic Warfare (EW), Computer Network Operations (CNO), Intelligence, Counterintelligence (CI), Security, Special Technical Operations (STO) and Public Affairs (PA).\n8. Establish assessment programs to assess friendly and adversary measures and countermeasures based on observable actions, indicators, or information that can provide a basis for identifying such control measures as Action Controls, Countermeasures, and Counter Analysis and for assessing revised policy, doctrine, force structure, training and governance processes to identify corrective actions."
