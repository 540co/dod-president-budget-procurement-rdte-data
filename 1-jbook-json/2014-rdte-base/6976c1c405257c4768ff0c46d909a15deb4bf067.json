Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program, leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations. The NW system provides operators electronic, real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader. The NW system also provides the same integrated mission command capability to tactical vehicle mounted leaders so that when they dismount their vehicles, they still have access to the common operating picture (COP) and have full situational awareness. This capability provides unparalleled situational awareness and understanding to the dismounted leader allowing for faster, more accurate decisions and reduced fratricide in the tactical fight. \n\nBeginning in FY 18, this project funds the development and prototyping of the next generation of Nett Warrior, leveraging the extensive technology improvements that will occur over the next five years."

The NW MS C was approved 3 April 2012 followed by a low rate Capability Set (CS) 14 production award. Conduct Developmental Test and Evaluation planned for 4QFY12-1QFY13, followed by 1QFY13 Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) as well as hardware, software, integration and program management. The Developmental and Operational tests are validation of the system utility, supportability, and austere-environment power production and regeneration strategy-leading to a production decision in the 2QFY13 to procure the CS14 quantity of NW systems and support. NW also continues to reduce size, weight and power through a semi-annual integration and evaluation and test of the latest commercial smart device technologies which evolve continuously. This is the next increment of Nett Warrior that will leverage technology available in the FY 18 time frame."

The Air SS provides improved safety, survivability, and human performance that amplifies the Warfighter's effectiveness and facilitates full-spectrum dominance of Army aircraft. The Air SS addresses capability gaps identified during combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan including the effects of weight and bulk, limited situational awareness, and lack of functionally integrated aircrew member life support equipment. The Air SS follows an evolutionary acquisition approach with two sub-increments that integrate mature technologies to build to the full capability. Each sub-increment progressively reduces overall weight and bulk of aircrew equipment, increases situational awareness, and enhances aircrew mobility. This funding provides advanced development for the Air SS in technology areas supporting improved environmental cooling, integrated power, wireless personal area networks, lightweight protective clothing, and miniaturized communication devices."

Small arms systems include weapons ranging up to 40 millimeter in caliber. Current and future efforts focus on improvements designed to enhance lethality, target acquisition and tracking, fire control, training effectiveness and reliability of weapons to include ammunition when developing and\/or evaluating standard and non-standard weapons. Focus areas include the maturing of technology through testing and evaluation of sub-system or system prototypes which demonstrates light weight materials, wear resistant\/protective\/anti-reflective coatings, observation\/situational awareness improvements and equipment enhancements.  Benefits include continuous improvements to small arms weapons, fire control equipment, optics, gun barrels, training devices, suppressors, component mounts, weapon mounts, and weapon\/ammunition interface."
