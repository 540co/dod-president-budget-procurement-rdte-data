The major effort under this project is the phased approach for mobile high power solid state laser (SSL) technology demonstrations that are traceable to the form, fit, and function requirements for a HEL weapon.  At entry level weapon power of around 10 kW, SSL technology has the potential to engage and defeat small caliber mortars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), surface mines, sensors, and optics.  At full weapon system power levels of around 100 kW, SSL technology has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM), UAVs, and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), as well as surface mines, sensors, and optics at tactically relevant ranges.  HELs are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to strategically, operationally, or tactically stockpile ordnance.  This effort utilizes a modular building block approach with open systems architecture to ensure growth, interoperability, and opportunity for technology insertions for maturation of laser, beam control, sensor\/radar, integration of power and thermal management subsystems, as well as Battle Management Command, Control, and Computers (BMC3). \n\nThis project supports Army science and technology efforts in the Ground portfolio. \n \nWork in this project is related to, and fully coordinated with, efforts in PE 0602307A (Advanced Weapons Technology), PE 0602890F (High Energy Laser Research), PE 0603924F (HEL Advanced Technology Program), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603924D8Z (High Energy Laser Advanced Technology Program), PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), and PE 0605605A (DOD High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility). \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Department of Defense Research and Engineering Strategic Plan and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n \nWork is performed by the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command Technical Center, Huntsville, AL."
