The ER and WR provide tracking, telemetry, communications, flight safety, and other capabilities to enable: national security, civil, and commercial space launches; ballistic missile and missile defense test launches; and aeronautical and guided weapons tests.  Decreasing reliability of aging range systems leads to higher operations and maintenance costs and increased risk of launch delays.  \n\nThe AF will address range deficiencies in FY14 via multiple contracts, including the LTRS Integrated Support Contract (LISC), a command destruct modernization contract, small business set-aside contracts for ER and WR network modernization, and the Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) Contract.  As a follow-on to the Spacelift Range System Contract (SLRSC) which runs through FY13, the AF will award LISC as a consolidated sustainment, operations, and maintenance contract in FY14.  LISC will provide interface systems engineering, technical studies, and requirements analysis to integrate future maintenance and sustainment upgrades with modernization efforts.  Also, the separate Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) contract supporting the program management office will expand efforts to provide systems engineering and integration support for future modernization efforts, in terms of system baselines,configurations, and architectures.
