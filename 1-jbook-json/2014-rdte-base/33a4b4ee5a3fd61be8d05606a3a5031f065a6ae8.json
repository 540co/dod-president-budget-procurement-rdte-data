OCPL effectiveness comes from consciously balancing funding into four capability areas required for effective operations: Common Mission Framework (CMF), platforms, access, capabilities.  The program office investigates and selects the highest potential cyber and Information Operations (IO) technologies to meet specific shortfalls, deficiencies, and requirements documented by major commands (MAJCOMs), unified commands, and IO agencies in Mission Area Plans (MAPs) and capabilities documents.
