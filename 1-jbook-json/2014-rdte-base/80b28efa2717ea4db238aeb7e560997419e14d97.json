The OSD JWP account underwrites two related activities supporting development of the Department's joint warfighting capabilities.  In anticipation of constrained military budgets, there will be increased demand for JWP support as Combatant Commanders will be under pressure to refine their requests for supplementary capabilities to define their capability requirements, and identify potential solution options.  \n\nThe Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP) segment provides innovative and responsive analytic support on joint capability development serving the needs of joint capability clients.  It provides an independent source to examine potential remedies for mission capability gaps and can establish a framework for accelerated acquisition, subsequent field experiments, and capability demonstrations.  JAWP often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.  JAWP resources sustain a small dedicated staff of civilian operation research analysts (currently hosted by the Institute for Defense Analysis \u2013 IDA).  Administered by the Joint Operations Support cell within OSD\/AT&L, the JAWP conducts an annual call for inputs from Combatant Command staffs elements that formulate Capability Gap assessments and technology based initiatives.

JWP provides a safety net for analytic support responding to emergent joint capability requirements and capability gaps.  Typical projects funded with JWP include translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements, identification of candidate solutions via experimentation, translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations, and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources dedicated to direct support joint commands provides analytic expertise not normally allocated via formal staffing billets.  In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.

It provides an independent source to examine potential remedies for mission capability gaps and can establish a framework for subsequent field experiments, capability demonstrations or accelerated acquisition.  JAWP often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.  JAWP resources underwrite a small dedicated staff of civilian military operation research analysts (currently hosted by the Institute for Defense Analysis - IDA).  Administered by the Joint Operations Support cell within OSD\/AT&L, the JAWP conducts an annual call for inputs from Combatant Command staffs elements that formulate Capability Gap assessments and technology based initiatives.  Project selection is undertaken in consultation with the OSD staffs serving AT&L and Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff."
