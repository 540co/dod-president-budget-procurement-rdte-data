Currently, each Air Force Operational Support Aircraft and Very Important Person Special Airlift Mission (OSA\/VIPSAM) aircraft is configured with its own unique communications suite. National Senior Leaders require 100% secure voice, data, and video capability for all activities from general planning and strategy discussions to directing command decisions.
