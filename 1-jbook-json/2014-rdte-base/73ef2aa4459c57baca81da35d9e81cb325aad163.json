            "val": "This funding supports Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) directing the Department of Defense (DoD) components to develop guidelines and procedures for a comprehensive readiness reporting system that evaluates readiness on the basis of the actual missions and capabilities assigned to the forces. The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) establishes a capabilities-based, adaptive, near real-time readiness information system for the DoD. This system is being designed to measure the readiness of military forces and supporting infrastructure to meet missions and goals assigned by the Secretary of Defense. DRRS also hosts information and applications used to support Joint Forces Command (JFCOM), Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and Strategic Command (STRATCOM) in their roles as the Joint Force Providers.\n\nThe transformation of readiness reporting into a new comprehensive readiness system presents a number of significant challenges. First, there are thousands of new potential reporting entities to include in DRRS, such as Combatant Commands, Joint Task Forces, Services, Active and Reserve component units, installations, depots, ports, and major elements of the industrial base. These entities must not only define and implement reporting based on specific readiness metrics, but they must make their readiness status continuously available in near real time to DRRS. Second, the current National Military Strategy (NMS) makes substantially more complex demands on readiness reporting. Instead of basing readiness on traditional MTW-based scenarios, the NMS asks us to contemplate readiness for an entire range of operational forms, and to design DRRS to assess global readiness impact based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements. Finally, Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) sourcing challenges mean that force managers need applications that will query the entire Department for suitable, available organizations to meet current needs. The need for these applications and the underlying data are a top priority for the DRRS project.\n\nThe realization of DRRS requires integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that supports distributed, collaborative, and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment. The primary technical goal is the creation of a highly reliable and securely integrated readiness data environment to leverage and extend current readiness information systems. This system is based on intelligent agents, dynamic databases, semantic middleware, and publish\/subscribe concepts; providing a logically uniform view into the multiple databases and information sources that feed DRRS. Crucially, through this type of advanced information environment, we dramatically expand the range of readiness queries that DRRS can be able to handle. This environment supports a suite of analysis tools that allow users to explore the consequences of readiness deficiencies in terms of the ability to generate forces and assess transportation feasibility as it pertains to specific scenarios. These tools and tool suites harness the power of the information environment to make possible the kind of quick-turnaround, excursion-driven readiness assessment that is at the heart of DRRS."
