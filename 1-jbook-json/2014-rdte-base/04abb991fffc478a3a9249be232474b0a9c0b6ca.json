Specific activities include the following:\n\n- Work with MDAP\/MAIS\/SI Program Managers to develop a comprehensive DT&E strategy that supports acquisition decision milestones. Ensure that the test strategy is documented in the Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPs). The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) DT&E also approves or disapproves the developmental test and evaluation plans in the TEMPs.\n- Coordinate with the Director of Systems Engineering to ensure that the DT&E activities of the DoD are fully integrated into, and consistent with, the systems engineering and development planning processes of the Department.\n- Provide formal DT&E Assessments prior to major milestone decisions to inform the Acquisition decision-makers  on the readiness of programs to proceed into Engineering and Manufacturing Development (MS B), Production and Deployment (MS C), and Operations and Sustainment (FRP) with the goal of reducing discovery of performance issues late in the acquisition cycle.\n- Develop policy and guidance to ensure efficient and effective DT&E across DoD, including policy and guidance for developmental testing of interoperability and information assurance in coordination with the Joint Staff and DoD CIO.\n- Provide DT&E assessments in support of Nunn-McCurdy certification review teams, and the Director, Performance Assessment and Root Cause Analysis (PARCA).\n- Review the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to developmental test and evaluation and identify needed changes or improvements to such organizations and capabilities, and provide input regarding needed changes or improvements for the test and evaluation strategic plan developed by Test Resource Management Center (TRMC).\n-As the T&E Functional Leader, establish, oversee, and maintain the education, training and experience requirements including competencies and certification standards to enhance T&E acquisition workforce. Monitor and facilitate Defense Acquisition University (DAU) updates of T&E courses to ensure the curriculum supports the certification standards and provides the appropriate education and training."

The goals of this project are to demonstrate in each of these areas energy storage systems, with high power and energy densities, high rate capability, scalable to all power levels, that reduces total logistics replenishment of fuel and material, increases platform and vehicle ability to sustain operations during engagement, and reduce non mission capable and maintenance events.  Once demonstration is complete, this technology will be further sustained by the Services.  In collaboration, this program is closely coordinated with the Advanced Management and Protection of Energy-storage Devices (AMPED) program of the Department of Energy\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency \u2013 Energy (ARPA-E). AMPED technology will be used to potentially extend the operational performance benefits and safety for these applications beyond the hybrid storage module baseline design configurations."
