            "val": "This program element supports the development of system capabilities for the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) mission.  This funding specifically supports (1) the development of collaborative CWMD analysis capabilities between DoD and key interagency and international partners through a globally accessible net-centric framework in the form of the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset (IWMDT) and (2) technologies to meet national International Monitoring System (IMS) technology requirements in support of implementation, compliance, monitoring, and inspection for existing and emerging nuclear arms control activities under the Nuclear Arms Control Technology (NACT) program.\n\nThe WMD Defeat Capabilities program element supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats priorities, and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) monitoring requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD AT&L).  The general strategy spells out four focus areas:  1) Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, whether caused by natural, accidental, or deliberate events, 2) Establish and reinforce norms against the misuse of the life sciences, 3) Expand of our capability to prevent, attribute, and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism, with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities (Capability Expansion);  and 4) Leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capacity to respond to and recover from biological incidents (Leveraging Science).   In addition to the broad priorities, there are specific objectives to support the WMD monitoring through Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation (RDTE) in support of implementation, compliance, monitoring, and inspection for existing and emerging nuclear arms control activities. Details are provided in the R-2a exhibits.\n\nProject RF-Detection and Forensics Technologies supports the Nuclear Arms Control Technologies (NACT) Program, conducting Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation (RDT&E) to meet International Monitoring System (IMS) technology requirements in support of implementation, compliance, monitoring, and inspection for existing and emerging nuclear arms control activities.  \n\nProject RL-Nuclear & Radiological Effects develops and provides a real-time globally accessible net-centric framework which migrates the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive (CBRNE) modeling and simulation codes to provide an integrated suite of Combating WMD decision support capabilities."

The project directly provides for the US contribution to the IMS and addresses Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) monitoring requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD AT&L).  This project conforms to the Administration\u2019s research and development priorities as related to WMD arms control and disablement.  Technical assessments are made to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs and provide the data required to  inform  compliance assessments and support US monitoring policy and decision-makers and negotiation teams.  The DTRA conducts technology developments and system improvement projects to ensure these monitoring capabilities are available when required.  \n\nPrimary emphasis is on improved sensor sustainability,  availability and detection capabilities against a wide range of threat or event origins and enhanced monitoring system sustainability and availability.  The program includes development of monitoring and analysis equipment and capabilities and procedures for data exchanges,  inspections, and analyses.  The technologies and procedures developed in the NACT program provide a vital source of information on treaty mandated equipment and procedures that are extensively used by US and international agencies.  This project also supports the warfighting capability area of combatting WMD. \n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the transfer of the Nuclear Arms Control Technology (NACT) program to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).  The NACT program will transfer from United States Army Space Missile Development Command  (SMDC) to DTRA beginning in FY 2014."

Models will include fine-scale atmospheric conditions, topography, 3-D winds and effects of non-linear propagation.\n-  Continue to develop a portable\/rapid deployable infrasound array and standard sound source for calibrating infrasound stations\/arrays.  \n- Continue on-location infrasound event calibration and metrology research at established engineering and development test centers (EDTC), continue development of EDTCs to support research, testing, and evaluation relevant to station shutdowns, configuration changes, and invasive procedures, and  use EDTCs to perform primary evaluations of prototype monitoring arrays and related new technologies and all associated field testing.   \n- Continue R&D on support system to collect and prioritize station operator requirements to inform required design-build-test activities across the monitoring system.  Focus areas continue to be improvements to radionuclide detector cooling and functionality, filtration medium and sample head, and electronic controls.\n- Continue US IMS sensor event signal identification technique research and development of the transportable xenon laboratory (TXL) and associated xenon detection system and prepare for international deployment exercises and demonstrations.  Operations and maintenance performed in advance of the TXL foreign deployment will establish an operations baseline for this xenon monitoring capability and provide unique opportunities to diagnose and resolve remaining operational and technical concerns and issues, including investigating the \u201cmemory effect\u201d recently encountered in these systems as a result of the unintended radio-xenon releases from the Fukushima reactors.  Also planned is a continuation of infrasound event clutter and false alarm reduction, and noise mitigation analyses.  \n- Continue to drive improvements in radionuclide detection and measurement, including xenon gas collection\/analysis systems research.  Evaluate detection limits, and yields.  The PTS technical requirements dictate that the US radionuclide laboratory (RL-16) gas system requires additional capability to meet required detection thresholds.  Develop test methods to increase xenon gas yields, improve detection efficiencies, and decrease dead volume.  To ensure RL-16 is making a high precision measurement, analysis samples will be peer reviewed and calibrated at certified laboratories.\n- Continue to develop a robust, high-precision method to calibrate nuclear detectors and calibration methods to obtain the absolute calibration of the system\u2019s nuclear detector."

Under Project RL, the Net-Centric Architecture program integrates legacy capabilities and facilitates data sharing through a net-centric framework. It will provides near-real time collaborative analysis capabilities between DoD and key interagency and international partners through a globally accessible net-centric framework known as the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset (IWMDT).  The IWMDT migrates Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive (CBRNE) modeling and simulation codes to provide an integrated suite of Countering WMD decision support capabilities. The framework is the only operational CBRNE framework in the world which provides capabilities through web applications, net-centric web services, and stand-alone mobile deployments which are validated and accredited for operational use by International, National, State, and local authorities.  \n\nThe Net-Centric Architecture program includes three functional areas: 1) IWMDT, 2) IWMDT Codes, and 3) Software Assurance, Certification, and Accreditation.  The IWMDT functional area develops the architecture, defines and implements the standards to consolidate validated Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) tools, and through this architecture, enables rapid access for planning, emergency response, and assessment capabilities.  These capabilities are used by a wide range of planners, managers, and operational and technical personnel facing the full spectrum of CBRNE threats.  The IWMDT Codes functional area develops analysis and simulation codes, and then integrates the codes into the IWMDT architecture. These activities are unique to this effort across the Department of Defense (DoD). They directly support analysis capabilities in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Studies and Analysis Group, and Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (OSD CAPE), US Pacific Command and United States Forces Korea (USFK) offices, Republic of Korea (ROK) Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Defense Taiwan, as well as providing unique simulation capabilities to the Air Force Distributed Mission Operation Center.  The Software Assurance, Certification and Accreditation functional area supports all aspects of DTRA software development and fielding.  This sub-project extends research and development to system development and demonstration. \n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to increased investment for fielding of IWMDT."

At end of FY 2006, its follow-on contract was awarded with an initial $.300M increment.  IWMDT program efforts have continued into FY 2013 with $35.26M now applied.  Likewise, the NuCS program was funded under a competitive Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract over a 3-year period with funding of $5.913M applied through FY 2008; a follow-on contract has now been awarded with initial funding to date of $2.356M to continue program efforts, this effort is not funded past FY11 under this line.  COE was funded under a competitive CPFF contract with increments to date of $6.566M total.   NUCS and COE will no longer be funded under this line.  Task Order 00055 (IWMDT) Option 1 of the base contract was issued Nov 2012 for an 18 month period of performance.
