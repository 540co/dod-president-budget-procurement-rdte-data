            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. \n\nActivities and efforts in this Program Element (PE) address technologies critical to enabling the transformation of discrete functions to network centric warfare capabilities, which simultaneously perform Radar, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Communications and Network functions across platforms through multiple, simultaneous and continuous communications\/data links.  The Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology program addresses Radio Frequency (RF) technology for Surface and Aerospace Surveillance sensors and systems, EW sensors and systems, RF Communication Systems, Multi-Function sensor systems, and Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment offers affordable options for the transformational capabilities required by the Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense), Sea Strike (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance), and ForceNet (Communications and Networking) SeaPower 21 Naval Warfighting Pillars. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

In FY 2012, JCREW EC program will support JCREW 3.3 Acquisition Program Increment 2 Blocks 1 and 2 and will develop an advanced multi-function communications and EW architecture with supporting component technologies to support prototype development.\n\nThe major objectives of this activity are:\n\na) Affordable Common Radar Architecture (ACRA) - Develop a scalable, open radar architecture that addresses affordability challenges for 5 different radars.\n\nb) SATCOM Vulnerability Mitigation - Develop a diverse, multi-tier communications networking capability for Naval strike forces.\n\nc) Long Range Detection and Tracking - Ability to detect, track and identify (ID) future anti-ship ballistic missiles, advanced cruise missiles, aircraft and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs).\n\nd) Affordable Electronically Scanned Array Technology for Next Generation Naval Platforms - Develop and demonstrate affordable components in beamforming element chains for efficient S- and X-Band radar, and EA using highly efficient digital solid state electronics components covering the RF and microwave frequencies.\n\ne) Countermeasure Technologies for Anti-Ship Missile Defense (ASMD) - Improve ship survivability by disrupting the terminal engagement phase of hostile Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles\/ Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles (ASCM\/ASBM), including improvements to both onboard Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) and offboard Nulka RF EA systems.\n\nf) Next Generation Countermeasure Technologies for Ship Missile Defense - Develop and demonstrate the fundamental technologies required to conduct next generation, persistent EW in support of ship, sea base, and littoral force missile defense operations in a distributed, coordinated manner across the entire battlespace.\n\ng) Next Generation Airborne Electronic Attack - Develop and demonstrate advanced capability Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) sub-systems (e.g., broadband exciters, power amplifiers, and transmit arrays) that provide Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD), deliver Non-Kinetic Fires, counter Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), and provide suppression of Command, Control & Communications (C3) links and data networks.\n\nh) Data Exfiltration Nanosatellite Innovative Space Enabler (DENISE)(formerly known as Global Applications for Data Exfiltration(GLADEX)) - Develop a capability for monitoring and relay of unattended sensor data for global situational awareness.  Benefits include security through encryption, reduced dependence on commercial systems, and reduced collection needs by manned and unmanned in-area assets.  It addresses a shortfall to monitor shipping in territorial waters and the open ocean to combat terrorism, and, enforce criminal law.\n\ni) Radar Electronic Attack Protection (REAP) - Develop single platform precision passive Electronic Support Measure (ESM) and Electronic Protection (EP) techniques and technology to counter hostile use of modern Electronic Attack (EA) self protection jammers.\n\nj) Joint Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (JCREW) 3.3 - Develop integrated RF communications and RF jammer capability that addresses the electromagnetic interference (EMI) issue to enable interoperability.\n\nk) Submarine Survivability- Electronic Warfare - Develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide submarines an EA capability against surveillance radar systems through EW payloads integrated with submarine masts, as well as networked offboard platforms.  These capabilities will improve the submarine's survivability in a hostile RF environment by providing a non-kinetic strike capability against enemy Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors.\n\nl) Electronic Warfare (EW) Roadmap - Develop classified advanced electronic warfare technology in support of current and predicted capability requirements. \n\nDecrease in funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to transfer of FNC efforts addressed in this PE to a new PE titled Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development (PE 0603673N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all 6.3 FNC investments in a single PE.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

This activity will increase the operational effectiveness of U.S. Naval units.  The focus is on the mitigation of GPS electronic threats, the development of atomic clocks that possess unique long-term stability and precision, and the development of compact, low-cost, Inertial Navigation Systems (INS).\n\nThe major objectives of this activity are:\n\na) GPS Anti-Jam Antennas and Receivers - Integrate and demonstrate anti-jam antennas and antenna electronics for Navy platforms for the purpose of providing precision navigation capabilities in the presence of electronic threats; to integrate and demonstrate anti-spoofer\/anti-jam processors for the purpose of providing precision navigation capabilities in the presence of emergent threats. \n\nb) Precision Time and Time Transfer - Integrate and demonstrate tactical grade atomic clocks that possess unique long-term stability and precision for the purpose of providing GPS-independent precision time; to integrate and demonstrate the capability of transferring GPS-derived time via radio frequency links for the purpose of providing GPS-independent precision time. \n\nc) Non-GPS Navigation Technology - To integrate and demonstrate inertial navigation systems for the purpose of providing an alternative means of providing precision navigation for those Naval platforms which may not have GPS navigation capabilities and\/or loss of GPS signals; to integrate and demonstrate a correlation navigation technique using earth maps of high precision (including bathymetric, magnetic and gravimetric data) for navigation for those Naval platforms which may not have GPS navigation capabilities and\/or loss of GPS signals.\n\nThe increase in funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to restoration of previously programmed funding level for GPS and Navigation Technologies research.  FY 2012 GPS research was reduced to fund critical related work in Gallium Nitride (GaN) High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) supporting Electronic and Electromagnetic Research program objectives.   \n\nThe decrease in funding from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the reduced investment in Advanced Technology efforts for GPS and Navigation, and planned increase in Applied Research investment in the Navigation Technology activity in PE 0602271N. \n\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples for projects funded in this activity."

                                        "val": "The overarching objective of the INTOP INP is to develop and demonstrate a set of prototypes that integrate RF functionality (EW, Radar, Communications, Navigation) into a common set of multi-function apertures electronics and software through an architecture that is modular, scalable across all platforms, and open at the RF as well as computer and software level.  The apertures are capable of providing multiple simultaneous, independent beams which can together perform any of the above functions.\n\nThe major objectives of this activity are:\n\na) Submarine SATCOM Array - Develop wide-band SATCOM array capable of supporting EW for submarines.\n\nb) Electronic Warfare (EW)\/Information Operations (IO)\/Line of Sight (LOS) Communications (Comms) for Surface Combatants - Develop wide-band array to support EW capability and other functions, including but not limited to IO and LOS Comms, for surface combatants with potential application to other platforms.\n\nc) Architecture, Standards and Devices - Develop architecture and standards for wide-band multi-beam, multi-band arrays and below deck systems and the technology and electronic devices needed to make integrated array systems affordable.\n\nd) Surface Combatant Communication Array - Develop wide-band surface combatant communication array capable of supporting other RF functions.\n\ne) Resource Allocation Manager - Develop enterprise common Resource Allocation Manager.\n\nf) Digital Radar - Develop an all digital radar to demonstrate advanced concepts for coherent radar networking and control, which will increase radar coverage and provide new levels of electronic protection (EP), while maximizing radar resources and reducing cost.\n\ng) Low Band Communications, IO and EW - Develop low band technology development and concept studies leading to development of an Advanced Development Model (ADM).\n\nThe decrease in funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to completion of the SATCOM Array prototype build during FY 2013.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

Additionally, demonstrate reductions in size, weight, and power as well as cost (both acquisition and life cycle) by reducing the number of topside apertures needed for communication, electronic warfare, and some radar functions.  A critical tenet of the prototype will be the demonstration of an open architecture so that not only can different companies supply the major components, such as a given receive or transmit aperture, but even down to the subarray and lower component level throughout the life cycle, to ensure continuing competition for maintenance and replacement parts.\n- Continued development of architecture and interfaces and their application to wide-band SATCOM arrays for submarines.\n- Continued development of deckhouse and platform integration strategies and concepts.\n\nSurface Combatants Communications Array:\n- Initiated design effort.\n\nResource Allocation Manager:\n- Continued development of functional queue management software.\n- Continued development of control interface software for the resource allocation manager.\n\nDigital Radar:\n- Completed concept studies.\n- Initiated design effort."
