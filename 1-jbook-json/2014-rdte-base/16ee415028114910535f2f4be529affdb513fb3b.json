            "val": "The Quick Reactions Special Projects (QRSP) Program supports five separate projects that provide rapid funding to expedite development and transition of new technologies to the warfighter.  These projects are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF); 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF); 3) Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) Architecture and Integration (RAI) program; 4) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support; and 5) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) support.  QRSP provides the flexibility to respond to emergent Department of Defense (DoD) issues and address technology surprises and needs within the years of execution outside the two year budget cycle. \n\nThe QRF Program objectives are to respond to emergent conventional warfare needs during the execution years that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies.  The QRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office.  Examples of the types of projects that are envisioned include:  force protection projects to enhance anti-access and area denial capabilities, undersea offensive capabilities and broad electronic warfare capabilities.  The QRF focuses on maturing technologies critically needed for the Combatant Commands.  QRF projects are typically 12 months in duration and produce prototypes with new capabilities for demonstration and evaluation.\n \nThe RRF objectives are to leverage the DoD science and technology (S&T) base and those of the other federal departments, and to provide feedback to the S&T community to guide long term developmental strategies.  The RRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  RRTO works to anticipate adversaries\u2019 exploitation of new technologies and advanced capabilities and develop counters to those capabilities.  Additionally, RTTO works to leverage technology developed outside of the DoD in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas, and small, non-traditional businesses to expose them to specific DoD needs areas as identified by Combatant Commanders, Military Service organizations, other Defense agencies and interagency organizations.  The typical length of an RTTO program falls within a 6 to 12 month range in order to more effectively aid the warfighter.  The RRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 30 percent for demonstration programs (DoD Strategic Objective 4-3). \n\nThe RDT&E Architecture and Integration (RAI) program objectives are to enhance and expand rapid technology architecture and assessment capabilities in general; and, to enhance the Joint Experimentation Range Complex (JERC), Stiletto maritime test platform and the Thunderstorm ISR exercise series.  The JERC provides a venue to evaluate a wide range of new technologies in a dessert environment.  The requested funding will also support Stiletto, a maritime test vessel that routinely hosts numerous new technologies for evaluation in a maritime environment.  Thunderstorm, an ongoing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) exercise series, is also supported by this budget line.  Thunderstorm brings emerging ISR technologies together in a common architecture for exercise and operational demonstration.   \n\nThe JRAC Program objectives focus on responding to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) that have been submitted by Combatant Commanders and validated by the Joint Staff.  In addition, the JRAC\u2019s objectives are to manage the delivery of capabilities as requested by the Combatant Command (COCOM) in a time frame acceptable to the COCOM.  Efforts, in most instances, are conducted outside of the processes described in the Defense Acquisition System in DoD Directive 5000.1 and utilize contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.\n\nThe SMA cell program objective is to support all Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Joint Force Commanders, and other government agencies by assessing complex operational\/technical challenges which require multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the United States Government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA cell develops solution options to COCOM generated challenging problems and informs the command\u2019s senior leadership.  Each SMA cell effort is initiated at the request of COCOM senior leadership. Priorities for SMA Cell programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy for Operations.  Products are typically produced within six months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the COCOM\u2019s senior leaders."

Current program protection and supply chain risk management efforts primarily target individual Major Defense Acquisition Programs of Record (POR). However, this approach currently lacks a strategic or operational mission focus to identify and assure critical DoD missions, which are comprised of acquisition programs, as well as legacy systems and infrastructure.\n\nGlobalization of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) markets creates unprecedented opportunities for sophisticated adversaries to defeat not only individual systems, but DoD capabilities through supply chain exploits or other malicious tampering. Defense Planning Guidance, Defense Science Board Reports, and recent deliberations on Nuclear Command, Control and Communications have all acknowledged the problem, and identified the requirement to protect critical missions from cyber and supply chain vulnerabilities.\n\nThis Quick Reaction Fund effort provides funding for the Department to pilot initial activities to develop methodologies to assess critical mission vulnerability to cyber or supply chain exploit, and assess the utility of available tools, processes and models in conducting such a cross cutting vulnerability assessment. This project will seek to demonstrate the application or expansion of current program protection and supply chain methodologies to a mission-level assessment, focusing on selected exemplar missions. This project will result in an identified mission vulnerability assessment method and available tools, as well as critical gaps in tools in order to inform future development and application of this type of assessment as a standard practice."

The QSRP Program provides the flexibility to respond to emergent DoD issues and addresses technology surprises and needs that may arise outside the two-year budget cycle. \n\nThe Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) is fully executed through the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  The RRTO was established to provide rapid response to enhance operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other theaters; and, to accelerate the transition of high-potential science and technology (S&T) projects into operationally useful products in the execution years.  The RRTO leverages the Department of Defense (DoD) S&T base and those of the other Federal Departments; stimulates interagency coordination and cooperation; accelerates the fielding of capabilities and concepts to counter emerging threats; and, provides feedback to the S&T community to guide long term developmental strategies.  With projects supporting each Combatant Command and with a global perspective, the RRTO anticipates adversaries' exploitation of technology, including available and advanced commercial capabilities. \n\nIn prior years, RRTO has explored methods and approaches of persistent surveillance stimulation for counter-insurgency; developed alternate power sources for sensors and systems; expanded human, social and cultural knowledge; increased small unit situational awareness; advanced the interface between law enforcement and military operations; developed biometrics and forensics capabilities; supported denied area operations; strategic multi-layer assessments; and, established an innovation outreach cell that is facilitating better interactions with small companies with emerging technologies that do not normally do business with the DoD.  \n\nIn FY 2013 and FY 2014, RRTO will continue to explore new and emerging capabilities to support irregular warfare operations while working to support the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology & Logistics) (USD (AT&L)), the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) (ASD(R&E)) and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Rapid Fielding (DASD RF) goals.  With project selection occurring during the execution year, the RRTO's potential focus areas for FY 2013 and FY 2014 Rapid Reaction Technology Office projects include:  Forward Operating Base (FOB) protection; persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) architecture; ISR sensors; interface of law enforcement and military operations; biometrics and forensics S&T; autonomous operations; data processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED); cyber security; exploitation of new and emerging cell phone technologies; support to border patrol initiatives; counter proliferation initiatives; capabilities to exploit denied areas; strategic communications and multi-layer assessments; and, non-traditional approaches to leverage innovative businesses.  \n\nThe typical length of a RRTO project falls within a 6 to 12 month range in order to more effectively respond to the Warfighter."

This follow on effort will examine the assessment of regional stability in SA and will identify both direct drivers of interstate conflict as well as sources of internal instability. Internal instability which allows for VEO safe havens that may spill-over into, and exacerbate interstate tensions.  The stability and instability factors in the assessment include:  (1) Ethnic divisions, recent anti-regime opposition movements, and other sources of internal social, economic and governing instability that may lead to state failures of various kinds; (2) The domestic and external factors driving regional actors \u2013 both state and non-state, (3) The contagion dynamics \u2013 including social media and shared narratives -- that transfer instability within and across state borders. This effort will assist Combatant Command (COCOM) planners in assessing strategic long-term and short-term regional stability.  It will also assist the planners in assessing sub-regional stability through various short-term excursions, a threat scenario, and a conflagration scenario.  This effort will also examine long-term decline and will propose a multi-generational Security Strategy Concept designed to avoid conflagration.
