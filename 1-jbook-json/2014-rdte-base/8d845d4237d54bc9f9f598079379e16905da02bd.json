Program baseline will also address research and development into Strategic Signals; Undersea and Irregular Warfare; Counter Unmanned Air Systems; Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination; Commercial Navigation Radar Threats; Maritime Intelligence Fusion; Open Ocean Surveillance; Threat Geo-location; and Command & Control.  Link Crimson also supports and participates in Fleet exercises, which provide the venue for testing and demonstrating new prototype capabilities and enhancements. Link Crimson holistically develops warfighting capabilities by synchronizing insertion of technologies with existing Navy, joint, and national agency programs.
