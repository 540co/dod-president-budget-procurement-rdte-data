            "val": "Since 1986, the United States and the State of Israel have cooperated on missile defense. Currently Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has three major projects with Israel to develop and improve their indigenous capability to defend against short and medium range ballistic missiles. These include the Arrow Weapon System (AWS), the David`s Sling Weapon System (DSWS) for Short Range Ballistic Missile Defense (SRBMD), and the Arrow-3 Interceptor. Within these projects MDA develops and produces weapon systems, conducts tests, and exercises interoperability between U.S. BMDS and the Israeli Missile Defense Architecture. \n\nU.S.-Israel Cooperative Programs consist of the following major efforts: \n\nIsraeli Upper Tier Project:\nThe Upper Tier Program provides the Arrow 3 missile, increasing the system`s capability against advanced medium range threats by providing approximately four times the current Arrow-2 battle space. The primary near term objective for Upper Tier is to demonstrate readiness for a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) delivery in FY 2016 through successful flight testing. \n\nIsraeli Arrow Weapon System (AWS):\nThe Arrow System Improvement Program (ASIP) includes block upgrades to the Arrow Weapon System that enhances capabilities against more stressing evolving medium range threats by increasing the total defended area by approximately 50 percent. ASIP elements include the Arrow-2 missile and launcher, Citron Tree Battle Management Center (BMC), Green Pine (GP) and Super Green Pin (SGP) Radars, and the Hazelnut Tree Launcher Control Center (LCC). Also included is the integration of Block 5 assets which include the Arrow-3 missile and launcher. Arrow Block 5, under the ASIP agreement will also incorporate a Long Range Detection suite that consists of an unmanned aerial vehicle Airborne Early Warning System (ABEWS) and a S-Band Silver Oak radar for increased sensor range, early detection and enhanced raid size capacity. The program also includes the continued development of Arrow`s interoperability with U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS). Related activities include the Israeli Test Bed (ITB) and the Israeli Systems Architecture and Integration (ISA&I) study that assesses requirements and growth paths for the 2025 Israel Missile Defense Architecture. \n\nShort Range Ballistic Missile Defense (SRBMD):\nSRBMD, also known as The David`s Sling Weapon System (DSWS), is designed to counter short range rockets and missiles and serve to fill the lower-tier gap between the Arrow Weapon System and Iron Dome. The first fielded block capability will perform the short range rocket and missile defense mission. Subsequent blocks will address a cruise missile defense capability. David`s Sling Weapon System (DSWS) elements include the Stunner Interceptor, Missile Firing Unit (MFU), Multi-Mission Radar (MMR), and the Golden Almond Battle Management Center (BMC). The main near term objectives for DSWS are successful completion of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) in FY 2014, initiation of Interceptor Full Rate Production (FRP), and completion of final Block 1 flight testing."

The Upper Tier Interceptor will enhance Israel`s indigenous capability to defend against short and medium range ballistic missiles by increasing the battle space by a factor of four. The scope of the Upper Tier Program covers interceptor development, testing, initial lot production, and integration with the Block 5 AWS. The United States through the cooperative effort gains knowledge and experience of the Israeli Defense Forces operation of a multi-layered defense architecture. This project also includes the development of the Silver Sparrow Air-Launched Target which is necessary to validate the performance of the Arrow 3 Missile. \n\nThe Upper-Tier Interceptor Project Agreement was signed in 2010. This agreement states that the project will be jointly managed by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and the Israeli Missile Defense Organization. The agreement also documents the U.S.-Israeli cost share, in which the development costs will be equitable between the U.S. and Israel."

Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and the Israeli Ministry of Defense (IMoD) continue to implement management practices that allow for the more effective use of program management tools to ensure risk is adequately managed to include Knowledge Points that assess Israel`s development progress. The DoD U.S. Israeli Cooperative Program Office jointly manages the Upper Tier program with IMoD to ensure that all systems are delivered on time, on budget, and meet the needs of the warfighter. The program is equitably funded between the U.S. and Israel. A portion of the Israeli cost share comes from non-financial contributions such as previously completed work prior to joint program initiation. In regard to the Upper Tier Interceptor, IMoD will contract with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). IAI subcontracts with Israeli and U.S. companies."

Also included is the integration of Block 5 assets which consists of the Arrow-3 missile, launcher and the Long Range Detection Suite (LRDS). The LRDS consists of an unmanned aerial vehicle Airborne Early Warning System (ABEWS) and an S-Band Silver Oak radar for increased sensor range and early detection and enhanced salvo engagement capability. The AWS provides Israel an indigenous capability to defend against short and medium range ballistic missiles. The ASIP effort will enhance the performance of the AWS to defeat longer-range and more robust ballistic missile threats expected to be introduced in the Middle East in the near future. ASIP elements include the Arrow-2 missile and launcher, Citron Tree Battle Management Center (BMC), Green Pine (GP) and Super Green Pine (SGP) Radars, and the Hazelnut Tree Launcher Control Center (LCC). The ASIP also ensures AWS interoperability via Joint Tactical Information Data System (JTIDS) Link-16 common communication architecture with the U.S. BMDS elements such as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), AEGIS, Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC), Army Navy\/Transportable Radar Surveillance and Control (AN\/TPY-2), and Phased Array Tracking Intercept of Target (PATRIOT) through ground tests, flight tests, and operational exercises.\nThe Israeli Test Bed (ITB) provides experiments to evaluate Human-In-The-Loop (HIL) battle management. Israeli Systems Architecture and Integration (ISA&I) conducts studies to assess Israel`s future 2025 Missile Defense Architecture. The ITB and ISA&I efforts will continue to support AWS development as well as to define future missile defense architectures and growth paths."

The program funding is equitably funded between the U.S. and Israel with Israel providing matching contributions. However, a portion of the Israeli cost share comes from non-financial contributions such as previously completed work prior to joint program initiation. In regard to Arrow System Improvement Program (ASIP), IMoD contracts on behalf of U.S. government with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). IAI subcontracts with Israeli and U.S. companies. For the Israeli Test Bed, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) contracts directly with Elbit Systems, Ltd. while IMoD provides an equitable share of the funding to the U.S. Finally, MDA contracts directly with WALES, Ltd for the Israeli System Architecture and Integration program."

The current Israeli Missile Defense Architecture has capability against some of these short-range missile threats, but does not provide a cost-effective defense. The goal of the Israeli Short Range Ballistic Missile Defense (SRBMD) program is to provide an affordable defense capability. In March 2005 the U.S. and Israel initiated a joint 18-month feasibility study of a low-cost SRBMD capability as a complement to the Arrow Weapon System. This was followed in May 2006 by the Israeli`s down-selection to the David`s Sling Weapon System (DSWS) for their SRBMD solution. Under the current Program Agreement, Block 1 provides a baseline capability against large caliber rockets and short range ballistic missiles. The DSWS is comprised of the Stunner Interceptor, Battle Management Center the Multi-Mission Radar, and the Missile Firing Unit. \n\nUnder the U.S.-Israeli Project Agreement signed in September 2008, the project is jointly managed by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and the Israeli Missile Defense Organization. The agreement documents the U.S.-Israeli cost share, in which the development costs are equitably shared between the U.S. and Israel."
