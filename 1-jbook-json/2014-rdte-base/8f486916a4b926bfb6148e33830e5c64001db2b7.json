Through identifying Defense Critical Assets, assessing them to determine vulnerabilities, incorporating specific threat and hazard information and analysis, and visually displaying relevant infrastructure data and analysis, DoD will be positioned to make risk management decisions to ensure the appropriate infrastructure is available, when needed, to support DoD missions.\n\nSpecifically, Combatant Commands (COCOMs) are responsible for identifying the mission capability requirements and coordinating with the Military Departments, Defense Agencies, DoD Field Activities, and Defense Sector Lead Agents to identify and assess Defense Critical Assets. As asset owners and capability providers, the Secretaries of the Military Departments and the Directors of Defense Agencies and DoD Field Activities, coordinate with the COCOMs to identify and prioritize the assets required to support mission-essential functions. Asset owners will also assess identified Defense Critical Assets to identify vulnerabilities and apply appropriate remediation and mitigation measures. The Defense Sector Lead Agents are responsible for identifying the specific functions, systems, assets (DoD and non-DoD owned), and interdependencies within the Defense Sector infrastructure networks supporting the identified critical missions.\n\nEach Defense Sector Lead Agent, as identified in DoDD 3020.40, represents one of ten (10) functional areas that provide support to the Combatant Commanders and asset owners. These functional areas are as follows:  defense industrial base (DIB); financial services; global information grid (GIG); health affairs; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); logistics; personnel; public works; space; and transportation.  \n\nIn addition, DCIP manages specific analytic efforts in the identification and maintenance of specific inter- and intra-dependencies DpD has on the foundational commercial infrastructure networks supporting the identified critical missions.  Specific analytic efforts are focused within six (6) commercial infrastructure areas:  energy (electric power, natural gas); chemicals; transportation; telecommunications; water; and petroleum, oil, lubricants (POL)."

Through identifying Defense Critical Assets, assessing them to determine vulnerabilities, incorporating\nspecific threat and hazard information and analysis, and visually displaying relevant infrastructure data and analysis, DoD will be positioned to make risk management\ndecisions to ensure the appropriate infrastructure is available, when needed, to support DoD missions.  Specifically, Combatant Commands (COCOMs) are responsible for identifying the mission capability requirements and coordinating with the Military Departments,\nDefense Agencies, DoD Field Activities, and Defense Sector Lead Agents to identify and assess Defense Critical Assets. As asset owners and capability providers,\nthe Secretaries of the Military Departments and the Directors of Defense Agencies and DoD Field Activities, coordinate with the COCOMs to identify and prioritize the\nassets required to support mission-essential functions. Asset owners will also assess identified Defense Critical Assets to identify vulnerabilities and apply appropriate\nremediation and mitigation measures. The Defense Sector Lead Agents are responsible for identifying the specific functions, systems, assets (DoD and non-DoD\nowned), and interdependencies within the Defense Sector infrastructure networks supporting the identified critical missions.\nEach Defense Sector Lead Agent, as identified in DoDD 3020.40, represents one of ten (10) functional areas that provide support to the Combatant Commanders\nand asset owners. These functional areas are as follows: defense industrial base (DIB); financial services; global information grid (GIG); health affairs; intelligence,\nsurveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); logistics; personnel; public works; space; and transportation.\nIn addition, DCIP manages specific analytic efforts in the identification and maintenance of specific inter- and intra-dependencies DpD has on the foundational\ncommercial infrastructure networks supporting the identified critical missions. Specific analytic efforts are focused within six (6) commercial infrastructure areas:\nenergy (electric power, natural gas); chemicals; transportation; telecommunications; water; and petroleum, oil, lubricants (POL)."
