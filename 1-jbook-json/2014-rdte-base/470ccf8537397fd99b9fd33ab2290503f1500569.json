            "val": "Aviation Systems:\nThis project provides for the development, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF specific avionics; Low Probability of Intercept\/Low Probability of Detection (LPI\/LPD) terrain following\/terrain avoidance radar; Electronic Warfare (EW) - radio frequency countermeasures; Precision Strike Package (PSP) for MC-130W Multi-Mission Modification; AC-130H, AC-130W, and AC-130U Recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection, and identification technologies; digital broadcast capabilities; and aerial refueling. \n\nCV-22 Development:\nThe CV-22 is a Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft. The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved capabilities in block increments. The funding in this project supports these block increments as well as associated flight test support. The Block 10 increment was completed in FY 2007, and the Block 20 increment started in FY 2008.\nBlock 10: Integrate and test Directional Infrared Countermeasures, a system that protects against infrared guided missiles; design, integrate and validate the Troop Commander Situational Awareness Station to provide the embarked troop commander access to the CV-22's communication, navigation and mission management system; relocate the ALE-47 chaff and flare dispenser control head to allow any cockpit crew member to activate defensive countermeasures; add a second forward firing chaff and flare dispenser to provide an adequate quantity of consumable countermeasures for the extended duration of SOF infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply missions; and incorporate a dual access feature to the Digital Map System to allow both the pilot and co-pilot to independently access and control the digital map display from the mission computer.\nBlock 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing.  This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.\n\nMission Training and Preparation Systems:\nThis project funds the definition, design, development, prototyping, integration, and testing of Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) systems to support mission planning and rehearsal  required to meet Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies in current mission planning and rehearsal capabilities. The MTPS project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse mission planning systems. \n\nAC\/MC-130J:\nThe AC\/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II, AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky airframes. The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J configuration. These platforms perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; airdrop of leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft; and provide close air support (CAS), air interdiction, armed reconnaissance, escort, and force protection - integrated base defense. Additional capabilities include low-level navigation and in-flight refueling. The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM. An incremental upgrade approach will be used to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft.\n\nRotary Wing Aviation:\nThis project develops SOF-unique modifications and upgrades to SOF rotary wing aircraft that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A\/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to Special Operations Forces (SOF) in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters"

This\nis a capability not currently provided by existing aircraft. The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved capabilities in block increments supported with rapid\nprototyping. The funding in this project supports these block increments as well as associated flight test support. The Block 10 increment completed in FY 2007, and the Block 20 increment started in FY 2008.\nBlock 10: Integrate and test Directional Infrared Countermeasures, a system that protects against infrared guided missiles; design, integrate and validate the Troop Commander Situational Awareness Station to provide the embarked troop commander access to the CV-22's communication, navigation and mission management system; relocate the ALE-47 chaff and flare dispenser control head to allow any cockpit crew member to activate defensive countermeasures; add a second forward firing chaff and flare dispenser to provide an adequate quantity of consumable countermeasures for the extended duration of SOF infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply missions; and incorporate a dual access feature to the Digital Map System to allow both the pilot and co-pilot to independently access and control the digital map display from the mission computer.\nBlock 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous\ntesting. This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment, improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform."

Block 10 RDT&E funding was sent from USSOCOM to NAVAIRSYSCOM to be placed on contract with the V-22 prime contractor. Block 10 capability is required for compliance with the Joint Operational Requirements Document and associated Milestone III Capabilities Production Document. Block 20 and subsequent block upgrades are planned to follow the same acquisition strategy, with NAVAIRSYSCOM PMA-275 ensuring the integration of SOF-unique systems with the ongoing basic vehicle improvements supporting both the CV-22 and the Marine Corps MV-22."

The MTPS project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse SOF training systems.\n\nSub-projects include:\n\u2022 Special Operations Mission Planning Environment (SOMPE): Develops, integrates, tests, and validates software enhancements required to meet SOF-unique\nrequirements for, and correct deficiencies to, mission planning, preview, and execution software tools to support all phases of SOF operations from deliberate to\ntime critical. The SOMPE project automates time-sensitive planning activities and provides enhanced situational awareness during mission execution. SOMPE\nprovides the interoperable environment for SOF adaptive planning to integrate global operations including, but not limited to, precision strike software, digital navigation, and unmanned aerial systems command and control. This project also provides the integration of SOMPE with multi-dimensional visualization systems, providing immersive mission rehearsal in minimal timeframes from the SOMPE mission plan. SOMPE is embedded in the USSOCOM Headquarters, Theater Special Operations Commands, Joint Special Operations Task Forces, Joint Special Operations Aviation Components, SOF war-fighters, and SOF warfighter platforms.\n\n\u2022 MC\/AC-130J Simulator (MC\/AC-130J): Conducts analysis, development, integration, assembly, test and checkout of SOF-unique MC-130J and AC-130J simulator development efforts modifications to include, but not limited to, all efforts of technical and functional activities associated with the design, development, and production of mating surfaces, structures, equipment, parts, materiels, and software required to assemble equipment (hardware\/software) elements into training mission equipment as a whole and not directly part of any other individual element.\n\n\u2022 Terrain Following\/Terrain Avoidance Silent Knight Radar Simulator (TF\/TA SKR): Integrates, tests, and validates the SKR capability into the MH-47G and MH-60\ncombat mission simulators. This is a SOF-common multi-mode radar characterized by a Low Probability of Intercept\/ Low Probability of Detection (LPI\/LPD) capability."

The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J configuration. These platforms perform clandestine or low visibility, single- or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; airdrop leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft; and close air support (CAS), air interdiction, armed reconnaissance, escort, and force protection - integrated base defense. Additional capabilities include low-level navigation and in-flight refueling.  The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM. USSOCOM will then employ an incremental upgrade approach to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the Air Force-provided aircraft.\n\nConducts development, integration, and testing of aircraft enhancements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements. Enhancements include, but are not limited to, SOF communications, mission processors, aircraft performance enhancements, enhanced situational awareness, electronic warfare and survivability systems, and other SOF mission kits.

Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A\/MH-6M.  These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts, and they must be capable of rapid deployment; undetected penetration of hostile areas; and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  Sub-projects include:  \n\n\u2022  A\/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade is necessary to restore structural, performance, and safety margins for the aircrews.  An airframe structural modification will address structural failures due to high intensity, high gross weight operations, and a decade of battle damage.  A main\/tail rotor drive train and engine control replacement effort will reduce airframe loads and restore sufficient safety and performance margins.  An avionics upgrade (NDI\/COTS) will replace obsolescent components and provide basic situational awareness.  This upgrade is critical to keep a 1960's vintage aircraft in the fight until a suitable replacement aircraft is available, estimated to be in the 2025 timeframe.\n\n\u2022   MH-60 SOF Modernization program provides for the systems engineering and platform integration efforts, to include continued flight and qualification testing and test support.   \n\n\u2022   Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) solution will fuse information from currently fielded aircraft sensors with emerging technology to display real-time reference points, obstacles, and landing zone information to the aviator.  The DVE solution will provide MH-47\/60 aircrews with visual cues for obstacle avoidance and aircraft control during all phases of flight and significantly increase crew and passenger survivability in DVE such as dirt and snow.  Additional funding is provided to begin software development.\n\n\u2022   Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program provides for the long-term replacement of an aging fleet of aircraft and provides a significant increase in range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and maintainability of vertical lift aircraft to meet emerging mission requirements.  USSOCOM will participate in the Service Common development of a joint future vertical lift aircraft by injecting USSOCOM requirements and equities into the initial development and design efforts to minimize SOF-peculiar modifications to the common aircraft. This is a new start in FY 2014\n\n\u2022   Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) program provides a lightweight capability suitable for the A\/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB).  The IRCM program will develop, integrate, qualify, and test a complete lightweight IRCM system to include a missile warning system and expendables dispenser.  The A\/MH-6 is the only tactical aircraft in the U.S. Army inventory without protection from IR guided missiles.  IRCM is a new start in FY 2014."

The airframe\/rotors development effort will be a sole source contract to Boeing, who owns the technical data associated with the A\/MH-6 airframe.  The engine control work will be performed by Rolls-Royce and Goodrich Power and Engine Control (GPEC) under subcontract to Boeing.  As part of the airframe upgrade, the main and tail rotor blades are being replaced with one of several blades available off-the-shelf through a competitive evaluation.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins, with the intent to leverage the Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) source code to the extent possible.  Any new hardware components will be NDI\/COTS and will be competitively selected.  The production software effort will be a FFP contract.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.\n\n\u2022   MH-60M SOF Modernization Program - This supports the Systems Integration and Qualification efforts on the prototype MH-60M helicopter. This includes, but is not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation. There are no proprietary considerations that may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer.  \n\n\u2022   DVE - This effort integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in degraded visual environments.  A competitive source selection process will be conducted for the DVE solution to the extent possible while capitalizing on Science and Technology initiatives and other Service DVE investments.  Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer.  Additional funds will be employed to begin the development of the software\/firmware for the Synthetic Vision Backbone which uses Digital Terrain Elevation Data or High Resolution digital elevation maps, Threat Data, and Blue Force Tracker.  This is combined with Q2 Electro-Optic Sighting System overlay and Silent Knight Radar or DVE sensors (not yet defined) to provide a synthetic vision scene to aid the aircrew in degraded visual environments. The Synthetic Vision Backbone is sensor agnostic, maximizing the use of a priori data with sensors used for change detection.\n\n\u2022   Future Vertical Lift (FVL) - New start in FY2014. This effort is the SOF aviation participation in the Joint FVL effort to develop the next generation of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft and establishes the foundation for the transformation of the Department of Defense (DoD) vertical lift Aviation capabilities over the next 40 years.   \n\n\u2022 Infrared Countermeasures (IRCM) - New Start in FY2014. This program will be a competitive source selection effort that develops, integrates, and qualifies a mission configurable Missile Warning System (MWS) and IRCM capability which does not currently exist at a weight suitable for the A\/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB).  Special operations aviation requires the addition of IRCM to protect against increasingly proliferated and sophisticated infrared-guided weapons."
