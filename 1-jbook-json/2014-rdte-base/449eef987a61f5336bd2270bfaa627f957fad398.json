These requirements include commitments to satellite, sensor, and operational demonstration\/development activities as well as the transition to fleet applications associated with three satellite programs: 1) the joint Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), 2) the jointly funded Coriolis satellite which includes Navy Satellite Based Wind Speed (WindSat) and Air Force Solar Mass Ejection Imager instruments, 3) the Geodetic\/geophysical Satellite (GEOSAT) Follow-On 2 (GFO-2) altimetry satellite funded entirely by Navy.\n  \nThe Navy METOC Space-Based Sensing Capabilities project provides for Navy participation in Navy\/Air Force cooperative efforts leading to DMSP sensor development, and specifically participation in the calibration and validation of instruments and delivery of satellite products to the fleet.  The passive microwave instruments carried on the DMSP satellites provide global and atmospheric data of direct operational relevance, including sea surface wind, sea ice, and precipitation.  WindSat is a partnered program that meets multiple naval remote sensing requirements and provides a significant risk reduction for the Joint Polar Orbiting Satellite System (JPSS) satellites' Microwave Imaging Sensor instrument.\n  \nThe GEOSAT Follow-On project, and GFO-2 program, will provide a polar-orbiting satellite that measures sea surface topography using a precise altimeter.\nBoth the GEOSAT Follow-On and Navy METOC Support (Space) projects fulfill Navy's obligation to develop naval service-unique, mission critical space-based METOC technology. \n\nStarting in FY12 the Navy has delayed all Geodetic\/geophysical Satellite (GEOSAT) Follow-On 2 (GFO-2) altimetry satellite development efforts until FY 2017.\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY:  BA-7: This program is funded under Operational System Development because it encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for upgrade of existing, operational systems."

CMIS will collect global microwave radiometry and sounding data to produce microwave imagery and other meteorological and oceanographic data. CMIS can be viewed as the follow-on instrument to the Special Sensor Microwave (SSM) instruments Navy developed for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. These CMIS sensors will be acquired as part of the JPSS architecture which supports these Navy requirements in the future. Maintenance of rigorous sensor calibration and data validation for operational SSM instruments continues along with algorithm development in support of fleet applications. The Advanced Altimeter technologies will improve radar altimeter resolution and aerial coverage to support Navy requirements for sea surface topography measurement in the littorals."

Mission data will be collected by the Spacecraft Operations Center and passed to the Payload Operations Center, and Altimetry Data Fusion Center, which are co-located at the Naval Oceanographic Office, Stennis Space Center, MS.  Mission data is used in global and regional scale ocean forecast models.  GFO-2 will provide a capability for precise mesoscale (e.g., fronts and eddies) and basin-scale oceanography.  This capability will support tactical anti-submarine warfare, mine warfare, naval special warfare mission planning, tactical decision aids, and sensor\/weapon performance prediction.  GFO-2 will also provide an undersea warfare battlespace characterization capability that supports submarine detectability, weapon settings, sound velocity profiles, tropical cyclone intensity, and track forecasts.\n \nGFO-2 data will be made freely available to other agencies, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, who value its input to studies involving global warming and climate change, including El Nino Southern Oscillation effects.  \nOcean topography data was previously provided by GEOSAT from 1985 until the satellite failed in January 1990.  The Geodetic\/geophysical Satellite Follow-On satellite was launched in February 1998 and deorbited in November 2008.  The GEOSAT GFO-2 will provide for the continuation of this capability. \n\nThe Navy has delayed all Geodetic\/geophysical Satellite (GEOSAT) Follow-On 2 (GFO-2) altimetry satellite development efforts until FY 2017."

GEOSAT Follow-On 1 demonstrated that a space based altimeter provided the equivalent of approximately a 500-fold increase in available subsurface observations and a 10-fold increase in available surface observations, critical to characterization of the ocean environment and oceanographic modeling.  War-gaming models show that this increased knowledge of the subsurface acoustic propagation resulting from one altimeter reduced the probability of losing a ship to subsurface attack from 80% to 20% for various scenarios."
