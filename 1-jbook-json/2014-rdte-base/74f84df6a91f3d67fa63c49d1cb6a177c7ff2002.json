Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  The systems developed  and tested in this line item are National Systems Support to SOF (NSSS);  Joint Threat Warning System (JTWS);  Special Operations Tactical Video System (SOTVS).\n\nU.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.  The intelligence programs funded in this project will meet annual emergent requirements and are grouped by the level of organizational element they support: Operational Element (Team) and Above Operational Element (Garrison).    \n\nOPERATIONAL ELEMENT (TEAM)    \n\n\u2022   NSSS.  This program provides a research and development rapid prototyping capability which functions as HQ SOCOM's Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities program.  NSSS improves the combat effectiveness of USSOCOM, its components, and the Theater Special Operations Commands by leveraging National Agency and Service development efforts to provide innovative space-based intelligence systems technologies and enhancements, products and special communications capabilities to tactical SOF units, to include field-deployed signal intelligence (SIGINT) and communications systems such as the Firefly SIGINT and Rapid Reliable Targeting (RRT) geo-location payload and future Friendly Force Trackers (FFT).  Similarly, the Enhanced Software-Defined Radio Tag effort will provide a unique, mission-relevant and globally flexible field device which will provide tactical forces the ability to clandestinely tag and persistently track almost any target, using multiple National Theater and Tactical collection platforms.\n\n\u2022   JTWS.  This program  is an evolutionary acquisition (EA) effort that provides threat warning, force protection, enhanced situational awareness, and target identification\/acquisition information to SOF via signal intercept, direction finding and SIGINT.  JTWS will employ continuing technology updates to address the changing threat environment.  SOF SIGINT operators are globally deployed and fully embedded within Special Operations teams and aircrews in every operational environment.  This state-of-the-art technology enables SOF operators to provide critical time-sensitive targeting and actionable intelligence to the operational commander during mission execution.  Intelligence derived from operations supports campaign objectives and the National Military Strategy.  This system has variants that utilize common technologies and interfaces allowing operators to task, organize, and scale equipment based on anticipated signal environments and areas of operation.  Variants will be modular; lightweight with minimal power requirements; and configurable to support body worn\/mobile or static, air, maritime and precision geo-location operations in support of all SOF missions.  Each variant, except static, will be capable of operation by a single trained operator.  The four variants are Ground SIGINT Kit (GSK) Bodyworn\/Mobile and Team Transportable (GSK static), Air, Maritime, and Precision Geo-Location (Ground and Air).\n\n\u2022  SOTVS.  This program employs an evolutionary strategy to meet SOF reconnaissance and surveillance mission requirements. The program consists of a family of interoperable digital commercial-off-the-shelf systems to capture and transfer near-real time day\/night tactical ground imagery utilizing SOF organic radios and global C4I infrastructure.  The program provides the capability to forward imagery in near-real time via current or future communication systems (i.e., land-line, High Frequency, Very High Frequency, and Satellite Communications radios) in support of surveillance and reconnaissance missions. This man-packable tactical system consists of digital still cameras, camcorders, ruggedized laptop computers with image manipulation software and data controller.  This program is a FY 2014 new start.\n\nABOVE OPERATIONAL ELEMENT (GARRISON)  \n\n\u2022   Counter-Proliferation Analysis and Planning Systems (CAPS).  Department of Defense (DoD) has a planning mission for counter-proliferation (CP) contingency operations.  CAPS has been identified by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) as the standard CP planning tool set for DoD, and the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Chemical and Biological Defense Program has consolidated RDT&E funding at USSOCOM for overall program management. U.S. Strategic Command serves as the coordinator for CAPS requirements.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency provides science and technology expertise and integration support to enhance CAPS capabilities.  CAPS provides tools and assessments to DoD and SOF mission planners to aid in worldwide identification and analysis of suspected weapons of mass destruction and potential targets; assesses the associated effectiveness, costs and risks of various CP options and their collateral effects; and develops alternative plans.  CAPS is a primary source of CP mission planning information for Combatant Commanders who are the principal customers.  CAPS requires ongoing development, integration and testing of leading edge technology for operational planning and processes in order to provide the best possible engineering analysis and to support consequence engineering to meet changing threats.   CAPS program funding and responsibility transfers to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for consolidation and interface with DIA's Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction Analysis Cell beginning in FY 2014.\n\n\u2022   Special Operations Command Research and Threat Evaluation System (SOCRATES).  This program is an umbrella program that acquires and supports the network and computing infrastructure for SOF intelligence information up to and including the Top Secret, Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS\/SCI) level. SOCRATES integrates intelligence information from national, theater, Service and SOF-specific databases; provides news service and message traffic; automated imagery processing, dissemination, and archival; analyst-to-analyst electronic mail and collaborative tools; web interfaces\/search capabilities and browse-down capability to Secret web servers; and secure voice and facsimile. It provides a seamless and interoperable interface enabling SOF-unique intelligence support to mission planning and intelligence preparation of the battle space."
