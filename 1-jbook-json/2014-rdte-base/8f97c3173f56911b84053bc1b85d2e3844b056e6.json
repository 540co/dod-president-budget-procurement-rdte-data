The System will provide 360-degree protection and will simultaneously engage threats arriving from different azimuths. A block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability. The Block 1 system will consist of an existing interceptor and sensor and development of technical fire control and a Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) to support the UAS and CM mission. The Block 2 system will develop interceptors, sensors, and technical fire control to support the counter RAM mission. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be compatible with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) C2 architecture. The IFPC Inc 2-I System will be transportable by Army common mobile platforms."

The Government will use existing contracts and work performed by other Government agencies.  Additional work will be performed by the Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) and Letterkenny Army Depot (LEAD) through funding provided to those organizations by the IFPC Inc 2-I Product Office.  The Government will use the following contracts:\n   \n   - The Navy's PMA-259 contract will be used to develop and integrate the Technical Fire Control (TFC) and IFPC Inc 2-I Block I Interceptor uplink.  This contract will also be used to procure test missiles to support the Technology Development (TD) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phases.\n  \n   - The Army's FAAD Command and Control (C2) contract will be used to support development, test, and integration of the IFPC Inc 2-I Block I Interceptor with the FAAD C2 and the Multi-Mission Launcher (MML).\n \n   - The Army's IBCS contract will be used to support development, test, and integration of the IFPC Inc 2-I Block I Interceptor with the IBCS and the MML. \n \n   - The Army's Sentinel contract will be used to incorporate sensor software upgrades to enhance detection of low radar cross section (RCS) and slow moving targets."
