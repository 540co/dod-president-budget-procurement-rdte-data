The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD AT&L) provides principle oversight of the JNLWP. \n\nThe efforts in this Program Element (PE) reflect Joint Service research and development (R&D) investment decisions provided by the Joint Non Lethal Weapons Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that executes the JNLWP for the Executive Agent. Research conducted is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Document. This coordinated joint R&D development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative Service investment. \n\nThis PE funds Joint Service research, development, test, and evaluation of non-lethal weapon (NLW) systems and technologies that provide a non-lethal capability to minimize fatal or permanent injuries as well as undesired damage to property and the environment. NLW are designed to incapacitate or hinder movement of individuals, crowds, or equipment. The availability of NLW allows commanders less than lethal options, across the spectrum of military operational warfare, i.e., peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, as well as special operations. \n\nThe Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate was established by the Executive Agent to manage the day to day research and \ndevelopment activities of the DoD Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program. The JNLWP funding is distributed amongst the USA, USAF, USN, USMC, SOCOM, and USCG in support of NLW research and development efforts. Each Service is responsible for their procurement and operating support costs."
