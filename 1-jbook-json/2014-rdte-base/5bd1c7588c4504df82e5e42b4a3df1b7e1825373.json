            "val": "The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space based positioning, navigation and timing distribution system, which operates through weather and electromagnetic environments (jamming, spoofing, etc.). GPS supports both civil and military users in air, space, sea and land operations.  GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide.  GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity and time.  GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC) sec 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 51 USC sec 50112, which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation. \n\nThis Program Element (PE) funds the Research & Development for the GPS next generation operational control system (OCX) and the GPS Enterprise Integrator.  This includes the advanced concept development, systems analysis, modernized control segment development, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, and developmental test resources, and systems engineering required to meet the government's obligations to the international, military and civil communities, and system requirements verification.  OCX acquisition was established to 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites, 2) incorporate situational awareness to support Navigation Warfare and signal monitoring, and 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support warfighter effects-based approach to operations.  GPS Enterprise Integrator is responsible for architecture and system definition (the analysis and definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents) as well as for the planning, execution, and fielding of the Enterprise.\n\nOCX funds will support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, modernization initiatives, systems engineering, system development, test and evaluation efforts and mission operations in support of upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to support efforts to protect U.S. military and allies' use of GPS.  Additionally, funds will ensure efforts to meet current and future Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved required capabilities. \n\nGPS supports both military and civil users in air, space, sea and land operations. The GPS Enterprise consists of Space, Ground Control, Nuclear Detonation Detection System (NDS) and User Equipment Segments. The government is responsible for the integration of the GPS Segments such that they provide worldwide GPS capability to support the warfighter and over a billion national security, civil, allied, and commercial GPS users. The GPS Enterprise Integrator project includes the efforts associated with the Government's prime contract tasks necessary to accomplish this critical integrating function with the entire GPS user community. The Enterprise Integrator maintains the GPS current architecture and system definition, controls and validates interfaces, ensures compatibility of Generation II and III systems, and develops\/manages plans for execution and fielding of the GPS Enterprise.  Further, the Integrator provides modeling, simulation and technical analyses of impacts for Government-directed enterprise-level trades among the GPS segments leading to definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents to build and ensure the integrity of the enterprise technical baseline, and perform system requirements verification. \n\n In addition, the GPS Enterprise Integrator project funds the technical evolution, risk reduction, enterprise-level testing and delivery of all GPS Enterprise capabilities.  Examples for Generation II include electronic protection and additional civil signals; for Generation III, additional anti-jamming protection.  To accomplish this, the GPS Enterprise Integrator delivers Test and Verification capabilities, Requirements and Interface Management, and Systems Integration support across the Space, Control, and User Segments.  In this capacity, the Enterprise Integrator is responsible for managing this cross-program work to provide these and other capabilities.   GPS Enterprise Integrator's analyses guide government decisions to ensure efficient and effective synchronization and execution across all Generation II and III GPS programs.  For Enterprise-wide integration to be successful, the Integrator: works with the GPS and NDS prime contractor teams to develop plans for early risk reduction System Integration Demonstrations to ensure system interfaces and functionality meet user and system requirements; ensures all equipment and documentation is ready when needed; integrates and analyzes enterprise schedules, conducts formal test and verification, including Requirement Verification Plans; and System Test Plans and Procedures. GPS Enterprise Integrator performs all these efforts across all GPS programs in all acquisition phases. The government owns the Enterprise system requirements and integration, and highly leverages the Enterprise Integrator team to eliminate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions. This enhances the government control, oversight and program accountability."

OCX funds will support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, systems engineering, system development, test and evaluation efforts and mission operations in support of upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to support efforts to protect U.S. military and allies' use of GPS.  Additionally, funds will ensure efforts to meet current and future Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved required capabilities. Funds will support technology development and systems development efforts.  \n\nOCX Block 0 is the GPS satellite command and control system intended to conduct Launch and Early Orbit (LEO) operations and the checkout of all GPS III satellites.  OCX Block 0 is a subset of OCX Block 1.\n\nOCX Block 1 fields the operational capability to control all legacy satellites and signals (L1C\/A, L1P(Y), L2P(Y)) as well as the GPS III satellites and the L2C and L5 signals.  It also fully meets information assurance\/cyber defense requirements.\n\nOCX Block 2 fields the operational capability to control L1M and L2M (M-Code), and L1C signals.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that were fielded or received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

GPS supports both civil and military users in air, space, sea and land operations. GPS provides a worldwide capability that supports over a million warfighters and over a billion national security, civil, allied, and commercial GPS users.  The GPS Enterprise consists of four segments: Space, Ground Control, Nuclear Detonation Detection System (NDS) and User Equipment Segments.  Each segment has prime contracts to provide specific segment products (eg. spacecraft, master control system, receivers & antennas). The government, not a development contractor, is responsible for the integration of the GPS Segments and relies upon GPS Enterprise Integrator contracts to supply specific expertise and sufficient resources to successfully allocate the segment requirements, integrate the segment products, and verify that system requirements are met. \n\nThe GPS Enterprise Integration project includes the efforts of the FFRDC and SE&I contract tasks necessary to accomplish this critical integrating function. The Enterprise Integration maintains the GPS current architecture and system definition, controls and validates interfaces, ensures compatibility of previous, current, and future GPS segment products (Generation II and III systems), and develops\/manages plans for execution and fielding of the GPS Enterprise.  Further, the Integrator provides modeling, simulation and technical analyses of impacts for Government-directed enterprise level trades among the GPS segments leading to definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents to build and ensure the integrity of the enterprise technical baseline.  \n\nIn addition, the GPS Enterprise Integration project funds the technical evolution, risk reduction, enterprise-level testing and delivery of all GPS Enterprise capabilities.  Examples for Generation II include electronic protection and additional civil signals; for Generation III, additional anti-jamming protection.  To accomplish this, the GPS Enterprise Integrator delivers Test and Verification capabilities, Requirements and Interface Management, and Systems Integration support across the Space, Control and User Segments.  In this capacity, the Enterprise Integrator is responsible for managing this cross-program work to provide these and other capabilities.   GPS Enterprise Integrator's analyses guide government decisions to ensure efficient and effective synchronization and execution across all Generation II and III GPS programs.  For Enterprise-wide integration to be successful, the Integrator: works with the GPS and NDS prime contractor teams to develop plans for early risk reduction System Integration Demonstrations to ensure system interfaces and functionality meet user and system requirements; ensures all equipment and documentation is ready when needed; integrates and analyzes enterprise schedules, conducts formal test and verification, including Requirement Verification Plans; and System Test Plans and Procedures. GPS Enterprise Integrator performs all these efforts across all GPS programs in all acquisition phases. The government owns the Enterprise system requirements and integration, and highly leverages the Enterprise Integrator team to eliminate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions. This enhances the government control, oversight and program accountability.\n\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to support operational systems."

To elminiate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions, the government leverages systems engineering and integration expertise from both Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractors and a Systems Engineering & Integration (SE&I) contractor.  GPS Enterprise Integrator function of the SE&I contractor is currently funded within this Program Element (PE) for the Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX).  SE&I services were procured in 2007 through a full and open competition.  GPS Enterprise Integrator function is now being tracked as a separate Project (67A025) within this PE."
