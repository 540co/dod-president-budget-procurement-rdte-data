TIS RM is a critical component of network-centric warfare, supporting joint operations and Allied and Coalition forces world-wide. The ability to pass sensitive and critical data across security domains and to our Allied and Coalition partners in a timely fashion can only be met by accredited Cross Domain Solution (CDS) systems such as RM.  RM enables the United States (US) Navy to operate in a multi-national environment.\n\nTIS RM provides automated, bi-directional sanitization, transliteration and guarding capability for formatted and unformatted data between security enclaves.  RM helps ensure critical intelligence is provided quickly to operational decision-makers. TIS RM provides the capability to disseminate information for operating forces worldwide, including the operating forces of key allies in the Pacific, Central and Europe Command regions. This capability to move all-source intelligence-derived track information into the realm of the operational community significantly improves the situational awareness of tactical operators and planners. Unformatted data is handled by the Information Review Process (IRP).  The system provides cross domain services to a wide variety of customers including Combatant Commanders, Air Force (Shared Early Warning program), Army (Blue Force Tracking program), Navy (Global Command and Control System - Maritime\/J (GCCS-M\/J) and Automatic Identification System (AIS)), Maritime Operations Centers (MOC), Distributed Common Ground System-Navy (DCGS-N), Tactical Ranges (TR), and numerous other Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence agencies.\n             \nMajor Focus Area for FY14: Complete development of Radiant Mercury (RM) Version 6.0 to run on Security Enhanced (SE) Linux which removes dependency on proprietary vendor products whose pricing models have had a negative impact on the program and customers.  Begin and complete the in-house testing and certification process for Version 6.0.  SE Linux allows the developer to customize the Operating System (OS) for the RM application, increasing processing speeds and improving security.  Improve remote configuration management by replacing the current version of Windows with a Lightweight Text Interface for initial configuration control and a web-based interface to configure the system.  Use Free and Open Source (FOSS) to manage the Log, Audit Reduction, and Mission Assessment capabilities.  Enhance the RM Message Analysis Generator (MAG) Generic Interface Functionality (MGIF) in order to take advantage of software and capabilities developed elsewhere within the Navy, Department of Defense, and Intelligence communities."
