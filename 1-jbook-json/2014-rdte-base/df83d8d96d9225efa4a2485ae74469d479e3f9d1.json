Technologies in the PE support the continued development of technologies beyond Budget Activity 3 (PE 0603711D8Z) for technology transition and transformation to close warfighter requirement capability gaps. By exercising its oversight role through a technology advisory board, senior military Council and Senior Steering Group (Flag level), Joint Ground Robotics (JGRE) applies this PE to enable coordination between the Services and places emphasis on interoperability and commonality among unmanned ground systems. This PE funds efforts to overcome technology barriers in thrust areas of unmanned ground system technologies to include Autonomous & Tactical Behaviors, Collaborative Operations, Interoperability, Man-portable Unmanned Ground System Technologies, Manipulation Technologies, and Technology Transition\/Transformation. This PE funds unmanned ground system technologies and supports the integration of technologies into representative models or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment and expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational use. Emphasis is on proving component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major and complex systems and may involve risk reduction initiatives. Within this PE, funded projects will continue the delivery of advanced technology directed at enhancing the warfighter's capabilities identified during new concept development, operational assessments and field feedback of current unmanned systems. The technologies are generally at TRL 4 or 5 with the intent to mature them through JGRE efforts to TRL 6."
