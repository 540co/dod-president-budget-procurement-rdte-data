            "val": "Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) ensures the protection of Navy and joint cyberspace systems from exploitation and attack. Cyberspace systems include wired and wireless telecommunications systems, Information Technology (IT) systems, and the content processed, stored, or transmitted therein. ISSP includes protection of the Navy's National Security Systems and Information (NSSI).\n\nISSP is the Navy's implementation of statutory and regulatory requirements specified in Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA, 44 U.S.C. section 3541), the Computer Security Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-235), Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. section 552a, Public Law No. 93-579), National Security Act of 1947 (Public Law 235), Comprehensive National Cyber security Initiative (CNCI) National Security Presidential Directive 54\/Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23 (NSPD-54\/ HSPD-23), National Security Directive 42, Presidential Decision Directive 63, Executive Order 13526, Appendix III of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130 Revised, Committee for National Security Systems (CNSS) Policy 22, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Instructions 6510.01F and 6510.02D, Department of Defense (DoD) Directives 8500.01, O-8530.01, and 8570.01, the new DoD Instruction 8500.02, and CNSS Instruction 1253.\n\nISSP activities address the risk management of cyberspace defined in \"The National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations\", Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dec 2006, of defensive Information Operations (IO) defined in Joint Publication 3-13 including the capabilities to protect, detect, restore, and respond. ISSP supports the entire naval cyberspace domain from the mobile forward-deployed subscriber, through the ashore supporting critical information infrastructure, and the interconnection with other cyberspace domains. Navy cyberspace is a higher value and more vulnerable target due to the interconnectivity of naval and joint networks, connections to allied and coalition partners, connections to the public information infrastructure, and their use in naval and joint war fighting. Navy cyber systems face advanced attacks involving malicious changes to critical information, changes to the functionality of critical systems, denial of service (including jamming), and the destruction of systems and networks. Since many naval cyber systems are based on commercially available technologies, adversaries often have access to the technologies they seek to exploit.\n\nRapid changes in the underlying commercial and government cyber infrastructures makes cyber security an increasingly complex and dynamic problem. ISSP provides the Navy's warfighter the essential information trust characteristics of availability, confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. Information Assurance (IA)\/Computer Network Defense (CND), key supporting cyber security activities, must evolve quickly to meet the rapidly evolving threats and vulnerabilities. Implementing ISSP requires rapid acquisition approaches to stay ahead of nation-states, terrorists, and criminal organization adversaries, among others.\n\nThe Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) provides the Navy with the following cyber security elements: (1) defense of Navy's National Security Systems and Information (NSSI); (2) assured separation of information levels and user communities, including allied, coalition, non-Governmental, Defense Industrial Base, and other public partners; 3) technologies supporting the Navy's Computer Network Defense Service Providers (CNDSP) operations; (4) assurance of the Navy's telecommunications infrastructure and the wireless spectrum; (5) assurance of joint-user cyberspace domains, using a defense-in-depth architecture; (6) assurance of the critical computing base and information store; and, (7) supporting assurance technologies, including the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). The ISSP program must be rapid, predictive, adaptive, and tightly coupled to cyberspace technology. Through modeling and simulation of Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial cyberspace systems evolution, the ISSP program provides architectures, products, and services based on mission impacts, information criticality, threats, vulnerabilities, and required defensive countermeasure capabilities.\n\nAll ISSP Research Development Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) efforts comply with the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-113) as implemented through Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-119 of February 10, 1998, DoD Instruction 4120.24, Defense Standardization Program (DSP), and DoD Instruction 4120.3-M, Defense Standardization Program Policies and Procedures. The predominant commercial standard bodies in ISSP-related matters include International Organization for Standardization, American National Standards Institute, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Internet Engineering Task Force, World Wide Web Consortium, and National Institute of Standards and Technologies. The joint interoperability required in today's telecommunications systems makes standards compliance a must and the ISSP RDT&E program complies with the joint technical architecture. The FORCEnet architecture and standards documents reflect this emphasis on interoperable standards.\n\nThe connection of FORCEnet with the DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) requires all ISSP RDT&E activities to adopt a minimum standard of \"best commercial IA practices.\" The ISSP program examines commercial technologies to determine their fit within Navy architectures, provides feedback to vendors about what the Navy requires, and participates in the\nstandard bodies themselves. When necessary to protect mission critical systems specified in the Clinger\/Cohen Act, ISSP RDT&E develops or tailors commercial and government technologies, standards, and processes to meet Navy-unique requirements; prototypes systems or portions of systems and examines their utility in operational Navy settings; and,\nprovides Information Assurance (IA) expertise and engineering to Navy and joint information system developments. All ISSP technology development efforts endeavor to solve specific Navy and joint IA problems using techniques that speed transition to procurement as soon as possible.\n\nMaritime Operations Center (MOC) will respond to new technologies and advanced hardware and software tools to support the development and deployment towards automated autonomous Computer Network Operations (CNO) Network Operations (NetOps).\n\nJustification for Budget Activity: This program is funded under Operational Systems Development because it encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for the upgrade and integration of existing, operational systems. This includes cryptographic systems required to protect information defined in Title 40 United States Code (USC) Chapter 25 Sec 1452, and implements requirements in Executive Orders 12333 and 12958 and National Security Decision Directive 145.\n\nMajor focus areas in FY14 (By Program):\nComputer Network Defense (CND) - Continue to ensure that security of Navy networks meet the mandates and initiatives of DoD for securing the Global Information Grid (GIG).

                            "val": "The Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) Research Development Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) program provides Information Assurance (IA) solutions for the Navy forward deployed, highly mobile information subscriber. FORCEnet relies upon an assured information infrastructure, and the ISSP RDT&E program architects, engineers, and provides\nthe level of robustness consistent with risks faced. The ISSP addresses engineering design, development, modeling, test, and evaluation for the unique IA challenges associated with the highly mobile, dispersed, bandwidth limited, and forward-tactical connected United States (US) Navy communications systems.\n\nISSP RDT&E personnel work closely with the Navy's Information Operations (IO) - Exploit (Signals Intelligence (SI)) and IO - Attack (Information Warfare (IW)) communities. ISSP RDT&E-developed systems dynamically change the Navy's current information assurance posture, based upon operational indications and warnings. To ensure interoperability, ISSP RDT&E products integrate fully with the FORCEnet and maritime cryptologic architectures. ISSP RDT&E-developed systems can provide the trigger for offensive warfare activities.\n\nThis project includes a rapidly evolving design and application engineering effort to modernize national security-grade (Type-1) cryptographic equipment and ancillaries with state-of-the-art replacements to counter evolving and increasingly sophisticated threats, in accordance with The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6510 requirements. Communication Security (COMSEC) and Transmission Security (TRANSEC) evolution are from stand-alone dedicated devices to embedded modules incorporating National Security Agency (NSA) approved cryptographic engines, loaded with the certified algorithms and key, and interconnected via industry-defined interfaces. This includes the Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) capability requirements document for the development of Content Based Encryption (CBE).\n\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Improved Link Eleven (NILE) is a cooperative development project for Link 22 involving 7 nations: United States, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Canada, Italy and Spain. The US is responsible for all coordination of Information Security (INFOSEC) activities under the NILE project. In addition, the US controls the release of the crypto capability to the nations and all potential 3rd parties. The current Link 22 crypto (Link Level Crypto (LLC)) is obsolete and needs to be modernized per NSA and CJCS Crypto Modernization mandates.\n\nIn addition to protecting national security information, ISSP RDT&E efforts must provide enterprise-wide assurance for statutorily protected information under the Privacy Act of 1974, Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, Medical Records Confidentiality Act of 1995, Model State Public Health Privacy Act, 45 Code of Federal Regulation\nsubtitle A sub-chapter C, parts 160-164, 1999, and the Federal Education Records Privacy Act. ISSP RDT&E efforts must also provide assurance to the broad spectrum of sensitive but-unclassified information such as financial, personnel, contractor proprietary, and procurement sensitive. ISSP RDT&E must also provide solutions to the most advanced state-sponsored and criminal-intent advanced persistent threats, including those to platform Information Technology (IT), weapons systems, Industrial Control (ICS), and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA).\n\nThe Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) today includes more than legacy Communication Security (COMSEC) and network security technology. Information Assurance (IA) or defensive Information Operations (IO) exist to counter a wide variety of threats. ISSP activities cover all telecommunications systems, and RDT&E projects must provide protection, detection, and reaction capabilities to the operational commander. ISSP Research Development Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) efforts provide dynamic risk-managed IA solutions to the Navy information infrastructure, not just security devices placed within a network. Extensive effort will be placed on rapidly providing solutions required for the new DODI 8500.02, CNSSI 1253, and NIST SP 800-53 IA control set, focused primarily on espionage and sabotage capable, state-sponsored advanced persistent threats. Additional efforts will include the implementation of data object security labeling and provenance metadata, also required by DODI 8500.02, which is a major enabler for cross domain data sharing.\n\nFew technology areas change as fast as telecommunications and computers, and IA must keep pace. This results in the continuing need to evaluate, develop, and\/or test IA products and approaches. Technology-based efforts include developing or applying: (1) new secure voice prototypes; (2) technology for a new family of programmable COMSEC and Transmission Security (TRANSEC) modules; (3) security appliances and software for switched and routed networks; (4) technology to interconnect networks of dissimilar classification, known as Cross Domain Solutions; (5) techniques for assuring code and data residing in and transiting the Navy's computing base and information store; and (6) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and associated access control technologies such as SmartCards and similar security tokens; (7) Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) devices such as Simple Key Loaders (SKL), COMSEC Material Work Stations (CMWS), and Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) equipment (Client Management (MGC)\/Advanced Key Processor (AKP) MGC\/AKPs, High Assurance Protocol Equipment, Delivery Only Client (DOC) and Next Generation devices.\n\nISSP efforts conclude with continuously monitored, certified, and accredited systems supported within Navy cyber operational environments. Achieving and maintaining this milestone requires:\n\n* Evolving techniques for defense of National Security Systems (NSS) and Information against advanced persistent threats, including process, control, and sensor layers;\n* Approved techniques for the assured separation of information levels and user communities, including allied, coalition, non-Governmental, Defense Industrial Base, and other public partners;\n* Rapid deployment of technologies supporting the Navy's Computer Network Defense Service Providers (CNDSP) operations;\n* Hardware and software to assure end-to-end resilience of the Navy's telecommunications infrastructure and availability of the critical wireless spectrum resource;\n* High robustness interfaces with joint user and platform cyberspace domains, using a defense-in-depth architecture;\n* COMSEC and process isolation techniques for securing the critical computing base and information store.\n\nThe cyberspace domain has virtually eliminated the traditional distinction between telecommunications and information systems. Because cyber security is a cradle-to-grave enterprise-wide discipline, this program applies the set of best practices embodied within the Committee on National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) 1253.\n\nOf special note is the Navy's cyber security role in the joint Cryptographic Modernization Program, required by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instructions (CJCSI) 6510.02D, providing high assurance and other cryptographic technologies protecting cyber systems. The parallel Security Management Infrastructure (SMI) program develops, evaluates, and applies new emerging technologies and enhanced capabilities to the EKMS\/KMI. \n\nAdditional efforts will focus on the architecture, design, and development of systems to manage the security parameters (e.g., cryptographic keys) necessary to the operation of the\nsystems developed by the secure data and secure voice portions of the ISSP. This includes the application of EKMS\/KMI Infrastructure technology, and the development of improved\ntechniques for key and certificate management. \n\nInformation Systems Security Program (ISSP) Research Development Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) management will direct a program that:\n* Ensures the Navy's cyber domain implements consistent joint and enterprise cyber security architecture;\n* Rapidly develops and deploys the latest versions of cyber security measures across all seven layers of the Information Organization of Standardization (ISO) Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model and for all Committee on National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) 1253\nInformation Assurance (IA) controls (best practices);\n* Ensures that all data within the Navy Enterprise is protected in accordance with its classification and mission criticality, as required by law;\n* Provides Fleet Cyber Command and Commander U.S. Tenth Fleet (C10F) with integrated tools and techniques to protect, detect, restore, and respond to cyber events and incidents;\n* Supports the Navy Computer Network Defense (CND) provider by enabling cyber situational awareness;\n* Defends against and detects the unauthorized modification or disclosure of data outside the Navy cyber domain, such as in the WikiLeaks incident;\n* Provides a risk-managed means of selectively allowing information to flow across the enclave boundary while ensuring proper marking and provenance;\n* Provides strong authentication of users accessing services from Navy cyberspace;\n* Defends against the unauthorized use of a host or application, particularly operating systems, control and process systems, and supervisory control and data acquisition systems;\n* Maintains cyber security configuration management of all hosts to track patches and system configuration changes;\n* Ensures adequate defenses against subversive acts of trusted people and systems, both internal and external;\n* Provides a Communications Security (COMSEC) infrastructure that supports key, privilege, and certificate management; and that enables positive identification of individuals\nutilizing network services; and,\n* Provides a continuous monitoring, analysis, assessment, situational awareness, and response infrastructure.\n\nMaritime Operations Center (MOC) networks will operate and share information with multiple partners in varying circumstances. The MOCs will receive integrated tools to maintain a Network Operations (NetOps) Common Operational Picture (COP) and support Command and Control (C2) of the Communications Systems (CS) through the ability to analyze and develop Courses of Action (COA) to manage C2 cyberspace operations. This includes CYBER Surveillance, bandwidth monitoring, INTEL situational awareness tools, and network health monitoring. NetOps COP will provide a proactive view and enhanced security tool for use by CYBER network managers. NetOps COP ensures validity of the COP, network health, and provides operator synchronization with Information Operations (IO), and situational awareness of the cyber battle space. A combination of software tools, interoperable enabling hardware and processes will be provided to monitor and visualize network traffic and to provide a locally-generated, fused situational awareness picture for battle watch decision making. NetOps COP provides the Commander with near immediate risk assessment, actionable intelligence and immediate mitigation courses of action and attribution of on-going CS Protection events in order to enable the apportionment of forces with exacting control in response to national objectives.\n\nFY 14 Highlights for Information Systems Security Programs (ISSP):\n\nComputer Network Defense (CND) - Continue to implement Department of Defense (DoD)\/Information Assurance (IA)\/CND Enterprise Solutions Steering Group (ESSG) tools into Outside the Continental United States (US) Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-Net), Information Technology for the 21st Century (IT-21), and other networks such as Cyber Asset Reduction & Security (CARS) as required.

NSA is the lead for the joint EKMS effort and has been developing and certifying EKMS devices and capabilities in an evolutionary approach. EKMS Phase V is a major component evolving to KMI Capability Increment 2 (CI-2). Products that are procured and fielded include: Tactical Key Loader, Simple Key Loader, Next Generation Fill devices.\n\nKey Management Infrastructure (KMI) - KMI is the next generation EKMS system that is net centric in nature, providing the infrastructure for management, ordering and distribution of key material as well as directly supporting the key requirements of all Crypto modernization efforts. Products that are procured and fielded include: Advanced Key Processor (AKP), Management Client (MGC - computer , printer, scanner, monitors, key boards, hard drives, Type -1 tokens, card reader and mice), and High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryption devices. Navy will continue to provide and refine Navy unique requirements into the NSA KMI CI-2 Spiral 2 Spin 2 capability. In parallel, KMI will: (1) continue to define Navy operational architecture and requirements for roll-out (limited) of this new capability in the Fiscal Year 2014; (2) provide and refine Navy unique requirements into the NSA KMI CI-3 Capability Development Document (CDD); and (3) investigate alternative KMI architecture implementations for submarine and other communities within the Navy.\n\nCryptographic Modernization (CM) - The procurement and fielding of Modernized Crypto devices such as the KG-3X Inc 2, KG-45A, AN-PYQ-20 (formerly KL-51M), KW-46M, KG-175D, KG-175A, Very High Frequency (VHF)\/Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Wideband Tactical Secure Voice Cryptologic Equipment (VINSON)\/Advanced Narrowband Digital Voice Terminal (ANDVT) Cryptographic modernization (VACM), KIV-7M WALBURN and SAVILLE Communications Security (COMSEC) Crypto Serial Replacement will provide replacements of legacy crypto in accordance with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) mandate (CJCS Instruction 6510) as well as the NSA's planned decertification, which improves the security of the Navy's data in transit.\n\nComputer Network Defense (CND) - The CND program procures equipment to secure Navy information system networks. Procurements within the CND equipment line include: Firewall components which provide protection for networks from unauthorized users, Virtual Private Networks (VPN) which provide encrypted \"Point-to-Point\" virtual communication networks, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), Administrator Access Control, Network Security tools and Filtering routers. The rapid advance of cyber technology requires an efficient process for updating CND tools deployed to afloat and shore platforms. Recognizing the need for future CND capability improvements, CND implements an evolutionary acquisition strategy that delivers CND capabilities in multiple builds and functionality releases that address validated requirements."

                            "val": "The goal of the Navy Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) is to ensure the continued protection of Navy and joint information and information systems from hostile exploitation and attack. ISSP activities address the triad of Defense Information Operations: protection, detection, and reaction. Evolving attack sensing (detection), warning, and response (reaction) responsibilities extend far beyond the traditional ISSP role in protection or Information Systems Security (INFOSEC). Focused on the highly mobile forward-deployed subscriber, the Navy's adoption of Network-Centric Warfare (NCW) places demands upon the ISSP, as the number of users expands significantly and the criticality of their use escalates. Today, the ISSP protects an expanding core of services critical to the effective performance of the Navy's mission.\n\nThe rapid rate of change in the underlying commercial and government information infrastructures makes the provision of security an increasingly complex and dynamic problem. Information Assurance (IA) technology mix and deployment strategies must evolve quickly to meet rapidly evolving threats and vulnerabilities. No longer can information security be divorced from the information infrastructure. The ISSP enables the Navy's war fighter to trust in the availability, integrity, authentication, privacy, and non-repudiation of information. \n\nThis project includes funds for advanced technology development, test and evaluation of naval information systems security based on leading edge technologies that will improve information assurance (e.g., situational awareness and information infrastructure protection) across all command echelons to tactical units afloat and war fighters ashore. This effort will provide the research to develop a secure seamless interoperable, common operational environment of networked information systems in the battle space and for monitoring and protecting the information infrastructure from malicious activities. This effort will provide naval forces a secure capability and basis in its achievement of protection from unauthorized access and misuse, and optimized IA resource allocations in the information battle space. This program will also develop core technology to: (1) improve network infrastructure resistance and resiliency to attacks; (2) enable the rapid development and certification of security-aware applications and information technologies in accordance with the Common Criteria for IA and IA-enabled information technology products by the National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Instructions; and (3) measure the effectiveness and efficiency of IA defensive capabilities under naval environments.\n\nThe program will develop common architectural frameworks that facilitate integration of network security capabilities, enable effective seamless interoperation, and contribute to a common consistent picture of the networked environment with respect to information assurance and security. This effort will address the need for a common operational picture for IA, as well as assessment of security technology critical to the success of the mission. This effort will also initiate requirements definition for situational awareness capabilities to support computer network defense in a highly-distributed, homogeneous, and heterogeneous networks including mobile and embedded networked devices. This effort also includes the architectural definition of situational awareness and visualization capabilities to support active computer network defense and support underlying data mining and correlation tools. This includes addressing the capability to remotely manage and securely control the configurations of network security components to implement changes in real time or near real time. Program will also initiate requirements definition for secure coalition data exchange and interoperation among security levels and classifications, and ensure approaches address various security level technologies as well as emerging architectural methods of providing interoperability across different security levels. Examine multi-level aware applications and technologies including databases, web browsers, routers\/switches, etc. Efforts will also initiate infrastructure protection efforts as the Navy develops network centric architectures and warfare concepts, ensuring an evolutionary development of security architectures and products for IA that addresses Navy infrastructure requirements. IA will ensure the architectures evolve to provide proper protection as technology, DoD missions, and threats continuously evolve. IA includes defensive protections as well as intrusion monitoring (sensors), warning mechanisms, and response capabilities in the architecture. Ensure the unique security and performance requirements of tactical systems, including those operating various security levels are addressed. Also, the program will initiate the efforts to conceptualize new network centric warfare technology to protect our assets, such as secure network gateways, routers, components and tools that improve the survivability of Navy networks. Last, IA will provide systems security engineering, certification and accreditation support for high-confidence naval information systems and ensure certification and accreditation approaches are consistent with Navy and DoD requirements.\n\nMajor focus areas in FY14:  Continue development of new network security demands addressing nation-state level sponsored activity. Incorporate security services to thwart DNS attacks, distributed denial of service, botnet and other sophisticated attacks."

Efforts also include the conduct of systems engineering and architect Theater Network Operations and Security (TNSOC) modifications required to support ONE-Net environment security enhancements and network efficiencies. Funding establishes a lab environment that can support the development of Ozone Widget framework tools. Also, CND develops the architecture and integrated tools that support the automation of certification and accreditation processes in-line with Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) imperatives for continuous network monitoring and risk scoring. Funding is used to determine optimal technical and governance solution for interception of outbound encrypted traffic, allowing for inspection and control. Last, CND will be updated development lab hardware will be updated to ensure Charleston Network Operations Center (CHASNOC), SSC Pacific Afloat, and End-to-End (E2C) labs contain the most current CND cyber security technologies. This also promoted comprehensive implementation of Host Based Security Systems (HBSS) and other DoD mandated tools and capabilities."
