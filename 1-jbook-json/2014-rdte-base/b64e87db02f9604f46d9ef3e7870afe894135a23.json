            "val": "JPALS is an Acquisition Category 1D program.  System development includes an incremental approach employing a family of Land-Based (fixed and deployable) and Sea-based systems.  On 16 March 2007, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved the Capability Development Document (CDD) for the JPALS family of systems and Increment 1 for the Sea-Based System and designated the Navy as the JPALS lead Department of Defense (DoD) Service and lead Component for the Sea-Based System.  On 19 January 2010, the JROC approved Increment 2 CDD for the Land-Based System and designated the Air Force as the lead Component for the Land-Based System.\nAs reflected in the JPALS CDD, JPALS was intended to be the next generation precision approach and landing system which would provide a common interoperable system for both DoD and civil use.  A cornerstone of the JPALS implementation strategy was parallel development and implementation with the FAA Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) which was based on the same GPS Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) technology.    However, since the CDD was approved, the pace of the FAA LAAS implementation and phase down of the legacy instrument landing system has slowed.  This, combined with the several billion dollar cost for aircraft equipage and the need to fund higher Air Force priorities, resulted in the Air Force delaying JPALS implementation for the foreseeable future.  The Army has also delayed JPALS implementation beyond the current future years defense plan. \nAs JPALS is now early to need for the Air Force, Land-Based Increment 2 development responsibility is being transferred from the Air Force to the Navy.  The Navy has a near term need in FY17 for a shore based system to support Joint Strike Fighter carrier landing training ashore.  The Air Force will monitor the progress of JPALS implementation but, in the interim, continue the use of the legacy Instrument Landing System (ILS).  ILS is supportable through the 2030 timeframe and, in its fixed and deployable configuration, will provide an effective and affordable landing system capability.  The Air Force will also retain a limited number mobile precision approach radars to provide joint Service interoperability at deployed location as all Navy and Army aircraft are not ILS equipped."

                            "val": "JPALS is an Acquisition Category ID program.  System development includes an incremental approach employing a family of Land-Based (fixed and deployable) and Sea-Based systems.  On 16 March 2007, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved the Capability Development Document (CDD) for the JPALS family of systems and Increment 1 for the Sea-Based System and designated the Navy as the JPALS lead Department of Defense (DoD) Service and lead Component for the Sea-Based System.  On 19 January 2010, the JROC approved Increment 2 CDD for the Land-Based System and designated the Air Force as the lead Component for the Land-Based System.\n\nAs reflected in the JPALS CDD, JPALS is intended to be the next generation precision approach and landing system which would provide a common interoperable system for both DoD and civil use.  A cornerstone of the JPALS implementation strategy was parallel development and implementation with the Federal Aviation Administration Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) which was based on the same GPS Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) technology.  However, since the CDD was approved, the pace of the FAA LAAS implementation and phase down of the legacy instrument landing system has slowed.  This, combined with an on-going tech refresh (life extension) of the legacy Instrument Landing System (ILS), development of a Deployable ILS, the fact that new platforms (F-35, KC-46) will be ILS equipped, and the need to fund higher Air Force priorities, the Air Force is delaying JPALS implementation for the foreseeable future.  The Army has also delayed JPALS implementation beyond the current future years defense plan. \n\nAs JPALS is now early to need for the Air Force, Land-Based Increment 2 development responsibility is being transferred from the Air Force to the Navy.  Both Service Acquisition Executives are in agreement on transfer of the Land-Based Increment 2.  The Navy has a near term need in FY17 for a shore based system to support Joint Strike Fighter carrier landing training.  The Air Force will monitor the progress of JPALS implementation but, in the interim, continue the use of the legacy Instrument Landing System (ILS).  ILS is supportable through the 2030 timeframe and, in its fixed and deployable configuration, will provide an effective and affordable landing system capability.  The Air Force will also retain a limited number mobile precision approach radars to provide joint Service interoperability at deployed location as all Navy and Army aircraft are not ILS equipped.\n\nAs JPALS Land-Based Incremement 2 is being transferred to the Navy beginning in FY13, no FY14 funding is requested.  The Navy program element is 0603860N\/ Project 3354.         \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."
