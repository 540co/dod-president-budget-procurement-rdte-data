            "val": "The four aircraft E-4B National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) fleet satisfies the military need for an airborne operations center with communications capabilities that permit military and civilian leadership to monitor and control military and civil national assets during all phases of nuclear and non-nuclear conflict or natural disaster. The E-4B NAOC fleet also satisfies the military requirement to provide a highly survivable node of the National Military Command System (NMCS). \n\nThis PE's developmental modifications include, but are not limited to, upgrades and enhancements to aircraft structures, propulsion system, fuel system, environmental control system, electrical generation and distribution systems, flight safety and navigation systems (with their associated communications equipment), and the related aircraft operations center facilities, equipment, and communications necessary for the E-4B fleet to execute its mission. Additionally, funds may be used to explore modifications, upgrades, and future systems required to meet evolving mission requirements. Developmental modifications and studies\/projects currently underway or planned for accomplishment under this program include:\n\n- The Super High Frequency Multiplexor (SHF MUX) effort integrates an upgraded, and logistically supportable, MUX to replace the obsolete legacy solution. The legacy SHF MUX is prone to intermittent disconnects and poor performance. The updated device will allow the E-4B to efficiently combine secure and non-secure digital data streams via satellite.\n\n- The Communication, Navigation, Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) efforts upgrade the air traffic communications systems to improve navigation and instrument approach capabilities. These efforts are necessary to maintain air worthiness certifications for the E-4B platform. CNS\/ATM is an incremental program, and this effort will specifically address:\n  -- Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out) capability\n  -- Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) capability\n  -- Multi-Mode Receiver for Global Positioning System (GPS) Precision Instrument Approaches \n  -- Updates to the obsolete Flight Management Computer (FMC)\n\n- The SHF Modernization program updates system to meet immediate needs, and eventual replacement of the SHF System. Upgrade of the current SHF system is required in the near-term to replace the most critically obsolete components to ensure that the system remains operable and logistically supportable until a replacement system is fielded. A replacement to the SHF system is required as secure, survivable communications capability transitions from the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS).\n\n- The Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Compatible Terminal\/ Presidential National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) Program integrates externally provided  AEHF Compatible Command Post Terminals and PNVC capability onto the E-4B NAOC platform. This integration is necessary to replace the legacy Military Strategic, Tactical and Relay (MILSTAR) terminal, and provide access to protected wideband AEHF satellite networks. PNVC replaces Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN), which will not be supported once the AEHF satellite network is in place.\n\n- The Low Frequency Transmit System (LFTS) program will replace the current Very Low Frequency\/Low Frequency (VLF\/LF) Transmit system that is on the E-4B. The current system has been on the E-4B for over 35 years and is past its useful life. This system must be replaced in order to meet existing National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-28 requirements and ensure there is constant and consistent connectivity to National Leaders and Forces in real world situations. The transmit system consists of three primary equipment groups: a Receiver\/Transmitter group, a Power Amplifier-Coupler (PA-C) group, and a Trailing Wire Antenna (TWA) group.\n\n- The Secure Data Crypto modification replaces various E-4B cryptographic systems currently scheduled to be decertified by the National Security Agency (NSA). This modification ensures the continued transmission and receipt of critical strategic force orders. Funds for this modification will be used to design an engineering solution, develop compatible software, and conduct pre-production studies for integration of NSA approved and Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) compliant secure data cryptographic devices and associated peripherals on the aircraft.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The updated device will allow the E-4B to efficiently combine secure and non-secure digital data streams via satellite.\n\n- The Communication, Navigation, Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) efforts upgrade the air traffic communications systems to improve navigation and instrument approach capabilities. These efforts are necessary to maintain air worthiness certifications for the E-4B platform. CNS\/ATM is an incremental program, and this effort will specifically address:\n  -- Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out) capability\n  -- Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) capability\n  -- Multi-Mode Receiver for Global Positioning System (GPS) Precision Instrument Approaches \n  -- Updates to the obsolete Flight Management Computer (FMC)\n\n- The SHF Modernization program updates system to meet immediate needs, and eventual replacement of the SHF System. Upgrade of the current SHF system is required in the near-term to replace the most critically obsolete components to ensure that the system remains operable and logistically supportable until a replacement system is fielded. A replacement to the SHF system is required as secure, survivable communications capability transitions from the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS).\n\n- The Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Compatible Terminal\/ Presidential National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) Program integrates externally provided  AEHF Compatible Command Post Terminals and PNVC capability onto the E-4B NAOC platform. This integration is necessary to replace the legacy Military Strategic, Tactical and Relay (MILSTAR) terminal, and provide access to protected wideband AEHF satellite networks. PNVC replaces Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN), which will not be supported once the AEHF satellite network is in place.\n\n- The Low Frequency Transmit System (LFTS) program will replace the current Very Low Frequency\/Low Frequency (VLF\/LF) Transmit system that is on the E-4B. The current system has been on the E-4B for over 35 years and is past its useful life. This system must be replaced in order to meet existing National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-28 requirements and ensure there is constant and consistent connectivity to National Leaders and Forces in real world situations. The transmit system consists of three primary equipment groups: a Receiver\/Transmitter group, a Power Amplifier-Coupler (PA-C) group, and a Trailing Wire Antenna (TWA) group.\n\n- The Secure Data Crypto modification replaces various E-4B cryptographic systems currently scheduled to be decertified by the National Security Agency (NSA). This modification ensures the continued transmission and receipt of critical strategic force orders. Funds for this modification will be used to design an engineering solution, develop compatible software, and conduct pre-production studies for integration of NSA approved and Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) compliant secure data cryptographic devices and associated peripherals on the aircraft.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
