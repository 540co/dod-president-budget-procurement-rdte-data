            "val": "The Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) system is an evolutionary acquisition program that provides significantly improved defensive systems capability for DoD aircraft to counter the infrared (IR) man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) missile threat.  The current LAIRCM system configuration [AN\/AAQ-24V] consists of an ultra-violet missile warning sensor (MWS), a laser transmitter assembly, control interface unit (CIU) and processors to detect, track, jam and counter incoming IR missiles.  The number of sensors and turrets per aircraft is determined by the size and signature of the aircraft.  The system is fully automatic following system power-up.  LAIRCM requirements are documented in the multi-command Operational Requirements Document (ORD) LAIRCM ORD 314-92, validated on 03 Aug 98.  The system was first fielded on the C-17 aircraft.\n\nThe baseline program development is complete and consists of the small laser transmitter assembly (SLTA), ultra-violet MWS, processor, control interface unit (CIU) and a repeater (on some aircraft) to meet the need for advanced IR countermeasures.  The Guardian Laser Transmitter Assembly (GLTA) is an upgrade to the baseline transmitter equipment to improve reliability, enhance performance, address obsolescence issues, reduce mass and improve overall functionality.  First production GLTA delivery occurred in June 08.\n\nDevelopment of the Next Generation Missile Warning System (NexGen MWS) is complete and includes new hardware that improves capability.  Baseline equipment (ultra-violet MWS) will be retrofitted with the NexGen MWS as it becomes available.  Developmental test\/operational test (DT\/OT) was conducted in FY10 with initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E) in FY11.  \n\nPer DoD direction LAIRCM program will accomplish group A integration and testing and provide integration support to incorporate LAIRCM on new platforms, upon request of AMC, AFSOC, multiple potential tanker aircraft variants, and other federal agencies. The last Integragtion effort will be completed in FY14.\n\nLAIRCM upgrades include, but are not limited to hardware and software upgrades and testing of the LAIRCM system to maintain defensive capability against new and emerging threats.  Capabilities include engagement reporting (ER), Closed Loop Infrared Countermeasures (CLIRCM) and other emerging capabilities to upgrade\/update system threat defeating ability. \n\nCurrent and future efforts include Threat Analysis; Modeling, Simulation and Emulation Test; Jam Code Development; and Studies and Analysis.  \n\nThreat Analysis encompasses the activities to support threat exploitation analysis of a variety of threats (both known and emerging) against the current LAIRCM jam code with the intent of determining if jam code updates are required.  Typical threat analysis activities include: threat seeker characterization; model development for advanced threat IR seekers; development and testing of new infrared countermeasures concepts, techniques, and hardware; new technology assessment for potential incorporation into the LAIRCM system, and the evaluation\/exploitation of new threats and threat characteristics relative to IRCM. \n\nModeling, Simulation, and Emulation Test activities verify and validate the information obtained from threat analysis activities.  These activities include: evaluation of IRCM techniques used in defeating real threat hardware; developing and evaluating jam code, validating and verifying integration of LAIRCM system components to newly developed jam codes, software or hardware, evaluating system effectiveness, performing platform integration support tests, and conducting predictive risk reduction tests prior to Live Missile Fire Test (LMFT) or on aircraft flight testing.\n\nJam code development would be initiated when the threat analysis activities identify and the modeling, simulation, and emulation test activities validate and verify jam code vulnerabilities that make the system less effective.  Activities include all work efforts necessary to develop an efficient and effective jam code.\n\nStudies and Analysis include logistics, programmatic, and engineering efforts to ensure continued systems viability and sustainability.\n\nProgram management and administration efforts consist of, but are not limited to contract services and Government costs.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Developmental test\/operational test (DT\/OT) was conducted in FY10 with initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E) in FY11.  \n\nPer DoD direction LAIRCM program will accomplish group A integration and testing and provide integration support to incorporate LAIRCM on new platforms, upon request of AMC, AFSOC, multiple potential tanker aircraft variants, and other federal agencies. The last Integragtion effort will be completed in FY14.\n\nLAIRCM upgrades include, but are not limited to hardware and software upgrades and testing of the LAIRCM system to maintain defensive capability against new and emerging threats.  Capabilities include engagement reporting (ER), Closed Loop Infrared Countermeasures (CLIRCM) and other emerging capabilities to upgrade\/update system threat defeating ability. \n\nCurrent and future efforts include Threat Analysis; Modeling, Simulation and Emulation Test; Jam Code Development; and Studies and Analysis.  \n\nThreat Analysis encompasses the activities to support threat exploitation analysis of a variety of threats (both known and emerging) against the current LAIRCM jam code with the intent of determining if jam code updates are required.  Typical threat analysis activities include: threat seeker characterization; model development for advanced threat IR seekers; development and testing of new infrared countermeasures concepts, techniques, and hardware; new technology assessment for potential incorporation into the LAIRCM system, and the evaluation\/exploitation of new threats and threat characteristics relative to IRCM. \n\nModeling, Simulation, and Emulation Test activities verify and validate the information obtained from threat analysis activities.  These activities include: evaluation of IRCM techniques used in defeating real threat hardware; developing and evaluating jam code, validating and verifying integration of LAIRCM system components to newly developed jam codes, software or hardware, evaluating system effectiveness, performing platform integration support tests, and conducting predictive risk reduction tests prior to Live Missile Fire Test (LMFT) or on aircraft flight testing.\n\nJam code development would be initiated when the threat analysis activities identify and the modeling, simulation, and emulation test activities validate and verify jam code vulnerabilities that make the system less effective.  Activities include all work efforts necessary to develop an efficient and effective jam code.\n\nStudies and Analysis include logistics, programmatic, and engineering efforts to ensure continued systems viability and sustainability.\n\nProgram management and administration efforts consist of, but are not limited to contract services and Government costs.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
