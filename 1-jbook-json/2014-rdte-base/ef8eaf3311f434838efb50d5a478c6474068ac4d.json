This mission has two key aspects.  First, to develop and\/or demonstrate and rapidly transition into the force operational energy technologies or practices that will improve the Department\u2019s military capabilities and\/or reduce its costs.  Second, to establish within the military Services sustainable institutional capacities that will continue to research, develop and adopt operational energy innovations.  OECIF funds serve as \u201cseed money\u201d to consolidate or start promising operational energy programs or directions to be sustained by the Services; accordingly, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs, rather than one-off projects.\n\nP456 The Hybrid Energy Storage Module (HESM) project explores advanced technology development of hybrid energy storage associated with providing the capability to enhance fuel efficiency, maximize performance and reliability, and enable future high power weapons and sensors systems on legacy and next generation Army and USMC battlefield generators and vehicles, Air Force and Navy aircraft and Navy ships.  This project will demonstrate scalable energy storage systems with high power and energy densities, high rate capability that: reduce total logistics replenishment of fuel and material; increase platform and vehicle ability to sustain operations during engagement; and reduce maintenance and other events that interfere with mission capability.  Post the demonstration completion, this technology will be further sustained by the Services."

Consistent with the mission of this funding, these programs are being executed by the Services and PACOM.  An Army\/Navy program to improve the efficiency of vapor compression cooling systems in forward areas began work on various component technologies and environmental data reduction and model development.  A complementary Navy\/ARPA-E program to pursue high risk, high reward deployable cooling technologies determined the needed capabilities and began a process to select ARPA-E technologies to leverage.  An Army\/Air Force program to develop energy efficient soft shelters\/tents established technical baselines and thermal models of shelter systems, began to identify and mature technologies to reduce energy consumption and coordinated a variety of related technology, test and demonstration activities.  A Navy program to improve the energy efficiency of containerized living units (CLUs) began testing component technologies and investigating new shelter configurations\/designs for a super-efficient CLU.  A PACOM\/DOE program to evaluate an array of technologies to reduce energy loads in tropical environments, partly through a deployable testbed, conducted some initial tests and set up its outreach network, which is designed to reach a variety of organizations that offer promising technologies.\n\nThese five programs were complemented by several other efforts.  One such effort involves establishing a quantitative basis for energy use of expeditionary outposts in Afghanistan; this program instrumented and began collecting data on various equipment in the field.  Another is a joint program with the Strategic Environmental Research and Development program (SERDP) to develop practical, deployable waste to energy systems; that program awarded contracts to develop conceptual designs and test prototypes.  Finally, there is a program to develop modeling and simulation technology to assess operational energy effects in ground operations."

The Army\/Air Force soft shelters\/tent program will conduct first generation technical testing in relevant locales to validate reductions in energy consumption compared to the baseline and continue improving energy efficiency through thermal modeling, further technology maturation, and optimizing second generation, system-level designs.  The Navy CLU program will continue testing various component technologies as potential upgrades for existing CLUs and design and prototype a new super-efficient CLU.  The PACOM\/DOE program will test additional technologies during several exercises and continue to build-up and improve its outreach network.  The data collection program in Afghanistan will finish collecting data and then analyze the results.  The waste to energy program with SERDP will complete the design of waste-to-energy systems and construct prototype systems. \n\nThe key new initiative in FY 2013 will be the start up of broad efforts to improve DoD\u2019s operational energy performance particularly by involving nontraditional innovators and small businesses in meeting DoD\u2019s operational energy challenges.  These new programs will emphasize the use of innovative business methods, such as consortia, to establish standing forums for sustained interaction between DoD and a broad variety of non-government organizations.  Possible topics for these consortia or similar organizations include dismounted power, power supply networks for expeditionary outposts, and tactics, techniques and procedures for energy efficient operations.

The Army\/Air Force soft shelters\/tent program will conduct second generation technical testing in relevant locales to validate a 50 percent reduction in energy consumption compared to the baseline and transition technologies to appropriate programs.  The Navy CLU program will finalize the design and conduct a field test of the super-efficient CLU.  The PACOM\/DOE program will test and refine additional load reduction technologies for tropical environments, validate the data collected in previous assessments, and look for additional DoD partners with similar or related challenges.  The waste to energy program with SERDP will evaluate the prototype systems using waste streams that simulate those encountered at expeditionary base camps.\n\nFY 2014 new starts will focus on filling one or more of the operational energy technology gaps identified in a technology gap assessment completed by ASD(R&E) at the end of FY 2012.  Consistent with the mission of this funding, these new programs will aim to fill some of the identified gaps by funding the startup of sustainable S&T programs within the Services.  The five top priority gaps are: High Efficiency Energy Conversion; Energy Integrated Design and Simulation; High Efficiency Propulsion; Environmental Control Units; Flexible and Adaptive Power Distribution."

This project will demonstrate scalable energy storage systems with high power and energy densities, high rate capability that: reduce total logistics replenishment of fuel and material; increase platform and vehicle ability to sustain operations during engagement; and reduce maintenance and other events that interfere with mission capability.  Post the demonstration completion, this technology will be further sustained by the Services. This program is closely coordinated with the Advanced Management and Protection of Energy-storage Devices (AMPED) program of the Department of Energy\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency \u2013 Energy (ARPA-E). AMPED technology will be used to potentially extend the operational performance benefits and safety for these applications beyond the hybrid storage module baseline design configurations."
