            "val": "This program element provides for development, testing and integration of specialized equipment in the areas of automation, communication, radio, weapon, soldier protection and survival, visual augmentation, lasers and sensor, munition and military information support operations (MISO) systems.  The efforts within this PE improves Special Operations Forces (SOF) war fighting capabilities, by continuing efforts to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust capabilities.  The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability while, generally, being conducted in harsh environments for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  Communications efforts will maintain a Command, Control, and Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams, and provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies and allied foreign forces.  Efforts relating to soldier protection and survival requirements will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Specialized visual augmentation, lasers and sensors will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Munition efforts include advanced engineering operational system development and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar munitions and equipment.  Additionally, MISO efforts include planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups and individuals.  \n\nWarrior Systems specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.    SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.\n\nTactical Systems Development:\nThis project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF. Tactical systems provide forward deployed forces with advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control of forces. \n\nCommunications Equipment and Electronics Systems:\nThis project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support SOF.  SOF units require communications equipment that improves their war fighting capability without degrading their mobility.  Therefore, SOF Communications Equipment and Electronics is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.\n\nTactical Radio Systems:\nThis project is for development of all SOF tactical radio programs.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their war fighting capability without degrading their mobility.  United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  SOF Tactical Radios provide the critical Command, Control, and Communication (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in overseas contingency operations (OCO) and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied\/coalition forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed Command and Control (C2) communications between infiltrated\/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.\n\nWeapons Systems:\nThis project provides for next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I), testing, and integration of specialized weapon systems and weapon accessories to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Current efforts include; but are not limited to the life cycle replacement of the MK13 by the Precision Sniper Rifle and an anti-materiel rifle that will pursue heavy sniper system technology to provide SOF with precision engagement capabilities on materiel target.  In the weapons accessories program, efforts are currently focusing on muzzle brakes and suppressors and P3I for a variety of accessories, both individual and crew served by leveraging the latest technological advances in optical accessories.  \n\nSoldier Protection and Survival Systems:\nThis project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized equipment to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized equipment will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Current efforts include, but are not limited to counter-improvised explosive device system improvements and testing to meet the continual changing technology on the battlefield. \n\nTheater Body Armor and Associated Equipment:\nNote:  The National Defense Authorization Act of 2010 directed a separate project (S385A) be created for ballistic protection efforts.\nThis project provides specialized equipment to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF with ballistic protection.  Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability and load bearing equipment impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  This project funding enhances the SPEAR program by supporting body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, and eye protection.  It also provides for the research, development, and testing of a variety of body armor and personal protective equipment to meet the current ballistic threats that exists on the battlefield.\n\nVisual Augmentation, Lasers and Sensor Systems:\nThis project provides for next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I), testing, and integration of specialized visual augmentation, laser and sensor systems equipment to meet the unique requirement of SOF.  Programs in this area include; but are not limited to  binocular\/monocular devices, visual augmentation for both crew-served and individual systems; leveraging the latest technological advances.  A current capability shortfalls identified by the SOF is the ability to detect, classify, and engage targets out to 800 meters without the use of an infra-red illuminator. \n\nMunitions Advanced Development:\nThis project provides for the advanced engineering operational system development and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar munitions and equipment.  Funding supports development of Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology and evaluation, in accordance with statutory requirement set forth in U.S. Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 (December 2001).  (Including bullet impact, fast cook off, fragment impact, slow cook off, sympathetic detonation, and shaped charge test.)  Testing is in accordance with the USSOCOM  IM Strategic Plan.  Funding also support efforts to develop and improve Stand-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM); including the development and integration of improved warheads, seeker, guidance navigation and control systems operational flight software and missile delivery to meet SOF requirements.\n\nMISO:\nThis project provides for the development, test and integration of MISO equipment.  MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct MISO in support of combatant commanders."

The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration within the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a multitude of existing and projected national assets that allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments. \n\n \u2022 SOF Deployable Node (SDN) is a family of satellite communications systems that includes the following variants:  heavy, medium, and light.  This program consists of a family of deployable, super high frequency, multi-band, satellite communications (SATCOM) systems capable of supporting high-capacity, voice, data, and video services at all levels of classification.\n\n\u2022  The Special Communications Enterprise program (SPCOM) includes organizations, practices, processes, services, networks, systems and subsystems that manage and provide clandestine exchange of information between elements (field-to-field, field-to-base, base-to-field).

SOF often deploys as small, independent, quick reaction, foot-mobile teams independent of primary logistics support. Existing weapons and combat equipment are frequently unsuited to these conditions.  Sub-projects include:\n\nFamily of Sniper Weapon Systems (FSWS). This program includes next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I) to current sniper systems.  Next-generation systems include two variants: a (PSR) as a life cycle replacement of the current .300 Winchester Magnum rifle (MK13) that is intended to provide SOF with a highly accurate weapon system capable of engaging targets at ranges equal to or better than the MK13, and an anti-materiel rifle that will pursue heavy sniper system technology to provide SOF with precision engagement capabilities on materiel targets.\n\nWeapons Accessories (WPNAC).  This program effort enhances all SOF weapons, both individual and crew served, by leveraging the latest technological advances in optional accessories (up to 30 different functions\/capabilities) such as day scopes, clip-on night scopes, active aiming laser module, visible lights, grenade launchers, suppressors, hand grips, and close quarters battle sights. Miniature Day-Night Sight (MDNS) for Crew-served Weapons enhances all SOF weapons, by leveraging existing image intensification and thermal technology to improve combat effectiveness for all crew served weapon systems.  Development efforts include test and evaluation of the Advanced Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Laser (ATPIAL) hardening to withstand the live-fire shock profiles for the Combat Assault Rifle (CAR), Visual Augmentation Systems (VAS), and Family of Muzzle Breaks and Suppressors (FMBS).  Leveraging extensive modeling and simulation efforts executed by National Labs, competitively award RDT&E contracts to select vendors to develop suppressors and flashhiders for select SOF weapon systems. These accessories greatly improve the combat effectiveness of the weapon systems and the survivability of the SOF operator."

NOTE: In compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 2010, resources to support ballistic protection efforts were moved from SPEAR to a separate project (S385A) beginning in FY 2012.\n\n\u2022 Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) provides medical devices, ancillary equipment and Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) sets for SOF. The CASEVAC program procures a suite of Food and Drug Administration approved medical items including, but not limited, to intraosseous infusion devices, patient monitoring and assessment devices, emergency airway kits, as well as devices that provide SOF the capability to support extraction, extrication,  mobility, transportation, and sustainment of casualties in forward areas.  This program fields tactical medical and CASEVAC capabilities with the intention to transition capabilities developed under the National Mission Force Tactical Medical Programs.  This capability provides significant ability to lessen battlefield losses by providing timely, critical lifesaving and evacuation capabilities to the forward-deployed SOF operators. \n\n\u2022 Counter Radio Controlled-Improvised Explosive Device (RC-IED) program provides SOF with the ability to counter current and future radio controlled improvised explosive devices threats used by terrorist networks.  NOTE: The Counter RC-IED efforts were conducted in the program element 1160408BB.  The resources for these efforts were split beginning in FY 2013 to support the SOF theater force requirements."

Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability and load bearing equipment impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions. These missions are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. \n\nThis budget line enhances the SPEAR program by supporting body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, and eye protection.  It also provides for the research, development, and testing of a variety of body armor and personal protective equipment. Creation of a separate project for ballistic protection efforts was directed in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2010."

                            "val": "This project provides for development, testing and integration of specialized visual augmentation, laser and sensor system equipment to meet the unique requirements of Special Operations Forces(SOF).  Specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations within harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorist, or highly sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to enemy threats to ensure mission success.\n\nVisual Augmentation Systems (VAS).  This program develops, buys prototypes, and supports fielding of operator-borne combat optics for SOF.  These devices provide the SOF operator the ability to maneuver, conduct fire control operations, and perform surveillance and reconnaissance.  Research and Development efforts will develop, test, and evaluate prototype systems of the next generation Fusion system.\n\nThese Visual Augmentation Systems will provide an all-weather, low-light capability for SOF personnel by employing a Block approach.  This Block approach produces a family of VAS systems which will utilize a variety of different sensor technologies to satisfy the capabilities defined by individual Block requirement.  Some examples of the types of sensor technologies that these systems may utilize include:  Image Intensification, Thermal, Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) and\/or multi-spectral.  To date the Target Engagement Portfolio has utilized several Block system approaches that have been fielded by the VAS program.  These VAS programs will be a developmental effort to produce and field the next generation systems for SOF personnel.  Some of the capability shortfalls identified by the SOF community are the following: (1) ability to detect, classify, and engage targets out to 800 m without the use of an infra-red illuminator; (2) ability to determine wind speed at ranges out to 500 m or greater and (3) ability to observe bullet trace at ranges of 800 m or greater.\n\nVisual Augmentation Systems Weapons Accessories (VASWA).  This program effort enhances all SOF weapons, both individual and crew served, by leveraging the latest technological advances in optional accessories (up to 30 different functions \/ capabilities) such as combat optics, aiming laser modules, visible lights, and close quarters battle sights.  Miniature Day-Night Sight (MDNS) for crew-served weapons enhances all SOF Weapons by leveraging existing image intensification and thermal technology to improve combat effectiveness for all crew-served weapon systems.  Development efforts include test and evaluation of the Advanced Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Laser (ATPIAL) hardening to withstand the live-fire shock profiles for the Combat Assault Rifle (CAR), VAS and clandestine pointer.  Leveraging extensive modeling and simulation efforts executed by National Labs.  Also, competitively award RDT&E contracts to select vendors in order to develop clandestine operator-borne visual augmentation devices.  These accessories greatly improve the combat effectiveness of the weapon systems and the survivability of the SOF operator."

MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct MISO in support of combatant commanders. \n\n\u2022 The MISO Broadcast System consists of fixed and deployable multi-media production facilities for radio and television programming, distribution systems, and dissemination systems to provide MISO support to theater commanders. This project is comprised of several interfacing systems that can stand alone or interoperate with other MISO systems as determined by mission requirements. This project includes the fixed site media production center; a light and medium media production capability; a product distribution system that provides a reachback link to systems worldwide; a media system; a transit case fly-away broadcast systems that consists of a combination of amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), shortwave (SW), and television (TV) transmitters, and radio\/TV production systems; and a long range broadcast system (LRBS) which transmits analog and digital broadcasts. The LRBS will include scatterable media, telephony, and Internet broadcast. MISO media displays will consist of easily transportable, state of the art, electronic media displays designed to disseminate and broadcast electronic messages designed to influence foreign target audiences, and will support the MISO direct broadcast mission requirements. Additionally, lightweight and tactical media development work stations will allow soldiers to produce MISO products in deployed locations."
