OTC consists of four forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Integrated Test and Evaluation Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; Fires Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma; and Intelligence Electronic Warfare Test Directorate, Fort Huachuca, Arizona) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Ft Hood, Texas. These activities support the development and fielding cycle of all Army acquisition programs including rapid fielding initiatives in support of operations in Afghanistan. Sustainment funding maintains existing testing capabilities at all locations by replacing unreliable, uneconomical, and irreparable instrumentation, as well as incremental upgrades of hardware and software for M&S and instrumentation systems to assure adequate test data collection capabilities. This data supports acquisition milestone decisions for all commodity areas throughout the Army including programs such as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV), Network Integration Evaluation (NIE), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Patriot Advance Capability Phase 3 (PAC-3), Armored Multipurpose Vehicle (AMPV), Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T), Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), and the Army Battle Command System (ABCS) which includes Joint Battle Command - Platform. This Program Element develops and sustains developmental and operational test capabilities that provide key support to the Army's three roles: Prevent, Shape, and Win Decisively. In addition this Program Element supports Overseas Contingency Operations by providing instrumentation to support ATEC's 24\/7 mission at YTC, Arizona, WSMR, New Mexico and ATC, Maryland supporting the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO), as well as efforts throughout ATEC in support of the Army's Rapid Equipping the Force (REF) initiative."

These capabilities are required to support developmental testing requirements of high priority Army systems being rapidly fielded to Afghanistan, and those systems supporting Army modernization efforts. Where practical, efficiencies will be gained through the common use of developmental instrumentation in operational testing.  A key element is sustaining aging instrumentation which maintains existing capabilities at test facilities by replacing unreliable, uneconomical and irreparable instrumentation, as well as lifecycle replacement and incremental upgrades of instrumentation and software, reducing their average age to assure adequate testing capabilities. This project develops and sustains developmental test instrumentation and capabilities that provide the data necessary to support acquisition milestone decisions for all commodity areas throughout the Army. Significant examples include new instrumentation for the testing of body armor and other soldier protective equipment, advanced methods for testing the survivability of ground vehicles and aircraft, refurbishment of kineto-tracking mounts (precise optical instruments used in missile and aviation testing), and an expanded instrumentation suite in support of the growing mission to test Command, Control, Communication and Computer (C4) systems."

Operational Test (OT) Instrumentation collects required data from both the systems being tested and the surrounding activities.  OT simulation enhances the live forces conducting operational testing by simulating additional units, message traffic, effects, and terrain. The Army's OPTEMPO has reduced the number of tactical units and vehicles available to support OT, making augmentation through simulation needed at times to test in a realistic, operational environment. The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) provides development of major simulation and instrumentation systems while ATEC adapts systems from other organizations, purchases off-the-shelf systems, develops minor new systems, and sustains all ATEC simulation and instrumentation systems.  The OT Simulation and Instrumentation (S&I) (Sustainment and Minor Development) program funds the expertise and the adaptation, purchases, minor development and sustainment requirements that support systems undergoing OT. Costs unique to specific systems under test may require Program Manager (PM) funding."
