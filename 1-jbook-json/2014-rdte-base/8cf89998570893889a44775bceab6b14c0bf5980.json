Starting in FY2013 the funding in PE 0604771D8Z JTIDS associated with communications and information networks architecture, strategy and policy; and frequency spectrum analysis and management was transferred to this PE (PE 0305199D8Z Net Centricity) and aligned under the office of the DoD Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO).\n\nFunds will be used to provide technical, systems engineering and capability management oversight of programs, projects and activities to maximize the Department\u2019s return on investment in information technology resources and affect a comprehensive approach for assessing and procuring critical information systems from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of improved systems performance and military operations. Emphasis is placed on the information transport, information assurance, net and spectrum management, command and control (C2) applications and services, information sharing capabilities, and enterprise services activities focused on the development, integration, testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of command, control, communication, computing network, and Information Infrastructure (C4&II) capabilities and programs.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  \n\n     This project provides the resources necessary to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytic methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space) of the joint information environment architecture, to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field effective capabilities more rapidly and efficiently as an enabler for C4&II capabilities applications and services.  Resources are required to transform current networks into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse joint information environment that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer, computing networks, and mission application capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, contested communications on the move, Position Navigation and Timing (PNT), and C2 mission application capabilities.  These funds develop the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance capabilities with other joint information environment capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).  \n     In addition, funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes initiating the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators, engineers, and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint \/Allied units prior to system fielding, or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the Global Information Grid (GIG) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future Tactical Data Link (TDL) capabilities. These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDL capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled Global Information Grid (GIG) initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies."
