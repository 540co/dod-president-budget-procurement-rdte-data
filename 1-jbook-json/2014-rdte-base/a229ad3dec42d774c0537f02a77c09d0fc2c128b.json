            "val": "This program addresses advanced technology development associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.\n\nMunition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining five, ten, and fifteen year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate Program Executive Offices (PEO) for insertion in their Insensitive Munition (IM) Strategic Plans \/ Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs \/ FATGs and IM \/ fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.   The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technical Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technical Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior DoD and DOE laboratory representatives and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.\n\nThe Insensitive Munitions effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with Insensitive Munitions requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoDI 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.\n\nThe JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas:  1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.\n\nThe Enabling Fuze Advanced Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development (GDF) of the Force, the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration weapons and programs based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&T) communities.  In this way, promising multi-point initiation architectures, high reliability fuze architectures, survivable components, modular fuze packaging, and components produced based on ease of manufacturing can be integrated into munitions applications and its ability to address required capability needs will be validated.  Mature fuze technologies will be transitioned to Weapon PEO\u2019s and\/or Industry, thereby decreasing program costs and schedule risk while facilitating technology into potentially broader range of munitions applications.\n\nThe JFTP investments focus on four specific capability areas that have been identified by the Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and as validated by the PEOs and the Service S&T communities.  These capability areas are:  1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.   These Fuzing technologies will be incorporated in weapon applications to demonstrate their maturity and utility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs."

Technologies include, but are not limited to, rocket propellant ingredients (including synthesis, characterization and scale-up), reduced smoke or smokey propellants (including formulation, characterization and scale-up), rocket motor case design, materials for active and passive thermal mitigation, shock mitigation materials and techniques, passive and active coatings, active and passive venting techniques for motor cases or containers, ignition systems, sensors and thrust mitigation techniques.  Operating conditions may be controlled or widely varying in both temperature and vibration.  The five, ten, and fifteen year goals of the HPP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of missile propulsions systems due to Fragment Impacts and Slow Cook Off for the majority of High Performance Propulsion rocket motors, and solving the Fast Cook Off response of very large High Performance Propulsion motors."

The development and demonstration of gun propulsion technologies, when applied to munition systems, will improve munition IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and at least maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include but are not limited to gun propellant formulations, ingredients for gun propellant formulations (including synthesis, characterization and scale-up), cartridge case and packaging design, active and passive venting techniques, reduced sensitivity primer propellant and primer systems, and robust primers for insensitive propellants.  Applications vary, but include both large and medium caliber munitions, as well as propelling charges for mortars and shoulder launched munitions.  Operating requirements vary, and other factors such as barrel life and operation over varying environmental conditions may be critically important depending on the intended munition application.  The five, ten, and fifteen year goals of the GP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of gun propulsion munitions to Fragment Impact, and Slow Cook Off threats."
