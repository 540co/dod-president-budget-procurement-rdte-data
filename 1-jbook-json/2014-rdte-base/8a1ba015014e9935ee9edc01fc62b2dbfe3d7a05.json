On 14 August 2009, a Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) Contract W56HZV-09-C-0550 was awarded to BAE Systems Inc. for the Prototype Development and Fabrication of 7 prototype vehicles (5 PIM Self Propelled Howitzer Systems (SPHS) and 2 PIM Carrier Ammunition Tracked (CAT) vehicles).  A Comprehensive Contract Modification (CCM) award to the RDT&E contract was accomplished on 6 Jan 2012.  This modification allows for the completion of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase and transfers the system responsibility for the program from the Government to BAE Systems Inc.  Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract is Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF) with a period of performance running from AUG 2013 through DEC 2018.  The LRIP contract provides for four LRIP years with the initial base year including 19 SPHs and 18 CATs and the remaining three option years with 18 Sets each (one each SPH and CAT) of PIM vehicles.  The Full Rate Production (FRP) contract is planned as a FPIF contract that converts to a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract after the second year of FRP.  The FRP contract provides for the remaining PIM vehicles to fulfill the requirement up to the Army Acquisition Objective of 580 sets."
