            "val": "The Army requires an Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) capability to rapidly deploy an overmatching infantry squad anywhere on the battlefield.  The GCV IFV will provide the infantry squad with a highly mobile, protected, transport to the decisive locations on the battlefield.  The GCV IFV will provide both destructive fires against threat armored vehicles and direct fire support for the squad during dismounted assaults.  It will increase the Infantry's tactical mobility, survivability, and lethality against light and heavy armored threats across a variety of missions.  The Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program was initiated on the basis of an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) that was approved 10 December 2009.  A Capabilities Development Document (CDD) is currently under review, with anticipated approval by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 3QFY2013.  The accomplishments and funding reflected in this justification are based on these documents and on program milestone decision memoranda.\nA Milestone (MS) A Defense Acquisition Board was conducted on 21 July 2011 and an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was signed 17 August 2011.  It granted the Army approval to enter a 24 month Technology Development (TD) phase. Two contracts were awarded on 18 August 2011.  One contract was awarded to BAE Systems Land & Armaments, Limited Partnership(L.P). and one was awarded to General Dynamics Land Systems Inc. Following receipt of a protest, stop work orders were issued on 29 August 2011.  The GAO denied the protest on 5 December 2011, and work resumed 6 December 2011.  The following funding requirements\/justifications reflect the impact of the 100 day delay caused by the protest.\nRevisions to the GCV strategy were approved via an ADM that was signed on 16 January 2013.  The Army's exploration of the capabilities trade-space and full range of alternatives prior to finalizing requirements has led to a modified set of requirements that require additional preliminary design effort.  In addition, the results of the three pronged development effort were considered in revising the GCV strategy.  Some relevant decisions included in the ADM were:  the TD phase is to be extended by six months, a full and open competition for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase will be conducted and contract award will be to a single vendor, and MS B will be conducted in late FY2014.  The GCV Project Manager is currently taking steps to incorporate these decisions into the program.  The following funding requirements\/justifications reflect these decisions and are based on cost estimates generated by the Project Management Office.\n\nThe GCV program is using an incremental approach with the GCV IFV as the first increment (future increments have not yet been defined).  Due to the aforementioned revision to the GCV strategy, the Technology Development phase (with 2 competing contractors) that effectively began 6 December 2011 will proceed for 30 months.  Following Milestone B, currently planned for 3Q2014, the program is planning to award a single competitively selected 54 month contract for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  During EMD, the selected contractor will continue to refine designs and deliver prototypes to support engineering development, risk mitigation, and technical and operational tests.  Milestone C is planned for 1QFY2019 and will immediately be followed with award of a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract to one contractor.\n\nNOTE:  The FY2013 Accomplishments\/Planned Program reflect the revised GCV strategy but, the FY2013 budget breakouts reflect the submitted FY2013 President's Budget (the FY2013 words have been updated but not the dollars)."

Approximately 35 contract deliverables are associated with each PDR and they must be reviewed and approved by the Government team prior to the reviews. Information generated from the three-pronged strategy will be used to complete an updated performance specification for inclusion in both the TD contracts and the EMD Request for Proposal (RFP), which is planned for release in 1QFY2014. The final reports for both the non developmental vehicle assessment and the Dynamic AoA Update will be completed. \nContinue preparation of approximately 40 documents to support the Milestone B. The Milestone B is currently planned for 3QFY2014, but a pre-MS B review is anticipated 1QFY2014 to support the release of the EMD request for proposal."

One contract was awarded to BAE Systems Land & Armaments, L.P. and one was awarded to General Dynamics Land Systems Inc. Due to a protest, stop work orders were issued on 29 August 2011. The Government Accountability Office denied the protest on 5 December 2011, and work resumed 6 December 2011. \n \nFor the ongoing TD phase, the Army has been maturing its requirements by using key program imperatives to shape trade space and to ensure convergence on an affordable and achievable set of requirements. The TD phase contracts have allowed contractors to trade selected capability to support the path to an affordable set of requirements and to reduce program cost and risk. In addition to the effort related to the TD contracts, PM GCV has conducted assessments of selected non-developmental vehicles and supported a dynamic update to the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). This \"three pronged effort\" (TD contracts, vehicle assessments, and dynamic AoA update) is generating data that will ensure a well informed Milestone B.\n\nRevisions to the GCV strategy were recently approved via an Acquisition Decision Memorandum  signed on 16 January 2013.It recognized that the Army's exploration of the capabilities trade-space and full range of alternatives prior to finalizing requirements MS B decision, has led to a modified set of requirements that require additional preliminary design effort. It likewise acknowledged that the results of the three pronged development effort were considered in revising the GCV strategy. Decisions included in the ADM were: 1) The TD phase is to be extended by six months,  2) A full and open competition for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase will be conducted and contract award will be to a single vendor,  3)  Planned procurement of long lead items for EMD prototypes is not authorized,  4) The Milestone C decision shall be planned for FY2019, and  5) Milestone B will be conducted in late FY2014, following a pre-EMD Defense Acquisition Board first quarter FY2014 (which must occur prior to releasing the EMD Request for Proposal). The GCV Project Manager is currently taking steps to incorporate these decisions into the program.\n\nThe GCV program is using an incremental approach with the GCV IFV as the first increment (future increments have not yet been defined). Due to the aforementioned revision to the GCV strategy, the Technology Development phase competitive development contracts that effectively began 6 December 2011 will proceed for 30 months. Following Milestone B, currently planned for 3Q2014, the program is planning to award a single competitively selected 54 month contract for the EMD phase. During EMD, the selected contractor will continue to refine designs and deliver prototypes to support engineering development, risk mitigation, and technical and operational tests. Milestone C is planned for 1QFY2019 and will immediately be followed with award of a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract to one contractor."
