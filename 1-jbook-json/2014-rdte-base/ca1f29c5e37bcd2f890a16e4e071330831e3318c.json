BCS3 provides commanders the capability to execute end-to-end distribution and deployment management and brings better situational awareness resulting in better decision-making capability to Warfighters. It enables Warfighters to acquire, scale and tailor critical logistics information in near-real time in order to enable the Warfighter in the planning and execution of operations. BCS3 provides an effective means to gather and integrate asset and in-transit information to manage distribution and deployment missions. BCS3 combines distribution management to include commodity and convoy tracking, and deployment management into a logistics Common Operating Picture (COP) for one mission-focused visual display. It is an inherent part of the common operating environment (COE). It provides the sustainment functionality in the command post computing environment (CP\/CE).  \n\nBCS3 has been adopted and integrated into Joint and strategic logistics (C2) processes. BCS3 is the only near-term end-to-end logistics COP solution for the Joint commander. BCS3 will maintain its core capabilities and continue to advance in development while integrating into the Joint (C2) architecture. This continued development will enable decision superiority via advanced collaborative information sharing achieved through interoperability. \n\nBCS3 has immediate, high pay-off benefit to Warfighters and additional future growth in its capabilities. BCS3 is a force multiplier, a precision tool for sustainment\/logistics planning and execution. It is a core part of CP\/CE."
