The T&E activities make up the Navy portion of the Department of Defense's Major Range and Test Facility Base.  These activities are chartered to perform T&E for the development and acquisition of technology advanced weapons systems.  Core T&E capabilities and capacity are operated to obtain weapons system performance documentation for acquisition program milestone decisions to provide operational forces with effective weapons systems.  This program provides Navy Acquisition Program Managers required test capabilities; lowers cost of T&E; removes cost and scheduling impact of providing their own T&E resources; and retains the physical airspace, land space and sea space needed to conduct testing."

The AUTEC Program Office is headquartered at Newport, RI.  AUTEC's administrative offices are located at West Palm Beach, Florida.  Test facilities are located at Andros Island, Sites 1 through 4, and the Berry Islands in the Bahamas.  AUTEC aircraft make scheduled daily flights between West Palm Beach and Andros Town Airport.  \n\nAUTEC manages and, under service contract, maintains and operates a 500 square nautical miles deep-water and a 100 square nautical miles shallow-water acoustic tracking range; air-target tracking capabilities; sonobuoy simulation systems; electronic warfare threat simulation systems; rotary wing aircraft; aircraft ground support facilities; acoustic targets; torpedo retrieval and flushing capabilities; open-ocean range craft; marine support facilities; and data processing and analysis capabilities.  \n\nMajor test facilities on Andros Island are located at Site 1.  The Command Control Building houses the range tracking displays and replay centers, the computer center, operations support functions, communications center, and the central timing system. The Range Support Facility houses a torpedo post-run workshop, Mark 46 \/Mark 50 lightweight torpedo Intermediate Maintenance Activity (IMA), a Mark 30 undersea target IMA, a Mark 48 heavyweight torpedo Research and Development Turnaround facility and related technical facilities. The complex includes electrical and physical calibration labs, a complete electronics maintenance shop, a dive locker, a precision machine shop, and logistics support areas.\n\nAUTEC has a 285-foot concrete pier with a controlling depth of 17 feet (5.2 meters) at mean low tide. An adjacent wharf is approximately 240 feet in length (72 meters) with a controlling depth of 15 feet at mean low tide.  Power is available at both locations.  Facilities at the pier\/marine area include fully equipped machine \/fabrication and marine overhaul shops.  Also at Site 1, six Range User Buildings are maintained  for assembling test equipment and equipment check-out during test mobilization or dockside periods. These staging areas are equipped with a variety of power sources, gantry cranes, compressed air and security features. A fully equipped range user hanger for ground maintenance and storage of helicopters is located at the AUTEC helicopter airstrip.  Sites 2, 3, and 4 are small instrumented areas located south of Site 1 used to extend tracking of sonobuoys, communications, and air target track."

The Pacific Ranges use China Lake's 1.1 million acres of land and 17,000 square miles of military restricted (R-2508) airspace together with Point Mugu's 125,000 square miles of instrumented sea range and 36,000 square miles of controlled overlying airspace, and airfield and test instrumentation at San Nicolas Island to perform its T&E mission.  Included in the China Lake ranges is the Electronic Combat Range (ECR), which provides outdoor free space development and operational testing of airborne electronic warfare systems and tactics against shipboard and land based air defense systems. These ranges perform metric radar, multilateration and optical  tracking of test objects; command, control,  and destruct for range safety purposes; communications; frequency interference control and analysis; collection processing and display of telemetered data; real-time data processing and display; and the operation of a sub scale aerial target launch capability.  Other test capabilities include sled tracks, measurement facility; propulsion, warhead, environmental, rocket motor, and other missile component test facilities; and gun ranges.

Operates ocean-based environment, measurement and support systems.  Maintains and repairs systems that measure warfare system performance.  Oversees test, training, and measurement facilities, equipment, operations and maintenance processes.  Satisfies customer exercise and measurement requirements through the operation of ocean based test and measurement systems.  Assures the readiness of  systems through the implementation of calibration, maintenance, repair and life cycle processes.  Performs exercise planning, exercise interpretation and development of surrogate environments, measurement and support systems.  Assists in the design, fabrication and testing of systems for Undersea Warfare warfare environment simulation and performance measurement.  Oversees the manning and maintenance of Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport range craft and range craft systems."
