AF-IPPS will provide Enterprise Information Web (EIW) services.  The AF-IPPS program will be bound by using the BEA \"Hire-to-Retire\" (H2R) construct.  \n\nThe purpose of AF-IPPS is to provide the AF with a sustainable, cost-effective, auditable and regulatory compliant method of effectively capturing and maintaining personnel information so that Service members are paid accurately and on-time without requiring repetitive action or onerous paperwork, while allowing commanders\/managers to easily access pertinent information.\n\nThe goal of AF-IPPS is to fully integrate personnel and pay management for the AF's Total Force (RegAF, ANG, and AFRes).  The future state will be characterized by streamlined, Total Force business processes; efficient and accurate management of pay entitlements; auditable financial statements with regard to military pay; improved access to accurate and timely personnel data for authorized users; and a modernized IT systems environment that is cost-effective and can adapt to future needs.\n\nAF-IPPS's customers include approximately 507,000 AF Service members across all components (330,000 RegAF, 107,000 ANG, and 70,000 AFRes) as well as thousands of military leaders of different ranks, specialties, and career fields who are responsible for the conduct of AF operations that rely on these services to ensure Service members with the appropriate skill sets are deployed where needed at home and on the battlefield.

Development, integration, testing, training, deployment, and sustainment of subsequent releases will be competed.  The primary contract type will be Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF).  Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) will be used for the smaller portions of the contract, as appropriate.\n\nAir Force Program Executive Officer for Business and Enterprise Systems (AFPEO BES) is the PEO for AF-IPPS.  Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is the Contracting Authority for the AF-IPPS Program and provides Contracts, Legal, and Comptroller support.  The Office of the Secretary of Defense Deputy Change Management Officer [OSD(DCMO)] is the program's Milestone Decision Authority (MDA)."
