            "val": "The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is conducting research into the transmission and control of directed energy largely above the atmosphere for non-intercept missile defense applications and ultimately boost phase intercepts. The agency works in collaboration with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office in a systems engineering based strategy for the research, development, test and evaluation of high energy laser technologies. \n\nTo transition to the next generation high power directed energy platform, MDA is pursuing two promising laser technologies in a competitive environment. These candidate laser systems offer a path to high efficiency, electrically-driven, compact, light-weight high energy lasers for multiple missile defense applications including discrimination and boost phase defense. MDA is pursuing the Diode Pumped Alkali Laser System and fiber combining laser technologies based on their efficiency and scaling potential. A 200 kilowatt (kW) class flight qualifiable laser prototype will be built and tested based on the selected technology for non-intercept Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) enhancement. In parallel with laser development, a surrogate high altitude, long endurance platform will be instrumented to collect high altitude flight environment data to inform the design and flight compatible packaging of the high powered laser payloads. MDA is also investing in a number of advanced technology initiatives which will support the design of the next-generation airborne laser platform. \n\nThe Directed Energy Research contributions to the Prioritized Capabilities List include: Prevent Attack - counter emerging or advanced air and missile threats and Persistent Surveillance - improve birth-to-death tracking, identification and targeting. \n\nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management costs in support of the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS)."
