JSIC promotes Service\/Defense Agency C2 capability integration, and conducts technical, operational, and DOTMLPF assessments of Command and Control (C2) and Command, Control, Computer, Communication, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) capabilities.  JSIC serves as the technical analysis and operational assessment activity in support of the Joint Staff capability-driven requirements process, the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS).  JSIC also serves as a joint interoperability compliance activity for the milestone decision authorities\/program managers in the Defense acquisition enterprise.\n\nThe FY 2005 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) directed the transfer for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding for joint warfare experimentation and training programs from Navy accounts to new Defense Wide RDT&E accounts beginning in FY 2007.  Joint Staff J8 is the executive agent for the JSIC PE and Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD (R&E)) provides execution oversight.\n\nJSIC provides Combatant Commands, at the joint force headquarters level, with a laboratory and assessment environment for the warfighter and capability developer.  This environment provides for assessment of current and near-term joint and coalition capabilities primarily at the operational and tactical levels. JSIC's Persistent Command and Control (C2) Environment accurately replicates an operational C2 environment. With this capability, JSIC assesses system of systems interoperability, operational capability, procedural compliance and technical suitability of emerging and existing systems and programs to confirm readiness for deployment.  Through JSIC's analysis and assessment, systems are evaluated for \"value-added\" prior to employment in joint and coalition environments typical of deployed theaters of operation.  \n\nBy establishing ground truth for interoperability and suggesting remedies for demonstrated shortfalls, JSIC is an enabler for interoperable joint and coalition solutions and provides a means to foster rapid, near-term insertion of C4ISR technology by promoting the ability to meet the DoD direction for spiral development and evolutionary acquisition.  JSIC's mission is to provide for the fielding of warfighter C2 systems through rapid systems integration, technical assessment, and operational evaluation using laboratory environments and field venues.  In the world of C2 and ISR interoperability, performance in the field is the bottom line. In terms of investment, JSIC is the \"ounce of prevention\" that precludes a \"pound\" of mission failure and loss of life due to interoperability failures in military operations."

JSIC will analyze COCOM near-term requirements using DOTMLPF criteria.  JSIC will identify current, emerging, or mature technologies to address materiel requirements.  Comprehensive assessments covering joint maturity, interoperability, warfighter utility, and operational effectiveness will be conducted on legacy and transformational projects.  JSIC will provide DOTMLPF recommendations on fielding strategies for Joint Staff endorsement.\n\nThe primary outputs and efficiencies realized are: 1) Increased number of recommended improvements that enhance the capability of Joint Task Force Headquarters (JTF HQ); 2) Increased number of verifiable capability solutions recommended for fielding to the Combatant Commander based on quantified capability improvements; 3) Increased empirical data to support benefit-cost ratio improvements of JTF HQ investment decisions to ensure JTF HQs command and control (C2) capabilities are interoperable from technical and operational standpoints; 4) Increased number of assessments conducted that identify current force JTF HQs C2 systems that are interoperable and supported, that inform and recommend solutions to integrate, modify, or retire current force systems; 5) Increased number of assessment based recommendations of technology solutions that address the military utility of proposed and existing Service solutions; and  6) Increased number of solutions deployed with recognized DOTMLPF impacts.\n\nProgram Management offices benefit because the JSIC program provides a venue for Military Utility Assessments (MUAs) of technologies before committing to implementation.  The potential savings associated with finding existing commercial technologies to provide gap filler solutions, and avoid the fielding of systems that are not interoperable or that fail to meet warfighter needs, are difficult to quantify.  Potentially life-threatening shortfalls are identified and fixed in advance of fielding.  Services benefit directly by reduced Program Manager costs and by fielding systems that are interoperable and meet warfighter needs."
