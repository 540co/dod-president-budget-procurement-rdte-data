The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces\u2019 ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools, and prototypes.  Work under PE 0604670D8Z will create transition ready software tools that will help intelligence analysts, operations analysts, operations planners, wargamers, and others represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.  This program focuses on maturing, hardening, and validating human, social, culture, and behavior modeling software for transition to meet the needs of the warfighter, integration into the architectures of existing programs of record, and\/or maturing software via open architectures to allow broad systems integration.  The Program provides a development to product transition pathway for sociocultural models, tools, and capabilities to rapidly meet immediate and emerging warfighter needs.  The work supports the testing, validation, and transition of model-based technology into existing and developing systems in coordination with Program Executive Offices\/Program Managers, Combatant Commanders, Joint and Service organizations, warfighters in need, and other transition customers.  The Program will mature sociocultural relevant data and tools to provide essential sociocultural understanding and forecasting capabilities at the strategic, operational and tactical levels."
