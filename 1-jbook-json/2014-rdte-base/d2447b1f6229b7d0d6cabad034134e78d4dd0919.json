It facilitates the sharing of training and readiness information, while allowing for the transfer of emerging and innovative technologies among the Services and private sector.  In addition, this project supports OSD (P&R) and DoD training managers (OSD, Joint Staff, Unified Commands, and the Services) in promoting more efficient and effective use of training resources, increasing the effectiveness of military training, and enhancing the readiness and performance of the military forces.  Projects analyze the contributions to readiness of various training techniques and programs and use the results to expedite new training concepts and procedures that increase unit effectiveness or decrease costs.
