            "val": "This program element (PE) supports application of knowledge gained through basic research to refine drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, medical practices\/procedures, and other preventive measures essential to the protection and sustainment of Warfighter health. Research is conducted in five principal areas: Combat Casualty Care; Military Operational Medicine; Military Relevant Infectious Diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine; and Systems Biology\/Network Sciences. Research is funded in seven projects.  \n\nProject 869 refines knowledge and technologies on screening tools and preventive measures for post-traumatic stress disorder and mild traumatic brain injuries, physiological monitors, and interventions to protect Soldiers from injuries resulting from operational stress, and exposure to hazardous environments and materials. Also conducts research on medically valid testing devices and predictive models used for the refinement of Soldier protective equipment. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.  \n\nProject 870 designs and refines medical diagnostic devices, drugs, and vaccines for protection and treatment against naturally occurring diseases and wound infections of military importance, as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.  \n\nProject 873 conducts research on HIV, which causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Work in this area includes refining improved identification methods to determine genetic diversity of the virus, preclinical work in laboratory animals including non-human primates to identify candidates for future vaccine refinement, and evaluating and preparing overseas sites for future vaccine trials. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.    \n\nProject 874 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics (products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and diagnostics for resuscitation, life support, and post-evacuation restorative and rehabilitative care, as well as trauma care systems for use by field medics and surgeons. Research focus is on identifying more effective critical care technologies and protocols to treat severe bleeding, traumatic brain injury and other blast related injuries, and treatments for ocular injury and visual system dysfunction, as well as laboratory and animal studies of regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, and bone tissue for the care and treatment of battle-injured casualties. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. \n\nProject FH2 conducts applied research directed toward the sustainment of a healthy force of Warfighters through the entire deployment life cycle.  \n\nProject VB4 conducts applied research in systems biology to provide a highly effective mechanism to integrate iterative biological tests, computer simulations, and animal studies.  Such refinement efforts using systems biology could ultimately reduce the time and effort invested in medical product refinement. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.\n\nProject VJ4 examines over a planned 5-year period the mental and behavioral health of Soldiers to counter suicidal behavior. This work will focus on advancing the understanding of the multiple determinants of suicidal behavior, psychopathology (study of the causes and nature of abnormal behavior), psychological resilience, and role functioning. Work on this project is being performed by the National Institute of Mental Health through extramural cooperative research grants in collaboration with the Department of the Army. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nAll medical applied research is conducted in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA requires thorough testing in animals (referred to as preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon transition to 6.3 Advanced Technology Research). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and assay refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves preclinical testing in animals. The EPA also requires thorough testing of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for use.\n\nProgram refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biome"

                            "val": "This project conducts applied research for medical countermeasures to naturally occurring infectious diseases that pose a significant threat to the operational effectiveness of forces deployed outside the United States. Effective preventive countermeasures (protective\/therapeutic drugs and vaccines and insect repellents and traps) protect the Force from disease and sustain operations by avoiding the need for evacuations from the theater of operations. Diseases of military importance are malaria, bacterial diarrhea, and viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever and hantavirus). In addition to countermeasures, this project funds refinement of improved diagnostic tools to facilitate early identification of infectious disease threats in an operational environment, informing Commanders of the need to institute preventive actions and improve medical care. Major goals are to integrate genomics (DNA-based) and proteomics (protein-based) as well as other new biotechnologies into the refinement of new concepts for new vaccine, drug, and diagnostics candidates.\n\nResearch conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas:\n\n(1) Drugs to Prevent\/Treat Parasitic (living in or on another organism) Diseases\n(2) Vaccines for Prevention of Malaria\n(3) Diagnostics and Disease Transmission Control\n(4) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)\n(5) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)\n\nFor the refinement of drugs and biological products, studies in the laboratory and in animal models provide a proof-of-concept for these candidate products, including safety, toxicity, and effectiveness, and are necessary to provide evidence to the FDA to justify approval for a product to enter into future human subject testing. Additional non-clinical studies are often needed in applied research even after candidate products enter into human testing during advanced technology development, usually at the direction of the FDA, to assess potential safety issues. Drug and vaccine refinement bears high technical risk. Of those candidates identified as promising in initial screens, the vast majority are eliminated after additional safety, toxicity, and\/or effectiveness testing. Similarly, vaccine candidates have a high failure rate, because animal testing may not be a good predictor of human response, and therefore candidate technologies\/products are often eliminated after going into human trials. Because of this high failure rate, a continuing effort to identify other potential candidates to sustain a working pipeline of countermeasures is critical for replacing those products that fail in testing.  \n\nWork is managed by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the NMRC. The Army is responsible for programming and funding all DoD naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.   \n\nPromising medical countermeasures identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project 810.\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.   \n \nWork in this project is performed by the WRAIR, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories; USAMRIID, Fort Detrick, MD; and NMRC, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories."

This research focuses on enhanced protection of Soldiers against health threats in military operations and training. Stressors that adversely affect individual Soldier health readiness are identified and studied to refine interventions that will protect Soldiers and improve their health and performance in stressful environments. This is follow-on research that extends and applies findings from over a decade of research on Gulf War Illnesses and other chronic multi-symptom illnesses that have suspected nerve and behavioral alterations caused by environmental contaminants and deployment stressors. Key databases include the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow us to evaluate interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.\n\nForce Health Protection applied research is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services working on Army projects.\n\nResearch conducted in this project focuses on the following three areas:\n(1) Millennium Cohort Research\n(2) Biomarkers of Exposure and Environmental Biomonitoring\n(3) Physiological Response and Blast and Blunt Trauma Models of Thoracic (Chest) and Pulmonary (Lung) Injuries\n \nPromising efforts identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project FH4.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.    \n \nWork in this project is performed by the U.S. Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, CA; and USARIEM, Natick, MA. \n\nEfforts in this project support the Soldier Portfolio and the principal area of Combat Casualty Care."
