A comparison of multi-year SoE Reports shows measurable DCGS Enterprise net-centric maturity progress. The T&E FT will also leverage Joint Interoperability Certification testing to support the evaluation of DCGS Enterprise maturity.  Of the six DCGS PoR systems, three hold current Joint Staff, Command, Control, Communications, & Computers\/Cyber (J6) Interoperability (IOP) Certifications, while the other three PoRs remain in prototype status, which precludes them from completing Joint IOP Certifications.  Efforts will continue to collect data on these emerging systems towards overall J6 IOP Certification as they mature.  Due to increased automation and advances in Enterprise maturity, the T&E FT increased the number of net-centric evaluations from approximately 150 data assets and 120 web services in 2011 to over 400 data assets and over 300 web services in 2012.  This effort provides the basis for the DCGS Enterprise Assessment, allowing the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) to measure the level of maturity of the DCGS Enterprise supporting the DCGS Governance."
