Specifically this program includes: (1) the upgrade and modernization of information systems; (2) the Software Support Activity (SSA); (3) the upgrade and modernization of medical systems; and (4) revitalization and technical upgrade of existing instrumentation and equipment at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG).\n\nKey efforts within this PE are in support of the FY14 policy priorities for Countering Biological Threats.  Approximately $.5M supports the priority to \"Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, whether caused by natural, accidental, or deliberate events.\"  Approximately $5.8M supports the priority to \"Expand our capability to prevent, attribute, and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism, with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities.\"  Approximately $.5M supports the priority to \"Leverage science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capacity to respond to and recover from biological incidents.\""

                            "val": "This Project provides for the upgrade and modernization of fielded Information Systems including the Joint Effects Model (JEM) and the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN). This project also provides for the Software Support Activity (SSA).\n\nThe Joint Effects Model (JEM) is the DoD's only accredited model that has been operationally tested and deemed effective for predicting hazards associated with the release of contaminants into the environment. JEM is being developed in separate increments and is capable of modeling hazards in a variety of scenarios including: counterforce, passive defense, accident and\/or incidents; high altitude releases, urban Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC) environments; building interiors, and human performance degradation.  Battle space commanders and first responders must have a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) hazard prediction capability in order to make decisions that will minimize risks of CBRN contamination and enable them to continue mission operations.  JEM operates in an integrated fashion with operational and tactical Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and in a standalone mode.  JEM interfaces and communicates with the other programs such as JWARN, weather systems, intelligence systems, and various databases.  \n\nThe Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) will provide the Joint Forces with a comprehensive Integrated Early Warning, Analysis and Response capability to minimize the effects of hostile CBRN attacks, as well as accidents and incidents.  It will provide the operational capability to employ CBRN warning technology which will collect, analyze, identify, locate, report, and disseminate warnings.  JWARN will be compatible and integrated with Joint Service C4ISR Systems.  JWARN will transition from platform specific Common Operating Environment (COE) standards to a Web-based Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).  JWARN will also provide an expansion of sensors that will connect to JWARN, increased automation of message handling, improved false alarm filtering, integration of route-planning calculator, and interoperability with additional command and control (C2) systems.  JWARN will be located in Command and Control Centers at the appropriate level and will be employed by CBRN defense specialists and other designated personnel.  This employment will transfer data automatically from existing and future sensors to provide commanders with the capability to support operational decision making in a CBRN environment.  JWARN will provide additional data processing to support the production of plans and reports, and access to specific CBRN information to improve the efficiency of limited CBRN personnel assets.  JWARN will integrate existing sensors into a sensor network or host C2 system, but does not provide the sensors that will be employed in the operating environment.  The JWARN capability described above will be developed utilizing an incremental approach based on Service requirements and host system architecture.    \n\nThe SSA is a CBDP enterprise-wide, user developmental support and service organization focusing on development assistance and net-centric interoperability.  SSA provides the CBRN community with critical \"plug and play\" capabilities which allow for system modularity and re-configurability across the enterprise.  SSA  helps ensure that the various programs and projects are designing\/adhering to DoD and industry standards to avoid proprietary\/stove-pipe solutions.  The requirement for net-centric, composable solutions provides the near term foundation for the Warfighter's ability to communicate his CBRN solutions and interoperate with other service operational systems.  It also supports a longer term ability to interoperate with related agencies and to reduce the Warfighter's CBRN footprint as technologies improve.\n\nThe SSA also directly supports various Bio-Surveillance efforts in training and logistics coordination.  The SSA is re-baselining the entire IM\/IT work-flow in support of the Bio-Surveillance Portal.  By creating a catalog of portlets (think apps on a smart-phone) a user will be able to select the portlets that they need\/use and will have access to data that is appropriate for them in a customizable format."

Using full and open competitive procedures, a single contract will be awarded to the responsible offeror who provides the best value in maintaining current JWARN software and developing future JWARN software.

                            "val": "This Project provides for the upgrade and modernization of fielded Medical Biological defense equipment\/systems including the Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS).  \n\nJBAIDS is an evolutionary development program.  JBAIDS is a commercial off-the-shelf development\/production effort started in August 2003 that focused on rapid development and fielding efforts to deliver a critical capability to identify bacteria and viral agents in environmental surveillance and clinical specimen sample types.  By 2005, 16 biological warfare (BW) agent surveillance detection kits were fielded along with the first JBAIDS in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  JBAIDS currently has seven IVD kits cleared by the FDA, e.g. Anthrax, Plague, Tularemia, Q-Fever, H5 Avian, Influenza A&B, etc.  An expanded influenza detection panel covering six new assays was cleared on Sept 13, 2011.  Additionally, the JBAIDS Platinum Path Extraction Kit (PPEK) Bridging Study contract was awarded on Oct 20, 2011; this will allow the PPEK to be used with the Anthrax, Plague, and Tularemia IVD kits.  JBAIDS achieved full operational capability (340 systems delivered all Services) in July 2011.  JBAIDS efforts in 2012-2015 will focus on adding new surveillance food and water pathogen detection assays.  Also, the development team will focus on completing Pre-Emergency Use Authorization (Pre-EUA's) packages annually for FDA review.  These operational development RDT&E funds will be used to oversea the configuration management of the system to include the conduct of software security information assurance (IA) updates on fielded software and monitor analyzer\/laptop parts obsolescence.\n\nThe Next Generation Diagnostics System (NGDS) addresses the mission needs identified in the CBRN Field Analytics ICD (2010).  The NGDS is envisioned to be an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System.  The mission of the NGDS is to provide CBRN warfare threat identification and FDA-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment, CBRN situational awareness, and disease surveillance.  NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component will significantly improve diagnostic capabilities for deployable combat health support units (role 3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability.  The NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component is intended to replace the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17.  The NGDS Increment 1 Service Laboratory Component is intended to provide high throughput Biological threat identification, characterization and diagnostics to fixed site CONUS and OCONUS laboratories operated by the Army, Navy and Air Force in coordination with the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center.  NGDS Increment 2 is intended to provide advanced diagnostics for biological pathogens and toxins, diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures and to provide capability to lower echelons of care."
