            "val": "This project explores innovative concepts pursuant to Public Law 106-554 (Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000) and Public Law 107-50 (Small Business Technology Transfer Program Reauthorization Act of 2001), which mandates a two-phase competition for small businesses with innovative technologies that can also be commercialized. The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technologies for possible future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS) needs. Dual-use means that the technologies will also be judged on their potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new MDA BMDS technologies, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products. MDA will conduct the competition and will award and manage the contracts. \n\nThe Missile Defense Agency`s SBIR\/STTR investments are divided into 14 Research Areas from 5 MDA Elements:\n-Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD): A hybrid program office (MDA\/Navy) that builds BMD Capability for use in multi-mission ships and in Aegis Ashore.\n-Command, Control, Communication, Computer Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR): Defines, develops and deploys an integrated Sensor and Command and Control (C2) capability for Missile Defense\n-Program and Integration: Supervises the Acquisition Category ID ACAT 1D Ballistic Missile Defense System Program portfolio including element design, development, system integration, and test.\n-Test: Characterizes ballistic missile defense capabilities and supports fielding of an integrated and effective capability to the Warfighter.\n-Advanced Technology: Develops cost and operationally effective capabilities; explores and develops technology to counter future threats. \n\nSmall Business Innovation Research topic areas for FY 2012 included: \n\n-Combined Radio Frequency\/Infrared Data Correlation \n-Radio Frequency\/Infrared Data Fusion\n-Innovative Technologies for High Performance Infrared Detectors\n-Novel Planning Algorithms for Hybrid Land and Sea Platform Sensor Coordination\n-Radar Waveforms to Discern Remote Object Attributes\n-3G and 4G Communication System Interference Remediation Techniques\n-Asset Pairing for Battle Management\n-Radio Frequency\/Infrared Data Fusion for Track and Data Correlation\n-Anti-Tamper Technology for Missile Defense\n-Techniques for Performing Warhead Characterization\n-Fast-Running Physics-Based Models for Intercept Debris Aero-heating and Aero-thermal Demise\n-Modeling High Explosive Detonation Response and Resulting Debris\/Shrapnel Generation from Submunitions Warheads\n-Antenna design in the Plasma Environment\n-Radio Frequency Material Property Characterization\n-Advanced Techniques for Lossless Compression of Target Vehicle Telemetry\n-Modular Hypergolic Leak Detector\n-Acquisition, Tracking and Pointing Technologies for High Energy Laser Applications\n-Development of Line-narrowed Diode Pump Sources for Diode Pumped Alkali Laser systems\n-Optics and Coatings for High Energy Laser Applications\n-Atmospheric Characterization for Directed Energy Applications\n-Light weight Rubidium-Metal Vapor Circulating System\n-Solid State High Energy Laser Batteries and Power Sources\n-Methodologies for Realtime Correction of Water Vapor Effects on an Infrared Scene\n-Lightweight Communication Equipment for Interceptor Communications\n-Miniature Extendable Nozzles or Actuating Nozzles for Improved Specific Impulse of Divert and Attitude Control System\\Thrusters\n-Powdered Propellant Rocket Motor\n-Waste Heat Recovery of Rocket Motors for Reduction of Battery Weight\n-Affordable Reinforced Polymer Composite Structures with Embedded Electrical Interfaces\n-Marking of Components for Avoidance of Counterfeit Parts\n-Thermal Isolation of Nozzle Exit Cone Insulators\n-Electro-Optic Infrared Debris Management during ascent phase for Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications\n-Post Intercept Debris Predictions for Electro-Optic Infrared Scene Modeling\n-Human-in-Control Modeling\n-Modeling & Simulation Uncertainty Quantification\n-High energy laser analysis tool with experimental verification of Diode Pumped Alkali Laser rate constants\n-Improved Target Discrimination of Multiple Targets Using Bulk Filtering for Debris\n-Anchoring Post-Intercept Debris Prediction Tools\n-Detailed Lethality Assessments for Flight Test Events\n-Innovative designs for reliable Electro-Explosive Ordnance Devices \n-Long-Term Missile Aging Assessment & Reliability Predictions for Polymer Materials and Electronic Parts\n-Cost Effective, Reliable Service Life Extension Testing of Ordnance Devices\n-Correlation identification and evaluation of new technologies or methodologies to accurately measure inertial movement in a stressing flight environment\n-Materials and Life Cycle Sustainability"

The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technologies for possible future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS) needs. Dual-use means that the technologies will also be judged on their potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new MDA BMDS technologies, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products. MDA will conduct the competition and will award and manage the contracts. \n\nThe Missile Defense Agency`s SBIR\/STTR investments are divided into 14 Research Areas from 5 MDA Elements:\n-Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD): A hybrid program office (MDA\/Navy) that builds BMD Capability for use in multi-mission ships and in Aegis Ashore.\n-Command, Control, Communication, Computer Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR): Defines, develops and deploys an integrated Sensor and Command and Control (C2) capability for Missile Defense\n-Program and Integration: Supervises the Acquisition Category ID ACAT 1D Ballistic Missile Defense System Program portfolio including element design, development, system integration, and test.\n-Test: Characterizes ballistic missile defense capabilities and supports fielding of an integrated and effective capability to the Warfighter.\n-Advanced Technology: Develops cost and operationally effective capabilities; explores and develops technology to counter future threats."
