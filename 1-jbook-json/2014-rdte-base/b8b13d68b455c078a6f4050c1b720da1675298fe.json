MSS provides an integrated suite of enhancements to the combat vehicle crew member and commander to address identifiable capability gaps in their ability to fight, communicate, and maneuver across the full spectrum of operations.  MSS consists of lightweight, modular, and misison tailorable equipment and Command, Control, Communications and Computer (C4) devices worn, carried, or used by mounted crew members in performance of their missions.  Congressionally added funding in FY10 for Soldier Power efforts has been applied to the Soldier Power project line.  NW provides unparalleled situational awareness and understanding to the dismounted leader allowing for faster and more accurate decisions in the tactical fight.  This translates into Soldiers being at the right place, at the right time, with the right equipment making them more effective, more lethal, and more survivable in the execution of their combat mission. TCAPS enables Soldiers to communicate over radios in combat environments while simultaneously providing hearing protection from both steady state and impulse noise."

TCAPS enhances survivability through improved threat detection in operational environments and supports situational awareness by enabling clear and understandable communications over radios in combat situations where hearing can be temporarily impaired from gunfire and explosions. By reducing noise-induced hearing damage, TCAPS contributes to the reduction of post-service disability compensation and limits lost in-service time related to hearing injury.  TCAPS will employ commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution(s) with technical readiness level of 8 or higher.\n\nThere is an immediate need for TCAPS. Theater reports indicate a high incidence of temporary and permanent hearing loss caused by impulse noise when Soldiers remove hearing protection to communicate over radios. Currently hearing loss and other hearing injuries (tinnitus, dizziness, etc.) are the fourth leading reason for medical referral for combatants returning from deployments."

The MSS consists of lightweight, modular, and mission tailorable equipment and Command, Control, Communications and Computer (C4) devices worn, carried, or used by mounted crew members in performance of their missions.  Major components include a helmet mounted display mounted on the Combat Vehicle Crewmember Helmet (CVCH), an untethered (wireless) communications system, and a microclimate cooling system. Other integral components include a Mounted Soldier over-garment and cold weather gloves, Chemical\/Biological\/Radiological\/Nuclear (CBRN) protection, multi-threat eye protection, ballistic protection, flash\/flame protection, and individual weapon holsters.  The MSS increases mission effectiveness by improving Command and Control and Situational Awareness while increasing crewmember survivability, endurance, and comfort.  MSS enables Mounted Crewman to utilize existing platform sensor, situational awareness, and C4 capabilities in and around their platform, therefore increasing combat effectiveness."

These improved systems enable the warfighter to sustain themselves for extended mission duration.  An advanced, integrated Soldier power system provides a Soldier worn power\/data capability that is significantly more efficient and lighter than carrying separate batteries for each device.  Soldier Power Systems address the power and energy gap created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier portable power consumers, such as Situational Awareness (SA) displays, Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation, weapon sensors, and tactical radios. This effort began in FY10 as a Congressional add for development and system improvements to the M-25 fuel cell and Acid Alkaline (AA) batteries, and continues to develop a line of power sources and solutions suited for not only the individual Soldier, but for the team and squad. These power solutions include, but are not limited to, individual Soldier worn systems, integrated power vests, wireless power technology, and small unit charger\/power supplies intended for use in the most austere operating environments. A portable power system will equip the Squad with power to the forward edge.  Soldier portable power platforms reduce the weight and logistical risk and burden associated with moving fuel and primary (disposable) batteries.  By using renewable energy and power scavenging technology, it enables Infantry Squads to operate independently for longer durations without being tethered to a large generator, vehicle, or supply train. This effort supports the draft Small Unit Power Capability Development Document (CDD), March 2011; the Soldier Protection CDD; the December 2011 Operational Energy Initial Capabilities Document (ICD); the Army Chief of Staff's Squad: Foundation of the Decisive Force initiative, and the December 2011 Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) Operational Energy directives specified by GEN Allen."

This improved conformal battery will be the central source of power for all Soldier worn devices and serve as the central power storage point for integrated Soldier worn energy harvesting and renewable energy sources.  This integrated Soldier system will pass its power and peripheral C4I data through a wiring system that will be integrated into the fabric of the improved outer tactical vest.  Will continue to mature: 1) wireless charging on the Soldier from vehicle platforms and from Soldier worn power sources, thus reducing dependency on battery chargers and numbers of batteries carried; 2) improved light weight hybrid power sources; 3) integrated embedded \"smart\" electro-textiles to improve Soldier mobility and reduce Soldier weight; 4) Soldier carried power\/data management devices that are capable of harvesting energy from a variety of available power sources even in the most austere\/remote environments reducing Soldier resupply; and 5) Will mature a highly efficient solar technology conducive to a variety of operating environments and capable of providing over twice the current level of power in an equal or smaller form factor."

Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program, leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations. The NW system provides operators electronic, real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader. The NW system also provides the same integrated mission command capability to tactical vehicle mounted leaders so that when they dismount their vehicles, they still have access to the common operating picture (COP) and have full situational awareness. This capability provides unparalleled situational awareness and understanding to the dismounted leader allowing for faster, more accurate decisions and reduced fratricide in the tactical fight. \n\nThe development and integration process relies significantly on feedback from combat operations and employs combat veterans for Soldier integration and feedback enhancing human factors design and fightability of the system. The NW program also integrates soldier power systems aimed at considerably reducing the weight of the dismounted soldier's load. This project funds the following: 1) Yearly developmental and operational test of the NW with continually advancing commercial smart device technology inserted, 2) Software development for planned updates, 3) Integration with Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), including vehicle power integration, 4) and Government led integration and system engineering and program management."

The NW program executed a MS A in FY09 and began three competing TD phase contracts leading to developmental and operational testing FY10-11. A Configuration Steering Board (CSB) was held August 2011 which restructured the program to implement COTS-based technology. Twice a year technology maturation and integration is assessed at NIE events. The NW MS C was approved 3 April 2012 followed by a low rate Capability Set (CS) 14 production award. Will conduct Developmental Test and Evaluation planned for 4QFY12-1QFY13, followed by 1QFY13 Operational Test (OT) as well as hardware, software, integration and program management. The Developmental and Operational tests are validation of the system utility, supportability, and austere-environment power production and regeneration strategy-leading to a production decision in the 2QFY13 to procure the CS14 quantity of NW systems and support. While in production NW also continues to reduce size, weight and power through a semi-annual integration and evaluation and test of the latest commercial smart device technologies which evolve continuously."
