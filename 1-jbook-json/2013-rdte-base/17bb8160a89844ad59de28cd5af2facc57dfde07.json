It also facilitates the sharing of training and readiness information, while allowing for the transfer of emerging and innovative technologies among the Services and private sector.  Efforts have included: development of mission essential tasks; design, development, and implementation of performance metrics, data, and methodologies for the Joint Assessment and Enabling Capability to guide Training Transformation and support the Department\u2019s balanced scorecard and Defense Readiness Reporting System; identified and defined joint urban training requirements, identified methods to conduct effective joint training, and determined best means to develop simulations, military construction, and other urban training facilities that meet Service, joint, and fiscal demands and requirements; developed joint training regimen requirements and investments ranging from the joint strategic level down to the joint tactical level for joint asymmetric warfare; and developed a joint stability and support operations training roadmap and investment plan for operations other than war including peace enforcement, peacekeeping, and humanitarian assistance.\n\nIn addition, this project supports DHRA and DoD training managers (OSD, Joint Staff, Unified Commands, and the Services) in promoting more efficient and effective use of training resources, increasing the effectiveness of military training, and enhancing the readiness and performance of the military forces.
