The THAAD element includes five major components: Interceptors, Launchers, Army Navy\/Transportable Radar Surveillance - Type 2 (AN\/TPY-2) Radars, THAAD Fire Control and Communication (TFCC), and THAAD-Peculiar Support Equipment. THAAD delivered Battery #1 in FY 2009 and Battery #2 in FY 2010 to the U.S. Army at Ft. Bliss, TX for initial fielding and training. \n\nPATRIOT Advanced Capability (PAC 3) is an U.S. Army short range Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) that interfaces with the BMDS. MDA funds PATRIOT participation in BMDS interoperability integration efforts. \n\nTHAAD has completed the development of the THAAD 1.0 configuration and will develop the THAAD Build 2.0 capability. Continued development and integration will provide for enhanced debris mitigation and interoperability with other BMDS elements. \n\nTesting with other BMDS elements (including BMDS Command Control \/ Battle Management and Communication (C2BMC), PATRIOT and Aegis) will demonstrate integrated mission execution and provides flexibility to rapidly augment the stationary BMDS assets in the global Phased Adaptive Approach. \n\nProgram-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management costs in support of MDA functions and activities across the entire BMDS."

New THAAD capabilities include: 1) Launch on Link 16 Track providing the ability to initiate an engagement and launch THAAD interceptors using sensor data provided by BMDS sources outside the THAAD Battery; 2) Improving THAAD Weapons System performance in the presence of a high debris environment; 3) Expanding the defended area footprints by remote operation of THAAD Launchers; 4) Peer-to-peer engagement coordination with Aegis and Patriot weapon systems; 5) Software upgrades to maintain capability against evolving threats; and 6) Message based regional engagement command functionality to process message content from Command and Control\/Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) to obtain direction for target engagement. \n\nTHAAD supports fielded software through Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS). PDSS enhancements will include: 1) Information Assurance mandatory updates; 2) Warfighter requested corrections and enhancements; and 3) Upgrades to maintain interface with other BMDS software builds. \n\nThrough FY 2011, THAAD provided logistical support to field, operate, maintain, repair and replenish the weapon system. Beginning in FY 2012, these costs are resourced with O&M funding. \n\nMDA Engineering integrates element development, test, and Modeling and Simulation work to optimize the capability of the BMDS. \n\nTHAAD provides institutional and unit training devices to support U.S. Army requirements for CONUS and OCONUS deployments based on the System Training Plan (STRAP)."

Other costs included provide facility capabilities for MDA Executing Agent locations (with the exception of Federal Office Building 2 after FY 2011), such as physical and technical security, legal services, travel and agency training, office and equipment leases, rents and utilities, data and unified communications support, supplies and maintenance, logistics and central property management of equipment, and similar operating expenses. Also includes legal settlements, and foreign currency fluctuations on a limited number of foreign contracts. In keeping with congressional intent, PWS is allocated on a pro-rata basis and therefore, fluctuates by year based on the total MDA budget."
