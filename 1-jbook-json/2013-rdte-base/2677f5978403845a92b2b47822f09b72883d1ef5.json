This program is critical to ensure that the Department of Defense (DoD) has the ability to adequately test the advanced systems that will be fielded in the future.  To meet this objective, the T&E\/S&T program performs the following activities:\n\u2022 Exploits new technologies and processes to meet important test and evaluation (T&E) requirements.\n\u2022 Expedites the transition of new technologies from the laboratory environment to the T&E community.\n\u2022 Leverages industry advances in equipment, modeling and simulation, and networking to support T&E.\nAdditionally, the T&E\/S&T program examines emerging T&E requirements resulting from Joint Service initiatives to identify T&E technology needs and to develop a long-range roadmap for technology insertion.  The program leverages and employs applicable applied research efforts from the highly developed technology base in DoD laboratories and test centers, other government agencies, industry, and academia to accelerate development of new test capabilities.  This program element also provides travel funds for T&E\/S&T program oversight, special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure.\n     The Secretary of Defense, in a memorandum dated April 19, 2011, established seven strategic science and technology (S&T) investment priorities for fiscal years 2013-2017, specifically 1) Data to Decisions, 2) Engineered Resilient Systems, 3) Cyber Science and Technology, 4) Electronic Warfare\/Electronic Protection, 5) Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction, 6) Autonomy, and 7) Human Systems.  The T&E\/S&T Program has been re-aligned and reprioritized to prepare the T&E community to test warfighting capabilities that emerge from these S&T priority investments.\n     The T&E\/S&T program is funded within the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it develops and demonstrates high payoff technologies for current and future DoD test capabilities."

Current weapon system demonstrations and technology development programs include high-speed and hypersonic air-breathing missiles, maneuvering reentry and boost\/glide weapons, hypersonic gun-launched projectiles, and air-breathing space access vehicles.  These systems require development of high-speed turbine, ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle engines; high temperature materials; thermal protection systems; and thermal management systems.  In addition, important advancements are underway in systems such as conventional turbine engines and high-speed (supercavitating) torpedoes.\n     In response to advances made in technologies to achieve prompt strike weapons, the Advanced Propulsion Test Technology project has been renamed to High Speed System Test (HSST) to address test technology needs beyond propulsion testing, including aerodynamic and aerothermal testing, so that the test community has the technology to support the required test scenarios for concepts under development in the science and technology (S&T) community.  Furthermore, the technology development efforts within the HSST project have been re-prioritized to align to Secretary of Defense guidance on S&T priority investments for FY2013-2017.  The HSST project is developing advanced test and evaluation (T&E) technologies for ground test (both advanced propulsion and aerodynamic\/aerothermal testing), for open-air range flight test, and for advanced computational tools, along with instrumentation and diagnostics systems that could be used both in ground tests and flight tests of high speed systems.\n     The HSST project develops technologies to enable robust, accurate, and timely T&E of these future weapon systems.  Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition regulations require weapon systems to undergo a thorough T&E process to detect deficiencies early and to ensure system suitability and survivability.  However, the extreme environments in which these weapons operate preclude accurate determination of their performance with today\u2019s T&E assets.  Current national test capabilities have deficiencies in data accuracy, flight condition duplication and simulation, test methods, productivity, modeling and simulation (M&S) fidelity, and range safety.\n     The HSST mission is to provide test technologies that will enable high-speed and hypersonic weapon systems to be successfully developed through accurate, robust, and efficient T&E."

Current production ground test facilities can only create the high temperature inlet conditions necessary for scramjet engine tests by burning fuel in the airflow prior to entering the engine.  The resulting \u201cvitiated air\u201d has different gas properties than clean air which significantly affects the engine\u2019s performance and introduces artificiality in the test environment and errors in predicted flight performance.  These landmark reports will improve the understanding of results from existing vitiated T&E facilities, help explain flight test results, improve the accuracy of M&S, and guide investments in future T&E capabilities.\n   Tests were also completed comparing the performance of identical engines in impulse and blow down aero propulsion facilities in order to quantify the accuracy of the different test methods.  The tests revealed significant differences, providing the T&E community with important new information to guide future weapon system test plans.\n   Two new technology developments were initiated to develop the test techniques necessary to accurately test large scramjet engines in our existing national facilities which would otherwise be deemed too small a scale for accurate measurements.  One effort will evaluate a means of truncating the long inlet section of an engine while still accurately replicating its performance.  The other effort will quantify and improve the accuracy of direct connect and semi-free jet test techniques by comparing them to a benchmark free jet test.  Collectively, all of the aforementioned technology developments will allow weapons system developers to maximize the use of our existing infrastructure and better understand test results, thereby reducing flight test and acquisition risks.\n   The two key technologies necessary for revolutionary improvements to the accuracy and productivity of aero propulsion ground test are clean air heat addition (i.e. non-vitiated air) and variable Mach number test capability.  Component technologies for these desired capabilities were previously developed by the T&E\/S&T program and are now being incorporated into a small scale, clean air, variable Mach number, aero propulsion test facility.  Integrating these technologies into an operational facility will complete their development to Technology Readiness Level 6, provide an on-going test asset to the DoD, and provide risk reduction for construction of a full scale facility.  Significant progress was made this year with the completion of all Phase I design work, fabrication of the heater\u2019s pressure vessel, and initiation of production of the yttria-stabilized-zirconia heat storage bricks and the modifications required for integration into an existing host facility.\n   Understanding ablation characteristics of thermal protection systems is critical for maneuvering reentry and boost\/glide vehicles.  A new electrode design that increases arc jet facilities\u2019 maximum enthalpy (available energy to simulate flight conditions) and run time, was successfully demonstrated this year allowing for more realistic tests of leading edge materials.  Additionally, a new test technique was established utilizing low temperature ablators in existing wind tunnels which do not achieve true reentry temperatures to determine the affect of ablation on vehicles\u2019 stability and control and to provide data for validating ablation computer models.  Final tests in this technology development were successfully conducted at Mach 8 and 14 with a boost-glide vehicle nose tip.\n   Advances in flight test technologies included advances in flight termination technology and flight maneuvers.  Hardware-in-the-loop testing and final design of a flight rated, autonomous flight termination system were completed.  The autonomous flight termination system is designed to assure destruction of an errant hypersonic vehicle if it leaves its designated safety corridor.  Advanced parameter identification maneuvers were designed, qualified, and programmed into the flight computer of the second X-51 flight.  These special maneuvers are designed to collect far more stability and control data per flight than possible using traditional methods thus reducing the number of flight tests and costs.\n   Progress was also made in advanced high speed systems test instrumentation.  Fabrication of a flight-weight, laser-based, non-intrusive measurement system was completed for an upcoming flight test.  A similar laser-based system for ground testing was transitioned and is being used in a hypersonic wind tunnel.  Further advancement of this technology is being made by utilizing newly available lasers operating in the mid-infrared spectrum to significantly lower measurement uncertainties.  Design and fabrication of a miniaturized, temperature compensated wind tunnel balance specifically addressing a T&E gap in supersonic store separation capabilities was completed.  Finally, testing of a fiber optic heat flux gauge was also successfully completed. \n   Investment in a state-of-the-art validated computational fluid dynamics tool culminated in release of an updated version to the hypersonic community that can simulate the complex flows within scramjet engines and includes physical modeling for turbulence, fuel-air combustion, and heat transfer.  The code was successfully used to model combustion phenomenon in a scramjet engine."

A vast amount of data must be collected, transmitted, and analyzed, which requires a large amount of spectrum resources.  However, the amount of radio frequency spectrum designated to support test and evaluation (T&E) is decreasing, most notably due to reallocation for commercial use.  The combination of decreasing radio frequency spectrum and increasing data requirements results in an urgent need to create test technologies that maximize the use of spectrum resources for Department of Defense (DoD) T&E operations.\n   The L and S frequency bands are the traditional spectrum allotted for military use.  The explosive need for spectrum in the commercial sector has resulted in reallocation of portions of these bands to industry.  To compensate, DoD was authorized to use the C-Band spectrum which offers numerous benefits, including a three-fold increase in available bandwidth, but comes with technical challenges.  Most notably, our current test infrastructure for telemetry is not designed to accommodate C-Band.  Technologies are required to implement innovative techniques that efficiently extend our use of C-Band without a major overhaul to our national test infrastructure.  For instance, commercial telemetry transmitters operating in C-Band exist but do not have the form factor (size and weight) or packaging (not ruggedized) to survive airborne test applications.\n   Traditional telemetry applications employ streaming telemetry where data is moved one-way from the instrumented system under test to our test infrastructure.  Modern network based telemetry capabilities, like those being developed by the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP), enable more robust\/efficient bidirectional transfer of data.  DoD\u2019s strategy is to create technologies for streaming telemetry capability in C-Band, opening up legacy L- and S-Bands for networked telemetry usage.\n   The Spectrum Efficient Technology (SET) project is developing test technologies that enable more efficient use of legacy telemetry bands and expansion into non-traditional areas of the radio frequency and optical spectra at DoD test ranges.  These technology advancements will address both the growing data requirements of warfighting systems and the limited availability of spectrum to support testing.  The technology development efforts within the SET project have been re-prioritized to align to Secretary of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments for FY2013-2017.  The SET project is structured to develop test technologies to advance range communications, networked telemetry capabilities, and enhanced management of spectrum at DoD test ranges."

Spectrum and network management technology continued, with a focus on capabilities that allow for dynamic distribution of spectrum resources amongst test participants.  The spectrum management technologies matured by SET provided risk reduction in support of spectrum management needs exacerbated by spectrum selloff activities.  The SET project matured and demonstrated the capability of a radio network to rapidly change operating frequencies based on policies in the presence of non-cooperative interference, thus maintaining connectivity with no perceivable impact on telemetry network performance.  Additionally, the SET project initiated the development of a three dimensional channel model tool for modeling and simulation of telemetry channels in various environments to provide higher fidelity simulations for use in researching the effects of terrain and other factors on telemetry channels.

A networked telemetry transceiver using an advanced waveform was developed and tested as a risk reduction effort for the CTEIP integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry (iNET) development.  The SET project initiated an effort to develop a networked data recorder to provide risk reduction in support of iNET development.  Efforts continued in developing forward error correction schemes for use in aeronautical telemetry to increase data reliability in dynamic test environments.

Additionally, SET initiated efforts to develop airborne phased array antenna technology that will enable flexible scheduling of the T&E spectrum by incorporating both the traditional and C-Band frequencies.

Our ability to counter such threats is essential to owning the airspace in theater.  Therefore, the ability to test missile warning systems (MWS), hostile fire indicators, infrared countermeasures (IRCM), and advanced sensors is critical to our national defense.  Additionally, a new generation of enemy radio frequency (RF) missile seekers is both currently fielded and in further development, requiring a correspondingly new generation of test technologies to test the latest countermeasures.  The test and evaluation (T&E) community is required to test IRCM and RF countermeasure systems in a repeatable manner with validated ground-truth data before and after integration into warfighting systems.  Without new test technologies, the Department of Defense (DoD) will be unable to perform adequate T&E of advanced countermeasure systems.\n     In response to Secretary of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments for FY2013-2017, the T&E\/S&T program restructured and reprioritized on-going Multi-Spectral Test (MST)technology efforts to address emerging Electronic Warfare\/Electronic Protection test needs.  Accordingly, the MST project was renamed to the Electronic Warfare Test (EWT) project, to align with the Department\u2019s priorities.  The EWT project is focusing on the test needs in both the electro-optic (EO) and the radio frequency domains, and by concentrating on the core test technology needs, technical advancements in this area have applicability to other EO and RF test requirements, such as in fire control systems, reconnaissance sensors, and missile seeker subsystems.\n     The EWT project develops test technologies to stimulate IRCM and RF system sensors through the high-fidelity simulation of scenes viewed by the sensors.  Stimulation can be as simple as testing to see if a system under test responds to an image or as complex as simulating battle phenomena to measure the response of a system under test in a more relevant, cluttered scenario.  Simulations and stimulations are used at open air ranges (OAR) and in installed system test facilities (ISTF), and in hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) test beds."

On-board and wearable instrumentation are required for sensing and collecting critical performance data; determining accurate time, space, position, and attitude information; interfacing with command and control data links; monitoring and reporting system-wide communications; recording human operator performance; and storing and transmitting data.  The technology development efforts within the AIST project have been re-prioritized to align to Secretary of Defense  guidance on science and technology (S&T) priority investments for FY2013-2017, particularly in support of human systems, engineered resilient systems, and counter weapons of mass destruction.

Consequently, a continued major thrust for FY 2011 included the development of test technologies to support collection of TSPI data for soldier systems (manned or unmanned), particularly in GPS-denied or degraded situations, such as in urban areas and tunnels.  A wideband local positioning system was developed to locate soldiers and unmanned ground systems in GPS-denied\/impaired areas using radio frequency waveforms and techniques that penetrate structures found in urban environments.  Test results indicate that position accuracy less than one meter can be achieved with radio frequency signals going through up to four concrete block walls, which constitutes typical structural conditions encountered in urban operations.\n   To support testing high-acceleration systems, an ultra-high dynamics GPS receiver was developed that performs significantly better than existing test instrumentation.  In preliminary tests, the prototype ultra-high dynamics GPS receiver demonstrated the ability to acquire satellite signals at velocities up to 5.0 kilometers per second (km\/s) and during accelerations at 50-1100 times the force of gravity.  As a result, position solutions were obtained at velocities up to 10 km\/s with time-to-first-fix under 0.5 seconds, which is important for testing air-to-air missile systems launched from under the wing or from a weapons bay.\n   Other major development areas in FY 2011 included the development of advanced sensor instrumentation technologies (non-intrusiveness, miniaturization, and hardened for harsh environments).  A probe was developed for simultaneous analysis of turbine engine exhaust products (i.e., carbon, nitrogen, water vapor, and hydrocarbons) and will be used in ground testing of the C-17 engine.  Technology investments are also being applied to develop a fiber-optic instrumentation test suite capable of measuring electric and magnetic fields to support testing electromagnetically-propelled weapons.\n   Additional efforts to test systems that operate in a GPS-denied environment include a technology that enables networking of GPS-enabled systems within the test environment, and then using the network to integrate GPS and other positional information across the connected nodes by sharing raw observables from GPS and inter-node ranges to locate each network node with high reliability.  Simulation results indicate that this technology will deliver high accuracy tracking performance upon completion.  A related technological approach employs a layered system of navigation sensors leveraging collaborative navigation, existing radio frequency ranging technology, and a Doppler velocimeter to achieve more precise positional information.\n   Several new efforts were initiated in FY 2011.  A holographic optical memory system was designed for data recording and retrieval, extending the data storage capacity of current state-of-the-art holographic memory up to 16 terabytes.  An attachment technology initiated development with new adhesive formulations that employ an electrically releasing foil patch, for use in attaching sensors to non-conductive painted exterior surfaces of aircraft and other combat vehicles, significantly improving the turnaround time to return the system under test back to its operational configuration.  To improve testing at DoD undersea range complexes, algorithms and methodologies were investigated to automate detection and classification of marine mammal vocalizations from ocean floor range sensors.  This test technology will allow the Navy to conduct critical test and evaluation (T&E) events without jeopardizing marine mammal populations.  Boot-mounted sensors were investigated to track the geolocation of dismounted war fighters with sub-meter accuracy during testing.  Additionally, an effort has been initiated to leverage microsystems technology under development at universities, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and government laboratories that will be applicable to T&E of modern war fighting systems."

A robust test capability to assess directed energy weapons is essential to understand their effectiveness and limitations, including determining their efficiency to perform counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) operations.  Such assessments will depend upon knowledge acquired through the test and evaluation (T&E) of the directed energy technologies and testing of operational concepts.  Directed energy weapon technologies, primarily consisting of high energy lasers (HEL) and high powered microwaves (HPM), are outpacing available test capabilities.  Traditional test techniques for evaluating conventional munitions (with flight times ranging from seconds to minutes) are not sufficient for the T&E of directed energy weapons that place energy on target instantaneously.  Consequently, new test technology solutions are needed to ensure that adequate developmental, live-fire, and operational test capabilities are available when directed energy programs are ready to test.\n     Directed energy system and component testing requires three principal assessments:  (1) energy or power on target; (2) the effects on the target; and (3) the propagation of the directed energy to the target through the atmosphere.  In addition, the vulnerability of DoD systems to HEL and HPM threats are required to be characterized in accordance with Military Standard (MIL-STD)-464C.  Current test capabilities do not provide the detailed data required to understand directed energy system performance and effects.\n      The Directed Energy Test (DET) project is developing the technologies necessary for quantitative assessment of HEL and HPM performance, as well as the vulnerability of DoD weapons system to directed energy threats.  The technology development efforts within the DET project have been re-prioritized to align to Secretary of Defense  guidance on science and technology priority investments for FY2013-2017."

Additional developments have produced alternative sensor array designs to measure the temperature maps on the back surface on a HEL-irradiated target and alternative inverse heat conduction algorithms to estimate the temperature on the front (HEL-heated) surface.  In this same HEL area, a hyperspectral sensor system that remotely measures radiance from an HEL spot on the target and applies an algorithm to calculate the target front surface temperature has been designed and is under fabrication.\n   In the area of HEL effects on target, an adaptive optics system has been designed that will allow improved remote imaging of an HEL spot on a remote target.  A prototype is under fabrication and is designed to be readily adaptable to telescopes at various test facilities.\n   In the area of HEL atmospheric propagation, a multi-light detection and ranging system to measure important atmospheric profiles along a slant path adjacent to the HEL beam propagation path is being fabricated.  This one system measures profiles for three parameters: optical turbulence, water vapor content, and aerosol attenuation.\n   Addressing the HPM energy at the source,a flash X-ray characterization prototype provided the capability to successively image explosively generated HPM prime energy to understand why expected increases in capability with more energetic explosives was not being realized.  At least one of the issues with achieving explosive source expectations was revealed during the field testing of this prototype.\n   In the area of surrogate shooters to support the recently approved MIL-STD-464C requirements, a high frequency wideband prototype was delivered providing the required fields on target, while also being capable of achieving significantly greater power.  As a result, the transition partner has requests from several organizations to test concepts for advanced systems using the source.  Several prototypes were delivered to improve HPM test tempo in MIL-STD-464C test activities including rapid polarization changes and broad power variation.  The demonstrated test technologies have wide application to other HPM test sources.\n   A test technology supporting both HPM energy on target and effects on target was demonstrated.  This capability measures the electric field arriving at eight locations on the target and the temperature rise resulting from those fields.  A family of HPM sensors demonstrated test technologies for measuring energy inside larger targets during HPM engagements.  The sensor technology can be used singly or in combination to non-intrusively measure electric and magnetic field vectors at the same location.  After promising field tests, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is now characterizing the performance of these new sensors so they can be adopted by the test ranges as authoritative data collection devices.\n   Early testing of electric field sensors for support of electromagnetic rail gun testing identified a prime source for examined rail wear, a key issue for rail gun systems.  To better support C-IED testing, the test technology development to measure soil electrical properties built a brass board sensor with three interchangeable heads to cover the required frequencies.  The brass board has been used in proving the concept to measure the soil electrical properties for portions of the test site, with results showing measurements similar to those taken by legacy technologies.  An advantage of the new test technology is that it measured in 20 minutes what the legacy measurements systems could do in two months."

To better support weapon research and design, a method will be sought to determine the time out of action for targets, such that HPM effects on targets need not be permanent.  In weapons development testing, these sensors will indicate how much increase in HPM weapon output is required to make a weapon effective.  In survivability testing, these sensors will support assessment of susceptibility with lower power HPM sources.

The NST project developed test planning technologies to address test integrations and interoperability issues.  Ontologies were developed to formalize concepts pertaining to LVC test resources in a net-centric joint mission environment.  Knowledge bases were developed that capture subject matter expertise on setup and execution of a test event and characteristics of test resources.  Reasoning capabilities were extended and integrated to automate test planning tasks.  The NST project developed a planning\/visualization technology to support joint mission thread testing to better correlate test data to the effectiveness of mission operations.\n   The NST project advanced technologies to support the execution of distributed tests with active network control, enhanced the degree of dynamic management of the test infrastructure, and improved the integration of Service laboratories and test ranges by transitioning new technologies into the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA).  \n   The NST project is investing in technologies to test military systems that employ Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), including test technologies to help the tester understand what is happening inside of and between SOA services and resources during test events.  These test technologies will allow the tester to understand the environment, including but not limited to network hardware and software.  The NST project also developed technologies for the next generation of TENA middleware that support a broad range of networks, including wireless networks, and provide native support for handheld and embedded computing platforms.\n   The NST project transitioned test technologies to the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) Interoperability Test and Evaluation Capability (InterTEC) development that will provide the capability to automate testing of the Net-Ready Key Performance Parameters (KPP) solution architecture element.  In addition, this test technology will perform compliance assessments of architectures against governing standards and allow a tester to plan a test event based on authoritative Joint mission threads.  The test technology will also allow the tester to visualize the execution of mission threads by mapping the progress of the test to architecture views.  An additional FY2011 NST transition involved technologies that will ingest test plans and provide automated, rule-based control of the test infrastructure during a large-scale complex test event.\n   Finally, the NST project transferred two on-going cyberspace test technology developments to the new Cyberspace Test project, which would be better suited within that portfolio."

The Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Test (UAST) project addresses current and emerging challenges associated with the test and evaluation (T&E) of these critical warfighting capabilities.  The UAST project is developing test technologies to simulate, stimulate, instrument, measure, and assess the capability of an autonomous system to perceive its environment, process information, adapt to dynamic conditions, make decisions, and effectively act on those decisions in the context of mission execution.  The technology development efforts within the UAST project have been re-prioritized to align to Secretary of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments for FY2013-2017, particularly in assessing autonomy.\n     The UAST project will provide the test technologies to effectively measure performance and characterize risk, thereby increasing the warfighter\u2019s trust in autonomous systems.  Current Department of Defense (DoD) test capabilities and methodologies are insufficient to address the testing of increasingly autonomous units and teams of unmanned systems operating in unstructured, dynamic battlespace environments.  Furthermore, advancements are being made in developing collaborating system-of-autonomous-systems, working in concert as a swarm or pack and in close proximity with humans.

Accordingly, the Multi-Level Security for test and evaluation (T&E) project was renamed to the Cyberspace Test project, to align with the Department\u2019s priorities.  Furthermore, two technology developments, previously in the Net-Centric System Test (NST) portfolio, that were investigating creating representative cyberspace attack threat effects were re-aligned within the Cyberspace Test project.  The Cyberspace Test project will address all test technology shortfalls in cyberspace testing, including planning cyberspace tests, executing cyberspace tests, and creating representative cyberspace threats.  The Cyberspace Test project will develop high fidelity live-virtual-constructive (LVC) test environments to measure cyberspace attacks and countermeasures across all information technology stack layers, while leveraging cyberspace technologies being developed across the S&T community."

These two efforts developed test technologies to induce network internet protocol\/host degradation and the ability to store and manage effects profiles.  Furthermore, the Cyberspace Test project investigated strategies to provide the tester with the capability to measure the impact of cyber threats, such as, denial-of-service and virus\/worm vulnerabilities."
