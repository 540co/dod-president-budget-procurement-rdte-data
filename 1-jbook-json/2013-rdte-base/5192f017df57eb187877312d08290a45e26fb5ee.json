            "val": "The four aircraft E-4B National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) fleet satisfies the military need for an airborne operations center with communications capabilities that permit military and civilian leadership to monitor and control military and civil national assets during all phases of nuclear and non-nuclear conflict or natural disaster. The E-4B NAOC fleet also satisfies the military requirement to provide a highly survivable node of the National Military Command System (NMCS). Developmental modifications include, but are not limited to, upgrades and enhancements to aircraft structures, propulsion system, fuel system, environmental control system, electrical generation and distribution systems, flight safety and navigation systems (with their associated communications equipment), and the related aircraft operations center facilities, equipment, and communications necessary for the E-4B fleet to execute its mission. Additionally, funds may be used to explore modifications, upgrades, and future systems required to meet evolving mission requirements.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nDevelopmental modifications and studies\/projects currently underway or planned for accomplishment under this program include:\n\n- The Secure Data Crypto modification replaces various E-4B cryptographic systems currently scheduled to be decertified by the National Security Agency (NSA). This modification ensures the continued transmission and receipt of critical strategic force orders. Funds for this modification will be used to design an engineering solution, develop compatible software, and conduct pre-production studies for integration of NSA approved and Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) compliant secure data cryptographic devices and associated peripherals on the aircraft.\n\n- The Super High Frequency (SHF) Multiplexor (MUX) project integrates a more capable and logistically supportable MUX to replace the obsolete and temporary solution used today. The current SHF MUX is prone to intermittent disconnects and poor performance. A new device will allow the E-4B to better meet requirements of transmitting combined secure and non-secure digital data streams via satellite.\n\n- The Communication, Navigation, Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) efforts upgrades the air traffic communications systems to improve Navigation and Instrument Approach capabilities. These ongoing efforts are required to comply with both U.S. and international air traffic management requirements and maintain worldwide (anytime\/anywhere) availability. This effort will add Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out) capability, a Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) capability, and a Multi-Mode Receiver for Global Positioning System (GPS) Precision Instrument Approaches and replace the obsolete Flight Management Computer (FMC) and upgrade required systems to meet domestic and foreign CNS\/ATM requirements.\n\n- Secure, Survivable Communication efforts will upgrade and replace existing systems required to meet existing National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-28 and NSPD-51\/Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-20 requirements and to ensure continued connectivity and interoperability as satellite and communications infrastructure evolves. Expected modifications requiring RDT&E include, but are not limited to, installation of Advanced Extreemly High Frequency (AEHF) Compatible Terminal, Presidential National Voice Conferencing (PNVC), modification of the current Super High Frequency (SHF) system to meet immediate needs, and eventual replacement of the SHF System. AEHF Compatible Command Post Terminals will replace the Military Strategic, Tactical and Relay (MILSTAR) terminal and provide access to protected wideband AEHF satellite networks. PNVC replaces Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN), which will not be supported once the AEHF satellite network is in place. Upgrade of the current SHF system is required in the near-term to replace the most critically obsolete components to ensure that the system remains operable and logistically supportable until a replacement system is fielded. A replacement to the SHF system is required as secure, survivable communications capability transitions from the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS).\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

In prior budget submissions, these development thrusts were previously described in the Communication, Navigation, Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management project description.  These development efforts described herein include: 1) improved capabilities for Navigation and Instrument Approach, 2) add Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B)OUT capability, and 3) add Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B)IN capability.  Collectively, these three efforts do not expand the scope of work previously described in the single Communication, Navigation, Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management description.\n\nThe previously funded Secure, Survivable Communication development efforts have been split into its two basic components to provide better program insight to the use and scheduling of these development funds.  The two work concentrations include 1) the modernization of the aging SHF system, and 2) integration and testing of the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Compatible Terminal, and the Presidential National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) equipment.

                            "val": "The four aircraft E-4B National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) fleet satisfies the military need for an airborne operations center with communications capabilities that permit military and civilian leadership to monitor and control military and civil national assets during all phases of nuclear and non-nuclear conflict or natural disaster. The E-4B NAOC fleet also satisfies the military requirement to provide a highly survivable node of the National Military Command System (NMCS). Developmental modifications include, but are not limited to, upgrades and enhancements to aircraft structures, propulsion system, fuel system, environmental control system, electrical generation and distribution systems, flight safety and navigation systems (with their associated communications equipment), and the related aircraft operations center facilities, equipment, and communications necessary for the E-4B fleet to execute its mission. Additionally, funds may be used to explore modifications, upgrades, and future systems required to meet evolving mission requirements.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nDevelopmental modifications and studies\/projects currently underway or planned for accomplishment under this program include:\n\n- The Secure Data Crypto modification replaces various E-4B cryptographic systems currently scheduled to be decertified by the National Security Agency (NSA). This modification ensures the continued transmission and receipt of critical strategic force orders. Funds for this modification will be used to design an engineering solution, develop compatible software, and conduct pre-production studies for integration of NSA approved and Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) compliant secure data cryptographic devices and associated peripherals on the aircraft.\n\n- The Super High Frequency (SHF) Multiplexor (MUX) project integrates a more capable and logistically supportable MUX to replace the obsolete and temporary solution used today. The current SHF MUX is prone to intermittent disconnects and poor performance. A new device will allow the E-4B to better meet requirements of transmitting combined secure and non-secure digital data streams via satellite.\n\n- The Communication, Navigation, Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) efforts upgrades the air traffic communications systems to improve Navigation and Instrument Approach capabilities. These ongoing efforts are required to comply with both U.S. and international air traffic management requirements and maintain worldwide (anytime\/anywhere) availability. This effort will add Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out) capability, a Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) capability, and a Multi-Mode Receiver for Global Positioning System (GPS) Precision Instrument Approaches and replace the obsolete Flight Management Computer (FMC) and upgrade required systems to meet domestic and foreign CNS\/ATM requirements.\n\n- Secure, Survivable Communication efforts will upgrade and replace existing systems required to meet existing National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-28 and NSPD-51\/Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-20 requirements and to ensure continued connectivity and interoperability as satellite and communications infrastructure evolves. Expected modifications requiring RDT&E include, but are not limited to, installation of Advanced Extreemly High Frequency (AEHF) Compatible Terminal, Presidential National Voice Conferencing (PNVC), modification of the current Super High Frequency (SHF) system to meet immediate needs, and eventual replacement of the SHF System. AEHF Compatible Command Post Terminals will replace the Military Strategic, Tactical and Relay (MILSTAR) terminal and provide access to protected wideband AEHF satellite networks. PNVC replaces Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN), which will not be supported once the AEHF satellite network is in place. Upgrade of the current SHF system is required in the near-term to replace the most critically obsolete components to ensure that the system remains operable and logistically supportable until a replacement system is fielded. A replacement to the SHF system is required as secure, survivable communications capability transitions from the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS).\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
