It is a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging\/advanced technologies in operationally relevant environments with Special Operations Forces (SOF) users.  This project integrates emerging technologies and presents them in technology demonstrations, in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  Evaluation results often facilitate the initiation of new programs and the insertion of appropriate technologies to acquisition programs.   The element also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few rapid prototypes must be developed on a responsive basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate prototyping efforts of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  Sub-projects within the Special Operations Special Technology Development effort include:  \n\n   \u2022  Rapid Exploitation of Innovative Technologies (REITS).  This sub-project supports both top-down and bottom-up approaches for USSOCOM Components, Theater Special Operations Commands and Special Operations Task Forces to articulate innovative technology recommendations.  Concepts, ideas, and needs will be submitted to HQ USSOCOM for review and\/or approval as appropriate.  The tenets promote speed, evolution, collaboration, and engagement between the SOF user and the technical problem solver.   Individual projects or ideas can be submitted from every echelon of command.  Initial evaluation clears new ideas for distribution to industry, academia, laboratories or SOF in-country mobile technology repair complexes that have the capability to augment or build solutions in-place.  The USSOCOM directive, \"Rapid Technology Support to Special Operations\" outlines the processes to identify, assess and exploit emerging innovative technologies for SOF in the following Capability Areas:  1) Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (C4), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and Sensors; 2) Mobility, Power, and Energy; 3) SOF Warrior Systems and 4) Weapons and Munitions.  Technical activities in these areas will provide new operational capabilities and will mature technologies to better shape future SOF procurements.  \n\n     \u2022 REITS C4, ISR, and Sensors Capability Area.  Exploit emerging technologies to conduct ATDs that provide SOF with robust C4 and intelligence capabilities such as, but not limited to, ensuring uninterrupted information exchange, influencing situations to support mission accomplishments, reducing an adversary's ability to use information, increasing sensory performance, improving antenna technologies, and achieving near real-time data fusion for sensor systems.  \n\n     \u2022 REITS Mobility, Power, and Energy Capability Area.  Exploit emerging technologies to conduct ATDs such as, but not limited to, providing SOF with durable, survivable mobility capabilities in high threat areas; enhanced situational awareness; reconnaissance and  direct action in high threat areas using unmanned systems,  improved power system technologies for signature reduction, longer endurance, or smaller size; and advanced energy storage for vehicles, sensors, and operational needs.  \n\n    \u2022 REITS SOF Warrior Systems Capability Area.  Exploit emerging technologies to conduct ATDs that provide SOF with increased survivability and performance to enhance individual operator capabilities including, but not limited to, ballistic protection, personal equipment, and night vision and optics systems.     \n\n   \u2022 Weapons and Munitions Capability Area.  Exploit technologies such as tunable weapons, reduce signature capability, and reduce size and weight. \n\n   \u2022 Special Operations Special Technology Development Sub-Project.  This sub-project integrates emerging technologies and presents them in technology demonstrations, in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.\n\n   \u2022 Joint Task Force SWORD Sub-Project.  Explore use of experimental technologies to provide emergent technologies to quick response task force deployments.   \n\n  \u2022 Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (TTL) Technologies Sub-Project.  Exploit emerging technologies as identified in the TTL users' Capabilities Based Assessments.  Exploit emerging technologies to locate and track targets or items of interest.  Pursue advanced development and prototyping of TTL capabilities that have been proven to be feasible and operationally useful.  \n\n  \u2022 National to Theater Transition Sub-Project.  Conduct additional testing required to transition items from national forces to theater forces. \n  \n  \u2022 Foliage Penetration Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Targeting and Engagement Radar (YMQ-18A Unmanned Aerial Vehicle).  Conducts planning, payload integration, air vehicle improvements, and training in support of multiple operational demonstrations to evaluate the military utility of the YMQ18A unmanned aerial vehicle.\n\n  \u2022 Classified Sub-Project (provided under separate cover).\n\n \u2022 The Special Communications Field Segment-Enterprise program includes organizations, practices, processes, services, networks, systems and subsystems that manage and provide clandestine exchange of information between elements (field-to-field, field-to-base, base-to-field).\n\n   The following technology activity was added by Congress for FY 2011:\n\n  \u2022 SOF Advance Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD).  Expand and enhance current Unclassified Test Bed (UTB) capabilities such as evaluating, developing, prototyping and fabricating quick reaction prototypes.  A classified area is being configured and certified, this area will provide SOF the ability to quickly transition candidate technologies from the unclassified Test and Evaluation (T&E) environment to a classified T&E environment."
