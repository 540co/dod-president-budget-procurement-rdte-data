            "val": "Common Data Link (CDL) provides the DoD standard for interoperable, multi-service, multi-agency, wideband datalinks for manned\/unmanned platforms performing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. As the CDL Executive Agent (EA), the Air Force is responsible for cross-service application of CDL RDT&E funds facilitating compliance to Congressional and DoD mandates. Military Intelligence Program (MIP) funds are used to maintain, distribute, and upgrade the CDL specifications while ensuring design configuration, commonality, and interoperability among ISR platforms. Additionally, funds are used for the management of resources allocated for development and migration of CDL technologies. Updates to the CDL specification and developmental systems impact 10,000+ DoD airborne and ground ISR systems. The CDL program enables compliance with OSD and Congressional mandates to minimize spectrum usage, use of cryptographic equipment, and direct support to current operations. The CDL specifications permit current and future ISR assets to operate worldwide by providing sensor data directly via point-to-point broadcast to ground sites, airborne platforms and dismounted users. CDL is a vital link in DoD's emerging communication architectures. CDL provides the capability to relay data via air-to-air or compatible satellite links when the asset and ground site are not in line-of-sight. CDL provides the largest bandwidth datalink in DoD, accommodating numerous sensors collecting Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), and video data. Research and development activities include achieving higher data rates for CDL, operations in other spectral bands, and support of large area surveillance missions, while supporting continuous improvements and implementation of line-of-sight platform and CDL terminal Command and Control, plus increased Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) capabilities. Activities also include studies and analysis to support current and future program planning and execution. CDL terminal designs provide for future technology insertion and reduce non-recurring engineering and life-cycle costs to the user. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "Common Data Link (CDL) provides the DoD standard for interoperable, multi-service, multi-agency, wideband datalinks for manned\/unmanned platforms performing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. As the CDL Executive Agent (EA), the Air Force is responsible for cross-service application of CDL RDT&E funds facilitating compliance to Congressional and DoD mandates. Military Intelligence Program (MIP) funds are used to maintain, distribute, and upgrade the CDL specifications while ensuring design configuration, commonality, and interoperability among ISR platforms. Additionally, funds are used for the management of resources allocated for development and migration of CDL technologies. Updates to the CDL specification and developmental systems impact 10,000+ DoD airborne and ground ISR systems. The CDL program enables compliance with OSD and Congressional mandates to minimize spectrum usage, use of cryptographic equipment, and direct support to current operations. The CDL specifications permit current and future ISR assets to operate worldwide by providing sensor data directly via point-to-point broadcast to ground sites, airborne platforms and dismounted users. CDL is a vital link in DoD's emerging communication architectures. CDL provides the capability to relay data via air-to-air or compatible satellite links when the asset and ground site are not in line-of-sight. CDL provides the largest bandwidth datalink in DoD, accommodating numerous sensors collecting Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), and video data. Research and development activities include achieving higher data rates for CDL, operations in other spectral bands, and support of large area surveillance missions, while supporting continuous improvements and implementation of line-of-sight platform and CDL terminal Command and Control, plus increased Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) capabilities. Activities also include studies and analysis to support current and future program planning and execution. CDL terminal designs provide for future technology insertion and reduce non-recurring engineering and life-cycle costs to the user. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
