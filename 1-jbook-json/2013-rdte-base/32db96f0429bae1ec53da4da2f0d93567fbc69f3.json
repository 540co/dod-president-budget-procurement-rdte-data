            "val": "(U) The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD has been estimated at over 23 billion each year. The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 \"Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure\" of 01 February 2010.\n \n(U) The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&L)) designated a Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.  In FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.\n \n(U) The Corrosion Prevention Control Integrated Product Team membership consists of both the equipment and infrastructure corrosion control experts from the Services, the Joint Staff, the Coast Guard, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  The Services are given project submission instructions, evaluation procedures and selection criteria.  The CPC project selection board, chaired by the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight, reviews the projects and makes recommendations to the USD(AT&L) for final approval.\n\n(U) The former DoD Corrosion Executive issued a policy letter that states: \"Basic systems design, materials and processes selection, and intrinsic corrosion-prevention strategies establish the corrosion susceptibility of Defense material.  The early stages of acquisition provide our best opportunity to make effective trade-offs among the many competing design criteria. . .\"  The Congress and former DoD Corrosion Executive made it clear that research and development into materials and methods to prevent or mitigate corrosion should receive high priority.  Since Congress has clearly established this program as one of its highest priorities, and has reiterated its expectations regarding funding levels and methods, our budget request is designed to reflect both fiscal realities of one or more on many proposed projects over the next five to ten years.\n \nThese projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of storage tanks and other mission support facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of electrical and avionics equipment.  Likewise, an array of highly effective, rapid cure coatings that are easy to apply and can forestall corrosion for many years on aircraft and ships are being developed.  Other vital projects being considered include sealants, wash down systems, sensors and prognostic technologies that have joint service applications and potential to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects over a wide range of systems.  The FY 2012 budget request will provide a critically needed resource to trigger even larger investment and cost avoidance."

Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.  In FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.\n \n(U) The Corrosion Prevention Control Integrated Product Team membership consists of both the equipment and infrastructure corrosion control experts from the Services, the Joint Staff, the Coast Guard, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  The Services are given project submission instructions, evaluation procedures and selection criteria.  The CPC project selection board, chaired by the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight, reviews the projects and makes recommendations to the USD(AT&L) for final approval.\n\n(U) The former DoD Corrosion Executive issued a policy letter that states: \"Basic systems design, materials and processes selection, and intrinsic corrosion-prevention strategies establish the corrosion susceptibility of Defense material.  The early stages of acquisition provide our best opportunity to make effective trade-offs among the many competing design criteria. . .\"  The Congress and former DoD Corrosion Executive made it clear that research and development into materials and methods to prevent or mitigate corrosion should receive high priority.  Since Congress has clearly established this program as one of its highest priorities, and has reiterated its expectations regarding funding levels and methods, our budget request is designed to reflect both fiscal realities of one or more on many proposed projects over the next five to ten years.\n \nThese projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of storage tanks and other mission support facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of electrical and avionics equipment.  Likewise, an array of highly effective, rapid cure coatings that are easy to apply and can forestall corrosion for many years on aircraft and ships are being developed.  Other vital projects being considered include sealants, wash down systems, sensors and prognostic technologies that have joint service applications and potential to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects over a wide range of systems.  The FY 2012 budget request will provide a critically needed resource to trigger even larger investment and cost avoidance."

Projects are also evaluated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank projects by relative efficiency.  DEA factors include project performance period, ratio of OSD funding to Service funding, return-on-investment (ROI), degree to which the proposed technology addresses high-cost corrosion problems, potential benefits, and joint service applicability.  DEA efficiency scores are provided to the evaluation team to assist in their prioritization of projects for funding.  In addition, evaluators consider the following in recommending final priorities:\n1. Return on investment credibility: Degree to which there is evidence that the project will achieve an acceptable return on investment\n2. Technology maturity:  Degree to which proposed technology has been developed or demonstrated and will satisfy project objectives \n3. Schedule confidence:  Degree to which the project is likely to be completed on time\n4. Budget confidence:  Degree to which the project is likely to be completed within the proposed budget\n5. Management support: Degree to which management actively supports this project and has committed program resources to both manage and support this project\nThe project priority ranking is finalized and sent to the CPCIPT lead for a final decision..  Upon acceptance and approval of the projects by the CPCIPT, the projects are briefed to the Corrosion Forum.  Funding is distributed between the Services based on funding priorities associated with the evaluation process results.     \n   \nUpon selection by CPCIPT of the highest priority projects and final funding approval, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) transfers individual project funding to the appropriate funding sites that are provided by the Services.  After receiving the project funding, the Services are responsible for the funding and management of the projects.  OSD retains oversight and direction of the Corrosion Prevention and Control initiative through the CPCIPT.  Project oversight includes the review of quarterly status reports which address progress summary, performance goals and metrics and upcoming key events, as well as reports to periodic Corrosion Forums.   \n   \nThe quarterly project report (PR) format has been defined and requires the following input:   \n1. Statement of progress \n2. Outstanding issues \n3. Performance goals and metrics \n4. Upcoming events\n5. Schedule status \n6. Current return on investment (ROI) status \nThese project reports (PRs) are submitted to the CPCIPT.  The CPCIPT analyzes project status, progress and project statistics and informs the Service points of contact (POCs) of any project problems.  Projects are also required to report verbally at Corrosion Forums, as appropriate.   \n   \nCorrosion Prevention and Control (CPC) Program direction, control and oversight include the following activities to be performed by staff and support contractors:   \n1. Plan and schedule Corrosion Forums and oversee Corrosion Forum activities and working Integrated Product Team (IPT) meetings.   \n2. Oversee project performance including review of quarterly status reports which address progress summary, performance goals and metrics and upcoming key events, as well as reports to periodic Corrosion Forums.   \n3.
