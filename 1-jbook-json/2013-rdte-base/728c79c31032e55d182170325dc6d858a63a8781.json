Research and development will cover improvements and enhancements to Electronic Intelligence technology.  This will include improved\/next generation SEI technology for miniaturization and automation of hardware, national collection systems, signal processing and analysis, and de-interleaving of signals.  Propagation in a multi-path signal environment will also be assessed.  All work on this project will be undertaken in pursuit of goals stated by the Office of Naval Intelligence and the National Security Agency in support of the Worldwide Ship Tracking Program.\n\nThis effort was previously funded in PE 0604270N and is moved to this new PE 0304270N for FY11 onward.
