This research expands fundamental knowledge of material properties that leads to the development of novel materials for airframe, turbine engine, and spacecraft structures. The goals of this Project are to develop improved materials for air and space vehicles that provide increased structural efficiency and reliability, increase the operating temperature of aerospace materials, and further increase thrust-to-weight ratio of engines. A primary research focus is on refractory alloys, intermetallics, polymer composites, metal and ceramic matrix composites, advanced ceramics, and new material processing methods. Basic research is also conducted in natural materials and systems to exploit unique properties and products for use in the development of advanced weapon technologies. Research is conducted to mimic the natural detection systems of organisms at the molecular level for use in developing novel manmade sensors. Research in natural materials focuses on using existing organisms or bioengineered organisms to manufacture new materials, or using the organisms themselves as materials. The primary areas investigated by this Project are ceramics, non-metallic hybrid composites, metallic materials, and natural materials and systems."

The goals are to improve theoretical models for aerodynamic prediction and design, as well as to originate flow control concepts and predictive methods used to expand current flight performance boundaries through enhanced understanding of key fluid flow (primarily high-speed air) phenomena. Vehicle control principles based upon natural flight sensory and sensorimotor systems applicable to small remotely piloted aircraft (RPAs) and ultraslow flight are also examined. Basic research emphasis is on turbulence prediction and control, unsteady and separated flows, subsonic\/supersonic\/hypersonic flows, and internal fluid dynamics. The primary approach is to perform fundamental experimental investigations and to formulate advanced computational methods for the simulation and study of complex flows, prediction of real gas effects in high-speed flight, and control and prediction of turbulence in flight vehicles and propulsion systems. Primary areas of research investigated by this Project are unsteady aerodynamics, supersonic and hypersonic aerodynamics, turbulence, and rotating and internal flows characteristic of turbomachinery flows."

Basic research thrusts include airbreathing propulsion, space power and propulsion, high altitude signature characterization and contamination, propulsion diagnostics, thermal management of space-based power and propulsion, and the synthesis of new chemical propellants. These thrusts can be grouped into reacting flows and non-chemical energetics. Study of reacting flows involves the complex coupling between energy release through chemical reaction and the flow processes that transport chemical reactants, products, and energy. Non-chemical energetics research includes both plasma and beamed-energy propulsion for orbit-raising space missions and ultra-high energy techniques for spacebased energy utilization. Primary areas of research investigated by this Project are space power, propulsion, combustion, and diagnostics. As a newly emerging research direction within this Project, bioenergy and catalysis will investigate the economical production of renewable biofuels for airbreathing engines and will explore biocatalysis for compact power applications."

The data, fusion engines, and command and control functions reside on interlocking systems connected by networks leading to a system of systems architecture. Areas of research underpinning these team-focused, network-enabled systems are those in networks and communications, software, information management, and human-system interactions. Complementing these overall focus areas, research is occurring in the following areas: information operations network, software, and system architectures; information fusion; information forensics; communications and signals and control of large systems. Information Sciences also derive mathematical models and computational algorithms designed to optimize information intelligently and problem-solving under adverse conditions, including sustained operations, non-cooperative environments, and multi-interactive command and control."

Developed and tested algorithms for applications in reinforcement learning, sequential sampling, kernel-based classification and generalization, Bayesian forecasting, and optimization of attentional resources. Developed new techniques to understand, measure, and control informational masking to enhance speech communication and situational awareness. Investigated the fundamental constraints and limits of computationally-based socio-cultural prediction, including scalability from individual or small groups to larger coalitions."

Major thrust areas being investigated in this Project are complex electronics and fundamental quantum processes; plasma physics and high energy density non-equilibrium processes; and lasers and optics, electromagnetics, communication, and signal processing. Although the major thrust descriptions that follow are specific sub-areas of focus within this Project, there is interest in exploring novel ideas that may bridge these major thrusts as well as those in the other Projects within this PE."

Major thrust areas being investigated in this Project are aero-structure interactions and control; energy, power, and propulsion; and complex materials and structures. Although the major thrust descriptions that follow are specific sub-areas of focus within this Project, there is interest in exploring novel ideas that may bridge these major thrusts as well as those in the other Projects within this PE."

Major thrust areas being investigated in this Project are information and complex networks, decision making, dynamical systems, optimization and control, and natural materials and systems. Although the major thrust descriptions that follow are specific sub-areas of focus within this Project, there is interest in exploring novel ideas that may bridge these major thrusts as well as those in the other Projects within this PE."
