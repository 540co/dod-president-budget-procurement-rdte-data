The SUGV provides an unmanned capability for those missions that are manpower intensive or high-risk such as Urban Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions in a MOUT environment, investigating Improvised Explosive Devices and Chemical\/Toxic Materials reconnaissance missions without exposing soldiers directly to the hazard. The SUGV will be used to obtain information on situational awareness at the squad level.\n\nSUGV Increment 1 XM1216:  The INC 1 SUGV is based on the IBCT Capability Production Document (CPD) threshold requirements. The SUGV INC 1 features a lightweight highly mobile SUGV platform with improved and tested reliability and an integrated Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) sensor head and radio.  In early FY10 the SUGV INC 1 platform underwent an Independent Verification Test (IVT) at Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) that provided the basis for many of the component reliability improvements that have been incorporated and validated in the FY11 Initial Qualification Test (IQT). Enhancements included improved seals on the drive motors, design changes to the drive motor themselves, Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) improvements to reduce the emissions and susceptibility of the SUGV platform and operator control unit enhancements. The XM1216 is currently conducting missions in support of units in OEF. \n\nSUGV Planned Product Improvements (Increment 1 Follow on) designated as the XM1216E1:  The SUGV configuration for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) moving to Full Rate Production (FRP) is based on the SUGV IBCT CPD Threshold Requirements. It will weigh 35 pounds and is capable of carrying up to 4 lbs of payload weight.  The SUGV will have the following capabilities: a hardened militarized Electro Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) sensor to meet stringent day & night detection of enemy personnel & systems, an National Security Agency (NSA) compliant radio from the Joint Tactical Radio system program, improved hand controller, the capability to provide grid location of the enemy, and the following capability to mount payloads: tether spooler, manipulator arm, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) suite and Embedded-Tactical Engagement Simulation System (E-TESS)."

Transition responsibilities and work from the Prime to Government counterparts to close out current SUGV contract and ease government takeover of the existing and future contract with SUGV vendor. Close out the SUGV Critical Design Review to finalize current design and assess that design to the SUGV CDD. Utilize prototypes to assess CDR design to meet CDD  requirements and operational utility, (Oct11-Mar12) under the bridging effort.  Evaluation and assessment will be used to assess requirement compliance and prepared SOW and Performance Specifications for the Follow-on contract.  Assess performance of the HMS\/SRW radio for range, latency and National Security Agency\/ Information Assurance Strategy (NSA\/IAS) compliance. Evaluate the performance and operational utility of the Operator Control Unit that will replace the Common Controller that was terminated. Assess design and performance for requirement compliance for payloads, environments, shock\/vibration, and command and control software and platform mobility utility.  Evaluate performance of the improved EO\/IR sensor to meet critical KPPs for day and night recognition.  Conduct a Limited User Test (LUT) to confirm operational utility. Award Follow-on contract (April 12) to finalize design, build production prototypes and conduct contractor\/government testing.  Conduct Delta Critical Design Review to confirm design decisions made from the testing with prototypes and changes to the drawing package. Delta CDR will focus on design changes and critical subsystem components: HMS\/SRW radio, Operator Control unit, Software, Payloads: tether, manipulator arm, CBRN detection and E-TESS.  Evaluate design to meet CDD  requirements. Build seven SUGV Pre-Production prototypes (July-Sept 12) with payloads. Conduct integration and contractor checkout of SUGV Pre-Production prototypes to include payloads. Prepare for prototype testing."
