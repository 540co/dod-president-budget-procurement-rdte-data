            "val": "This program includes support for multidisciplinary basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines that enable the U.S. Navy to maintain\ntechnological superiority, and for university research infrastructure to acquire research instrumentation needed to maintain and improve the quality of university\nresearch important to the Navy. Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high priority topics and\nopportunities that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline. For many military problems this multidisciplinary approach serves to stimulate innovations,\naccelerate research progress and expedite transition of results into Naval applications. The Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP) supports\nuniversity research infrastructure essential to high quality Navy relevant research. The instrumentation program complements other Navy research programs by\nsupporting the purchase of high cost research instrumentation that is necessary to carry out cutting-edge research. The program supports Presidential Early Career\nAwards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), single investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their research\ncareers. This program provides the knowledge base, scientific concepts, and technological advances for the maintenance of Naval power and national security.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

MURI efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high priority topics that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline. For many military problems this multidisciplinary approach serves to stimulate innovations, accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results into Naval applications. The DURIP project supports university research infrastructure essential to high quality Navy relevant research. The instrumentation project complements other Navy research programs by supporting the purchase of high cost research instrumentation that is necessary to carry out cutting-edge research. The PECASE project supports single-investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their research careers. This project provides the knowledge base, scientific concepts, and technological advances for the maintenance of Naval power and national security."

In turn, universities need to purchase the instrumentation and take delivery before any billings are generated. It frequently takes several months for delivery and billing to be completed.\n\nFY 2012 program increases provide for an increased number of grants. In past years, more outstanding proposals have been received than could be funded."

Example metrics include extending the life of Thermal\nBarrier Coatings for transition to the Enterprise and Platform Enablers Future Naval Capability program. It is projected that the life time of Thermal Barrier Coating on\nTurbine Blades can be doubled. The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's Congressionally directed \"Assessment of\nDepartment of Defense Basic Research\" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively."
