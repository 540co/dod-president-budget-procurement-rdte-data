INSCOM's cyber weapons are low-density\nor non-standard items whose requirements have been Army G3\/5\/7 or Joint validated and are not in development by acquisition technology developers or system program managers.  Justification: INSCOM executes its assigned RDTE mission in compliance with AR 10-87, 70-1, 71-9 and 700-142; CJCSI 3170.01E and O-3600.1; Army Cyberspace OPLAN 8039, and HQDA Cyberspace EXORD 155-10. INSCOM's rapid Cyber weapons systems developments are based on national, strategic,\noperational, and tactical requirements outlined in NSPD-38\/54, HSPD-23, National Strategic Plan for United States Offensive Cyber Operations, National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations, Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, USSTRATCOM CONPLAN 8039,and COCOM Joint Urgent\/Operational Needs Statements.  Priority of effort is given to requirements that are immediately traceable to land component command operations.  Risk\/Funding:  Not funding INSCOM's RDTE program severely degrades the Army's ability to provide Combatant Commanders with critical warfighting capabilities, resulting in additional risks of failure to Army operational missions or increased costs in Soldier lives and fighting capability due to loss of combat advantages provided through this program."
