Many projects are executed via existing contracts maintained by other agencies; others are executed via Air Force TENCAP contracts established with vendors responding to annual Broad Agency Announcements issued by SIDC.  The U.S. government organization sponsoring a project is responsible for assuming acquisition, deployment, logistics, and budgetary responsibilities for the developed capability after it has been successfully demonstrated by Air Force TENCAP.\n\nThe Air Force is pursuing a spiral approach to the BIS-MDI segment to rapidly respond to PACOM capability requirements.  Spiral Acquisition utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach along with a \u201cbuild-test-build-test-deliver\u201d which focuses on mitigating cost and schedule risk through a lower risk incremental delivery of mature technologies.  \n\nContracts funded in this program element will be awarded using competitive procedures to the maximum extent possible.  Program consists of multiple small projects."
