            "val": "This Program Element supports continuing technology investigations.  It provides a coordinated tri-service mechanism for the collection and free exchange of technical data on the performance and effectiveness of all non-nuclear conventional munitions and weapons systems in a realistic operational environment.  It provides for NATO interchangeability testing (F21); Joint munition effectiveness manuals used by all services; development of standardization agreements (STANAGS) and associated Manuals of Proof and Inspection (MOPI); operation of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC); evaluation of demilitarization methods for existing conventional ammunition (F24); evaluation of useful shelf life, safety, reliability and producibility of pyrotechnic munitions; and improvement of explosives safety criteria for DOD munitions via the DOD Explosives Safety Board (857).  Pyrotechnic Reliability and Safety (296) supports pyrotechnic research, development and testing to identify, characterize and resolve reliability, safety, storage and manufacturing issues that impact production availability and field use of pyrotechnics.  Project 296 will result in the development and demonstration of new, safe, reliable and environmentally acceptable munitions.  Munitions Survivability and Logistics (297) will make Army units more survivable by applying technologies to reduce the sensitivity of munitions to unplanned stimuli (e.g. bullet impacts, fragment impacts, fast cook off, slow cook off, sympathetic detonation, shaped charge jets) and by testing and demonstrating munitions logistics system solutions that prevent or minimize catastrophic explosive events and accelerate ammunition resupply.  Project 297 also supports the Army Insensitive Munitions (IM) Board's reviews.  The Army Explosives Safety Management Program (858) was established in FY01. The U.S. Army Technical Center for Explosives Safety uses the funds in this project to evaluate current explosives safety standards and develop new, scientific and risk-based standards to meet U. S. Army explosives requirements.  The Life Cycle Pilot Program (LCPP) (859) will assess production base capabilities and needs over the acquisition life cycle of various munitions and will address the producibility of ammunition including the transition to type classification and production, and the ability of the production base to cost effectively produce quality products on schedule.  The Fuze Technology Integration program (862) will improve performance and lower the costs of existing proximity fuzes and enable new applications in submunitions and medium caliber fuzes, addressing advanced proximity fuze sensor technology, Micro-electromechanical Systems (MEMS), Safety and Arming (S&A) technology, and Electronic S&A (ESA) technology for smart munitions."

Key thrusts are munitions storage area survivability, Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology integration and compliance, ammunition management and asset visibility, weapon system rearm, munitions configured load enablers and advanced packaging and distribution system enhancements.  Within each thrust, a broad array of solutions will be identified, tested, and evaluated against developed system measures of effectiveness.  Optimum, cost effective solutions that enable the rapid projection of lethal and survivable forces will be demonstrated.  The early stages of force deployment are especially critical.  Theater ammunition storage areas are vulnerable and present the enemy with lucrative targets.  These areas and distribution nodes contain the only available munitions stocks in theater.  Loss of these munitions could cripple the force, jeopardize the mission, and result in high loss of life.  This project mitigates vulnerabilities and ensures a survivable fighting force."

This program will implement these technologies into fuzing systems to preclude obsolescence and enhance performance of existing munitions. The program addresses two major areas: (1) risk mitigation and (2) block upgrades. Risk mitigation efforts will evaluate and demonstrate second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce cost by providing competition, and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available. It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect and identify latent defects. The second major area is block upgrades, which will evaluate and perform studies on improvements to fuzes; increase commonality of fuze components and requirements across all hand grenade programs; determine feasibility of common training fuze for 60, 81, and 120mm mortar rounds; determine feasibility of common mortar safe and arm device components for M734A1, M783 Fuzes; improve M759 fuze sensitivity of 30mm munition. Block upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuzing design current to avoid obsolescence issues, and add capabilities. \n\nReplacement of DPA Stabilizer in Ball Powder Propellants significantly reduces stabilizer depletion rate and increases propellant shelf-life with replacement of Diphenylamine (DPA) which is incompatible with Nitroglycerin (NG). Proposed replacement Akardite-2 is compatible with NG and is the least toxic of all stabilizers.  IMX104 as Comp B explosive fill replacement for 81mm HE reduces risk of accidental\/fratricidal incidents to the Warfighter in theater through incorporation of insensitive munitions.  It also improves transport and stockpile survivability.  155mm Extended Range Base Bleed System Maturation & Risk Reduction addresses maturation of base bleed grain formulation and igniter reliability to achieve extended range on base bleed projectiles using the current weapon platform and existing propulsion systems.  Efforts include test and validation of improved dual igniter and boat-tail cavity that will house a modern, cost effective and producible base bleed grain."

This effort employs the highly matured technology base in the Department of Defense Service Laboratories and Technical Centers, the Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories, industry, and academia.  The program is integrated through the leadership of the PM for Demil and the Joint Ordnance Commanders Group Munitions Demil\/Disposal Subgroup leveraging support from the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program, the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program and the Joint DOD\/DOE Munitions Technology Program.  The program supports an annual global demil symposium for technical review and data evaluation from ongoing projects and advanced demonstrations.
