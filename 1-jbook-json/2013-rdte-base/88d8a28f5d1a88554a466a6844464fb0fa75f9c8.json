            "val": "To support the Air Force worldwide flying mission, this program element funds research, development and management of new air traffic control surveillance, positioning, and precision approach landing systems.  When applicable, this includes joint efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  FY13 funding focuses on three main efforts as follows: \n\nDeployable Instrument Landing System (D-ILS).  This effort develops a deployable version of the fixed base ILS.  D-ILS will be the standard precision approach and landing system for conducting Air Force contingency operations and humanitarian or domestic disaster restoral operations in adverse weather conditions.  The current Air Force mobile precision approach radar system (PAR) used to support operations at deployed locations were procured in the 1970s, are manpower intensive, and logistically unsupportable.  On average, only 18% (three of 17 systems) of the mobile PAR systems are operational on a daily basis. Development and deployment of D-ILS will support increased operations in the area of responsibility, allow phase out of the currently obsolete legacy systems and will provide interoperability with the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF).  FY13 funds continue engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) under the EMD contract awarded in Aug 11. Due to a contractor protest, EMD execution was delayed until Dec 11.  EMD execution includes assembling two EMD units; as well as test and evaluation.  D-ILS Milestone C is now scheduled for FY14.  Related OPAF funds are in program element (PE) 0305114F.  \n\nDeployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON). D-RAPCON will replace the 40 year old AN\/MPN-14K and AN\/TPN-19 Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and Operations Shelter (OPS) subsystems with state of the art digital systems.  Modification and overhaul of the existing systems have proven to be ineffective due to diminishing manufacturing sources.  The D-RAPCON will be used to provide both a terminal and enroute surveillance capability.  The D-RAPCON will also be used with the D-ILS and a fixed or mobile control tower to provide a complete air traffic control capability.  The D-RAPCON will support tactical military and humanitarian operations and also provide a capability to support domestic disaster relief.  The primary surveillance radar coverage (non-cooperative targets) is out to 60 nautical miles (nm) and the secondary surveillance radar coverage (cooperative targets) is out to 120 nm.  FY13 funds will continue contract award efforts to include conducting the preliminary and critical design reviews and assembly of two pre-production units to support developmental test\/operational test (DT\/OT).  Related OPAF funds are in PE 0305114F.  \n\nNext Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen):  This is an interagency effort designed to enable the transition from a ground infrastructure dominated Air Traffic Management capability for the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) to a capability that leverages advances in Performance Based Navigation (PBN), non-radar based surveillance services, transition from voice communications to digital data exchange, as well as advances in weather forecast delivery systems.  The Air Force is the DoD lead Service for NextGen implementation and architecture development.  NextGen will be built on key elements from existing programs and technologies and on new systems under development.  FY13 efforts will continue integration studies and demonstrations leading to the implementation of Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B), Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA), RPA Pilot\/Controller Communications, surveillance radar and automation system upgrades, and radar windfarm clutter mitigation technologies.  These efforts will improve the display of aircraft position to air traffic managers, enhance flight safety, and support the seamless integration of RPAs into the National Airspace System and the airspaces of other nations. FY13 funding will also continue support of the NextGen Air Force and DoD Architect offices and development of the DoD NextGen overarching architecture.  As these technologies and architectures mature, ground system upgrades will be coordinated and fielded concurrently with aircraft avionics capabilities that are acquired and integrated into Air Force aircraft (manned and RPAs); these efforts will run in close parallel with the Communication, Navigation and Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) program in PE 0305099F.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "To support the Air Force worldwide flying mission, this program element funds research, development and management of new air traffic control surveillance, positioning, and precision approach landing systems.  When applicable, this includes joint efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  FY13 funding focuses on three main efforts as follows: \n\nDeployable Instrument Landing System (D-ILS).  This effort develops a deployable version of the fixed base ILS.  D-ILS will be the standard precision approach and landing system for conducting Air Force contingency operations and humanitarian or domestic disaster restoral operations in adverse weather conditions.  The current Air Force mobile precision approach radar system (PAR) used to support operations at deployed locations were procured in the 1970s, are manpower intensive, and logistically unsupportable.  On average, only 18% (three of 17 systems) of the mobile PAR systems are operational on a daily basis. Development and deployment of D-ILS will support increased operations in the area of responsibility, allow phase out of the currently obsolete legacy systems and will provide interoperability with the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF).  FY13 funds continue engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) under the EMD contract awarded in Aug 11. Due to a contractor protest, EMD execution was delayed until Dec 11.  EMD execution includes assembling two EMD units; as well as test and evaluation.  D-ILS Milestone C is now scheduled for FY14.  Related OPAF funds are in program element (PE) 0305114F.  \n\nDeployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON). D-RAPCON will replace the 40 year old AN\/MPN-14K and AN\/TPN-19 Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and Operations Shelter (OPS) subsystems with state of the art digital systems.  Modification and overhaul of the existing systems have proven to be ineffective due to diminishing manufacturing sources.  The D-RAPCON will be used to provide both a terminal and enroute surveillance capability.  The D-RAPCON will also be used with the D-ILS and a fixed or mobile control tower to provide a complete air traffic control capability.  The D-RAPCON will support tactical military and humanitarian operations and also provide a capability to support domestic disaster relief.  The primary surveillance radar coverage (non-cooperative targets) is out to 60 nautical miles (nm) and the secondary surveillance radar coverage (cooperative targets) is out to 120 nm.  FY13 funds will continue contract award efforts to include conducting the preliminary and critical design reviews and assembly of two pre-production units to support developmental test\/operational test (DT\/OT).  Related OPAF funds are in PE 0305114F.  \n\nNext Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen):  This is an interagency effort designed to enable the transition from a ground infrastructure dominated Air Traffic Management capability for the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) to a capability that leverages advances in Performance Based Navigation (PBN), non-radar based surveillance services, transition from voice communications to digital data exchange, as well as advances in weather forecast delivery systems.  The Air Force is the DoD lead Service for NextGen implementation and architecture development.  NextGen will be built on key elements from existing programs and technologies and on new systems under development.  FY13 efforts will continue integration studies and demonstrations leading to the implementation of Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B), Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA), RPA Pilot\/Controller Communications, surveillance radar and automation system upgrades, and radar windfarm clutter mitigation technologies.  These efforts will improve the display of aircraft position to air traffic managers, enhance flight safety, and support the seamless integration of RPAs into the National Airspace System and the airspaces of other nations. FY13 funding will also continue support of the NextGen Air Force and DoD Architect offices and development of the DoD NextGen overarching architecture.  As these technologies and architectures mature, ground system upgrades will be coordinated and fielded concurrently with aircraft avionics capabilities that are acquired and integrated into Air Force aircraft (manned and RPAs); these efforts will run in close parallel with the Communication, Navigation and Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) program in PE 0305099F.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
