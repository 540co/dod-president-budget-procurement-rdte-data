In laser devices, this research includes moderate to high power laser devices that are applicable to a wide range of applications.  In beam control, this research includes optical technologies to propagate lasers beams from a device and to provide ground-based optical space situational awareness.  In high power microwaves, this research examines technologies for applications such as counter-electronics and non-lethal weapons.  Vulnerability\/lethality assessments are conducted for representative DE technologies.  Research into other advanced non-conventional\/innovative weapons will be conducted.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research, since it develops and determines the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary technologies."
