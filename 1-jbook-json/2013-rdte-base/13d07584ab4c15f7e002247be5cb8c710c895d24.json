This will address the 3 primary tactical ATC systems.  The system will respond to voice commands and allow for controller error that can be captured and provide corrective actions to the operator.  Position of the virtual aircraft must be consistent across each platform.  The simulator will support aircraft at slow and fast approaches, hovering aircraft, fast climbing and slow climbing aircraft and even some commercial aircraft."
