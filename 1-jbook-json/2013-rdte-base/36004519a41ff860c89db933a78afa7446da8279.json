EW is an integral warfighting effect supporting AF Global Strike, Global Persistent Attack and Global Mobility operations as well as Joint-Coalition operations.  EW systems influence, deceive, disrupt, degrade, deny, and destroy threats to air operations throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. This PE supports Electronic Support (ES), Electronic Protection (EP), and Electronic Attack (EA).  ES programs support the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information related to the detection, geo-location, characterization, and identification of threats to air operations.  EP Programs preserve the electromagnetic spectrum for use by friendly forces.  EA programs provide self-protection through active and passive measures that deceive threats to air operations using kinetic and non-kinetic means to defeat threats that rely on the electromagnetic spectrum (Radio Frequency (RF), Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR)).  \n\nThis program is in budget activity 5 - System Development and Demonstration of common EW systems to meet user requirements."

The core ALR-69A program objectives are to improve identification of threat type, detect threat signals while outside of the threat envelope, and operate in a dense signal environment.  Evolutionary growth spirals include single and multi-ship Precision Geolocation (PG) as well as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI).  The underlying technologies and algorithms enabling PG and SEI are often collectively referred to as Precision Location and Identification (PLAID).\n\nALR-69A development is currently focused on a replacement RWR for AFSOC and AMC C-130 aircraft.  The ALR-69A is also under consideration by AFSOC, AMC and ACC for integration and installation in other mission design series aircraft.\n\nThis program is in budget activity 5 - System Development and Demonstration of common EW systems to meet user requirements."

The decoy and jammer configurations are key enablers supporting the Air Force Global Strike, Global Response, Space and C4ISR, and the Air and Space Expeditionary Force Concepts of Operations.  MALD-J will provide stand-in jamming capability for the Airborne Electronic Attack Systems of Systems.  It will be launched against a preplanned target and jam specific radars in a stand-in role to degrade or deny the Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) detection of friendly aircraft or munitions.  \n\nPlanned efforts for this program are risk reduction (to include prototyping) and Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) of the jammer configuration and any other direct increment or variant.  This will include design, development, test, aircraft integration, and seamless verification.\n\nThis program is in budget activity 5 - System Development and Demonstration of common Electronic Warfare (EW) systems to meet user requirements."

It will be launched against a preplanned target and jam specific radars in a stand-in role to degrade or deny integrated air defense system detection of friendly aircraft or munitions. \n\nThis program is terminated in FY13.
