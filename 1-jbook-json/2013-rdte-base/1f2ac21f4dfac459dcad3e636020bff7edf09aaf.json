Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) obtains general support services from contracts awarded after employing full and open competition contracting strategies. This is a level of effort program element.\n\nBudget Activity Justification:  This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts."

FOT&E answers specific questions about unresolved COIs and test issues, or completes areas not finished during the IOT&E. This PE also funds related operational test and evaluation (OT&E) activities such as Operational Utility Evaluations (OUE), Early Operational Assessments (EOA), Operational Assessments (OA), and independent IOT&E which support major milestones and decision points prior to Milestone C, full rate production, fielding, or declaration of IOC. IOT&E programs are identified in several system categories: Air; Space; Weapons; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I); and Combat Support. Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) obtains general support services from contracts awarded after employing full and open competition contracting strategies. This is a level of effort program element.\n\nBudget Activity Justification:  This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts."
