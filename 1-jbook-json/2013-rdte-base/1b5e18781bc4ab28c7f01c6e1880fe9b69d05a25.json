It installs directed navigation\/safety equipment:  terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) and traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS), reducing the threat of controlled flight into terrain and mid-air collisions.  CNS\/ATM capability requirements are incorporated in the aircraft to meet current and future International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)\/Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements and to progress toward next generation air transportation system.  AWFCS replaces low reliability line replaceable units (LRUs) in the automatic flight control system and replaces aging, non-supportable mechanical instruments in the engine and flight systems.  Connectivity to mobility command and control capabilities is also incorporated in the AMP design.  The portion of avionics capability required for modernization that does not complete at the end of AMP development will be captured and funded in follow-on development programs.  AMP requirements have been expanded to incorporate updates to the new avionics architecture, to include security enhancements to the global positioning system.

This effort centers around replacing the current TF39 engines with more reliable, commercial off-the-shelf CF6 turbofan engines.  The RERP modification increases payload capability and access to communications, navigation, surveillance\/air traffic management (CNS\/ATM) airspace through core mission computer (CMC), radar, and other Air Force (AF) bolt-ons like mode 5 identification, friend or foe (IFF), aircraft communication addressing and reporting system (ACARS), malfunction analysis detection and recording system (MADARS), embedded diagnostic system (EDS), etc.  The modification also decreases aircraft time to climb, increases engine-out climb gradient for takeoff, improves transportation system throughput, and decreases engine removals.  On 7 Oct 10, USD AT&L conducted a successful full rate production (FRP) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) and approved the C-5 RERP FRP acquisition decision memorandum for lots 5 \u2013 7; directed the Air Force to fully fund RERP to the OSD cost assessment and program evaluation (CAPE) ICE for RDT&E; and re-designated C-5 RERP as an acquisition category IC program.\n\nFY2011:  Funding supports RERP design, development, engineering change orders, contractor\/government test, and technical order publications.  Mission support funding is required for program office operations.  FY11 funding is also required to design, build, test and initiate delivery of aircrew\/maintenance training devices.    \n\nFY2012:  Funding supports RERP design, development, engineering change orders, contractor\/government test, and technical order publication in support of the correction of qualification operational test & evaluation deficiency reports through software updates.  Mission support funding is required for program office operations.  Funding is also required to finalize the testing, development, and delivery of aircrew\/maintenance training devices; complete technical publications; thrust reverser; and efforts to continue to minimize divergence between AMP and RERP baselines.  The new engines increased payload capability and access to CNS\/ATM airspace through core mission computer (CMC), radar, and other Air Force (AF) requirements, such as mode 5 identification, friend or foe (IFF), aircraft communication addressing and reporting system (ACARS), malfunction analysis detection and recording system (MADARS), etc.\n\nIn FY 2012, Project Number 674835, Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program research, development, test, and evaluation will be completed."

Software (S\/W) and hardware (H\/W) baselines between the avionics modernization program (AMP) and reliability enhancement and re-engining program (RERP) have diverged.  S\/W deficiencies corrected under AMP sustainment (block cycle changes) reappear in RERP.  The AMP system has a total of two core processor module (CPM) cards; the RERP system has a total of three CPM cards.  Originally, AMP was to have 50% spare processing and memory capability; currently, AMP CPMs have only 5% throughput capability remaining, which create safety concerns.  AMP throughput\/capacity constraint does not allow room for any new\/future capability and contributes to current computer problems.  Failure to upgrade the AMP core processing platform to the three CPM RERP configuration will affect mission capable rates, will inhibit the ability to fix current deficiency reports (DRs) and drive increased sustainment costs associated with S\/W and H\/W baseline divergence.  The C-5 AMP core processing platform development will complete in FY12.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This effort centers around replacing the current mission computer to obtain sufficient capacity\/capability to support integration of new system capabilities with margin for growth.  Also, the effort includes replacement of the weather radar with a commercial off-the-shelf color weather radar.  Mission systems equipment includes, but is not limited to, a redesign of the C-5 galley system. Examples of other mission systems equipment include troop seats, crew entry door and ladder, and interior trim.  \n\nThe current C-5 CMC has reached maximum capacity and cannot integrate required aircraft systems and capabilities to include the weather radar; flight management system (FMS); and communication, navigation, surveillance (CNS)\/air traffic management (ATM) requirements.  These requirements include capabilities such as the, automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), and identification, friend or foe (IFF) mode 5.  The new CMC will allow for current and future throughput growth of additional processing requirements to meet CY 2020 CNS\/ATM mandates.\n\nThe modification increases aircraft availability as the new color weather radar replaces the current APS-133 weather radar system, which becomes unsupportable in FY 2014.  Failure to replace the CMC to support a new weather radar will create a significant operational impact due to parts obsolescence of the current weather radar.  Equipment diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues will be resolved to support continued production and installation of requirements for the C-5 fleet.  Further, DMS issues will be resolved to support continued operations through studies, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, development, and redesign efforts.\n\nThe current C-5 galley system suffers inoperability and leakage of liquid sodium hypochlorite causing severe corrosion and burnt wires in the landing gear control panels.  A redesign will increase safety, mitigate risk, and reduce man-hours required to repair extensive damage. \n\nThe new CMC, weather radar replacement, and mission system equipment is programmed for completion on 52 C-5M aircraft.  \n\nIn FY2013, Project Number 675358, C-5 Core Mission Computer, Weather Radar, and Mission Systems Equipment Program is a new start project.\n\nFY 2013:  Funding supports CMC design, development, formal qualification testing (FQT), weather radar integration, engineering change orders, and contractor test.  Funding also supports redesign and proofing of C-5 mission systems equipment.  Mission support funding is required for program office operations."

The strategy is for the prime contractor to procure the core mission computer and weather radar, integrate and test those components, and install kits on three EMD aircraft. The synopsis has been completed, and there was no interest from sources other than the C-5 prime contractor. The contract method will be sole source. The contract type and fee has not been determined. The mission systems equipment redesign will require RDT&E funding for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) proofing. A trade study for market availability of EMD of the mission systems equipment is in-progress, so the contract method and type has not been determined."
