The Space and Missile Defense Command will participate and support to biennial rewrites of Army Capstone, Operational and Functional Concepts.  Continue to provide operational manager support to STRATCOM, NORTHCOM and SOCOM Joint Technical Capability Demonstrations to ensure Army space, missile defense, and high altitude equities are represented in advanced technology developments by demonstrating military utility when applied to military equipment and techniques.  Examples include: supporting multi service experiments and capability development of the national-directed Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) as it is applied to each of the regional COCOMs; and experimenting with operationally responsive space and high altitude capabilities to ensure the broader Army enterprises can leverage the advantages of these platforms for communications, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), position navigation, missile warning and command and control.  Continue to develop mitigation strategies for Army forces to operate effectively in contested space, missile defense and cyber environments.  Developing effective Integrated Missile Defense concepts for Army support to the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) being implemented within each regional COCOM.

When implemented, IFPC2 will provide 360 degree protection against RAM and residual UAS threats simultaneously attacking from multiple azimuths.  Anticipated system will consist of a kinetic (missile or gun) and\/or directed energy Interceptor, Fire Control Sensor, Technical Fire Control, Command Vehicle and control interfaces between major components.  The specific system concept will be determined by an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to be completed in FY 2012.  Tactical Command and Control is an external interface to the IFPC2 program to be provided by supported forces."
