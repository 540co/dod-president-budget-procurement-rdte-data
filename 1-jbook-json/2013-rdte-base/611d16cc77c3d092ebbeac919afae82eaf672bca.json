The objective is to improve, through the application of emerging technologies, the conventional defense capabilities of the United States and our cooperative partners, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), U.S. major non-NATO allies and Friendly Foreign countries. Through technology sharing and joint equipment development these projects help reduce U.S. acquisition costs and leverage important technologies for the Army Transformation and the development of the Future Combat system. Cooperative efforts also improve multinational force compatibility with potential coalition partners through the development and use of similar equipment and improved interfaces. The program focuses specifically on international cooperative technology demonstration, validation, and interoperability of Army weapon and command, control, communications and information (C3I) systems, including the NATO Defense Against Terrorism initiatives. Projects are implemented through international agreements with foreign partners that define scope, cost and work sharing arrangements, management, contracting, security, data protection and third party transfers.  Funds are used to pay for only the U.S. work share that occurs in the United States at U.S. Government and U.S. contractors facilities."

A single solution standard will include common doctrine, technical and procedural specifications to make better use of existing information, shared data, leverage national operating picture capabilities and enable the development of interoperability of data, databases, applications, security domains and national networks architectures. The MNNEC is more than interoperability of information systems; it is the complete networking of information systems with sensors and shooters focusing on building Net-Centric interoperability among coalition tactical land components operating in a Joint Environment, focused at the  Brigade and Below level, but not excluding using the services provided at higher echelons. The MNNEC has a future force focus, endeavoring to define migration strategies for Net-Centric capabilities in the 2010-2025 timeframe with part of the work to determine the time-phased implementations of a Multi-National Network Enabled Capability. The end results would be an integration of national C2\/C4ISR systems into an NCES environment to include the NATO Network Enabled Capabilities (NNEC)."
