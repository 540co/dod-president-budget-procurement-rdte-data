            "val": "The Air Force is the DoD Anti-Tamper Executive Agent (ATEA).  The ATEA is responsible for implementing Anti-Tamper (AT) policy, coordinating and providing financial support for AT technology development, establishing and maintaining a data bank\/library, providing proper security mechanisms, conducting effective validation and assessing AT implementations.  The purpose of developing AT techniques is to protect critical technologies in U.S. weapon systems that may be sold to foreign governments or that could possibly fall into enemy hands.  AT technology will permit the U.S. to preserve its critical weapons systems lead while also satisfying customer needs.  Furthermore, AT will add longevity to critical technologies by deterring efforts to reverse engineer or develop weapon countermeasures against a system or system component.   As the DoD Anti-Tamper Executive Agent, the Air Force will coordinate technology development and enhancement efforts among the Services, DoD Agencies, and laboratories, and with industry.  The DoD ATEA will issue contracts for AT technology development as well as plus-up existing AT technology efforts to increase the technology readiness level.  Priorities will be given to technologies that benefit the majority of the AT community.  The Anti-Tamper technology development and enhancement efforts will occur in the following areas:  advanced sensor hardware, generic electronic hardware, signature control, access detection & denial, software, and effectiveness.  The program management activities will coordinate the technology development and establish the Anti-Tamper data bank\/library.  Anti-Tamper validation is a significant responsibility assigned to the Air Force.  All DoD acquisition programs, Foreign Military Sales, and Direct Commercial Sales with critical technology\/critical information are required to have an Anti-Tamper plan with appropriate validation.  The resources required to review Anti-Tamper plans and conduct Anti-Tamper validation began to increase in late FY03.   Based on Anti-Tamper validation requirement projections, the number of Anti-Tamper experts needs to expand.  Beginning in FY09 additional funding has been dedicated to the technical development of new AT capabilities. Emerging research in the areas of materials, cryptography and electronic circuits has the potential to bring new AT capabilities that have reduced power needs, a smaller form factor, and less detectability by nation class adversary using state of the art reverse engineering tools.  The goal of the research is to mature promising technologies to the point that they can be transitioned to a program office or industry prime for implementation in our weapons systems.  This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding."

The DoD ATEA will issue contracts for AT technology development as well as plus-up existing AT technology efforts to increase the technology readiness level.  Priorities will be given to technologies that benefit the majority of the AT community.  The Anti-Tamper technology development and enhancement efforts will occur in the following areas:  advanced sensor hardware, generic electronic hardware, signature control, access detection & denial, software, and effectiveness.  The program management activities will coordinate the technology development and establish the Anti-Tamper data bank\/library.  Anti-Tamper validation is a significant responsibility assigned to the Air Force.  All DoD acquisition programs, Foreign Military Sales, and Direct Commercial Sales with critical technology\/critical information are required to have an Anti-Tamper plan with appropriate validation.  The resources required to review Anti-Tamper plans and conduct Anti-Tamper validation began to increase in late FY03.   Based on Anti-Tamper validation requirement projections, the number of Anti-Tamper experts needs to expand.  Beginning in FY09 additional funding has been dedicated to the technical development of new AT capabilities. Emerging research in the areas of materials, cryptography and electronic circuits has the potential to bring new AT capabilities that have reduced power needs, a smaller form factor, and less detectability by nation class adversary using state of the art reverse engineering tools.  The goal of the research is to mature promising technologies to the point that they can be transitioned to a program office or industry prime for implementation in our weapons systems.  This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding."
