            "val": "This Program Element (PE) supports the development of the critical electronic attack capabilities, from technology demonstrations through transition to operational capability, for Air Force and joint operations to include the Global Strike and Persistent Global Attack Concepts of Operations (CONOPS).  Based on the 2001 Joint Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) and the follow-on 2002 Joint Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (Joint SEAD) presentation to OSD (AT&L), the AEA capability will consist of a number of components working together in a joint system of systems.  The Joint SEAD presentation identified the Navy AEA components as the EA-6B Improved Capability (ICAP) III and EA-18G modified escort platforms and indicated the Air Force will be responsible for coordinating overall AEA system of systems requirements.  AF component capabilities include the Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) and its stand-in jammer variant called MALD-J, the EC-130H Compass Call Baseline 0 (formerly Block 35) configuration and Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar equipped aircraft, and potentially, recoverable unmanned stand-in and manned long range stand-off jammer platforms.  Additionally, this program element supports the planning, development and demonstration of capabilities for use in Irregular Warfare against non-Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) targets.  This includes targets such as communications networks, remote controlled improvised explosive devices, and man portable air defenses.  It also supports examining alternatives to counter both IADS and non-IADS components such as communications networks, computers, command and control links, etc in both major combat and irregular warfare scenarios.  \n\nThis program is included in budget activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because of the development and\/or testing associated with Airborne Electronic Attack."

These efforts are crucial in the development of critical electronic attack capabilities in support of Air Force and joint operations to include Global Strike and Persistent Global Attack Concepts of Operations (CONOPS).\n\nThe joint AEA SoS includes the Navy EA-6B and EA-18G core components; the Air Force Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) and its stand-in jammer variant, MALD-J; the EC-130H Compass Call Baseline 0 (formerly Block 35) configuration; Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar equipped aircraft; potentially an unmanned recoverable stand-in jamming platform; potentially a manned low\/mid frequency, high power component capable of location and reactive jamming suppression of enemy integrated air defense system (IADS) radars outside the ranges of the associated Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs) and non-IADS targets.  Recent events have led to an increased focus on developing advanced electronic attack capabilities for use in irregular warfare against non-IADS targets such as communication networks, remote controlled improvised explosive devices and man portable air defenses.  In addition, there is an increased focus on examining non-traditional electronic attack alternatives to counter both IADS and non-IADS components such as communication networks, computers, command and control links, etc. in both major combat and irregular warfare scenarios.\n\nThis program is included in budget activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because of the development and\/or testing associated with Airborne Electronic Attack."
