The Defense-Wide IO Program Review revalidated a requirement for an integrated range supporting exercises, testing, and development of IO capabilities.  Further direction by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) identified the need for an integrated IO test and evaluation capability to assess IO technologies and tactics in a representative operational environment against realistic targets.  The 2006 National Security Strategy identifies \"Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent Attacks Against Us and Our Friends\", which involves significant Information Operations (IO) and Cyber operations as a goal.  Through the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) and the Integrated Priority Lists, COCOMs repeatedly state the need to expand IO\/Cyber training and education for the developing cadre of IO\/Cyber professionals and provide an environment for analysis, testing, training, combat assessments, and measures of effectiveness for more reliable IO\/Cyber capabilities."

The basis of the functional structure of the IO Range is the integration of existing ranges, laboratories, information warfare centers, and other Government facilities that currently support IO\/Cyber test, training, exercise, and experimentation events. Capabilities at the selected sites are securely connected and integrated into the IO Range. A key feature of this concept is a persistent, secure connection that links the sites together, allowing the exchange of data and the visualization of effects as we employ capabilities. Creation of a \u201cvirtual range\u201d based on persistent connections significantly reduces the amount of lead-time required to set up each new warfighter event. The long-term goal for the IO Range is to be a full spectrum IO\/Cyber Range supporting: operations security (OPSEC), computer network operations (CNO), electronic warfare (EW), military information support operations (MISO), and military deception (MILDEC). This environment enables the warfighters to visualize non-kinetic weapons effects, understand the intricate and interactive effects generated by kinetic and non-kinetic weapons and achieve the same level of confidence and expertise in employing IO\/Cyber capabilities as they have with kinetic capabilities."
