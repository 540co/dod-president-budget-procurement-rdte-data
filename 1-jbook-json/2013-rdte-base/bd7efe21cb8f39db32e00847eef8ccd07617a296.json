It also provides target tracking data to support threat avoidance, targeting, force protection, and situational awareness.   This information is continually refined in near real time by strategic, operational and tactical sensors.  \n\nThis PE funds\/has previously funded IBS system development as described below:\n- A Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) on UHF satellite channel using a Common Message Format (CMF) and a MIL-STD Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) compliant waveform and Line of Sight (LOS) using the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT). \n\n- IBS-Network Services (IBS-NS) includes two Global IBS Network Servers (GINS) and four Theater Interface Nodes (TINs) to support the geographic Combatant Commanders; all built to validated warfighter requirements. \n -- Two GINS that receive data from each theater and integrate this data into a worldwide picture available to all network\/broadcast users. \n -- Four regional TINs, where out-of-theater (and local) users not directly receiving the broadcast can receive the information broadcast on the CIB.  Additionally, the TIN will receive and inject data into the CIB for producers without access to the theater CIB. \n\n- An XML-based Common Message Format (CMF) Data Element Dictionary (DED) that defines IBS messages for broadcast of  IBS information over available communications paths including the CIB and other Global Information Grid (GIG) networks. \n\n- A Modular Advanced TRanslation Interchange with XML (MATRIX) Reformatter that provides a modular, platform-independent, multi-use translator to support migration with legacy radios and provide a long term solution for IBS Full Operational Capability (FOC) radio users.  \n\nFunds the development of an evolving suite of interoperable planning and decision support capabilities comprised of software, hardware and communication products.  This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning."

It also provides target tracking data to support threat avoidance, targeting, force protection, and situational awareness.   This information is continually refined in near real time by strategic, operational and tactical sensors.  \n\nThis PE funds\/has previously funded IBS system development as described below:\n- A Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) on UHF satellite channel using a Common Message Format (CMF) and a MIL-STD Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) compliant waveform and Line of Sight (LOS) using the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT). \n\n- IBS-Network Services (IBS-NS) includes two Global IBS Network Servers (GINS) and four Theater Interface Nodes (TINs) to support the geographic Combatant Commanders; all built to validated warfighter requirements. \n -- Two GINS that receive data from each theater and integrate this data into a worldwide picture available to all network\/broadcast users. \n -- Four regional TINs, where out-of-theater (and local) users not directly receiving the broadcast can receive the information broadcast on the CIB.  Additionally, the TIN will receive and inject data into the CIB for producers without access to the theater CIB. \n\n- An XML-based Common Message Format (CMF) Data Element Dictionary (DED) that defines IBS messages for broadcast of  IBS information over available communications paths including the CIB and other Global Information Grid (GIG) networks. \n\n- A Modular Advanced TRanslation Interchange with XML (MATRIX) Reformatter that provides a modular, platform-independent, multi-use translator to support migration with legacy radios and provide a long term solution for IBS Full Operational Capability (FOC) radio users.  \n\nFunds the development of an evolving suite of interoperable planning and decision support capabilities comprised of software, hardware and communication products.  This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning."
