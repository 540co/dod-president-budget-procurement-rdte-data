            "val": "Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) is the Air Force program of record responsible for developing core technologies to horizontally and vertically integrate ISR sensor systems both within and across intelligence disciplines (for example SIGINT to SIGINT or GMTI to SIGINT).  NCCT software applications employ machine-to-machine interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) communications to coordinate sensor cross-cues and collection activities.  NCCT correlation and fusion services ingest collection data to produce a single, composite track (geolocation and ID) for high-value targets.  NCCT Research and Development funding supports evolutionary development of the NCCT message set and network management systems (Operations Interface, Network Controller, Fusion Engine, Data Guard, Interface to Command and Control and the Interface to Airborne Overhead Cooperative Operations), the migration of the NCCT technologies to emerging network centric technologies (for example service-oriented architectures and web services), and satisfying DoD standards and information assurance requirements.  Current NCCT-enabled systems include but not limited to, RC-135 Rivet Joint, Senior Scout, DCGS (SIGINT components), Falconer Aerospace Operations Centers (AOCs), Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar (VADER), Gorgon Stare, MC-12W, and Airborne-Overhead Multi- Intelligence Operations (AMO).  Any prospective NCCT-enabled Coalition, Joint, or Service system is required to fund its respective integration, unique core technology improvements\/upgrades to support system integration, and the infrastructure to support the system\u2019s NCCT operational employment.\n\nNCCT Program Manager will promote and facilitate the planning, demonstration and prototyping of capabilities, systems, and platforms in the approved Capabilities Production Document or designated by the Requirements Review Board toward the objective of inclusion and full participation in NCCT.  On-going support to Navy funded demonstrations to evaluate utility of NCCT to their maritime mission and to NATO Cooperative Electronic Support Measures Operations (CESMO) gateway development and demonstrations are also focus efforts of the NCCT program. \n\nFY 2013 funding is dedicated to Core Technology advancement and the continuation of GMTI\/SIGINT correlation enhancements to providing multi-source, multi-INT services within the NCCT architecture.  Providing composite tracks with both SIGINT (ID) and GMTI (moving track\/Doppler characteristics) components improving the find-fix-finish timelines against mobile and dismounted forces.  This correlation capability supports real-time and forensic operations, accelerates classified message architecture to network OCO relevant sensor systems, and directly supports tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) development for rapid operator use. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) is the Air Force program of record responsible for developing core technologies to horizontally and vertically integrate ISR sensor systems both within and across intelligence disciplines (for example SIGINT to SIGINT or GMTI to SIGINT).  NCCT software applications employ machine-to-machine interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) communications to coordinate sensor cross-cues and collection activities.  NCCT correlation and fusion services ingest collection data to produce a single, composite track (geolocation and ID) for high-value targets.  NCCT Research and Development funding supports evolutionary development of the NCCT message set and network management systems (Operations Interface, Network Controller, Fusion Engine, Data Guard, Interface to Command and Control and the Interface to Airborne Overhead Cooperative Operations), the migration of the NCCT technologies to emerging network centric technologies (for example service-oriented architectures and web services), and satisfying DoD standards and information assurance requirements.  Current NCCT-enabled systems include but not limited to, RC-135 Rivet Joint, Senior Scout, DCGS (SIGINT components), Falconer Aerospace Operations Centers (AOCs), Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar (VADER), Gorgon Stare, MC-12W, and Airborne-Overhead Multi- Intelligence Operations (AMO).  Any prospective NCCT-enabled Coalition, Joint, or Service system is required to fund its respective integration, unique core technology improvements\/upgrades to support system integration, and the infrastructure to support the system\u2019s NCCT operational employment.\n\nNCCT Program Manager will promote and facilitate the planning, demonstration and prototyping of capabilities, systems, and platforms in the approved Capabilities Production Document or designated by the Requirements Review Board toward the objective of inclusion and full participation in NCCT.  On-going support to Navy funded demonstrations to evaluate utility of NCCT to their maritime mission and to NATO Cooperative Electronic Support Measures Operations (CESMO) gateway development and demonstrations are also focus efforts of the NCCT program. \n\nFY 2013 funding is dedicated to Core Technology advancement and the continuation of GMTI\/SIGINT correlation enhancements to providing multi-source, multi-INT services within the NCCT architecture.  Providing composite tracks with both SIGINT (ID) and GMTI (moving track\/Doppler characteristics) components improving the find-fix-finish timelines against mobile and dismounted forces.  This correlation capability supports real-time and forensic operations, accelerates classified message architecture to network OCO relevant sensor systems, and directly supports tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) development for rapid operator use. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
