Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) is a result of the Small Business Development Act of 1992.  It was enacted by Congress in Public Law 97-219, reenacted by Public Law 99-443, and reauthorized by the SBIR Program Reauthorization Act of 2001.  Starting in FY 1994, the SBIR program was refocused toward dual use and defense reinvestment efforts.  Phase I projects evaluate the scientific technical merit and feasibility of an idea.  Awards are up to $0.100 million with a maximum six-month period of performance.  Phase II projects expand the results of, and further pursue, the developments of Phase I.  Awards are up to $0.750 million with a maximum two-year period of performance.  Phase III is for commercialization of the results of Phase II and requires the use of private or non-SBIR federal funding.  DOD publishes government agency proposal projects twice per year for a consolidated DoD Request for Proposal.  USSOCOM then awards its proposed SBIR projects."
