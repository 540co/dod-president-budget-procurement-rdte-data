The HS model, developed by Greenwave Scientific Inc., designed to be used to make accurate measurements of the specific absorption rate (SAR) of RF energy in the human body from Counter Radio-Controlled Electronic Warfare (CREW) devices.  The absorption of radiofrequency (RF) by the human body is very complex.  It is well known that even uniform RF exposures lead to non-uniform absorption in almost all human exposure situations.  Current methods to measure SAR in the human body are elegant and elaborate processes but they can only be carried out in the laboratory.  These consist of open and closed human phantom shells filled with liquids that simulate the electrical properties of human tissue.  To measure the uneven absorption of RF energy a small electric field probe is mechanically moved around inside the phantom shell during exposure.  \n\nContinue work on the HS model and the evaluation of the accurate measurements of the specific absorption rate of radio frequent energy in the human body from Counter Radio-Controlled Electronic Warfare devices.  Start developing some initial research studies looking at the long term use of the Counter Radio-Controlled Electronic Warfare devices."

The acquisition strategy for these products involves direct partnership with the acquisition and procurement professionals at Marine Corps Systems Command.  The program's major Product Areas in the Medical Development Program are:  1) Equipment, 2) Pharmaceuticals\/Biologics, and 3) Knowledge\/Concepts.  The primary Program Areas of Interest are in: 1) Expeditionary Medicine (Navy in Terrestrial, Maritime Surface, Submarine, and Aviation Operations), USMC in Expeditionary Operations. In these areas the focus is on Levels I and II in Clinical Care Medicine; and 2) Products developed for battlefield treatment of Combat Casualties and Combat Trauma, focusing on delivery of Levels III and IV of care.\n\nFor areas 1 and 2, there are two primary acquisition strategies.  The first is to test and evaluate commercially-developed medical product candidates in managed trials for ultimate Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Partnerships with commercial developers ensure that products of military interest are available for procurement across the DoD, Federal Government, and commercial market.  During development, DoD end users are included in the process to the extent possible.  The second strategy is to drive the development process with DoD program investments.  This process involves developing in-house or industrial prototypes in government-managed programs to meet military and regulatory requirements for production and fielding. \n\nBoth strategies promote advanced preparation of procurement plans in line with the product availability.  Major Medical Development programs falling in these categories are: MOVES and MOVES anesthesia module (Equipment).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Third Product Area (Knowledge\/Concepts) is focused on the introduction of technologies, techniques, and procedures that alter medical practice and standards of care.  These primarily require early involvement of the senior leadership of military medicine, in that the result of the program is modifications of concepts of operations, policy, and\/or doctrine.  These are often much smaller Medical Development Program examples include Navy\/USMC Medical Planning Requirement Assessment and Crisis Action Planning Tool Transition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPrograms such as System for Objective Decision-Making on Timing of Wound Closure involve both material and knowledge solutions."

The total contract value is approximately $4,100K with the project jointly funded by the Navy ($1,000K) and the USMC for a POP through 29 JUN 2012.  The first two proofs of concepts (under N00244-07-C-1531) and the breadboard (under W911QY-08-C-0116) are complete. Animal and human factors testing are ongoing.  Next two phases of MADM will be focused on developing the Beta prototype and testing it on animals (base year), followed by building 10 units, verification and validation, environmental, EMC, and vibration testing, and human testing. POP for base year is 12 months which extends to 24 if the option is exercised.  It is anticipated that MARCORSYSCOM will assume funding of this effort in FY12 under the existing MOA.\nThe SLC program incorporates redesign and reconfiguration efforts to enhance the USMC en route care device capability set. The core program effort is supplemented by a congressional add that augments final DT&E efforts of MOVES and configuration and redesign of SLC. \nMalaria vaccine research executed as partial funding of a consortium with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Malaria Vaccine Initiative.  Current year Navy Funding is $3.6M.  The product is the collaborative work between MVPP and a Gates Foundation researcher to develop a vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum.  The approach is based on a prime\/boost adenovaccine.\nThe performers developing an intranasal treatment for migraines are the Naval Postgraduate Dental School in conjunction with a contract for the McConnell Group, which will perform a clinical trial to determine the safety and effectiveness of nasal carbon dioxide versus placebo in the treatment of moderate to severe migraine for pain and associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia and phonophobia.  This clinical trial will be conducted at six military\/VA treatment facilities.\nUSMC Suicide Prevention Program Resiliency Study and Related Efforts - Complete research leveraging the Marine Resiliency study and the execution of targeted studies of Marines.  Address aims including addition of assessments to include 12-month after deployment return to determine risk for chronic PTSD and potential factors for mitigation.  Effort includes assessment of postvention efforts and psychological studies.\nIndividualized Fatigue-Based Scheduling and Countermeasure System - Initial study is underway for development of a tool that predicts, prevents, detects, and mitigates periods of high risk associated with fatigue.  Research leveraged is based upon an effort funded by the Office of Naval Research.  Periods of high individualized performance risk will be predicted and prevented by providing individual, specific, and fatigue optimized schedules and mitigation strategies.\nProduct Development incorporates numerous small efforts within major product lines to address the Navy Surgeon General?s priorities.
