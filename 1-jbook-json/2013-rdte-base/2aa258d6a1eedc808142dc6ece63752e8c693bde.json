        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "The Tactical Air Control Party-Modernization (TACP-M) program acquires capabilities for TACP operations.  TACP members deploy with Army maneuver units and provide a Command and Control (C2) link for Close Air Support (CAS), airlift, and Air Force surveillance\/reconnaissance missions.  TACP\u2019s are equipped with various targeting and communication equipment which interfaces with ground maneuver forces, CAS aircraft, Joint Fires assets, C2 aircraft\/agencies, and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms\/agencies.  Throughout the performance of their duties, TACP\u2019s detect targets and compute precision coordinates to aircraft to ensure pilots track the correct target in the employment of GPS aided weapons.  The actions performed by TACPs not only shorten the kill chain, but also reduces the potential for fratricide and collateral damage in civilian-occupied areas.  \n\nThe TACP-M program provides equipment modernization capabilities to TACP, Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs), and Tactical Operations Center (TOCs) personnel. The program supports the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and significantly increased the mission effectiveness of the TACPs and ASOCs during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New Dawn.  The TACP-M program continues to be instrumental in providing ground communications for TACPs during federal emergency relief operations and Homeland Defense initiatives.\n\nThe purpose of the TACP-M program is to reduce reliance on voice transmission and replace analog equipment with the latest digital, data link and streaming video (e.g. Streaming Video Receiver) technology.  Upgraded digital communications enable machine-to-machine interface between TACPs and Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft, Army units and other TACP units.  Machine-to-machine communication provides reliable, high speed digital communications, ultimately supports joint and multinational interoperability, improves battlefield Situational Awareness (SA), increases targeting accuracy, reduces kill chain decision time, improves data flows\/information exchange, and reduces potential fratricide. TACPs use Software Communication Architecture (SCA)-certified, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), software programmable radios, and ancillary components for reliable voice & data UHF SATCOM and LOS UHF \/VHF communications.  TACP-M is divided into three segments:  Software, Dismounted and Mounted. The Mounted segement is further divided into Fixed and Mobile elements. \n\nThe Software segment utilizes a common Close Air Support System Software(CASS) baseline across all TACP systems.  The CASS software major thrust provides cross-service interoperability with numerous aircraft (A-10, F-16, F\/A-18, etc), helicopters, unmanned air vehicles (Predator), land and naval artillery, network enabled weapons, command & control nodes, and communications systems utilizing numerous messaging systems (such as Variable Message Format (VMF), Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), and Link-16 to provide maximum flexibility and capability to the TACP for the execution of joint fires support mission. FY13 funding associated with the software segement will support the CASS major thrust. \n\nThe Dismounted segment consists of integrated, man-portable systems procured via streamlined acquisition using non-developmental and off-the-shelf (OTS) components which is carried by dismounted airman. These include laser rangefinders, thermal imagers, laser designators, man-pack and handheld radios, ruggedized tactical computers, streaming video receivers, and other required equipment. The dismounted segment also incorporates the development of an advanced Target Location Designation System (TLDS) which is also being managed under the Army-led Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS) program.  TLDS will combine the capability of a laser marker, designator and thermal imagers into a small, lightweight system. FY13 funding will continue to support this major thrust and focus on the development of TLDS within the JETS program.\n\nThe mounted (Fixed) segment integrates computer and communications equipment into re-locatable vehicle, rack or transit case mounted systems for use in Tactical Operations Center (TOC) or Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) locations.  The TACP mounted (Fixed) segment includes the High Mobility, Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV)-mounted Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) Gateway, Gateway Lite, and the Dismounted Communications Package (DCP).  The TACP Mounted (Mobile) segment integrates similar equipment into mobile tactical vehicles employed by the Army and provides on-the-move tactical voice and data capability.  \n\nPrior to FY12, the major thrust associated with the mounted segment of TACP-M was the Vehicular Communication System (VCS).  This thrust focused on placing a TACP equipment suite into a HMMWV. In September 2010, the AF decided not to pursue production of the large HMMWV-Mounted VCS system due to survivability issues related to the current theaters of operations, and cancelled the program in early 2011.  However, the requirement capability to conduct robust communications in both tactical operations center locations and on-the-move in tactical vehicles remains. The Air Force is now engaged in the JCIDS process and focused on a Capability Development Document to address these capability gaps.  FY13 the VCS thrust is renamed Moblie Communication Capability (MCC), and funding will be used to conduct studies and risk reduction activities for TACP mounted communications systems for fixed and vehicular platforms.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipated production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "The Tactical Air Control Party-Modernization (TACP-M) program acquires capabilities for TACP operations.  TACP members deploy with Army maneuver units and provide a Command and Control (C2) link for Close Air Support (CAS), airlift, and Air Force surveillance\/reconnaissance missions.  TACP\u2019s are equipped with various targeting and communication equipment which interfaces with ground maneuver forces, CAS aircraft, Joint Fires assets, C2 aircraft\/agencies, and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms\/agencies.  Throughout the performance of their duties, TACP\u2019s detect targets and compute precision coordinates to aircraft to ensure pilots track the correct target in the employment of GPS aided weapons.  The actions performed by TACPs not only shorten the kill chain, but also reduces the potential for fratricide and collateral damage in civilian-occupied areas.  \n\nThe TACP-M program provides equipment modernization capabilities to TACP, Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs), and Tactical Operations Center (TOCs) personnel. The program supports the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and significantly increased the mission effectiveness of the TACPs and ASOCs during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New Dawn.  The TACP-M program continues to be instrumental in providing ground communications for TACPs during federal emergency relief operations and Homeland Defense initiatives.\n\nThe purpose of the TACP-M program is to reduce reliance on voice transmission and replace analog equipment with the latest digital, data link and streaming video (e.g. Streaming Video Receiver) technology.  Upgraded digital communications enable machine-to-machine interface between TACPs and Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft, Army units and other TACP units.  Machine-to-machine communication provides reliable, high speed digital communications, ultimately supports joint and multinational interoperability, improves battlefield Situational Awareness (SA), increases targeting accuracy, reduces kill chain decision time, improves data flows\/information exchange, and reduces potential fratricide. TACPs use Software Communication Architecture (SCA)-certified, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), software programmable radios, and ancillary components for reliable voice & data UHF SATCOM and LOS UHF \/VHF communications.  TACP-M is divided into three segments:  Software, Dismounted and Mounted. The Mounted segement is further divided into Fixed and Mobile elements. \n\nThe Software segment utilizes a common Close Air Support System Software(CASS) baseline across all TACP systems.  The CASS software major thrust provides cross-service interoperability with numerous aircraft (A-10, F-16, F\/A-18, etc), helicopters, unmanned air vehicles (Predator), land and naval artillery, network enabled weapons, command & control nodes, and communications systems utilizing numerous messaging systems (such as Variable Message Format (VMF), Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), and Link-16 to provide maximum flexibility and capability to the TACP for the execution of joint fires support mission. FY13 funding associated with the software segement will support the CASS major thrust. \n\nThe Dismounted segment consists of integrated, man-portable systems procured via streamlined acquisition using non-developmental and off-the-shelf (OTS) components which is carried by dismounted airman. These include laser rangefinders, thermal imagers, laser designators, man-pack and handheld radios, ruggedized tactical computers, streaming video receivers, and other required equipment. The dismounted segment also incorporates the development of an advanced Target Location Designation System (TLDS) which is also being managed under the Army-led Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS) program.  TLDS will combine the capability of a laser marker, designator and thermal imagers into a small, lightweight system. FY13 funding will continue to support this major thrust and focus on the development of TLDS within the JETS program.\n\nThe mounted (Fixed) segment integrates computer and communications equipment into re-locatable vehicle, rack or transit case mounted systems for use in Tactical Operations Center (TOC) or Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) locations.  The TACP mounted (Fixed) segment includes the High Mobility, Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV)-mounted Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) Gateway, Gateway Lite, and the Dismounted Communications Package (DCP).  The TACP Mounted (Mobile) segment integrates similar equipment into mobile tactical vehicles employed by the Army and provides on-the-move tactical voice and data capability.  \n\nPrior to FY12, the major thrust associated with the mounted segment of TACP-M was the Vehicular Communication System (VCS).  This thrust focused on placing a TACP equipment suite into a HMMWV. In September 2010, the AF decided not to pursue production of the large HMMWV-Mounted VCS system due to survivability issues related to the current theaters of operations, and cancelled the program in early 2011.  However, the requirement capability to conduct robust communications in both tactical operations center locations and on-the-move in tactical vehicles remains. The Air Force is now engaged in the JCIDS process and focused on a Capability Development Document to address these capability gaps.  FY13 the VCS thrust is renamed Moblie Communication Capability (MCC), and funding will be used to conduct studies and risk reduction activities for TACP mounted communications systems for fixed and vehicular platforms.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipated production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
