This initiative funds Office of the Secretary of Defense and Service research and development efforts in key technologies and tools for design and development of complex systems.  The program seeks to develop enabling technologies that will support the rise of a new class of adaptable systems, and will spawn a new generation of engineering tools and markets that could revolutionize systems engineering practice.\n\nSystems 2020 research initiatives will investigate advanced engineering technologies and provide experimental platforms to assess the feasibility of proposed solutions.  These areas include:  (1) Multi-dimensional, multi-feature design and engineering  tradespace analysis approaches computed rapidly, accurately and within an integrated environment; (2) Techniques to generate multiple alternative designs with data structures enabling modeling of lifecycle implications such as producibility and sustainability; and (3) Novel decision-making techniques that interface engineering and operational data and inputs while guarding against premature or stovepiped design choices.  Together these efforts address opportunities to improve system adaptability and will develop techniques to balance design choices against costs for future adaptation precipitated by unexpected threats, changing missions, and disruptive technologies, while operating with far greater speed and agility."
