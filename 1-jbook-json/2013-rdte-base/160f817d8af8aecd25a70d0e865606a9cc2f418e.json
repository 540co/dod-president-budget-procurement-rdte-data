            "val": "The Information and Communications Technology program element is budgeted in the applied research budget activity because it is directed toward the application of advanced, innovative computing systems and communications technologies.  \n\n     The High Productivity, High-Performance Responsive Architectures project is developing the necessary computing hardware and the associated software technology base required to support future critical national security needs for computationally-intensive and data-intensive applications.  These technologies will lead to new multi-generation product lines of commercially viable, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications; it will include supercomputer, embedded computing systems, and novel design tools for manufacturing of defense systems.\n\n     The Information Assurance and Survivability project is developing the technology required to make emerging information system capabilities (such as wireless and mobile code\/mobile systems) inherently secure, and to protect DoD's mission-critical systems against attack upon or through the supporting information infrastructure.  These technologies will enable our critical systems to provide continuous correct operation even when they are attacked, and will lead to generations of stronger protection, higher performance, and more cost-effective security and survivability solutions scalable to several thousand sites.  \n\n     The Language Translation project will develop and test powerful new Human Language Technology that will provide critical capabilities for a wide range of national security needs.  This technology will enable systems to a) automatically translate and exploit large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a variety of means; b) to have two-way (foreign-language-to-English and English-to-foreign-language) translation; c) enable automated transcription and translation of foreign speech and text along with content summarization; and d) enable exploitation of captured, foreign language hard-copy documents.\n\n     The Cyber Technology project supports long term national security requirements through the development and demonstration of technology to increase the security of military information systems.  This involves networking, people, platforms, weapons sensors, and decision aids to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.  The results are networked forces that operate with increased speed and synchronization and are capable of achieving massed effects without the physical massing of forces as required in the past."

The program seeks to develop a design representation of meta-language and a domain-specific component model library from which system designs can quickly be assembled and their correctness verified with a high degree of certainty.  Such a \"fab-less\" design approach is complemented by a foundry-style manufacturing capability, consisting of a factory capable of rapid reconfiguration between a large number of products and product variants through bitstream reprogramability, with minimal or no resultant learning curve effects.  Together, the fab-less design and foundry-style manufacturing capability is anticipated to yield substantial---by a factor of five to ten---compression in the time to develop and field complex defense and aerospace systems.\n\nThe META effort will also explore the initial design of a next generation ground vehicle by employing a novel, model-based correct-by-construction design capability, a highly-adaptable foundry-style manufacturing capability, and crowd-sourcing methods to demonstrate 5x-10x compression in the timeline necessary to build an infantry fighting vehicle.  Beginning in FY 2012, the specific ground vehicle application work will be funded in PE 0602702E, Project TT-04, Advanced Land Systems."

The advantages of cloud computing have been demonstrated in civilian and Government applications to include the efficient utilization of computing resources, enabling deployed systems to be upgraded in the field, and reduced recurring and non-recurring costs.  With cloud computing, myriad one-of-a-kind, single platform specific processing implementations are eliminated and replaced with application effective computing on common hardware.  To date, the cloud computing paradigm has not been effectively exploited in embedded military applications, for reasons related to performance and correctness constraints.  In order to apply the cloud paradigm to military systems, MCC will make significant advances in the areas of virtualization, real-time responsiveness, reliability and verifiability, and security, while taking advantage of the cloud computing paradigm's inherent cost efficiency, manufacturing agility, maintainability, and programming democratization.  Fully realizing these capabilities will open the door to \"platform clouds\" that provide dramatically improved effectiveness in our military combat systems."

Given the relatively low consumption, the U.S. military IC requirements are not a factor that can influence IC production or the assurance that parts are delivered as specified.  With the majority of ICs used in modern military systems fabricated offshore, this situation presents a potential future risk that the parts acquired will not operate only in the specified manner.  The objective of the Integrity and Reliability of Integrated CircuitS (IRIS) program is to develop the technology to derive the functionality of an IC to determine unambiguously if malicious modifications have been made to that IC, and to accurately determine the IC's useful lifespan from a physical perspective.  The IRIS program will develop nondestructive scientifically based techniques for full functionality identification and functionality modification detection for ICs utilized in military systems.  In addition, the IRIS program will develop innovative test technologies and processes that can determine an IC's useful lifespan based on a significantly reduced number of samples.  Once developed, the resulting technologies may be deployed to Government or appropriate organizations that can provide critical IC functionality and reliability inspection services to the DoD, thereby ensuring that a scientific means is available to determine functionality and reliability in the various ICs deployed in DoD systems."

Similarly, CRASH will develop mechanisms at the hardware and operating system level that eliminate known vulnerabilities exploited by attackers.  However, because novel attacks will be developed, CRASH will also develop software techniques that allow a computer system to defend itself, to maintain its capabilities, and even heal itself.

SAFER is also developing technology for performing computations on encrypted data without decrypting it first through fully homomorphic encryption and interactive, secure multi-party computation schemes.  This will enable, for example, the capability to encrypt queries and to create an encrypted search result without decrypting the query.  This technology will advance the ability to run programs on untrusted hardware while keeping programs, data, and results encrypted and confidential.

The DoD is making increasing use of networked computing in systems such as military vehicles, weapon systems, ground sensors, smartphones, personal digital assistants, and other communication devices.  This dependence makes it critically important that the embedded operating system provides high levels of inherent assurance.  This operating system must also integrate the computational, physical, and networking elements of the system while running on a processor with very limited size, weight, and power.  Consequently, it can only devote a limited share of its computational resources to security while satisfying hard real-time constraints.  Recent advances in program synthesis, formal verification techniques, low-level and domain-specific programming languages, and operating systems mean that fully verified operating systems for embedded devices may be within reach at reasonable costs.  Systems that admit static verification can provide both high assurance and high performance to avoid the many dynamic checks otherwise necessary to provide high assurance.  The program will develop, mature, and integrate these technologies to produce an embedded computing platform that provides a high level of assurance for mission-critical military applications."

Previous programs included the Dynamic Quarantine of Computer-Based Worms (DQW) and Defense Against Cyber Attacks on Mobile Ad-hoc Network Systems (DCAMANET). \n\nIAMANET built upon the successes achieved in both the DQW and the DCMANET programs.  IAMANET directly supports the integrity, availability, reliability, confidentiality, and safety of Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) communications and data.  In contrast, the dominant Internet paradigm is intrinsically insecure.  For example, the Internet does not deny unauthorized traffic by default and therefore violates the principle of least privilege.  In addition, there are no provisions for non-repudiation or accountability and therefore adversaries can probe for vulnerabilities with impunity because the likelihood of attributing bad behavior to an adversary is limited.  Current protocols are not robust to purposely induced failures and malicious behavior, leaving entire Internet-based systems vulnerable in the case of defensive failure.  IAMANET, on the other hand, uses a deny-by-default networking paradigm, allowing only identifiable authorized users to communicate on the network.  While the objective transition path for IAMANET technologies is to the Services to support mobile tactical operations, the IAMANET systems are interoperable with fixed networks and may also have potential applicability to the broader DoD network architecture."

The technologies and systems developed in this project will enable our military to automatically translate and exploit large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a variety of means.  Current U.S. military operations involve close contact with a wide range of cultures and peoples.  The warfighter on the ground needs hand-held, speech-to-speech translation systems that enable communication with the local population during tactical missions.  Such tactical applications imply the need for two-way (foreign-language-to-English and English-to-foreign-language) translation.  Because foreign-language news broadcasts, web-posted content, and captured foreign-language hard-copy documents can provide insights regarding local and regional events, attitudes, and activities, language translation systems also contribute to the development of good strategic intelligence.  Such strategic applications require one-way (foreign-language-to-English) translation.  Exploitation of the resulting translated content requires the capability to automatically collate, filter, synthesize, summarize, and present relevant information in near real-time."

This involves networking people, platforms, weapons, sensors, and decision aids to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.  Adversaries seek to limit this force multiplier effect through cyber attacks intended to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.

This includes intelligence preparation of the cyber battlespace, indications and warning of adversary actions, detection of attack onset, attacker identification, and cyber battle damage assessment.  Cyber situational awareness is made difficult by the efforts of attackers to elude detection.  Approaches to cyber situational awareness will include forensic techniques to exploit data derived from events on hosts and networks that might appear innocuous when examined in isolation but reveal patterns indicative of a threat when correlated in time and space across an enterprise.  CSA will also create new graphical interfaces that enable intuitive visualization of events on hosts and networks to aid in the detection of cyber attacks.  This is an area where metrics are difficult to obtain, and so CSA will extend operationally-meaningful measures such as mean-time-to-detect and false-alarm rate to estimate the efficacy of proposed schemes."

C3D will enable the creation, deployment, management, and control of synthetic entities, objects, resources, and identities that produce uncertainties for attackers and make their task significantly more difficult, perhaps even intractable.  With C3D, infrastructure and other enterprise resources such as switches, servers, and storage could be virtually replicated to confound enemy targeting.
