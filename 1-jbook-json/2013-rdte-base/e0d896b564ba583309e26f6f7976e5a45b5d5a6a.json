DLS acquires, deploys and maintains a worldwide distributed learning system to ensure our nation's Soldiers receive critical training for mission success.  DLS benefits all Soldiers and DA Civilians.  DLS is a key enabler for Army training transformation by improving unit readiness and significantly reducing costs.  DLS enables the Army to properly train all components to a single Army standard.  DLS supports readiness by enhancing institutional and individual training in all Army components (Active, National Guard, Reserve, and Department of the Army Civilians (DAC)).  DLS provides both near and long-term information technology training infrastructure to enhance training, particularly in the areas of Military Occupational Skill Qualification (MOSQ) and reclassification.  It also provides a highly effective means to deliver training and education to deployed forces.  The overall goal for DLS is to leverage technology and to provide just-in-time training to each service member regardless of location.  DLS supports the E-Government strategy by using the Web to provide training materials, by enabling the intra-agency sharing of training data, and by adopting commercial practices and products to reduce operating costs.  DLS supports the President's Management Agenda by making use of e-Learning to leverage scarce training funds and to provide greater agency access to training materials.   DLS goals also include reducing training delivery and training support costs; improving service member morale by allowing members to obtain increased amounts of required training without leaving their home station; improving efficiency and effectiveness of Army instructors by allowing each instructor to train more students in a shorter period of time; and, improving unit readiness due to the reduction in personnel turbulence resulting from long term absence for resident institutional training. DLS Increment 1 fielded electronic classrooms known as Digital Training Facilities (DTFs) comprised of student work stations, servers and room based video equipment. DLS currently operates and sustains 222 DTFs (118 DTFs at the Active Component (AC) and 104 DTFs at the United States Army Reserve (USAR)).  DLS Increment 2 fielded the DLS Enterprise Management Center (EMC) that networked all of the global DFTs.  DLS Increment 3, Army Learning Management System (ALMS) provides a web-based learning management system which Soldiers can use to enroll, take training and record training results.   DLS Increment 4, Deployed Digital Training Campus (DDTC), approved for Full Deployment Decision Review (FDDR) in January 2010, will have fielded a total of 42 of 50 DDTC systems by end of FY 2013.  The DDTC is a mobile electronic training platform which will enable deployed Soldiers to take training."

The implementation of AHRS requires the development of an authoritative Army Corporate database to support the eventual migration to Integrated Personnel and Payroll System-Army (IPPS-A). However, major elements of AHRS are not planned to be subsumed into IPPS-A.  AHRS consists of three major components:\n - Electronic Military Personnel Office (eMILPO) provides the U.S. Army with a reliable, timely, and efficient mechanism for performing Army personnel actions and managing strength accountability.  The application provides visibility of the location, status, and skills of Soldiers both from a high level (tope of the system) and a unit level (bottom of the system).  eMILPO delivers enhanced performance to the Soldier, providing superior data accuracy, and a more intuitive web-based approach resulting in increased productivity, quality, timeliness, security, and user satisfaction.  It re-hosted the USC Title 10 functionality, formerly resident in the Standard Installation Division Personnel System-3 (SIDPERS) application, for migration to IPPS-A.  Selected elements of eMILPO will need to be operated in parallel with IPPS-A until\/unless IPPS-A is able to absorb all eMILPO funtionality.\n- Deployed Theater Accountability System (DTAS) is a personnel accountability system that enables the Combatant Commanders (COCOM) to meet Title 10 personnel accountability responsibilities.  DTAS is residing on the Secret Internet Router Network (SIPRnet) and accounts for military and civilian personnel in a deployed theater by unit, day and location supporting force tracking and deployed Operations Tempo (OPTEMP) tracking.  DTAS is a persistent system and will continue to exist Integrated Personnel and Pay System - Army (IPPS-A) migration.\n - The Tactical Personnel System (TPS)is a stand-alone system that supports personnel accountability for task organization\/manifests and jump manifests used by tactical units.  The system interfaces with DTAS, allowing Soldiers to be loaded into DTAS in mass upon arrival in theater.  TPS will continue to exist Integrated Personnel and Pay System - Army (IPPS-A) migration.\n-Personnel Transformation (PT)- Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)- The Army's Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) provides a data integration service in which data can be extracted from the legacy human resource systems and transferred to DIMHRS.  The ESB will be a middleware application which will  provide a single interface to and from DIMHRS from the Army Legacy Systems.  The ESB will provide the infrastructure for the integration of new and existing applications by allowing systems and applications to easily exchange information across different environments and platforms.  It will also form the information bridge between DIMHRS, the Army Legacy Systems, and external systems to create more streamlined systems in support of the military mission and personnel transformation goals. \n\nFY 2013 funding procures configuration management software, test and evaluation software, life cycle replacement of legacy equipment and Continuity of Operations (COOP) equipment and software to support Engineering Change Packages (ECPs)\/System Change Packages (SCPs)\/Interim Change Packages (ICPs) in support of eMILPO and DTAS."

AHRS contractual efforts are acquired on a firm fixed price basis through GSA schedule and existing contractual vehicles.  The Title 10 functionality has transferred to AHRS.  \n-Personnel Transformation - The Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) program management approach is a middleware application which will provide a single interface to and from DIMHRS from the Army Legacy Systems.  The ESB will provide the infrastructure for the integration of new and existing applications by allowing systems and applications to easily exchange information across different environments and platforms.  It will also form the information bridge between DIMHRS, the Army Legacy Systems, and external systems. Contractor selection will be accomplished through open competition, administered by a federal certified contracting agency.  Program Management is accomplished by combining a \"best practices\" approach coupled with standard tools."

The ISM system is a web environment that utilizes a single, centralized, replicated database to store logistical and personnel readiness data for the entire Army.  The requested funds continue migration of the fielded ISM software (Disk Operating System character based) applications to a more modern graphical user interface in a web based environment allowing the combat soldier as well as the field commander access to records impacting soldier readiness.   Functionality fielded in FY11 and FY12 includes web server architecture that supports a graphical user interface, web-based user access, and a consolidated infrastructure in accordance with the Army Knowledge Management Strategic Plan.  This modernized system enables the Army Installation Management community to provide simple web-enabled software applications for soldier processing; ready and relevant information to the commander; while transparently integrating multiple complex processes for soldiers, commanders, and Army executives.  ISM consists of five discrete modules focusing on ARFORGEN activities including in\/out processing of soldiers, personnel locator services, soldier transition processing, management of soldier educational records, and management of Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment (OCIE).  The Network Operations and Security Center, Ft. Huachuca, AZ manages the ISM network, provides general system configuration control, operates a 24\/7 Helpdesk, provides user account management, and performs automated backups for ISM devices located at Army sites worldwide.\n  \nCoalition Warfighter Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) is a mandated Joint program that requires participation by the US Army to explore near-term technologies that support Joint and Coalition Warfare Interoperability.  Funding is to facilitate Coalition Force interoperability research and development and to comply with CJCSI 6230.2 date 30 April 05.  Army Behavioral Health Integrated Data Environment (ABHIDE) will be the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (CHPPM) Suicide Registry.  Data relating to suicides and suicides attempts are collected and stored in a in disparate, non-related databases that cross the domains of medical, personnel and law enforcement.   ABHIDE will provide the capability of integrating the non-related and dispersed data from the separate sources into a single comprehensive database to support both retrospective and predictive analysis.  The information obtained will be used to conduct epidemiological surveillance, identify trends in behavior patterns and identify potential indicators for suicidal tendencies supporting the mitigation of future suicide attempts across all phases of Army service.\n\nISM Core funding is essential for supporting demands to research and develop improved systems to provide for soldier safety and inventory reduction without risking readiness. Supports research and development to comply with Dept of Defense Instruction 8320.4 Serialized Item Management.  Applications to use commercial off the shelf e-Signature systems to reduce soldier wait time for signature verification from 30 minutes per transaction to less than one minute. \n\nFunding for CWID will continue to facilitate Coalition Force interoperability research and development. Funding for ABHIDE will continue development of the system."

The MC4 System will interface Force Health Protection and medical surveillance information with Army Battle Command and Combat Service Support information technology systems as they evolve to support the Army Transformation.  The MC4 System also indirectly supports other soldier protection initiatives such as analysis of injury data collected from the MC4 systems, which is used to support the identification and development of other critical soldier support systems such as body armor, improved helmets, traumatic brain injury protection and trauma reduction.  Current MC4 Program efforts are focused on system engineering, testing and integration, and fielding automation infrastructure for Army users of the Joint Theater Medical Information Program (TMIP-J) suite of software.  Funding provides support system engineering, integration and developmental testing of information management\/information technology to better support Force Health Protection in the Army Campaign Plan and Overseas Contingency Operation units.\n\nFY 2013 Base funding will be used for the engineering effort required to provide the Defense Health Information Management System (DHIMS) TMIP-J software on the Army platform, as well as the engineering effort for other Army unique capability.  Activities include:\n--Test augmentation to include development testing of TMIP (all releases until final objective), and other Army unique software capabilities\n--Integration testing of software systems on the MC4 baseline system\n--Future engineering in architecture development for better efficiency and effectiveness\n--Evaluation of technology obsolescence and solutions\n--Evaluation and testing of technology upgrades to include capabilities identification through market surveys and demonstrations\n--Evaluation of new health care capabilities not provided by DHIMS\/TMIP, e.g. teleradiology\n--Test and evaluation of new capabilities and how well they work in the combat theater\n--Lab site studies with technology and scenarios\n--Interfaces with other systems, e.g. Army Brigade Combat Team Modernization"

The MC4 hardware is procured as Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) components.  Since TMIP software is a major component of the MC4 System, the MC4 Program will deliver capabilities in increments, recognizing the need for future system upgrades and Preplanned Product Improvements (P3Is).  The MC4 Program continues to work with the user community to continually define and refine additional requirements and match them with available technologies to provide the user enhanced capabilities.  These enhanced capabilities will be provided to the user at the earliest possible date.  This approach yields the most operationally useful and supportable capability in the shortest time possible with Cost As an Independent Variable.  Moreover, this approach provides an initial capability with the explicit intent of delivering improved and updated capability in subsequent upgrades and P3Is.  This evolutionary development approach will be accomplished through a rapid prototyping process that will progress the system from its current functional capabilities to fully integrated objective capabilities.  Appropriate commercial technology enhancements (e.g. advances in operating systems, voice activated technology, etc) will be incorporated into MC4 products and systems as they become available.  Each MC4 System component will undergo a full range of developmental testing to include software unit testing, integration testing, interoperability testing and software qualification testing. The MC4 system upgrades and improvements will continue to undergo follow-on operational testing."

PM AcqBusiness is using an evolutionary acquisition strategy to acquire the capabilities specified in the PM AcqBusiness requirements document in order to realize benefits early and reduce risk.  The full range of PM AcqBusiness Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) services will be achieved through an evolutionary implementation of individual components.  Each service is designed to federate cleanly with and leverage the capabilities provided by other SOA environments by leveraging an open-standards based approach to design.  Each PM AcqBusiness SOA service will implement new functionality, and may or may not utilize other already published SOA services.  Each service capability will be tested and then made available to consumers throughout the acquisition community and the Army.  This approach minimizes the cost incurred for testing the system, as well as minimizes release transition impacts on users.  PM AcqBusiness is using an evolutionary acquisition approach, incorporating the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software, and custom developed software to meet Army requirements.  In this approach, the maintenance release will be streamlined to expedite the fielding of a particular PM AcqBusiness software fix or upgrade.  Maintenance releases will be installed on an \"as needed\" basis after testing and approval by PM AcqBusiness.  This approach minimizes the time required to deliver new capabilities to users.  The PM AcqBusiness acquisition approach embraces the tenets of Subtitle III of Title 40, U.S.C. (Formerly the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  As such, the PM AcqBusiness is: (1) performing Business Process Reengineering (BPR) in advance of development of AcqBusiness capabilities.  AcqBusiness is primarily about changing how the acquisition business functions are done in the Army; (2) encouraging the purchase of commercial products and innovations from private industry;  (3) involving potential suppliers of SOA technology early in the requirements generation process; (4) employing outsourcing wherever possible; and (5) acquiring the AcqBusiness capabilities in interoperable modules, leveraging the evolutionary acquisition approach."

VIPS will enable a responsive, flexible and efficient means to qualify Applicants to meet manpower resource requirements for the uniformed Services, Coast Guard, and National Guard routine and contingency operations.  VIPS will be the future accessioning system to be used by the US Military Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM) which serves as the single entry point for determining the physical, aptitude, and conduct qualifications of candidates for enlistment.  VIPS will provide the capability to electronically acquire, process, store, secure, and seamlessly share personnel data across the Accessions Community of Interest (ACOI).  When fully implemented, VIPS will reduce the cycle time required to induct enlistees to meet the needs of Homeland Defense, reduce the number of visits to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS), reduce manual data entry errors, and reduce attrition through better pre-screening practices.  The implementation of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach will enable accession data to be securely available to applicants and ACOI partners such as Recruiting and Training Commands, Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), Military Health System, Human Resource Management (HRM), and Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO).  VIPS will support compliance with DoD direction for a net-centric environment and take advantage of automated data capture technology, e.g., medical equipment with the capability to capture and electronically transmit exam results.  The accessioning system of the future will be location independent, virtually paper-free, and automated to assist with bringing the right people at the right time to operational commanders.  On November 1, 2008, the DoD Business Transformation Agency (BTA) assumed program lead.\n\nFY12 Base funding supports USMEPCOM project transformation of VIPS."

One is to prepare those systems for subsumption by the Integrated Personnel and Pay System (IPPS-A).  The other is to disconnect and upgrade those systems not being subsumed by IPPS-A.  Many systems have delayed upgrade do to the planned release of DIMHRS.  Systems that will be targeted by HRC to prepare for IPPS-A subsumption or upgrade are the Enlisted Distribution and Assignment System (EDAS), Soldier Management System (SMS), the Army Strategic Readiness Update (ASRU), the Keystone Retain System, and the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS).\n     \nThe Program Planning Budget (PPB)- Business Operating System (BOS) will standardize and better integrate the transactional automated information systems used in the HQDA level programming and budgeting processes.  These systems are core to the PPBE business processes of the HQ for gathering programmatic requirements, balancing resources and delivering the Army's program budget to OSD.  This project is streamlining programming and budgeting processes and significantly improving strategic analysis capabilities.  The project is architecting, reengineering, streamlining and consolidating HQDA systems, feeder data base systems, and streamlining the associated processes.  These improvements will improve capability eliminate redundancies and reduce overall cost of operations.  The PPB BOS project is complementary to the Army's General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) program.  \n\nThe Law Enforcement Advisory Program (LEAP), formerly known as the Criminal Information Management System (CIMS), is a collection of mission essential information technology (IT) systems within the Criminal Investigation Command (CIDC) and the Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG). USACIDC and OPMG has been tasked by the Army Health Promotion\/Risk Reduction (HP\/RR) task force to develop and integrate a unified, comprehensive enterprise program \/ system that shall house Classified and Unclassified - Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data which shall leverage existing and future Army LE enterprise information technology (IT) assets and other external data sources providing a full range of law enforcement functions to support business objectives and mission.  This new comprehensive enterprise environment shall provide US Army LE stakeholders the enhanced capability to rapidly and efficiently manage a variety of LE and criminal intelligence (CrimIntel) functions; as well as a broader range of senior executive reporting requirements.  \n\nThe Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) is a web-based software system used at the United States Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory (USACIL) at Fort Gillem, GA for the management of casework and tracking of all evidence received and processed.  The USACIL requires RDT&E funding to complete the configuration, installation and validation of additional LIMS modules in support of forensics (to include the Materials Management, Equipment Management, Proficiency Testing, Training and Crime Scene support); and, to support the development, configuration and implementation of an Expeditionary Forensics Laboratory Information Management System (eLIMS)  in theater.  The eLIMS is the conduit between the deployed labs and the laboratory located at Ft. Gillem.  The eLIMS would provide the forensic analysts with the ability to collect, track, store and analyze evidence collected from battlefield crime scenes at required competency levels of testing and calibration.  It will allow the results to be electronically maintained and transmitted to the permanent physical lab at Ft. Gillem, Ga.  In addition, the system would afford the analysts electronic access to shared case management and evidence databases at the LAB from their deployed positions.  At the current configuration of LIMS from CONUS locations, transmission of case related information can be processed in real time; however, transmission of case related information in theater takes approximately 1-2 hours.  If requirements are not funded, the USACIL will not be able to complete and implement the additional forensic modules for the core LIMS or develop and implement the eLIMS for the deployable labs.  The stated objective will be delayed, resulting in a less than efficient process for handling of cases in theater and an inability to meet acceptable levels of turnaround time for casework."

The LEAP program will provide criminal intelligence querying and reporting capabilities in compliance with regulatory and policy standards for Army Law Enforcement regarding investigation of felony crimes.  LEAP will captures criminal case investigative information regarding incidents, location descriptors, entities (name, social security number, rank, title, physical characteristics, sex, birth place, and date), agent assignment, crime description and identifiers, statements, property data, laboratory tests; verifies and stores this data for criminal intelligence purposes: and reports this information to the proper authorities from the Division Commanding Officer to the United States Grand Jury.
