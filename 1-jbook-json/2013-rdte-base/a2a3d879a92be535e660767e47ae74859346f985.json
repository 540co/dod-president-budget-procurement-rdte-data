Each current project\/task is evaluated in terms of how well the technical work is progressing and how allocated resources are being utilized.  Adjustments to resources, schedules, and technical directions are made, as required.  Future projects\/tasks are also discussed, thereby ensuring an integrated approach is maintained across all related project\/task areas.  To further increase the utility of the IPR\/CCB structure, the Joint Staff customer participates in the project\/task reviews.  The result of this approach is a truly integrated effort of NMCS Engineering, contractor, and Joint Staff working together to achieve common program goals.  For FY 2011, thirteen major projects were completed.  All thirteen projects met operational\/functional requirements and were accepted by their respective NMCS customers.  All thirteen projects were completed within allocated costs\/resources.  All thirteen projects were completed within the original schedule."
