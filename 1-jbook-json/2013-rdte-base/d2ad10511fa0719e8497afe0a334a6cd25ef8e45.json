            "val": "The Ballistic Missile Defense Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BMC) Program establishes the System by linking together the external sensors and weapons of independent Elements into a layered missile defense system such that the whole is more capable and robust than the sum of its parts -- thus increasing the footprint of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) with greater performance and defensive coverage. The C2BMC enables the BMDS to manage complex threats -- near simultaneous enemy missile shots aimed at theater, regional, or homeland assets. The systems linked through C2BMC include Phased Array Tracking Radar Intercept on Target (PATRIOT), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), Ground Based Midcourse Defense (GMD); and sensors such as the Army Navy\/Ground Transportable Radar Surveillance model 2 (AN\/TPY-2) radar, Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX), Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS), and (BMDS) Overhead Persistent Infra-Red (OPIR) Architecture (BOA). The C2BMC Program will ship a C2BMC Deployable Interface Node (CDIN) with a forward based AN\/TPY-2 identified for a future BMDS deployment. The C2BMC program will also upgrade existing suite to Spiral 6.4 suite for Central Command (CENTCOM), install communications, support hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) integration testing, provide operations and distrainment, and add a training suite in CENTCOM. \n\nBased on the Missile Defense Agency`s defined architectures and system specifications, the C2BMC program will provide the warfighter the capability to plan the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) fight while concurrently tracking all potential ballistic missile threats, and pairing any sensor with any shooter to defeat ballistic missile threats at any range, in any phase, in all theaters. C2BMC battle management, via the Global Engagement Manager (GEM), will deliver full X-Band radar sensor control and capabilities for Improved threat object correlation which calculates a common threat track from multiple sensors through data fusion, with sufficient data accuracy and timeliness for BMDS weapon Elements to enable successful engagements via Link-16 and Extremely High Frequency (EHF) satellite communications. The C2BMC program will also work to increase coalition partners` capabilities. \n\nThe C2BMC Program will expand defense of the United States, allies, and deployed forces by continuing work which has focused on limited Iranian long-range threats by enabling a coordinated defense against short- to intermediate-range threats in two regions\/theaters. \n\nOne of the best ways to dissuade, deter, and defeat ballistic missile threats is through integrated ballistic missile defense capabilities: weapons; sensors; and command and control, battle management, and communications. A potential or actual attack may cross regions and may fly higher and faster than stand-alone, autonomous capabilities operated by a single Military Service can defend against. Integrated Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities draw on space-, land-, and sea-based assets operated by multiple Services to provide the best sensor information about the enemy missiles location and track a more diverse and effective set of weapon options to be used by the Combatant Commander to defeat the attack; with all connected by a unifying Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BMC) system. As a result, an effort funded in a program element may be critical to the success of efforts in other program elements. These connections are referred to as interdependencies."

                            "val": "The Command and Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) Program will provide the warfighter the capability to plan the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) fight while concurrently tracking all potential ballistic missile threats, and pairing any sensor with any shooter to defeat ballistic missile threats at any range, in any phase, in all theaters. The C2BMC Program will also work to increase coalition partners` capabilities. \n\nThe C2BMC Program will expand defense of the United States, allies, and deployed forces by continuing the work initiated in Budget Project BX01 which has focused on limited Iranian long-range threats by enabling a coordinated defense against short-to intermediate- range threats in two regions\/theaters. \n\nSpecific goals are to deliver the following, which include BMDS planning, situational awareness, sensor management, and engagement coordination functions incorporated in BMDS Integrated Build C and D specifications approved content: \n\n-Fully integrated BMD Planner and situational awareness displays with integrated intelligence information and defended asset priority schemes \n-Initial Global Engagement Manager (GEM) at Ramstein AB \n\n- Continuity of Operations Global Engagement Manager (GEM) at Northern Command (NORTHCOM) (Missile Defense Integration and Operations Center (MDIOC)) \n- Incorporate Central Command (CENTCOM) into the C2BMC operational architecture \n- Incorporate BMDS Overhead Persistent Infra-Red (OPIR) Architecture (BOA) sensor data for radar and shooter (Aegis, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)) cueing \n- Update C2BMC model (BCM), for system-level performance assessments that have been validated against operational C2BMC performance \n-Distributed Training System to provide COCOM exercise and training capabilities without scheduling downtime. Training Support System to provide COCOMs and schoolhouses with a flexible and small footprint training capability \n-Install more effective network monitoring and computer network defense software and hardware at the BMDS Network Operations and Security Center (BNOSC) \n-Information Assurance (IA) monitoring and modifications of global network devices at all C2BMC locations \n-Support system flight and ground testing in accordance with the MDA Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP) \n\nC2BMC ELEMENT \n\nThe Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Command and Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) will provide a regional situational awareness and battle management capability at Pacific Command (PACOM), Northern Command (NORTHCOM), European Command (EUCOM) and Central Command (CENTCOM). C2BMC will move to a blade-based computing architecture in Spiral 8.2 to support reliability, maintainability, and modularity. \n\nThe Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Planner will evolve to a network enabled capability designed to interface with service and allied planning components. Improvements include support for rapid re-planning enhanced mapping products and services, updating the Air and Missile Defense Workstation (AMDWS) interface to incorporate Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), and an initial interface with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) planning systems. \n\nC2BMC will evolve networked interfaces to expose data over the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) providing for display of individual weapon system engagement and coordination information resulting in an integrated common operating picture across the Combatant Commands. \n\nC2BMC battle management, via the Global Engagement Manager (GEM), will deliver full X-Band radar sensor control and capabilities for the following: \n\n- Improved threat object correlation which calculates a common threat track from multiple sensors through data fusion, with sufficient data accuracy and timeliness for BMDS weapon Elements to enable successful engagements via Link-16 and Extremely High Frequency (EHF) satellite communications \n- Incorporation of BMDS Overhead Persistent Infra-Red (OPIR) Architecture (BOA) and upgraded Space Based Infra-Red System (SBIRS) sensor data \n- Improved BMD system discrimination logic using multiple sensors discrimination results, selecting the best result, and assigning object type to common threat tracks \n- Sensor management and weapons engagement coordination aids to direct the BMDS fight and make efficient use of limited inventory \n\nC2BMC Spiral 8.2 Distributed Training System (DTS; AKA DMETS) planning and development enables COCOMs to support large-scale exercises and training events without scheduling downtime of operations. The DTS will stimulate C2BMC operational screens at COCOM Air Operations Center (AOC), Maritime Operations Center (MOC), and Headquarters. Capabilities will support training with theater\/regional assets and coalition partners, and updated simulations to represent current BMDS system capabilities. C2BMC Spiral 8.2 Training Support System (TSS) planning and development that provides a flexible scenario and small footprint training system for small scale COCOM training events and schoolhouses. The TSS will integrate with Missile Warning and Air Operations Center training systems to provide an integrated training system. \n\n\nThe Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Communications Network ties together an expanding set of sensors and weapons systems enabling the National Command Authority and the commanders at the strategic, theater and tactical levels to optimally engage ballistic missile threats including near simultaneous theater, regional and homeland attacks. The BMD Communications Network provides a robust, end-to-end, high availability, operational communications network (COMNET) infrastructure with diverse paths, that quickly and unambiguously shares information across the global Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). This sharing of information is performed securely with special emphasis on preventing cyber attack via a BMDS Network Operations and Security Center (BNOSC). The C2BMC system and networks are protected by layered defenses that start with circuits comprising the BMDS Communications Network (BCN) that are isolated from the known networks. Where the BCN and the known networks meet, layers of firewalls, encryption devices, routers and switches each with specific access control lists (ACLs), further protect the internal systems and allow only identified and approved users and systems access to the C2BMC data. Effective network management will coordinate, and integrate across diverse equipment platforms, interfaces with other DoD communications systems, evolving information standards and capabilities, and will adhere to the DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP). Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) services are also leveraged in providing world-wide communications. Planned improvements such as dynamic real-time network management and monitoring will enable the warfighter to monitor the connection to BMDS weapons and anticipate and remedy issues as they occur. \n\nSITE ACTIVATION \n\nCommand and Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) hardware and software have been deployed to Northern Command (NORTHCOM), Strategic Command (STRATCOM), Pacific Command (PACOM), and European Command (EUCOM) with existing sites receiving Spiral upgrades as needed. Current capabilities were expanded with Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Planner, web browser, and workstation installations per warfighter requirements. Planning instituted for future Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) operations and site installations included Global Engagement Manager (GEM) at European Command (EUCOM), GEM on the Parallel Support Network (PSN) at Northern Command (NORTHCOM), and network-enabled capability at various locations. Central Command (CENTCOM) has been incorporated into the operational C2BMC architecture. Site Activation also included participation in planning for future BMDS operations and site installations. \n\nOPERATIONS AND SUSTAINMENT \n\nC2BMC Program Operations and Sustainment (O&S) consists of 1) sustaining C2BMC operational capability worldwide; 2) on-site sub-systems maintenance for all C2BMC including COCOM suites, GEM Suites planners, remote Enterprise Work Stations (EWS), and GEM Work Stations (GWS), web browsers, and communication site(s) associated with the Army Navy\/Ground Transportable Radar Surveillance model 2 (AN\/TPY-2) radar(s); 3) the C2BMC Control Center that provides real-time resolution of operational issues; 4) vendor support which includes coordination and resolution of problems that occur with Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) equipment; 5) training of operator, maintenance personnel, and testers; 6) hardware and software maintenance, and upgrade installation to ensure continuity of C2BMC operations. \n\nC2BMC Spiral 6.4 Distributed Training System (DTS; AKA DMETS) operations and sustainment will continue until Spiral 8.2 becomes operational. The Spiral 6.4 DTS provides training for STRATCOM, NORTHCOM, PACOM, EUCOM, and CENTCOM. The DTS will be maintained to the same hardware and software baseline as the operational system and will incorporate simulation upgrades to keep pace with evolving BMDS system capabilities."
