The program focuses on developing components, subsystems, and technologies with potential aerospace combat, special operations, and airlift electronic combat applications in three project areas.  The first project develops and demonstrates technologies for integrating electronic combat sensors and systems into a fused and seamless whole.  The second project integrates and focuses research efforts in electronic warfare (EW), directed energy weapons (DEW), and cyber warfare to rapidly demonstrate a capability for rapid fielding.  The third project develops and demonstrates advanced technologies for radio-frequency electronic combat suites.  The fourth project develops and demonstrates advanced warning and countermeasure technologies to defeat electro-optical, infrared, and laser threats to aerospace platforms.  This program has been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops and demonstrates technologies for existing system upgrades and\/or new sensor and electronic combat system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs."
