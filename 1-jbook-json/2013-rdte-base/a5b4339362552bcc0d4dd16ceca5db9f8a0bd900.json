In addition, funding may be used to develop solutions to emergency obsolescence and safety of flight issues that impact the mission capability or continued support of the C-17 weapon system.\n\n- FY 2011:  Continued development and testing of C-17 aircraft performance improvements\/mandates to include projects such as, but not limited to, Instrument Landing System (ILS) Identification and Flight Control Computer (FCC) Updates, Replacement Heads-Up Display (RHUD), Replacement Core Integrated Processor (RCIP) Obsolescence, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5, Communication and Navigation Capability, Iridium EMI\/EMC Testing, Radio Frequency Counter Measures (RFCM) Risk Reduction Evaluation, Information Assurance Strategy (IAS), and Airdrop.\n\n- FY 2012:  Continued development and testing of C-17 aircraft performance improvements\/mandates to include projects such as, but not limited to, ILS Identification and FCC Updates, RHUD, RCIP Obsolescence, IFF Mode 5, Communication and Navigation Capability, and Communication Navigation Surveillance (CNS)\/Air Traffic Management (ATM) System - Phase 1 Surveillance.\n\n- FY 2013:  Continued development and testing of C-17 aircraft performance improvements\/mandates to include projects such as, but not limited to, development efforts in support of C-17 operational efficiencies, RHUD, RCIP Obsolescence, IFF Mode 5, Communication and Navigation Capability, and CNS\/ATM System - Phase 1 Surveillance.\n\nThis program is in budget activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
