            "val": "This program supports a range of activities including technology planning, development, demonstrations and prototyping, as well as modeling, simulations and exercises to support development of tactics and procedures in the Space Control mission area.  The types of Space Control activities accomplished are Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Defensive Counterspace (DCS) , Offensive Counterspace (OCS) and Command and Control and Battle Management.  For use in the Space Control mission area, SSA includes monitoring, detecting, identifying, tracking, assessing, verifying, categorizing, and characterizing, objects and events in space and terrestrial based space capabilities.  DCS includes defensive activities to protect U.S. and friendly space-systems assets, resources, and operations from enemy attempts to negate or interfere and prevention activities that limit or eliminate an adversary's ability to use U.S. space systems and services for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.  OCS activities disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy space systems, or the information they provide, which may be used for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.   Consistent with DOD policy, the negation efforts of this program currently focus on negation technologies which have temporary, localized, and reversible effects.  Command & Control efforts include identifying technology solutions to enable fusion of data for use in multi-level security environments, near-real-time data delivery and decision support to war fighter needs.  Rapid Reaction Capabilities in response to immediate war fighter needs are developed within this program.  \n\nFunding in FY11\/12\/13 also supports the development of the technology and infrastructure for space control elements of the Space Test and Trainging Range (STTR).  This includes development and demonstration of test assets, special test equipment, capabilities and systems required to test, validate, and verify performance of integrated space control systems.  Additionally, this program supports the development of test range assets required to support developmental and operational test, exercises, training, and tactics development for space control systems.  A collaborative command & control capability will be integrated into several range systems to provide real time communications during test event scenarios.  \n\nSpacetrack Integration Node Global Enhanced Reporting (STINGER) project converts an enhanced processing capability developed for missile warning radar to use for the space situation awareness program radars.   \n\nThese projects are in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

The types of Space Control activities accomplished are Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Defensive Counterspace (DCS) , Offensive Counterspace (OCS) and Command and Control and Battle Management.  For use in the Space Control mission area, SSA includes monitoring, detecting, identifying, tracking, assessing, verifying, categorizing, and characterizing, objects and events in space and terrestrial based space capabilities.  DCS includes defensive activities to protect U.S. and friendly space-systems assets, resources, and operations from enemy attempts to negate or interfere and prevention activities that limit or eliminate an adversary's ability to use U.S. space systems and services for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.  OCS activities disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy space systems, or the information they provide, which may be used for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.   Analysis to support vulnerability and survivability studies and projects.  Consistent with DOD policy, the negation efforts of this program currently focus on negation technologies which have temporary, localized, and reversible effects.  Command & Control efforts include identifying technology solutions to enable fusion of data for use in multi-level security environments, near-real-time data delivery and decision support to war fighter needs.  Rapid Reaction Capabilities in response to immediate war fighter needs are developed within this program. \n\nFunding also supports the development of the technology and infrastructure for space control elements of the space test and training range.  This includes development and demonstration of test assets, special test equipment, capabilities and systems required to test, validate, and verify performance of integrated space control systems.  Additionally, this program supports the development of test range assets required to support developmental and operational test, exercises, training, and tactics development for space control systems.  A collaborative command & control capability will be integrated into several range systems to provide real time communications during test event scenarios.\n\nSpacetrack Integration Node Global Enhanced Reporting (STINGER) project converts an enhanced processing capability developed for missile warning radar to use for the space situation awareness program radars.  \n \nThese projects are in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Additionally, this program supports the development of test range assets required to support developmental and operational test, exercises, training, and tactics development for space control systems.  A collaborative command & control capability will be integrated into several range systems to provide real time communications during test event scenarios.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."
