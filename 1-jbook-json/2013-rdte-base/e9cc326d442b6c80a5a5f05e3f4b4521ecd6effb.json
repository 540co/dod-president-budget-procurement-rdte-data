Logistics Systems Development (LSD), (project 675044), provides a budgetary accounting location for various projects having Congressional interest.\n\nA third project, Product Data System Modernization (PDSM), project 673318, is an effort to upgrade Air Force digital data standards to commercial industry standards supporting the Joint Computer-Aided Acquisition Logistic Support (JCALS) System.  In FY 2013, project 673318, Product Data System Modernization (PDSM), efforts transferred from PE 0708611F, Support Systems Development, to PE 0708012F, Logistics Support Activities, in order to better align the fielded and operational PDSM project within the more appropriate PE 0708012F Logistics Support Activities. \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The primary effort within the Product Data System Modernization (PDSM) project is the Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS) Enterprise.  ETIMS is an integration of custom developed software with new and existing applications\/components of Electronic Technical Order Viewer, Joint Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistics Support (JCALS), and Document Automation and Production Service (DAPS) On-Demand printing and distribution service.  It will provide user friendly, technically accurate, and up-to-date digital technical data at the point of use that is acquired, sustained, distributed, and available in digital format from a single point of access for all technical data users.  ETIMS will develop new software and integrate existing TO databases.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and program execution to include Nuclear Weapons Related Material (NWRM) technical data requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

As Air Force logistics transforms and streamlines its processes, new enterprise focused enablement is required.

LIMS-EV capabilities provide integrated \u201cone-version-of-truth\u201d information from multiple source systems to decision makers from strategic to tactical level.  LIMS-EV funding will allow development efforts to enable other eLog21 initiatives, extend current BI capabilities to provide configurable alerting, predictive analysis, what-if analysis and further integration of support equipment, vehicle, munitions, supply, commodities and components (engines, landing gears, etc) to increase weapons systems availability.   \n\nMaintains the flexibility to conduct Business Process Re-Engineering (BPRE) by use of the Service Development and Delivery Plan (SDDP) and to provide data discovery and migration support of Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS), PE 0708610F, as required.  BPRE and SDDP activties, along with data discovery and migration support of legacy logistics systems, have been limited due to ongoing reevaluation of ECSS.\n\nAs a result of the delay in migrating a number of legacy logistics systems to ECSS, the current state of Air Force Legacy Information Technology logistics systems is under evaluation.  Legacy Modernization and Legacy Remediation activities include efforts to bring systems originally planned to be subsummed by ECSS up to Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) compliance.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
