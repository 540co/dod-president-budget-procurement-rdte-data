Initiated and completed development of low-cost systems for the exploitation of commercial electronics, communications, and computing for special reconnaissance.  Completed development of an organic fixed-site mortar targeting system with an integrated Fire Control System that provides rapid and accurate indirect fire solutions and translates that to auto-laying of either a 120mm or 81mm mortar using legacy U.S. standard mortars and ammunition.  Completed development of a small, affordable imaging device capable of extracting object depth information along with a video stream of scenes. Completed development of an integrated, handheld device that combines a commercial off the shelf (COTS) Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, a standard military Blue Force Tracker and Combat Survivor\/Evader Locator radio for use during evasion of enemy forces or contingency operations.  Completed development of a system that provides a self-healing, ad hoc air-to-ground mesh network for the transmission of real-time communications (voice and data).  Completed development of a time-activated restraint and release system to temporarily restrain potential threat individuals for a predetermined period of time.  Completed development of a low-signature, backlit wrist worn compass that allows the operator to easily view cardinal directions whether in a well-lit or dark environment.  Completed development of a program of instruction and provided new equipment for special operations forces to enhance advanced marksmanship at ranges up to 1,800 meters.  Completed development of a lightweight, compact system that combines motion-sensing alert with an IR illuminator to provide broader early-warning security for deployed teams."
