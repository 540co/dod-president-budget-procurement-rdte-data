A federated environment \u2013 characterized by the capacity of DoD institutions to directly share participants and content across websites - fosters networks of partner influencers and enables better use of DoD resources through collaboration among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, PfP and international partners, other DoD educational institutions and communities as required. The program uses a spiral methodology (making available capabilities as developed), to speed the delivery of open source collaboration technologies the user community. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) oversees execution of the research and development of the RIO-PIMS effort and its operations, and ensures that the program addresses DoD security cooperation requirements in the context of defense, interagency, and international information sharing and collaboration needs.\n\nThe RIO-PIMS effort focuses on improving collaboration, supporting outreach efforts, and enabling communication among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, the Combatant Commanders, the DSCA, OUSD (Policy), North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) Military Cooperation Division (MCD), the PfP Consortium of Defense Academies, PfP Partner countries, and other designated DoD institutions and communities. It provides DoD and international partner security practitioners a platform to share information, communicate and collaborate, and improve administrative activities. It also provides the ability to form collaborative communities of interest around security issues. RIO- PIMS facilitates information sharing and knowledge management concepts in accordance with U.S. policy. PIMS, as a part of the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996, implements the Congressional endorsement for the modernization of Defense capabilities in eligible PfP countries relative to their telecommunications infrastructure.  RIO-PIMS provides allies and partner countries the ability to collaborate in critical cooperative activities that underpin the spirit of the PfP program.  The program supports PfP coalition initiatives through development of distributive collaboration tools to support aspects of U.S. and NATO-approved PfP cooperative activities.  This support is important to achieve the interoperability\/integration outlined in the Guidance for the Employment of the Force.  RIO-PIMS supports internet-based education and collaboration, exercise simulations, and training center requirements. \n\nRCPAMS provides an integrated student and activities management framework that was designed to complement the capabilities of the Security Assistance Network (SAN).  This interface between the SAN, RCPAMS, and RIO-PIMS provides faculty and students an effective information service to ensure student, activity and alumni management.  Data is shared between the systems ensuring improved data integrity."

RIO-PIMS re-validated all the system functional requirements through global audience research.  It distilled technical requirements from those functional requirements, developed use cases, and created a new information architecture (IA). The technical architecture was examined and determined to be inadequate for the validated requirements and a new technical architecture was developed and deployed.  A new user experience was planned and implemented through a new computer human interface (CHI).  An operational test plan, based on all of the requirements and workflow, was developed and executed by an independent authority.  Deployed system to seven members of the RIO-PIMS community. Moved all of the operational software and data from a Network Operations Center (NOC) in Stuttgart, Germany to a NOC in Ashburn, VA to save cost and increase speed for end users.  Closed multiple security holes found in production system in addition to development activities and achieving DoD milestones.\n\nCompleted the Capabilities Production Document (CPD); and Information Support Plan (ISP) required for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) process. Completed the security accreditation package in order to maintain Mission Assurance Category (MAC) Level 3, Common Criteria EAL-2, and Federal Information Process Standards (FIPS) Security Level 2. \n\nEnsured supported institutions had system providing faculty and students an effective information service to ensure student, activity and alumni management. Validated, tested, and implemented an integrated student and activities management framework called RCPAMS.  This included migrating legacy data from five regional centers and ensuring RCPAMS met or exceeded all functionality.  In addition, planned and executed an interface between the SAN and RCPAMS.  Planned for an interface between RCPAMS and RIO-PIMS. Planned for student nomination form on the GlobalNET platform."

In addition, provide a framework for chat that will include the replacement for the capabilities for Adobe connect to minimize the recurring costs of the VTC capabilities and whiteboarding.\n\nWork with DSCA and OSD-P leaders to identify institutions which need a similar capability.  Work to extend the platform for those institution specific requirements, allowing existing members to avail themselves of the newly developed feature sets.\n\nWork with the integrators of the RCPAMS system to ensure that information is exchanged between RCPAMS and GlobalNET.  This will include the implementation of 1) an automatic provision module allowing information from RCPAMS to populate and provision accounts for eligible participants, 2) participant nomination form, and 3) automatic group enrollment based on course participation.

This extends the exiting capability of responding to system generated notifications by allowing user initiated tasks through plain language submitted in an email.  The system will post all of the content correctly and in a structured format for knowledge management.

The capability would create a native VTC capability inside of the platform allowing much tighter integrations with messaging, file sharing, white boarding, and chatting and reduce the operations and maintenance (O&M) expense of leasing this service.\nWork with the existing platform managers to update the GlobalNET implementation to the newest platform stable release - allowing greater functionality and better security across all members of the platform.\n\nComplete 2013 recertification of security accreditation process that also reflects the new and updated software capabilities as well newly integrated educational organizations.
