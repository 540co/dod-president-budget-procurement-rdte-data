            "val": "Beginning in FY12, PE 0604283F funds the development of the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) which will replace the current legacy AN\/TPS-75 radar.  3DELRR will be the principal USAF long-range, ground-based sensor for detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting aircraft and missiles in support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) through the Ground Theater Air Control System (GTACS).  The primary mission of the 3DELRR will be to provide long-range surveillance, control of aircraft, theater ballistic missile detection, and Combat Identification (CID).  The 3DELRR will respond to the operational need to detect and report highly maneuverable, small radar cross section targets to enable battlespace awareness while at the same time mitigating the reliability, maintainability, and sustainability issues plaguing the AN\/TPS-75 radar system.  The 3DELRR will provide air controllers with a precise, real-time air picture of sufficient quality to conduct close control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions.  In the case of theater missile defense operations, the 3DELRR will have the capability to detect, track, and disseminate target information to respective command and control nodes, such as the Control and Reporting Center (CRC), for warning and engagement.  Similarly, the joint targeting process will benefit from trajectory information provided by the 3DELRR, including launch and impact locations. \n\nThe Pre-EMD efforts of the 3DELRR Program begin in FY12 and continue through FY13.  Acquisition activities during this Pre-EMD effort timeframe will include, but are not limited to, source selection to award multiple contracts, requirements refinement, completion of the preliminary design development, continued software and hardware subsystem-level development, modeling and simulation to support the system development, implementation of mitigation techniques to combat existing and emerging system threats (including cyber warfare), test planning, and implementation of the program protection plan. A Preliminary Design Review (PDR), and Capability Demonstration C Event will be conducted during this timeframe to ensure that the program is successful in the development of a mature preliminary system design.  Activities will also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning as well as finalization of Milestone B documentation and preparation for a Milestone B review.\n\n\nIn FY11 PE 0604283F BMC2 Sensor Development funded the Next Generation Aerial Ground Surveillance Radar strategy development.   The primary mission of Next Generation Radar (NGR) is the development of an Open System Architecture (OSA) specification to guide all future USAF Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) \/Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) development.  NGR will develop an integration environment to define, validate, and verify compliance with the government OSA specification, through analysis and demonstration.  NGR will develop a GMTI\/SAR roadmap that assesses current and future radar technologies to guide future USAF investment strategy.  NGR will provide the USAF a platform-independent OSA radar technology maturation and risk reduction effort.  NGR will enable the future development of OSA prototype radar to allow the rapid fielding of capabilities addressing evolving needs of detection and tracking in support of future requirements and capability gaps.\n\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

The primary mission of the 3DELRR will be to provide long-range surveillance, control of aircraft, theater ballistic missile detection, and Combat Identification (CID).  The 3DELRR will respond to the operational need to detect and report highly maneuverable, small radar cross section targets to enable battlespace awareness while at the same time mitigating the reliability, maintainability, and sustainability issues plaguing the AN\/TPS-75 radar system.  The 3DELRR will provide air controllers with a precise, real-time air picture of sufficient quality to conduct close control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions.  In the case of theater missile defense operations, the 3DELRR will have the capability to detect, track, and disseminate target information to respective command and control nodes, such as the Control and Reporting Center (CRC), for warning and engagement.  Similarly, the joint targeting process will benefit from trajectory information provided by the 3DELRR, including launch and impact locations. \n\nThe Pre-EMD efforts of the 3DELRR Program begin in FY12 and continue through FY13.  Acquisition activities during this Pre-EMD effort timeframe will include, but are not limited to, source selection to award multiple contracts, requirements refinement, completion of the preliminary design development, continued software and hardware subsystem-level development, modeling and simulation to support the system development, implementation of mitigation techniques to combat existing and emerging system threats (including cyber warfare), test planning, and implementation of the program protection plan. A Preliminary Design Review (PDR), and Capability Demonstration C Event will be conducted during this timeframe to ensure that the program is successful in the development of a mature preliminary system design.  Activities will also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning as well as finalization of Milestone B documentation and preparation for a Milestone B review.\n\n\nIn FY11 PE 0604283F BMC2 Sensor Development funded the Next Generation Aerial Ground Surveillance Radar strategy development.   The primary mission of Next Generation Radar (NGR) is the development of an Open System Architecture (OSA) specification to guide all future USAF Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) \/Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) development.  NGR will develop an integration environment to define, validate, and verify compliance with the government OSA specification, through analysis and demonstration.  NGR will develop a GMTI\/SAR roadmap that assesses current and future radar technologies to guide future USAF investment strategy.  NGR will provide the USAF a platform-independent OSA radar technology maturation and risk reduction effort.  NGR will enable the future development of OSA prototype radar to allow the rapid fielding of capabilities addressing evolving needs of detection and tracking in support of future requirements and capability gaps.\n\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."
