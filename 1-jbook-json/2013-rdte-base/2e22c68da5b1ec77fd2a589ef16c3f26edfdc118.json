The NC3 System provides connectivity from the President and the Secretary of Defense through the National Military Command System (NMCS) to nuclear execution forces integral to fighting a \u201chomeland-to-homeland,\u201d as well as theater nuclear war.  MEECN includes the Emergency Action Message (EAM) dissemination systems and those systems used for integrated Tactical Warning\/Attack Assessment (TW\/AA), presidential decision-making conferencing, force report back, re-targeting, force management, and requests for permission to use nuclear weapons.  Efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense, strategic and theater forces, and an informed decision-making linkage between the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Combatant Commands.  MEECN ensures our national leadership has proper command and control of our forces during times of national emergency, up to and including nuclear war.  Reduction or elimination of funding would seriously degrade DISA\u2019s ability to perform the systems engineering functions supporting the maintenance and evolution of MEECN.  DISA would not be able to provide nuclear C3 planning assistance to the Joint Staff, nor perform assessments of the nuclear C3 system."

Systems Analysis supports long range planning and vulnerability assessments to ensure the Nuclear C3 System is adequate under all conditions of stress or war and recommends investment strategies to evolve the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) to achieve desired capabilities.  Operational Assessments of fielded systems and weapon platforms provides the sole means for verification of nuclear C3 systems\u2019 performance in support of plans and procedures, operation orders, training, equipment, and end-to-end system configuration.  Assessments provide strategic and theater level C3 interfaces into the nuclear C3 System.  Supporting efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense and strategic and theater forces.  Systems Engineering provides the Senior Leadership C3 System (SLC3S) with technical and management advice, planning and engineering support, and Test & Evaluation (T&E).  Leading Edge Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) technology is assessed for all communication platforms supporting Executive Travelers and Senior Leaders to include the interoperability of hardware and operational procedures.  These elements support the President's and other DoD command centers and aircraft (e.g., Air Force One and the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC)).  Reduction or elimination of funding would seriously degrade DISA\u2019s ability to perform the systems engineering functions supporting the maintenance and evolution of MEECN.  DISA would not be able to provide nuclear C3 planning assistance to the Joint Staff or NII, nor perform assessments of the nuclear C3 system."
