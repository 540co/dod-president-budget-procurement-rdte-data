These funds are used to advance technical capabilities in mutual areas of interest through focused partnerships and projects with other federal departments and agencies.  In addition to supporting interagency cooperation, this PE incubates selected concepts and technologies of interest to joint warfighters and their interagency partners to provide mature options as capability needs emerge in and beyond the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP).  This includes developing risk-reducing prototypes to demonstrate capabilities in response to joint warfighter and interagency partners\u2019 shared requirements; and informing the Joint Capabilities Integration & Development System (JCIDS) and acquisition system through technical demonstrations.  Individual projects are developed and funded with interagency partners over a two to three year period \u2013 products are demonstrated and fielded in spirals within that project timeline \u2013 and generally do not include stand-alone studies.  Funding for this PE permits support for four to five major projects per year.  Typically, these projects support mid-term irregular warfare needs aligned with those of interagency partners, and often supports near term capability needs in support of the Department\u2019s Rapid Fielding efforts.  This program element has evolved from exclusive support of force transformation activities to the activities described above, more closely aligned with departmental goals.  This PE will transition from PE 0605799D8Z to PE 0603699D8Z in FY 2012."

At smaller, more remote locations, the kinetic response capability is limited only to existing organic weapon systems, which can become overwhelmed; or, to supporting arms which may be unavailable due to weather, competing requirements or Rules of Engagement (ROE).  In addition, mortar crews are routinely exposed to enemy fire and\/or unable to man their system due to enemy action.  The integration of a more robust response capability into detect\/warn\/assess systems will enhance the capability of small units\/FOBs to defend themselves, which in turn enables greater tactical flexibility.  In the near term, this project augmented current kinetic capabilities available to units occupying small FOBs by providing the capability for precision mortar fire.  In the longer term, integrating this system and other weapons with existing and future sensors in order to maximize current capabilities and accelerate the development of future FOB defense technologies.   The EMTS provided rapid, 360 degrees indirect fire capability from a single firing position using an integrated fire control system and an electronic drive which provides auto-laying capability at a traverse rate of 15 degrees per second.  The mortar uses either 120 millimeters or 81 millimeters United States standard mortar tubes and provides an accuracy of 1 percent of range (for example: 30 meters at 3 kilometers).  The project seeks an end state where next generation FOB defense capabilities are integrated with a robust, precise, kinetic response scalable for application to FOBs ranging from sub-platoon to company sized locations."

The goal was to provide a system that is capable of supporting a patrol mission with minimal human interaction, until a target of interest is identified, at which time the system either interrogated the target autonomously with its sensors, or requested operator support for interacting with the target.  There is no other fully functional autonomous unmanned surface vessel (USV) within DOD nor a system by which autonomous unmanned systems are able to act cooperatively.  Unmanned systems represent a large growth area for the warfighter, but currently require a greater logistics and personnel footprint than a similarly capable manned system.  This effort worked with cutting edge technologies to minimize human-machine interaction during the mission phase, while still producing high quality ISR data.  This will reduce manning requirements, allowing the tender vessel\/station to conduct normal operations while the USV is conducting its assigned mission."

Pelican will demonstrate the technical maturity of a scalable vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. Key technologies to be demonstrated include a buoyancy management system to enable ballast-independent operations, composite lightweight rigid external structure, a responsive low-speed\/hover control system, and a ground handling subsystem to enable operations on unimproved landing surfaces.\n\nThe program seeks to reduce risk by integrating and demonstrating a suite of technologies with the potential to reduce operational constraints on future heavy-lift, buoyant-aircraft development programs.  Success may lead to a nascent class of air vehicle which will radically reduce energy use per ton-mile, permit high-payload operations in austere regions with little infrastructure, and enable long-endurance manned or unmanned air operations.  RAVB aircraft appear to be scalable to payloads of 500-1,000 tons (compared with payloads in the 125-ton range for the largest current US cargo aircraft).  In addition, RAVB aircraft may also reduce need for intermodal transportation as cargo moves from origin to point of need, with corresponding reduction in delivery times."
