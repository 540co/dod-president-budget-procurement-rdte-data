The F-22 is a first-of-a-kind multi-mission fighter aircraft that combines stealth, supercruise, advanced maneuverability and integrated avionics to make it the world's most capable combat aircraft.  The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of F-22 acquisition is complete.  The program is now continuing the pre-planned modernization effort through incremental development phases that enhance the F-22 Global Strike capability.  The development program enhances the air vehicle, engine, and training system to improve\/enhance F-22 weapons, communications, and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.  \n\nBA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Several components in the F-22 labs have exceeded their useful life, or have become so difficult to support that they require replacement.  Currently identified items that require replacement include the: Stand-Alone Multi-Engine Real Time Simulator (SMRTS); Operational Flight Program (OFP) Build System; Raptor Integration Lab (RaIL) Communications, Navigation and Identification (CNI) Stimulator; Air Vehicle Systems (AVS) Prime Mission Equipment (PME); Integrated Vehicle System Controller (IVSC) Engineering Test Stand (ETS); Honeywell Environmental Control System (ECS) Lab; BAE Electronic Warfare (EW) Alpha Computers; RaIL Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) Computer Replacement; IL FTE; Crash Survivable Memory Unit (CSMU) Specialized Test Equipment (STE).  Replacement of these systems will be spread between FY12 and FY14 based upon criticality and availability for replacement (opportunity to replace without undue delay to the program), and available funding.  The obsolescence priority list is maintained current based upon historic and current failure rates, lead-time to replace, position on F-22 program critical paths, and identification of new candidates."
