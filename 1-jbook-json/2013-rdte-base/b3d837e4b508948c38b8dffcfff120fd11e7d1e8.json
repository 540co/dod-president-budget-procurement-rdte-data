The program has six projects, each focusing on a technology area critical to the Air Force. The Advanced Propulsion Technology project develops high-speed air breathing propulsion engines to include combined cycle, ramjet, and hypersonic scramjet technologies to enable revolutionary propulsion capability for the Air Force. The Combustion and Mechanical Systems project evaluates lubricants and combustion concepts and technologies for new and existing engines. The Turbine Engine Technology project develops enabling capabilities to enhance performance and affordability of existing weapon systems and develops component technologies for ultra high pressure ratio, substantially improved durability, and adaptive cycle engine architecture to provide optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and life for widely varying mission needs. The Aerospace Power Technology project develops electrical power and thermal management technologies for military applications that are part of energy optimized aircraft development. The Rocket Propulsion Technology project develops advances in rocket propulsion technologies for space access, space maneuver, missiles, the sustainment of strategic systems, and tactical rockets. The Aerospace Fuel Technology project evaluates hydrocarbon-based fuels for legacy and advanced turbine engines, scramjets, pulse detonation, and combined-cycle engines. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. This program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research, since it develops and determines the technical feasibility and military utility of evolutionary and revolutionary technologies."

Applications include missiles, aircraft, and sustained high-speed vehicles. Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis include lubricants, bearings, mechanical systems diagnostics, mechanical systems prognostics, rotordynamics, oil-less engine technology, optical diagnostics, fundamental combustion, detonations, combustors, and afterburners. Lubricants for these engines must be thermally stable, cost-effective, and operate over a broad range of conditions. Advanced combustion concepts must be cost-effective, durable, and reduce pollutant emissions. A portion of this project supports adaptive cycle technologies. This effort develops component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance\/fuel efficiency for widely varying mission needs."

Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis are propellants, propellant management, combustion, rocket material applications, technology for sustainment of strategic systems, and innovative space propulsion concepts. Technologies of interest will improve reliability, performance, survivability, affordability, and environmental compatibility of these systems. Technologies are developed to reduce the weight and cost of components using new materials and improved designs and manufacturing techniques. All efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion industry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire Department of Defense. Technologies developed under this program enable capabilities of interest to both the Department of Defense and NASA. Efforts include modeling and simulation, proof of concept tests of critical components, advanced component development, and ground-based tests. Aging and surveillance efforts could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by 50 percent, enabling motor replacement for cause."

Applications include missiles, aircraft, sustained high-speed vehicles, and responsive space launch. Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis include evaluations of fuel properties and characteristics of alternative fuels developed from unconventional sources (such as coal, natural gas, biomass, and combinations thereof), unique\/alternate fuels and components used in integrated thermal and energy management systems including high heat sink fuel capability, fuels logistics and associated vulnerabilities, and combustion diagnostics and engine emissions measurements."
