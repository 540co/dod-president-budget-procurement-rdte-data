The current efforts of Eglin, Haystack Ultra-wideband Satellite Imaging Radar (HUSIR), Ground-based Electro Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS),  and Globus II are representative of sensor systems upgraded in the SLEP project.  As the need arises in the execution year, funds in this project may be used to begin sensor life extension programs on additional efforts.  These efforts are in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because they develop modifications for operational SSA sensors."

This effort is classified as applied research under that contract.  MIT\/LL transferred ownership of the radar to the Air Force but continues to operate it as part of its Lincoln Space Surveillance Complex as per contract with the Air Force.  MIT\/LL will be responsible for operations and sustainment of the upgraded Haystack radar. The upgrade effort is scheduled to complete in FY13.\n\nThe GEODSS SLEP was awarded as an option on the System Engineering and Sustainment Integrator (SENSOR) contract, competitively awarded to ITT Corporation (now Exelis) in 2002.
