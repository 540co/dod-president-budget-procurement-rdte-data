Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, and future program planning.   This program also provides the ability for other COCOMs to conduct CNO planning.   The USCYBERCOM accomplishes part of its mission via systems engineering, testing and development across the primary functions of technical assurance, risk assessments, requirements management, capability development, and gap analysis.  The technical assurance function provides world-class \"assurance-in-depth\" products and services enabling COCOMs to confidently, legally, safely, and securely apply CNO capabilities as one of the elements of national power.  Further detail is classified and can be provided upon request.\n \nUSCYBERCOM provides support for US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and other geographic and functional COCOM exercises, war games, and experimentation requirements. USCYBERCOM integrates and synchronizes its effort with the USSTRATCOM development of CNO military utility assessments, research, and development efforts, and advocacy of capability needs for the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System (JCIDS) process.\n\nUSCYBERCOM supports the Information Operations (IO) community by providing a cadre of experts on CNO technology use, and renders technical assistance in the development, review and coordination of CNO plans and operations.\n\nUSCYBERCOM coordinates CNO capability research and development in order to achieve global military objectives. USCYBERCOM specifically is responsible for advocating on behalf of the COCOMs for CNO capability development.  It is also responsible for partnering with the CNO development community to seek resource advocacy from USSTRATCOM, and fund CNO capability development with service sponsorship and coordination.  Additionally, USCYBERCOM focuses capability developer's efforts on addressing COCOM requirements, fosters collaboration between OCO\/DCO developers, intelligence providers, and operational planners to shorten the development cycle, transfers end-result capabilities to service components, and supports research and development of OCO\/DCO capabilities for the conduct operational planning activities.\n\nUSCYBERCOM supports research and development of OCO\/DCO capabilities based upon COCOM and USCYBERCOM operational requirements to include supporting and conducting quick reaction development of OCO\/DCO capabilities in support of OCO\/DCO operations as required.  A small in-house development team will perform research as required to support this mission.  The Special Projects, Vulnerability Assessment Team provides analytical support to exploitable vulnerabilities.  Additionally, this team will \"re-tool\" existing OCO\/DCO capabilities to satisfy immediate USCYBERCOM operational needs.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, and future program planning.   This program also provides the ability for other COCOMs to conduct CNO planning.   The USCYBERCOM accomplishes part of its mission via systems engineering, testing and development across the primary functions of technical assurance, risk assessments, requirements management, capability development, and gap analysis.  The technical assurance function provides world-class \"assurance-in-depth\" products and services enabling COCOMs to confidently, legally, safely, and securely apply CNO capabilities as one of the elements of national power.  Further detail is classified and can be provided upon request.\n \nUSCYBERCOM provides support for US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and other geographic and functional COCOM exercises, war games, and experimentation requirements. USCYBERCOM integrates and synchronizes its effort with the USSTRATCOM development of CNO military utility assessments, research, and development efforts, and advocacy of capability needs for the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System (JCIDS) process.\n\nUSCYBERCOM supports the Information Operations (IO) community by providing a cadre of experts on CNO technology use, and renders technical assistance in the development, review and coordination of CNO plans and operations.\n\nUSCYBERCOM coordinates CNO capability research and development in order to achieve global military objectives. USCYBERCOM specifically is responsible for advocating on behalf of the COCOMs for CNO capability development.  It is also responsible for partnering with the CNO development community to seek resource advocacy from USSTRATCOM, and fund CNO capability development with service sponsorship and coordination.  Additionally, USCYBERCOM focuses capability developer's efforts on addressing COCOM requirements, fosters collaboration between OCO\/DCO developers, intelligence providers, and operational planners to shorten the development cycle, transfers end-result capabilities to service components, and supports research and development of OCO\/DCO capabilities for the conduct operational planning activities.\n\nUSCYBERCOM supports research and development of OCO\/DCO capabilities based upon COCOM and USCYBERCOM operational requirements to include supporting and conducting quick reaction development of OCO\/DCO capabilities in support of OCO\/DCO operations as required.  A small in-house development team will perform research as required to support this mission.  The Special Projects, Vulnerability Assessment Team provides analytical support to exploitable vulnerabilities.  Additionally, this team will \"re-tool\" existing OCO\/DCO capabilities to satisfy immediate USCYBERCOM operational needs.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
