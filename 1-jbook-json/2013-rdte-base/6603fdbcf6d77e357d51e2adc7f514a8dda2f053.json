Disposition of certification requirements for all USAF Commercial Derivative Aircraft (CDA) using the HRJ fuel blend will be accomplished.  Evaluation of infrastructure, toxicology, ESOH, and fire suppression effectiveness of the HRJ blend will be completed.  Acquisition of supplemental quantities of HRJ fuels is also planned (as required).  MIL-HDBK-510 will be revised and published.  \n\nAn F-16 Field Service Evaluations (FSEs) using the HRJ blend is being conducted to verify extended operational use durability. \n\nTransportation and storage of fuel for test locations will be accomplished including associated management and support costs. \n\nPhase I of the ATJ pathway is underway and includes the purchase of approximately 11K gallons of RDT&E fuel stocks and a feasibility demonstration of an A-10 Weapon System (flight test, materials, engine, sub-systems, etc)."
