BEIS provides solutions to these goals by:\n- Establishing the authoritative source for Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) values and providing for standardization by implementing SFIS and United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) compliant financial reporting capabilities for Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports.\n- Providing an enterprise-wide information environment that will serve as the single source for enterprise-wide financial information.\n- Serving as the DoD-wide system for Treasury Reporting.\n- Providing decision makers with significantly greater access to financial information through data visibility and business intelligence (e.g., Executive Dashboard).\nThe BEIS functional baseline encompasses a family of services organized into six distinct lines of business:\n- Financial Reporting Services: BEIS will provide SFIS compliant financial statements and budgetary reports for DoD.\n- Cash Accountability Reporting Services: BEIS will provide SFIS compliant reports of the Department\u2019s cash position to the Treasury.\n- Enterprise Level Business Intelligence Services: BEIS will provide data aggregation services, collecting select transaction level data from DoD systems of record\nto support business intelligence. BEIS will also deliver corporate business intelligence capabilities such as contingency reporting, status of funds reporting and\nmanagement dashboards.\n- Integration Support Services: This support will be funded by the requesting activity on a fee-for-service basis.\n- Reference Data Services: BEIS will establish a centralized repository for maintaining and exposing referential data to the DoD enterprise. This encompasses the\nSFIS Library data, Master Appropriation data, Corporate Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) data, and the Transportation Global Edit Table data.\n- General Ledger Services: BEIS will provide general ledger (i.e., financial management information) services for USSOCOM and select Defense Agencies.\nImpact: BEIS will provide DoD enterprise-wide financial visibility to meet Enterprise Transition Plan milestones. It will serve as the centralized financial data source and the single source for enterprise Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports. Through the BEIS enterprise business intelligence capability, DoD decision makers will gain improved visibility into the information they need to make strategic budget decisions. The BEIS financial management capabilities will be used by the Military Services, Defense Agencies, and the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). Modernization efforts for the functionality identified for BEIS Family of Systems (FoS) Increment 1 was completed in FY10. However, there are further enhancements\/product improvements required to accomplish deployment\/implementation of BEIS Increment 1 capabilities in order to achieve Full Operating Capability (FOC), as well as additional modernization efforts associated with BEIS Increment II capability which require out-year funding."

BEIS formally implemented a portfolio management approach to program management that helped to ensure a management strategy was in place to better reallocate assets within the portfolio. BEIS has and will continue to deliver needed capabilities more rapidly and efficiently using a Family of Systems concept providing a functional baseline organized into six distinct lines of business: General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, Enterprise Level Business Intelligence Services, Cash Accountability and Reporting Services, and Financial Reporting Services. Capabilities are being developed incrementally with multiple releases per year to meet the Enterprise Transition Plan milestones provided to Congress. At end of FY11, BEIS has achieved FOC for the following system components\/services: DCD\/DCW, to include General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, and Enterprise Level Business Intelligence Services.  Based on the list of requirements, an overall schedule is produced which includes integrated activities as well as identified products and milestones. Contracts are competitively awarded to keep costs down. Intra-governmental services are being used where possible for infrastructure support by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Technical Services Organization and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Information Processing Center."

DAI will transform the budget, finance, and accounting operations of the participating Defense Agencies to achieve accurate and reliable financial information for financial accountability and efficient decision making. The DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that effectively addresses the requirements depicted in such tools as the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product. The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a .mil environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 100,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions to support the warfighter.\n\nDAI will implement a compliant COTS business solution with common business processes and data standards for the following business functions:  procure to pay; order to cash; acquire to retire; budget to report; cost accounting; as well as time and labor.  Grants financial management, budget formulation, and re-sales accounting will be implemented by full Deployment. The Defense Agencies are committed to leveraging their resources and talents to build an integrated system that supports standardized processes and proves that the DoD is capable of using a single architecture and foundation to support multiple, diverse components.\n\nThe benefits of DAI are:\n- Common business processes and data standards;\n- Access to real-time financial data transactions;\n- Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;\n- Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities;\n- Standardized line of accounting with the use of Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS); and\n- Use of USSGL Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.\n\nThe system integration services for the DAI will include the following:\nProject management; Blueprinting; Design, Build, and Unit Test; Reports, Interfaces, Conversion, Extensions (RICE); Testing (integration, functional, performance, conversion, security, user acceptance, operational); End-User Training\/Change Management; System Deployment; Conversion; Information Assurance; Sustainment; Data Service; Help Desk Support; Studies and Analysis Support; and Site Surveys."

The DISS mission is to consolidate the DoD security mission into an Enterprise System that will automate the implementation of improved national investigative and adjudicative standards to eliminate costly and inefficient work processes and increase information collaboration across the community. DISS is currently under development and will replace the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS), a legacy system. When fully deployed this will be a secure, authoritative source for the management, storage and timely dissemination of and access to personnel clearances with the flexibility to provide additional support structure for future DoD security process growth. When deployed, it will accelerate the clearance process, reduce security clearance vulnerabilities, decrease back-end processing timelines, and support simultaneous information sharing within various DoD entities as well as among a number of authorized federal agencies. DISS will provide improved support to the Insider Threat and Personal Identity programs and will be comprised of capabilities that are currently part of the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) and will create a robust and real-time capability for all DoD participants in the Military Departments, and DoD Agencies. It will also include automated records check (ARC) functionality and the creation of an adjudicative case management capability with e-Adjudication functionality. DISS will also provide the following operational capabilities - single point of entry for: personnel security, adjudicative case management, and decision support functionality to all DoD adjudicators. DISS will provide near continuous intra-Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) communications on a web-based enabled platform utilizing a unified architecture with security management.\n\nThe DISS program specifically addresses the requirements of Section 3001(e)  of PL 108-458, Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA).  Additionally the DISS program supports the FY12 DoD Strategic Management Plan (SMP)'s Business Goal 6: \"Re-engineer \/ use end-to-end business processes to reduce transaction times, drive down costs, and improve service.\""

VIPS will enable a responsive, flexible and efficient means to qualify Applicants to meet manpower resource requirements for the uniformed Services, Coast Guard, and National Guard routine and contingency operations. VIPS will be the future accessioning system to be used by the US Military Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM) and will replace their legacy system, USMEPCOM Integrated Resource System (USMIRS). USMEPCOM serves as the single entry point for determining the physical, aptitude, and conduct qualifications of candidates for enlistment. VIPS will provide the capability to electronically acquire, process, store, secure, and seamlessly share personnel data across the Accessions Community of Interest (ACOI). When fully implemented, VIPS will reduce the cycle time required to induct enlistees to meet the needs of Homeland Defense, reduce the number of visits to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS), reduce manual data entry errors, and reduce attrition through better pre-screening practices. GAO has reported that better pre-screening practices will yield cost savings and cost avoidance of $83M per year for the VIPS automated elements, when Increment 2.0 is deployed.  The overall annual estimated cost avoidance is $479M across the DoD as referenced in the 1997 GAO Study 97-39 Military Attrition: DoD could save Millions by Better Screening Enlisted Personnel.  The implementation of a Modular Open System Architecture (MOSA) approach will enable accession data to be securely available to applicants and ACOI partners such as Recruiting and Training Commands, Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), Military Health System, Human Resource Management (HRM), and Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO). VIPS will support compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) direction for a net-centric environment and take advantage of automated data capture technology, e.g., medical equipment with the capability to capture and electronically transmit exam results. The accessioning system of the future will be location independent, virtually paper-free, and automated to assist with bringing the right people at the right time to operational commanders. The VIPS Program has not yet been baselined."

The revised Increment 1.0 content provides sufficient capability to retire the legacy system, USMEPCOM Integrated Resource System (USMIRS) through a series of capability deployments beginning in FY2014. Future increments will address the full VIPS capabilities necessary to realize the Return on Investment (ROI).\n\nOriginally the VIPS Increment 1.0 was procured under a single contract, competitively awarded to provide both a core infrastructure and business functions to support the accessions process. The VIPS PMO awarded a single Increment 1.0 contract on September 30, 2010 that will initially provide for the design of VIPS Increment 1.0 through PDR. The prime contractor also completed the design, development, and acceptance testing of the ROC prototype. Once the CCR report is completed, the program will seek a Milestone B decision. Following a successful Milestone B decision, the Government will assess appropriate contracting options to complete design, testing, deployment, fielding and training support. The system integration will include management of the technical configuration baseline and sustainment across VIPS. The VIPS PMO has adopted rigorous cost controls using earned value management and a comprehensive risk management program to manage program execution."

It is mandated for use by all DoD Services and\nAgencies for electronic invoicing by DFAR 252.232-7003. WAWF processes over 86 million transactions worth $301B per year and saves DoD millions of dollars\nannually in processing cost and avoided interest (over $77.6 M in FY10). WAWF brings together the invoice, the receiving report, and the contract from EDA to provide the accounting and entitlement systems with the three-way match needed to authorize payment. WAWF is also the Enterprise data entry point for the Item Unique Identifier (IUID) and Government Furnished Property (GFP) programs, the source of receipt and acceptance data for Service Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERP), and is central for the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) enterprise solutions for Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) and Inter Governmental Transfer (IGT). The benefits to DoD are a single face to industry suppliers, global accessibility of documents, reduced need for re-keying, improved data accuracy, real-time processing, secure transactions with audit capability, and faster processing resulting in reduced interest penalties. For vendors, benefits include the capability to electronically submit invoices, reduction of lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contract payment records."

Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place.  \n\nWithin the current OUSD(C) environment, the Directorates have a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems.  This lack of standardization and integration limits the visibility of funding information, introduces manual efforts and undue complexities into the management of budget authority, and impedes the flow of funding documents.  This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous.  The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions.   \n\nThe envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow.  Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data.  Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.\n\nThe operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment.  The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding."
