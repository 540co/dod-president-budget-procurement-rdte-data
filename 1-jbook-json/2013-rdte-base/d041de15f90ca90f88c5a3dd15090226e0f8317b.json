            "val": "The Combat Identification (CID) Technology program element analyzes, develops, demonstrates and evaluates promising target identification technologies to facilitate platform transition decisions prior to System Development and Demonstration (SDD).  Numerous joint needs statements, operational documents, lessons learned, and NATO requirements state the need for positive CID.  High confidence CID increases combat effectiveness, prevents fratricide, and reduces collateral damage.  It also enables combatant commanders to effectively command and control their forces in all weather, day or night.  This program element focuses on the cooperative and non-cooperative technologies that have the capability to positively identify surface and air targets in both air-to-surface and air-to-air engagements.  \n\nIn order to rapidly make available promising CID technologies for platform SDD decisions, the program element funds design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, and other efforts associated with integration and modification of CID related technologies and systems on platforms.  It also supports the development, testing, and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, Allied, and coalition interoperability.  \n\nNon-cooperative CID employs a number of sensing technologies and signal processing techniques.  The observations may be compared to a database of known objects to identify surface or air threats from air platforms.  These technologies include: (1) Laser Vision, an Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) imaging system that significantly increases ID ranges and includes exploiting synergies between non-cooperative and cooperative identification systems (radio, millimeter wave, infrared, and laser). The Laser Vision Program is working on performance improvements, laser vibrometry development, 3-dimensional laser detection and ranging, laser radar, Synthetic Aperture Laser (SAL) radar, hyper spectral phenomenology exploitation, aided\/automatic target recognition, image fusion and studies to support decisions on future EO\/IR technologies; (2) Radar Vision, an air-to-ground radar imaging technique to identify stationary and moving targets using their radar signatures; (3) Hydra Vision (formerly Fusion Vision), a balanced (robust) amalgamation of sensor data from multiple sources to provide warfighters with higher confidence CID results on surface or air targets potentially including fusion with intelligence sources,  identification of non-traditional targets, fusion to counter camouflage, concealment and deception (CCD), and multi-phenomenology features for sustainable databases and (4) X-Patch, a validated set of prediction codes and analysis tools that use the Shooting-and-Bouncing Ray (SBR) method to predict realistic far-field radar signatures from 3D target models in order to predict 1D and\/or 2D data.  X-Patch is vital for development of radar signatures of potential high-threat weapons systems; it is a critical capability of database production centers which support Joint Sensors Signature Database (JSSD) pathfinders.  \n\nCooperative CID employs technologies required to rapidly identify friendly platforms.  The program develops, integrates and evaluates technologies that provide AF platforms with a means of positively identifing an air or ground platform as a friendly, via active or passive cooperative ID capabilities.  Development funded by this program element ensures availability of a Mode 5 upgrade path for implementing ground and air platforms across the Air Force fleet.  Within the air-to-air domain, programs funded to meet this intent include: (1) Mode 5 Technology Insertion Program (TIP): The program element funds preliminary RDT&E for Mark XIIA, the next generation Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) standard for the DoD and NATO.  Mark XIIA represents a substantial enhancement to the Mark XII IFF system.  It is expected to achieve joint initial operational capability in 2014.  The \"A\" denotes the addition of Mode 5 (an encrypted challenge-and-reply mode) to the other Mark XII system modes (Modes 1, 2, 3\/A, C, S, and 4).  The Mode 5 secure IFF program is a DoD-wide, Navy-led development and acquisition program.  The Mode 5 TIP specifically addresses implementing air platforms.  (2) Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)TIP:  This program element will fund preliminary RDT&E for integration of ADS-B architecture into the APX-119 Mark XIIA transponder. The ADS-B TIP will develop ADS-B \"In\" and \"Out\" capability which leverages synergies between ADS-B and Mode 5 Level 2 (M5L2) to achieve M5L2 \"In\" capability.  The ADS-B TIP specifically addresses implementing air platforms. (3) Digital IFF Control Panel: This program element is developing a Digital IFF Control Panel (DCP) to support Mode 5 and ADS-B insertion programs into Air Force platforms with an Aeronautics Research Incorporated (ARINC)  429 based avionics architecture.  The DCP will provide a standard control panel for AF aircraft with growth capability for ADS-B and beyond.  \n\nWithin the air-to-ground domain, development funded by this program element ensures development, integration, test and evaluation of friendly identification systems focused on reducing air-to-ground fratricide.  A potential program to meet this intent includes:  (1) Radio Based Combat Identification:  An active challenge reply system leveraging Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) capable ground and aircraft targeting pod mounted radios for air-to-ground friendly identification. \n \nThis program element also funds the Air Traffic Control Beacon Systems Identification Friend or Foe Mark XII\/XIIA Systems (AIMS) Program Office.  The DoD International AIMS PO has system level interoperability management responsibilities for the present Mark XII system, development and integration of Mark XIIA (Mode 5) and transition to Mark XIIA Mode S systems. \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

The observations may be compared to a database of known objects to identify surface or air threats from air platforms.  These technologies include: (1) Laser Vision, an electro-optical\/infrared (EO\/IR) imaging system that significantly increases identification ranges and includes exploiting synergies between non-cooperative and cooperative ID systems (radio, millimeter wave, infrared, and laser). The Laser Vision Program is working on performance improvements, laser vibrometry development, 3-dimensional laser detection and ranging, laser radar, synthetic aperture laser (SAL) radar, hyper spectral phenomenology exploitation, aided\/automatic target recognition, image fusion and studies to support decisions on future EO\/IR technologies; (2) Radar Vision, an air-to-ground radar imaging technique to identify stationary and moving targets using their radar signatures; (3) Hydra Vision (formerly Fusion Vision), a balanced (robust) amalgamation of sensor data from multiple sources to provide warfighters with higher confidence CID results on surface or air targets potentially including fusion with intelligence sources,  identification of non-traditional targets, fusion to counter camouflage, concealment and deception (CCD), and multi-phenomenology features for sustainable databases; and (4) X-Patch, a validated set of prediction codes and analysis tools that use the shooting-and-bouncing ray (SBR) method to predict realistic far-field radar signatures from 3D target models in order to predict 1D and\/or 2D data.  X-Patch is vital for development of radar signatures of potential high-threat weapons systems; it is a critical capability of database production centers which support Joint Sensors Signature Database (JSSD) pathfinders. \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

The program develops, integrates and evaluates technologies that provide AF platforms with a means of positively identifying an air or ground platform as a friendly, via active or passive cooperative identification capabilities.  Development funded by this program element ensures availability of a Mode 5 upgrade path for implementing ground and air platforms across the Air Force fleet.  Within the air-to-air domain, programs funded to meet this intent include: (1) Mode 5 Technology Insertion Program (TIP): The Program Element (PE) funds preliminary RDT&E for Mark XIIA, the next generation Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) standard for the DoD and NATO.  Mark XIIA represents a substantial enhancement to the Mark XII IFF system.  It is expected to achieve Joint Initial Operational Capability in 2014.  The \"A\" denotes the addition of Mode 5 (an encrypted challenge-and-reply mode) to the other Mark XII system modes (Modes 1, 2, 3\/A, C, S, and 4).  The Mode 5 secure IFF program is a DoD-wide, Navy-led development and acquisition program.  The Mode 5 TIP specifically addresses implementing air platforms.  (2) Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Technology Insertion Program (TIP):  This PE will fund preliminary RDT&E for integration of ADS-B architecture into the APX-119 Mark XIIA transponder. The ADS-B TIP will develop ADS-B \"In\" and \"Out\" capability which leverages synergies between  ADS-B and Mode 5 Level 2 (M5L2) to achieve M5L2 \"In\" capability.  The ADS-B TIP specifically addresses implementing air platforms. (3) Digital IFF Control Panel: This PE is developing a Digital IFF Control Panel (DCP) to support Mode 5 and ADS-B insertion programs into Air Force platforms with an ARINC 429 based avionics architecture.  The DCP will provide a standard control panel for AF aircraft with built in capability for IFF support of ADS-B and beyond.  \n\nWithin the air-to-ground domain, development funded by this program element ensures development, integration, test and evaluation of friendly identification systems focused on reducing air-to-ground fratricide.  A potential program to meet this intent includes:  (1) Radio Based Combat Identification:  An active challenge reply system leveraging Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) capable ground and aircraft targeting pod mounted radios for air-to-ground friendly identification. \n\nThis PE also funds the Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon Systems Identification Friend or Foe Mark XII\/XIIA System (AIMS) Program Office.  The DoD International AIMS PO has system level interoperability management responsibilities for the present Mark XII system, development and integration of Mark XIIA (Mode 5) and transition to Mark XIIA Mode S systems.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."
