The program provides integrated logistics support for aircraft at selected field activities; provides depot-level rework of aircraft, engines, and components for the Navy inventory of RDT&E aircraft; and provides support for ships and aircraft bailed to contractors for Navy RDT&E projects. Costs covered under this element include aircrew training and proficiency, fuel, supplies, equipment, repair, Aviation Depot Level Repairables, overhaul of ships and aircraft, as well as organizational, intermediate, and depot maintenance of ships and aircraft in the Navy RDT&E inventory."

This consolidated AW SSD test and evaluation approach meets the Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) (PRA is defined as a required surface ship defense against Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles), Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) testing requirements as outlined in Air Warfare Ship Self Defense Enterprise TEMP 1714, and lead\/operational ship testing requirements for ESSM TEMP 1471, RAM Blk 2 TEMP 286-1, DDG 1000 TEMP 1560, CVN 78 TEMP 1610, CEC TEMP 1415, SSDS TEMP 1400, LHA 6 TEMP 1697, AN\/SPQ-9B TEMP 1463, SEWIP TEMP 1658 (Block 1A), 0686, and LCS TEMP 1695.\n\nLHA 6 acquisition, installation and testing supports all big deck Amphibs and Carriers in the OA configuration as well as RAM BLK 2 OPEVAL, SSDS OA with RAM BLK 2, First non AEGIS SEWIP and ESSM.\n\nThe T&E Enterprise merges common ship, element, and system requirements into the least number of test events while leveraging planned Combat System Ship Qualification Trials (CSSQTs) to accomplish Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) requirements. All tests on the SDTS require the sharing of infrastructure, missile range allocations, execution time and underway time to eliminate duplicative testing. \n\nT&E Enterprise preserves end-to-end mission Operational Testing in a realistic operational environment, capitalizing on Probability of Raid Annihilation M&S data validated with results of that Operational Testing, and ensuring a consistent approach across ship classes. Applicability of all test events is beneficial across multiple ship classes with the same variation under test.\n\nThe T&E Enterprise acquires equipment (FY10-12) for installation onboard the SDTS (FY11-14), conducts test and evaluation on the SDTS and lead\/operational ships (FY10-18) and satisfies the Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) Testbed Model Development and test execution requirements (FY10-18)."
