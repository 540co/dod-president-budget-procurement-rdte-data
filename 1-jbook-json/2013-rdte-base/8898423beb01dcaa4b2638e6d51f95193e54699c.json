It focuses on areas in the social sciences that are of strategic importance to U.S. national security policy which have not been substantially pursued in the past.  The Minerva research effort will be performed to understand the internal military-political dynamics of repressive regimes, the vulnerabilities of regimes and institutions to various kinds of influence and instability, the nature of crowd dynamics, the potential to influence public opinions and attitudes in diverse cultures, cultural effects on network security and military operations, the influence of technology on military capabilities of potential adversaries and allies, and other intersections of social-cultural issues with military activities.  Predictive models and other analysis tools will be developed.  Leveraging the expertise in the social sciences within the academic community is needed to provide understanding of the roots of terrorist organizations and the challenges and opportunities for military operations in a culturally diverse environment.  Better understanding at a fundamental level and new computational tools will provide a beneficial impact on war fighting capabilities at the national policy, military strategy, operational, and tactical levels, and will enhance the capabilities of intelligence activities at all levels.  All research results will be open source.\n\nIn FY11, this project consolidated efforts that were initiated under PE 0601103A, Project D55. Existing grants on the studies of the strategic impact of religious and cultural change in the Muslim world; Iraqi perspectives; and studies of terrorist organizations and ideologies; and new approaches to understanding dimensions of national security, conflict and cooperation from that project will be continued in FY12.\n\nBeginning in FY12, new research activities related to Minerva Outreach and In-House capability are funded though the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project will is performed by the Army Research Office."

It focuses on areas in the social sciences of strategic importance to U.S. national security policy. It seeks to increase the Department's intellectual capital in the social sciences and improve its ability to address future challenges and build bridges between the Department and the social science community. Minerva will bring together universities, research institutions, and individual scholars and support multidisciplinary and cross-institutional projects addressing specific topic areas determined by the Department. Proposals have been solicited that address the following topics:  Chinese Military and Technology Research and Archive Programs; Studies of the Strategic Impact of Religious and Cultural Changes within the Islamic World; Iraqi Perspectives Project; Studies of Terrorist Organization and Ideologies; New Approaches to Understanding Dimensions of National Security, Conflict, and Cooperation."
