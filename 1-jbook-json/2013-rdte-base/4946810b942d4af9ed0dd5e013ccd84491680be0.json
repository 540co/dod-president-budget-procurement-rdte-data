The program aims to improve existing technologies for: mine\/UXO detection, technical survey\/area reduction, mechanical mine\/UXO and vegetation clearance, mine neutralization, individual deminer protection, and post-clearance quality assurance (QA).

This approach is required due to the immediate need for new demining technologies in the face of ongoing U.S. forces and host nation citizen casualties in mine-affected countries.  The program evaluates prototype equipment by acquiring it off-the-shelf from industry using competition to the extent possible, by leveraging ongoing countermine R&D efforts in other U.S. and foreign R&D activities, and by taking advantage of extensive in-house fabrication capabilities at the Army's Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Division (NVESD)."
