Technologies in the PE support the continued development of technologies in Budget Activity 3 and 4 (PEs 0603711D8Z and 0603709D8Z) for technology transitions and transformations and closing war fighter requirement capability gaps. By exercising its oversight role through a technology advisory board, O-6 Council and Senior Steering Group (Flag level), Joint Ground Robotics applies this PE to enable coordination between the Services and places emphasis on interoperability and commonality among unmanned ground systems. This PE supports the effort to overcome technology barriers in thrust areas of unmanned ground system technologies to include Autonomous & Tactical Behaviors, Manipulation Technologies, Collaborative Operations, Interoperability, Man-portable Unmanned Ground System Technologies, and Technology Transition\/Transformation.  The purpose is to further the development and fielding of affordable and effective mobile ground robotic systems, develop and transition technologies necessary to meet evolving user requirements, and serve as a catalyst for insertion of robotic systems and technologies into the force structure.  Through application of funds against the thrust areas of unmanned ground system technologies, this PE supports the integration of technologies into representative models or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment and expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational use. Emphasis is on proving component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major and complex systems and may involve risk reduction initiatives. Within this PE, funded efforts will continue the delivery of advanced technology needs directed at enhancing the war fighters' capabilities identified during concept development, operational assessments and field feedback of current unmanned systems."

The proposed solution will be a sensor-fused approach to integrate the Talon UGV with Idaho National Lab\u2019s robotics intelligence kernel (RIK) Iris recognition and personnel identification and explosives detection. This integrated sensor approach will enable the Talon to semi-autonomously perform several remote checkpoint tasks yet allow operator intervention when needed, especially to employ systems to delay or deny hostile personnel.  The project will result in a capstone demonstration as well as a final report.\n      -  Finalized and delivered system design drawings\n      -  Delivered complete user\u2019s manual\n      -  Conducted Capstone Demonstration\n      -  Delivered final report with results of the overall project as well as the results from the Demonstration\n\n2)  Man-Portable ISR Robot - A current challenge for military ground forces is providing sustained intelligence gathering, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) in remote, ungoverned, denied, and\/or isolated environments.   Highlighting the importance of this high-priority need, the Department of Defense Joint Requirements Oversight Counsel has identified \u201cprovide persistent surveillance in ungoverned\/denied areas\u201d as the second item on its current list of most pressing military issues.  This need is of particular relevance in relation to the IED problem in Iraq, but is also a global requirement to support the War on Terrorism, as well as counter-narcotic and boundary enforcement operations in multiple areas of responsibility.  The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate a prototype unmanned system capable of providing sustained reconnaissance and surveillance in remote and\/or denied areas. This project will develop a prototype UGV with enhanced capabilities that specifically support persistent surveillance and reconnaissance applications. It will have a power system to support 72-hour endurance, communication to support long-range operation, an integrated sensor suite, and low light color cameras to perform night surveillance.\n      -  Integrated new EMCCD cameras\n      -  Integrated new pan and tilt unit\n      -  Integrated Velodyne LIDAR\n      -  Conducted military user trials\n\n3)  Cargo Unmanned Ground Vehicle - The goal of this project is to determine the feasibility of reducing the exposure of Marines to lethal attacks by replacing a portion of the manned vehicles in logistics convoys with unmanned vehicles.  Two Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacements (MTVRs) will be autonomized, and a third MTVR will be equipped with an Operator Control Unit (OCU).
