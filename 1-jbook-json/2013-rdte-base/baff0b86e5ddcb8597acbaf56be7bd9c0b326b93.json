            "val": "The successful integration of space-based capabilities into the core of U.S. national security operations has resulted in dramatically increased demand for and dependence upon space capabilities. As a result, U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) identified three needs: 1) to rapidly augment existing space capabilities when needed to expand operational capability; 2) to rapidly reconstitute\/replenish critical space capabilities to preserve \u201ccontinuity of operations\u201d capability; 3) to rapidly exploit and infuse space technological or operational innovations to increase U.S. advantage. \n\nSince the ORS standup in 2007, the terms resiliency and responsiveness in association with space programs are now seen in almost every policy and guidance document, not just at the DoD level, but at a National level as well.  Resilience has become a key criterion in evaluating alternative architectures, including cost-effective space system protection, hosting payloads on a mix of platforms in various orbits, drawing on distributed international and commercial partner capabilities, and developing and maturing responsive space capabilities.  We are transitioning the activities of the ORS program, and synergistically applying its efforts to other space technology efforts.\n\nThis refocused effort will integrate the operationally responsive space efforts, principles and activities into the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC).  SMC will then be better able to develop various enablers to ensure resilience, survivability and flexibility and to explore space mission augmentation options.  SMC will also be better positioned to incorporate responsive and resilient R&D efforts into other platforms.\n\nThe Department of Defense will support the new approach by developing architectures for space mission areas that will include international cooperation and commercial solutions  and will also look at how space missions are sustained and augmented to support the warfighter in all contingencies.  This strategy will also integrate the lessons learned from the ORS program office\u2019s accomplishments into existing space programs of record.  The end result of the program\u2019s termination will be that operationally responsive space activities are fully integrated into SMC\u2019s ongoing architectures and Space Modernization Initiative, increasing resilience and flexibility in space systems.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 04, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, because the efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes, and prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic environment."

ORS Common Services works with Joint Force Commanders (JFC) and the Services to identify the most likely emergent space needs, make plans and preparations to meet those needs, evaluate results of operational experimentation, and prepare plans and procedures for operational employment and transition.  These foundational activities ensure ORS enabler investments are optimally targeted to quickly mature ORS's ability to execute rapid responses to time-critical needs when they arise.  Common Services identifies and presents options for concepts\/solutions and experimentation including international efforts, conducts concepts development, solutions assessment, rapid evaluation of alternatives, experimentation planning, modeling and simulation, and develops budgetary recommendations for ORS solutions."

The additional ORS Office efforts of maturing enabling elements will be descoped and the knowledge base will be transitioned as appropriate to other space programs including Global Positioning System, Advanced EHF Milsatcom, Space Based Infrared System, Space Control Technology, and the rest of the space architecture.\n\nORS is working with the University of Hawaii\u2019s (U of H) Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory (HSFL) and Sandia National Laboratory on the Low Earth Orbit Nanosatellite Integrated Defense Autonomous Systems (LEONIDAS) program.
