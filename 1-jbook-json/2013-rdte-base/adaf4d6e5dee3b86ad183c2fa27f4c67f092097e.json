SLAMRAAM is a day or night, adverse weather, non-line-of-sight system that counters cruise missiles (CM), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), fixed wing and rotary wing threats. SLAMRAAM is mobile and armored which allows it to operate in various combat situations to protect maneuver forces and strategic assets. \n\nThe Army's Air and Missiles Defense (AMD) portfolio assessment of the cost-effectiveness of SLAMRAAM capabilities versus competing priorities for capability investments within the AMD portfolio led to an Army recommendation to conduct an orderly conclusion of the SLAMRAAM program. The program will complete prototypes and vehicle integration, developmental testing, limited user testing and demonstrations but will not go into production. The prototypes will allow for provision of an Emergency Operational Capability if required.  At the direction of the Under Secretary of the Army, Program Executive Officer (PEO), Missiles and Space, in coordination with the Army stakeholders, will conduct an analysis within existing funds to assist the development of an executable modernization\/mitigation strategy that considers legacy systems."

All prior SLAMRAAM activities are under PE Number 0604802A\/S23.\n\nThe Army's Air and Missiles Defense (AMD) portfolio assessment of the cost-effectiveness of SLAMRAAM capabilities versus competing priorities for capability investments within the AMD portfolio led to an Army recommendation to conduct an orderly conclusion of the SLAMRAAM program. The program will conclude testing activities, finalize safety reports and technical manuals, document the EOC support plan, prepare the prototypes and place them in long term storage, oversee the delivery of the Technical Data Package, archive essential program documents and data, and close out the SLAMRAAM contract and Product office.  The prototypes will allow for provision of an Emergency Operational Capability, if required."
