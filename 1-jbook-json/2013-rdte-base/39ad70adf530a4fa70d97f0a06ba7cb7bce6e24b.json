This project funds the following basic areas: Salaries and benefits for government civilian personnel assigned to the Agency headquarters, training, professional development, and travel for Agency personnel, rents, supplies and services for Agency facilities, facility support functions, and specialized headquarters contract support. \n\nThis PE also funds personnel that implement the initiatives and processes that have been introduced in the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009. This Act notes the key to successful acquisition programs is getting things right from the start with sound systems engineering, cost-estimating, and developmental testing early in the program cycle. \n\nPersonnel funded from the PE will successfully implement these Acquisition Reform initiatives and processes that will minimize future cost overruns, schedule delays, and performance problems in MDA acquisition programs by focusing acquisition and procurement program management on emphasizing systems engineering; more effective up front planning and management of technology risk, make trade-offs between cost, schedule and performance early in the program cycle."
