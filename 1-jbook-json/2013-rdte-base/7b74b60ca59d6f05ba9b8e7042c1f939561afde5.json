MQ-1 Predator, MQ-1C Gray Eagle, and MQ-9 Reaper have similar requirements for SAA capability; their SAA technology development will leverage the GH\/BAMS technology. Development of a Ground Based Sense-and-Avoid (GBSAA) system using existing technology can provide a near-term solution for improved airspace access, both for terminal operations (e.g., Beale AFB, GH transit to\/from controlled airspace) and for operations\/training within the GBSAA system's coverage area (e.g., Gray Eagle at El Mirage, Shadow operations at Cherry Point).\n \nProvides joint funding for the BAMS and GH programs to accelerate the development of a common onboard, autonomous SAA (ABSAA) capability (one upon which a similar SAA system for Predator, Gray Eagle and Reaper can be based).    BAMS program is the lead for the ABSAA development.  Also, provides a GBSAA capability to meet DoD training and operational objectives at locations where airspace restrictions currently limit training and operations, and establishes dedicated funding to develop standards, modeling and simulation tools, and technology to enable DoD UAS to routinely access the national and international airspace systems."

Initiated development for a common, ABSAA system that satisfies common sense-and-avoid requirements of the United States Air Force (USAF) Global Hawk (GH) and United States Navy (USN) Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) that is scalable to medium-altitude UAS. The program successfully conducted a System Requirements Review (SRR) and System Functional Review (SFR).   \nStandards Development - Developed and initiated plan for development of UAS airworthiness certification criteria, standards, and methods of compliance for both fixed and rotary wing UAS (GCS and links included) for incorporation into MIL-HDBK-516. Developed, assessed, & published evolutionary DoD UAS Airspace Integration CONOPS defining the airspace use profiles. Initiated the development of a consistent methodology across all Military Services for developing a UAS Safety Case and a mid-air target level of safety (TLS) for UAS operations in all classes of airspace. Completed Target Level of Safety series of workshops and Safety Case Analysis of Alternatives. Developed UAS Airspace Integration Recommended Requirements for Terminal Area Operations, and a Sense and Avoid Blueprint tracking tool and definitions for Core Capabilities, Cross-Cutting Capabilities, and SAA attributes. Created UAS Profile Selection Guide and Visual Line of Sight Recommended Practices Guide.  \nModeling & Simulation (M&S) - Completed 2011 Modeling and Simulation Roadmap and UAS Technical Standards Development Process. \nGBSAA \u2013 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted the first Certification of Authorization (COA) allowing UAS flight in the NAS with a GBSAA system for operations at El Mirage, CA.  In addition, Cherry Point MCAS made strides in FAA\/NAVAIR system certification process with a COA approved for GBSAA test\/data collection period, augmented with visual observers.  In executing these first GBSAA-enabled UAS flights in the NAS, experiences in the following areas were gained: refinement of the process for safety case development and subsequent FAA approval; establishment of a data collection and mitigation tracking process to fulfill service certification and FAA requirements; and identification of an end-to-end process for developing, testing, qualifying, and implementing a GBSAA system.  These flights utilized the first stage of GBSAA capability.  The Phase 1 capability was advanced in the areas of data fusion, target classification, safety case development and initial algorithm design for maneuvering in airspace with other aircraft.  A parallel development effort was conducted for Phase 2 (self-separation, including work on advanced maneuver algorithm requirements, optical sensor trade studies, and Human-Machine Interface (HMI) Studies for an improved user interface."
