This information will have the appropriate level of security needed for the Air Expeditionary Forces (AEF) to execute the Air Force mission throughout the full spectrum of military operations.  The GCSS-AF program modernizes, consolidates, develops, and integrates Air Force and Department of Defense combat support information systems.  \n\nThe modernized system is being developed in compliance with and hosted on the Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), DISA's solution to connects people and systems that have information (data and services) with those who need information, replacing the DII COE.  The modernized system is implemented and sustained worldwide and supports both wartime and peacetime requirements using hardware, software, and communications capabilities available from standard open systems government contracts and communications infrastructure programs.  \n\nIn this manner, GCSS-AF avoids added costs, removes business processing inefficiencies, reduces deployment footprint, and improves the speed with which information flows. GCSS-AF also supports the Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI) as a hosted application within its common infrastructure. \n\nActivities also include:  Studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning and continued test and evaluation critical to avoid technical obsolescence of this critical infrastructure.  Additional development activities for Platform as a Service (PAAS) and Software as a Service (SAAS) are directly aligned with GCSS-AF's service oriented framework and the movement of infrastructure and services to a Cloud Computer Environment (CCE).\n\nFunding will also support development and systems engineering activities, to include (1) facilitating improvements to system effectiveness through efficient segregation of mission capabilities (apps, services, applications) from underlying networking, middleware and computing infrastructures by using common architecture, standards, and services, and (2) employing a rapid\/agile IT acquisition process to effectively deliver capabilities to the warfighter.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or having approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This information will have the appropriate level of security needed for the Air Expeditionary Forces (AEF) to execute the Air Force mission throughout the full spectrum of military operations.  The GCSS-AF program modernizes, consolidates, develops, and integrates Air Force and Department of Defense combat support information systems.  \n\nThe modernized system is being developed in compliance with and hosted on the Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), DISA's solution to connects people and systems that have information (data and services) with those who need information, replacing the DII COE.  The modernized system is implemented and sustained worldwide and supports both wartime and peacetime requirements using hardware, software, and communications capabilities available from standard open systems government contracts and communications infrastructure programs.  \n\nIn this manner, GCSS-AF avoids added costs, removes business processing inefficiencies, reduces deployment footprint, and improves the speed with which information flows. GCSS-AF also supports the Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI) as a hosted application within its common infrastructure. \n\nActivities also include:  Studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning and continued test and evaluation critical to avoid technical obsolescence of this critical infrastructure.  Additional development activities for Platform as a Service (PAAS) and Software as a Service (SAAS) are directly aligned with GCSS-AF's service oriented framework and the movement of infrastructure and services to a Cloud Computer Environment (CCE).\n\nFunding will also support development and systems engineering activities, to include (1) facilitating improvements to system effectiveness through efficient segregation of mission capabilities (apps, services, applications) from underlying networking, middleware and computing infrastructures by using common architecture, standards, and services, and (2) employing a rapid\/agile IT acquisition process to effectively deliver capabilities to the warfighter.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or having approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
