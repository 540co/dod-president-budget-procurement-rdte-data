            "val": "The C-12 fixed wing aircraft platform hosts a number of Army Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance\/Reconnaissance Surveillance and Target Acqusition (ISR\/RSTA) sensor systems that support irregular warfare in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  Included in those systems are the Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS), Aerial Reconnaissance Multi Sensor (ARMS) (Iraq), the Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance Systems (MARSS) (Iraq and Afghanistan), and Constant Hawk (Afghanistan).  The ARMS system is composed of B-200 (C-12) aircraft equipped with imagery sensors, specialized COMINT sensors, and an array of line of sight and beyond line of sight communications equipment.  The aircraft were fielded to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) in FY06 and had provided daily support to the (Task Force Observe, Detect Identify, Neutralize (TF ODIN) commander.  Constant Hawk (CH) in Afghanistan is hosted on King Air 350 (C-12) aircraft.  CH is a persistent surveillance wide field of view airborne intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (AISR) system conducting Counter Improvised Explosive Device (IED) surveillance and forensic force protection missions.  CH uses high resolution Electro Optic (EO) cameras mounted on manned aircraft to provide persistent surveillance of a designated Named Area of Interest (NAI).  The MARSS aircraft are C-12 variant aircraft equipped with numerous sensors to include imagery and communications intelligence (COMINT) payloads.  They also include several line-of-sight and beyond line of sight communications systems and on board (manned) processing of the imagery and COMINT."
