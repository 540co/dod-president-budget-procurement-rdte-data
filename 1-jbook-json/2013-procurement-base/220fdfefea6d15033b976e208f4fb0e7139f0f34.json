The AAOs and TAMCNs for the funding contained under the sustainment line  is various due to the large number of items procured.    Funding is provided for upgrades to include the procurement of centrally procured items, Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), modification designs, and remanufacture of equipment, which falls within Fire Support Systems for the Marine Corps.  Funds procure software and ancillary equipment to implement GCFS digital communications capability.\n\nCommon Laser Range Finder (CLRF):  CLRF will equip operating forces with the technological capabiltiy to reduce the target location error, increasing target location accuracy.  CLRF is a comprehensive program fulfilling requirements for eye-safe laser rangefinders.  CLRF's principle function is to assist the operator in determining target location by measuring distance, direction and vertical angle from the operator to the target.  CLRF also facilitates target detection, recognition and identification by providing optics similar in magnification and field of view to the M-22 binoculars.   CLRF integrated capability is the replacement of the current CLRF system, and will provide a single integrated device incorporating the capabilities of all the devices listed above."
