DMS implements the high assurance requirements of the Multicommand Required Operational Capability (MROC) 3-88 change 2 dated 1 Oct 1997.  DMS is an integrated suite of Commercial Off-The-Shelf based applications that provide delivery of organizational messages on the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) for strategic (ashore) and tactical (afloat) interoperability.  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is the DMS lead agency and provides integration, configuration management, and certification of DMS product upgrades as well as backbone operations and help desk services.  Implementation and sustainment of operational sites is executed by the individual Services\/Agencies.  The Joint DMS program has reached Full Operational Capability and is in the sustainment phase and due to go End of Life in FY13.\n\nThe USN DMS program provided the procurement, engineering, integration and installation necessary to upgrade\/refresh all United States Navy and select United States Marine Corp components at the messaging control centers (aka DMS Service Providers), and remaining Legacy transitional messaging systems (CUDIXS, FMX , Nova, NIXT).  Upgraded  DMS components to ensure end-to-end, joint interoperable messaging capabilities for all Naval activities.  DMS Hardware\/Software components included shore tactical gateway message processing systems, secure access management systems, and the web-based Navy Regional Enterprise Messaging System (NREMS).  Funding provided for the procurement, engineering, integration and installation of interoperable systems to support the future of Command & Control Official Information Exchange (C2OIX).  Specific configurations implemented at individual sites varied to such a degree that aggregate quantities (and unit costs) are not applicable and would be misleading."
