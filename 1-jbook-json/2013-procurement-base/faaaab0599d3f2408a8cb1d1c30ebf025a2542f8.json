It sustains Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that is technologically and\/or economically obsolete. Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provides increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity and cost avoidances to Army Program Managers. Programmed funding will be used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at the Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, AZ."

            "val": "FY2013 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $0.586 million support the following: Acquires modern instrumentation to measure the antenna radiation patterns of antenna systems on all Army vehicles; provides improved measurement capabilities and accuracy for production antenna performance and software modeling of antenna performance. This is a modernization effort for equipment systems that are currently obsolete and will be phased out from support by its original equipment manufacturer in the next year. It will acquire modern Microwave receivers and RF components for antenna measurements, develop standardized procedures and high accuracy standards needed for the accreditation process, increase the measurement speed of the system to allow additional throughput of systems and add capability to measure active antennas used for radar systems. The majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life. This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data is collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized. Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies, decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers."
