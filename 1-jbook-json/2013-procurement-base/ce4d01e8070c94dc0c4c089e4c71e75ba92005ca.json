            "val": "Physical Security - Physical security systems are used at base flight lines and Arms, Ammunition and Explosive (AA&E) sites, in expeditionary environments, Other Critical Assets (OCA), Mission Essential Vulnerable Areas, support the Marine Corps Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Program and include capital plant equipment specifically designed for physical security\/electronic security systems (ESS) in military construction (MILCON) projects.  The budget line provides funding to procure investment items, devices and systems necessary for United States Marine Corps installations and facility infrastructure to comply with Congressional, White House Military Office, Department of Defense, Department of Navy, Marine Corps Physical Security and Antiterrorism Directives pertaining to security equipment and ESS as technological solutions to manpower intensive security requirements; and to provide a systematic, uniform capability throughout Marine Corps installations to deter, delay, and defeat espionage, sabotage, damage, theft, and terrorist acts against Marine Corps personnel, resources, installations and facilities.\n\nThese systems upgrade and replace antiquated systems that are costly to maintain and upgrade security in neglected areas. The Marine Corps Electronic Security System (MCESS) Program provides Installations Physical Security capabilities to include Intrusion Detection, Access Control to include automated entry control systems, Mass Notification.  Collateral Equipment capabilities include Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) and other surveillance equipment support by Visual Assessment Capabilities with digital recording. Mass Notification Systems provide warning capability to personnel in the event of emergencies or changes in Force Protection Conditions. These systems increase efficiency\/effectiveness of available security manpower and improve safety and security at access points.  The systems reduce vulnerabilities and maintain mission readiness and enhance mission capabilities in support of Flight Line Security.  Support to the warfighter with technology and equipment; increases assessment capability outside the established perimeter at Forward Operating\/Enduring Bases. Ground based radars support Expeditionary Missions (improved assessment at long distances) allowing for greater defensive posture and response capabilities.\n\nGround-Based Operational Surveillance System (G-BOSS) The Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (G-BOSS) is an incremental development program currently providing persistent, multispectral surveillance sensor packages in Afghanistan.  Each tower employs multiple, self-contained detection and assessment technologies on a single, mobile platform consisting of four main components: trailer-mounted elevation platform, multi-spectral sensor suite, ground control station and remote ground control station.  Three variants of G-BOSS exist; 80' tower mounted system (heavy), 20' trailer mounted system (medium), and man-portable, tripod mounted system (light).  Each variant includes: daylight color & infrared imagery (StarSafire III and T-3000), Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS), Tactical Remote Sensor System (TRSS), Manportable Surveillance and Target Acquisition Radar (MSTAR), Communication suite for wireless point to point link, and unmanned aerial vehicle interface (VideoScout).  G-BOSS is a material solution in response to an Urgent Universal Needs Statement in support of OEF.  In FY11, the program procured (27) heavy, (21) Medium and (6) lite G-BOSS systems in response to an Urgent Statement of Need dated May 2011 utilizing FY09 and FY10 OCO PMC.   FY12 - 13 the program will transition to the G-BOSS (E) phase I interoperability increment which will enhance the systems with an interoperability capability in support of the G-BOSS (E) capability insertion.  FY14 -  FY17 the program will transition to the G-BOSS (E) capability suite.  G-BOSS (E) is an expeditionary, ground-based self contained, multi-spectral sensor-oriented, persistent surveillance system used to observe, collect, detect, identify, classify, track and report on contacts, objects of interest and assessed threats twenty four hours a day utilizing a fused video and sensor data display.  The acquisition strategy is to procure critical upgrade kits to enhance the legacy systems over the course of the FYDP to the full capability set outlined in the CDD.\n\n[P40A \/ IDENTITY DOMINANCE SYSTEM (IDS)]: Identity Dominance System (IDS) will provide a multimodal biometric collection system that collects and compares fingerprints, iris images and facial photos to enroll, identify and track persons of interest and build digital dossiers on individuals that include interrogation reports, biographic information, relationships, etc. for the purposes of force protection and high-value target identification.  The system is expected to be a family of capabilities with hardware and software that is off-the-shelf, from government and commercial sources.  The family of capabilities will include a server suite capability, a client capability and an untethered\/handheld capability.  The IDS will interoperate with a variety of other systems and adhere to applicable technical standards, to include the DoD Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) and the Electronic Biometric Transmission Standard (EBTS).  IDS will incrementally phase out the Biometric Automated Toolset (BAT)."
