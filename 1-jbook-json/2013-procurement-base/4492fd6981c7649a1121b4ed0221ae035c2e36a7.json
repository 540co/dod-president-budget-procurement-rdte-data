            "val": "The Maritime Expeditionary Security Force (MESF), formerly Naval Coastal Warfare (NCW), community consists of Mobile Inshore Undersea Warfare (MIUW) units and Harbor Defense Command (HDC) units operating Mobile Ashore Support Terminal IIIs (MAST IIIs).  NCW also includes Inshore Boat Units (IBUs) and Maritime Security Force (MSF), which are separately funded.\n\n[P40A \/ R201 Maritme Expeditionary Security Forces (MESF) Upgrades]: MESF System Upgrades -   Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) to improve performance and reliability and provide engineering changes to the MIUW-SU (V4), MAST, IBU's systems as well as various upgrades which would apply to MESF Mission.  These upgrades would include sensor system upgrades, Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSAT), portable comm gear and additional sensor equipment, new computer operating system related hardware, new or upgraded platforms for movement\/transport of the MIUW-SU Radar Sonar Surveillance Central (RSSC) and the Portable Sensor Platform, and additional C4I equipment to include communications wireless links\/LANs.   System upgrades to MAST III units will enhance system operational performance and improve reliability.  These upgrades include communications enhancements; refresh\/upgrades to command and control components; and system mobility elements.  VSAT provides a highly mobile satellite communication capability for use by the Maritime Expeditionary Security Force (MESF).  \n\nThe MESF System upgrades will be implemented in Engineering Change Packages (ECPs) that provide P3I updates to the Eight (8) MAST III systems and Twenty (20) MIUW Sensor systems.  The average unit cost of all of the MAST III and MIUW ECPs executed in a given year are reflected in the P5 exhibit.  FY12 includes a major procurement to upgrade 4 of 8 MAST III systems with Joint Tactical Radio program equipment.\n\n[P40A \/ R2G85 - OCO supplemental]: MESF System Upgrades - Operation New Dawn (OND) deployment of MESF Squadrons has validated a need for a common JC2 capability.  The JC2 improvement will provide the MESF Sensor Detachments with improved tactical C2 system.  The Trailorable Sensor Platform (TSP) sensor nodes will receive upgrades to the radars and cameras including image tracking.  Supports two AN\/TSQ 268 Expeditionary Warfare Decision Systems (EWDS) and buys littoral sonobuoy sensors for corroborative tracking of low-observable targets.  NECC units (non-EOD) require a portable medium scale SATCOM solution for a wide range of command & control operations, that can provide access to NIPRNet, SIPRNet, VOIP\/VOSIP & VTC services in support of Overseas Contingencies Operations (OCO).\n\nProcurement of Mobile Ashore Support Terminal (MAST) and sensor equipment in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  Provides MAST and sensor equipment to enhance system operational performance and improve reliability.  Items include communications enhancements; refresh\/upgrades to command and control components; and system mobility elements.\n\n[P40A \/ R2G86 - OCO supplemental]: C4ISR Requirement (OCO):  Funding is required for the procurement and installation of C4ISR equipment in support of ISA Air Base.  Funding will support both the P-3 and M-TAV missions.  \n\nFunding is required for the procurement and installation of C4I Systems in support of FY12 Oversea Contingency Operations (OCO).  The Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) Joint Operations and Intelligence Center (JIOC) is relocating from a non-force protected location to their new headquarters building once complete.  Per the Military Construction Data Project (MILCON DD 1391), the building should be completed in FY 2012.  As noted on the approved DD 1391 (MILCON Data Project Form), the C4I requirements are not funded\/covered.  The new headquarters building will meet force protection standards and has been approved by Congress.  This request will provide the necessary funds to procure the required C4I systems\/ equipment to support CJTF-HOA requirements.  Tenant is the Operations and Intelligence watch floor portions of JTF-HOA.  The requirement is necessary in order for CJTF-HOA to move into the new facility without any downtime to critical services and in support of operational mission.  The Guards\/Sanitizers requirements will allow for secure data transfer between different network security enclaves.  The CJTF-HOA mission relies heavily on the sharing of information with local national partners and without these data sanitizers there is a great propensity for the leakage of classified materials.  Visual Integrated Support for Information Operations eNvironment (VISION) provides a suite of tools that enables the coordination and synchronization of Information Operations plans, tools, and effects.  Coalition Enterprise Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) is a system of networks that allow information to be exchanged within a coalition.  Each enclave represents a separate network based upon the members of the coalition.  With the expansion of the JTF-HOA mission from their Combatant Commander (USAFRICOM), it will be necessary to add additional CENTRIXS enclaves in order to share information with the necessary coalition partners.  The Tactical Voice Switching (TVS) will allow multiple users to use a single DAMA radio throughout the facility.  Currently, at CJTF-HOA, in order to use a DAMA radio circuit, one must be co-located with the radio.  This capability will allow radio circuits to be used regardless of where the radio is located.  The Electronic Surveillance System (ESS) provides electronic security controls and surveillance to protect sensitive areas of a controlled facility.  The Tactical Common Data Link (T-CDL) system will provide near-real time connectivity and interoperability between multiple T-CDL collection platforms, T-CDL surface terminals and, currently, fielded Common Data Link (CDL) interoperabie systems operated by the armed services and government agencies.  The Video Distribution System (VDS) will allow video to be distributed throughout the new JTF-HOA HQs facility from multiple video inputs to multiple video outputs.  There is no existing way to easily and rapidly share video feeds throughout the HQs facility.  This causes situational awareness to be stagnant in one area and\/or command decisions to be delayed."
