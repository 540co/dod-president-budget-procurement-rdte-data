            "val": "FY11 Base Appropriation Request: $19.238M\nCENTER FOR ADVANCED OPERATIONAL CULTURE LEARNING (CAOCL) provides a turnkey solution to support the growing demand for technologically enhanced foreign language training. This solution should be in the form of self-sustaining Language Learning Resource Centers (LLRCs) as training units. The USMC requires up to 30 LLRC units deployed to multiple CONUS and OCONUS locations. The USMC LLRCs will comprise the following basic requirements: be mobile with support for 16 students in a variety of ways, contain high speed unrestricted internet access, satellite radio and television capability, web based with a web server, contain a database server and 16 complete workstations, contain integrated Heating\/Ventilation Air Conditioning and Back-up Power generator. The USMC requirement is to implement a LLRC solution that has the ability to operate with minimum impact on resources from the hosting military installation.\n\nCOMBINED ARMS COMMAND AND CONTROL TRAINER UPGRADE SYSTEM (CACCTUS) will upgrade 29 Palms Combined Arms Staff Trainer (CAST) facility to provide a more realistic training opportunity for Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) staff elements in the areas of fire support employment, coordination, and integration. The upgraded system will support Marine Expeditionary Battalion (MEB) level training and to effectively integrate current and emerging Communications Command Control Computers and Intelligence (C4I) systems. These funds will also support the procurement of lab developmental hardware.\n\nCOMMAND and CONTROL TRAINING and EDUCATION CENTER of EXCELLENCE (C2 TECOE)will support the five (5) MAGTF Integrated Systems Training Centers (MISTCs) located at Camp Johnson, NC, (MISTC East), Camp Pendleton, CA (MISTC West), Camp Hanson, Okinawa (MISTC Okinawa), Kaneohe Bay, HI (MISTC Hawaii), 29 Palms, CA (MISTC 29 Palms), and the C2TECOE located in Quantico, VA. The MISTCs, under the operational control of the C2 TECOE is the primary command and control (C2) training venue for the Marine Corps operating forces for both individual and collective C2 systems sustainment training. The yearly funding is for equipment refresh and procurement of new training systems. A portion of the C2 computer systems are replaced each year to provide current systems for classroom and combat operation training in battle staff training for commanders and unit personnel.\n\nDEPLOYABLE VIRTUAL TRAINING ENVIRONMENT (DVTE)is a laptop PC based simulation system capable of emulating organic and supporting Infantry Battalion weapons systems and training scenarios to facilitate T&R based training, currently being fielded at the Battalion level. Its portable configuration allows Marines to train when they otherwise could not; aboard ship, at remote reserve locations and deployed. The type of training able to be conducted with DVTE include language and culture training, platoon and squad level tactics, employment of supporting arms, and various Recognition of Combatants (ROC)packages. DVTE is part of a Commander's \"training toolkit\" contributing to the building block approach to standards based training focusing on achieving an improved level of combat readiness. Funding supports hardware refresh and integration\/interoperability capabilities with operational forces' systems.\n\nDISTANCE LEARNING (DL) delivers effective training by using modern instructional technologies (interactive software\/courseware). The DL Program provides access to Marines to training and education products to increase operational readiness levels. The DL Program delivers courseware for both garrison and deployed Marines. In garrison, Marines use Learning Resource Centers (LRCs) that are NMCI seats, Deployed Marines access training through Deployable Learning Resource Centers (DLRCs) which are MCHS hardware. Both garrison and deployed access are supported by MCHS servers that provide student administration and deliver content over local and wide-area networks (LAN\/WAN) to include the MCEN\/NMCI. All DL PMC funds are for integration and installation and procurement of the hardware to support the current distance learning infrastructure which has a continuous expanding distance learning user population. Non-NMCI hardware is refreshed every 5 years. In FY 2012, 27 Deployable Learning Resource Center (DLRC) suites will be refreshed. The remainder will be refreshed in FY 2014.\n\nMINOR TRAINING DEVICES\/SIMULATORS (MTD) program encompasses the procurement of low density, minor (low cost) Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) ground training equipment, simulators and simulations. These devices such as Training-Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), Recognition of Combat Vehicles (ROC-V), climbing walls, Portable Infantry Target System (PITS), weapons models and mockups, enhance basic occupational and combat skills across the wide spectrum of tactics, techniques, procedures and firearms and weapon proficiency. MTDs are for the most part commercial\/service non-developmental training devices, used by Marine Corps Schools of Infantry, Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, Recruit Depots, operating forces, bases, stations and support combat readiness. Funding provides capability for the USMC to conduct critical OCO\/OIF\/EF training and participate as a full-fledged member of several Joint programs.\n\nMULTIPLE INTEGRATED LASER ENGAGEMENT SYSTEM (MILES 2000) is a joint interest program between the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army. It is the Tactical Engagement Simulation System for the Marine Corps and provides a family of low power, eye safe lasers which simulates the direct fire characteristics of infantry small arms, assault, armor, anti-armor mechanized weapons system and provides the gunner with hit or miss determination. MILES 2000 is designed to be used by the MAGTF as a force-on-force engagement simulation training system. MILES 2000 is the major component that the United States Marine Corps is using for the Range Instrumentation System initiative and an integral component of Position Location Instrumentation.\n\nRANGE MODERNIZATION\/TRANSFORMATION (RM\/T) Baseline and OCO program modernizes major USMC base and station live training ranges to provide enhanced after action review with ground truth feedback, realistic representation of opposing forces (OPFOR) and enhanced range and exercise command and control capabilities. Integrating live and simulated training technologies, the fielded capabilities enhance live-fire, force-on-target, and force-on-force training. Major system components of modernization include Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain (MOUT) facilities, inter-active targetry, battlefield effects simulators, individual and vehicle tracking systems, aviation tracking systems, Tactical Engagement Simulation Systems, simulated munitions, integrated simulation, and range control and exercise control information processing and situational awareness displays. Current combat Operations in Afghanistan (OEF) in support of OCO are being conducted in largely urban areas. Training is required to support the complexities of command and control, live-fire coordination in support of maneuver, and logistics operations in support of units at and above company level. Deploying Operational Units need access to instrumented, non live fire and live-fire capable MOUT training facilities, urban sniper training capabilities, convoy operation\/reaction course capability, Urban Close Air Support (CAS) ranges, and IED\/EOD training capability in order to accomplish this training and bring the Marine Corps into the 21st century, to include a fully immersive infantry trainer (IIT). These capabilities give deploying units the opportunity to better meet training requirements before exercising as a MAGTF at Mojave Viper and deploying to the combat theaters. Additionally lessons learned from OIF are driving the need for new training systems supporting a seamless training environment allowing crucial core capabilities to be available for all Marines at all sites at once. The requested funds would enhance the training capabilities sponsored in the Range Modernization and Transformation (RM\/T) program. AAO=I MEF -MCB Camp Pendleton, CA; MCAS Yuma, AZ; II MEF -MCB Camp Lejeune, NC; III MEF -Kaneohe Bay, HI; Okinawa, Japan; Supporting Establishments -MCAGCC, 29 Palms, CA; MCB Quantico, VA; Mountain Warfare Training Center (MWTC) -Bridgeport, CA.\n\nUNITED STATES MARINE CORPS OPERATOR DRIVING SIMULATOR (USMC-ODS) trains vehicle operators on multiple vehicle platforms. The trainer uses a manufactured cab with interchangeable dash sets that replicate the look and functionality of the vehicle chosen for simulation. It also uses an appended armor kittos emulate the appropriate field of view for the selected vehicle. Systems are equipped with three-degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) seat motion for the driver and 180 degrees of visual display via three electronic displays. Systems can be installed in a fixed location or delivered on a mobile trailer. Mobile systems have the option of being purchased in a single (1 Student Training Station (STS)) or dual (2 STS) configuration. Current vehicles selectable on the USMC-ODS include: Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR), MTVR with MTVR Armor System (MAS), Up-Armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HWWMV), Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Category l Cougar (4x4), Category II Cougar (6x6) and Category III Buffalo (FPll Variants). Procurement funding is used to acquire equipment for student training stations at Camp Johnson and Fort Leonard Wood and for the acquisition of generic cabs, interchangeable dashes, and steering wheels for the MTVR modules. This expands use of the simulators to include the HMMWV and the family of MRAP vehicles, by providing capabilities that are not available on the current MTVR-TS system.\n\nFY 11 Overseas Contingency Request (OCO): $55.864M\nCLOSE COMBAT TACTICAL TRAINER (CCTT) device provides training of Infantry, Armor, Mechanized Infantry, Cavalry and Armored Reconnaissance units from squad through Battalion\/Squadron level, to include their staffs and will be physically located at 2nd Tank Battalion. The primary training audience operates from full-crew simulators, mock-up command posts, and live battalion command posts to accomplish their combined arms training tasks.  As a device, the CCTT is a system of manned modules and work stations that allow tank units to train armor collective tasks at the platoon through battalion task force level.  Crews maneuver on the virtual battlefield in manned modules that replicate the individual crew stations for the USMC Main Battle Tank.\n\nCOMBINED ARMS COMMAND AND CONTROL TRAINER UPGRADE SYSTEM (CACCTUS) is an entity level constructive simulation used to train combined arms staff at battalion-level, and key company and below elements. CACCTUS provides trainees a realistic, scenario-driven atmosphere enabling commanders and their battle staffs to train or rehearse combined arms tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and decision-making processes in an immersed environment as defined in the CACCTUS concept of operations (CONOPS). CACCTUS is used in both pre-deployment and sustainment training at the major bases and at 29 Palms as a prerequisite to Mojave Viper training event.\n\nRANGE MODERNIZATION\/TRANSFORMATION (RM\/T) provides funds for multiple procurement actions to fulfill requirements for supporting pre-deployment training for current combat operations, including Afghanistan and other overseas operations that are required to support the complexities of command and control, live-fire coordination in support of maneuver, and logistics operations in support of units at and above company level.

Deploying Operational Units need access to instrumented, non live-fire and live-fire capable urban training facilities, urban sniper training capabilities, convoy operation\/reaction course capability, Urban Close Air Support (CAS) ranges, and Improvised Explosive Device\/Explosive Ordnance Disposal training capability in order to accomplish this training. Home stations that will benefit from these projects are Camp Pendleton, Camp Lejeune, Camp Butler, Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Marine Corps Base Quantico, and Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. These capabilities give deploying units the opportunity to better meet training requirements before exercising as a Marine Air-Ground Task Force at Enhanced Mojave Viper and deploying to combat theaters. Additionally, lessons learned from OEF and other overseas operations are driving the need for the new training systems supporting a seamless training environment allowing crucial core capabilities in small unit training to be available for all Marines at all sites at once. Funds will allow procurement of the Casbah Sniper Tower at MCB Camp Lejeune, NC, Air Position Location Indicator (APLI) at MCB Quantico, VA, Range 117 Location of Miss and Hit (LOMAH) System at MCB Camp Pendleton, CA, the Instrumented-Tactical Engagement Simulation System Phase II at Okinawa, Japan, and Range 5 Upgrades at MCB Quantico, VA and Camp Pendleton - Search and Seizure (Ship on Land). \n\nSUPPORTING ARMS VIRTUAL TRAINER (SAVT) provides funds to support Naval Air Warfare Center-Training System Division, Orlando, Florida incorporation of Close Air Support (CAS) Strikelink and Video Scout.\n\nFY 13 Overseas Contingency Operations Request (OCO): $3.602M\nRANGE MODERNIZATION\/TRANSFORMATION (RM\/T) provides funds for pre-deployment training for current combat operations including Afghanistan and other overseas operations required to support the complexities of command and control, live-fire coordination in support of maneuver, and logistics operations in support of units at and above company level. Deploying Operational Units need access to instrumented, non live-fire and live-fire capable urban training facilities, urban sniper training capabilities, convoy operation\/reaction course capability, Urban Close Air Support (CAS) ranges, and Improvised Explosive Device\/Explosive Ordnance Disposal training capability in order to accomplish this training.

Additionally, lessons learned from OEF and other overseas operations are driving the need for the new training systems supporting a seamless training environment allowing crucial core capabilities in small unit training to be available for all Marines at all sites at once.  Funds will allow procurement of the following training devices required at the following home-station commands:  Camp Lejeune - SR-6 Fire and Movement Range Targetry; MCB Hawaii - Pohakuloa Training Area Forward Operating Base #428 and Warrior; Okinawa - Search and Seizure (Ship on Land); Parris Island - Moving Target System on Hue City Range.\n\nOverall Training Devices Impact: Baseline request provide for seamless training environments that continue to enhance training capabilities, modernize major USMC base and station live training ranges, provide enhanced after action review with ground truth feedback, realistic representation of opposing forces (OPFOR) and enhanced range and exercise command and control capabilities.  Without these training devices, Marines will not be properly trained and prepared for Combat when deployed to combat theaters."
