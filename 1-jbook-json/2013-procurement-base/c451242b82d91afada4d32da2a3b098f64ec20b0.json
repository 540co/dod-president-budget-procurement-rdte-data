            "val": "Interim Contractor Support (ICS) provides maintenance and repair capability for depot level reparables (DLRs) to meet Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) operational requirements for the B-2 weapon system.  The ICS program is a comprehensive repair capability repairing 321 different line replaceable units (LRUs), shop replaceable units (SRUs), airframe structures, hydro-mechanical components, and avionics components until permanent depot capability is established.  ICS funds will fund repairs until all components are depot activated.  The current 315 LRUs\/SRUs are scheduled to transition in their entirety by FY-2018 with the current depot activation schedule.\n\nPost Production Support funds are used to acquire, replace, upgrade, integrate, and test obsolete B-2 peculiar support equipment (PSE), as well as procure non-stock listed piece parts for the Weapon System Support Center (WSSC) Ground Test Facility (GTF) as well as the Program Depot Maintenance, Test Range, and AFGSC operational support facilities.  The B-2 WSSC GTF is a one-of-a-kind facility that develops, maintains, sustains, integrates, tests, and certifies the B-2 Spirit software.  The B-2 WSSC GTF combines flight controls, radar, weapons, navigation, traffic control, communications, displays, flight management, external interfaces, and defensive management functionality in a test environment to conduct component, subsystem, and end-to-end software tests before deployment to the test aircraft and\/or the operational fleet.  This funding also supports replacement, upgrade, and integration of other   B-2 unique sustainment support systems such as, but not limited to, the VIPER Memory Load Verifier, Portable Compressed Air Heating System, Program Depot Maintenance sustainment equipment, and Test Range special test equipment.  \nThis program has associated Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding in PE 0604240F until FY-2010, and in PE 0101127F in FY-2010 and subsequent."

            "val": "ICS Funding requirements continue until depot activation is complete. Currently ICS continues through FY18; however, any additional new hardware added to the aircraft will also require interim contractor support until depot activation for that hardware is completed. Without the ICS funding, Total Non-Mission Capable for Supply (TNMCS) rates will increase and Aircraft Availability Improvement Program (AAIP) goals will not be met.  Additionally, lack of mission capable assets will eventually ground aircraft, prohibiting B-2 participation in Global Strike and Global Persistent Attack.\n\nIn FY13, Post Production Support funds will acquire, replace, upgrade, integrate, and test obsolete B-2  special test equipment and peculiar support equipment required to support the WSSC GTF, Programmed Depot Maintenance, Test Range, and AFGSC operational facilities. \n\nItems procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements."
