            "val": "The AH-64D Longbow Apache aircraft incorporates the Longbow weapon system and provides the US Army with a significant improvement in target acquisition and firepower effectiveness, increasing the survivability, lethality, and adverse weather fighting capabilities of the Apache.  Principal aircraft components include the Target Acquisition Designation Sight (TADS) housed in a turret on the nose of the AH-64 and consisting of a TV, Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), Direct View Optics, Laser Designator\/Rangefinder and Spot Tracker.  The Pilot Night Vision Sensor (PNVS) is a FLIR which allows Nap-of-Earth operations at night by the pilot independent of the co-pilot\/gunner's FLIR.  Apache aircraft are armed with the Hellfire Antitank Missile, 2.75 inch rockets, and a 30 mm gun capable of defeating armor.  The AH-64D Longbow model is equipped with a modified AH-64 airframe, a Fire Control Radar (FCR)\/Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI) mission kit, and \"Fire and Forget\" Longbow HELLFIRE missiles.  \n\nThe new build aircraft will replace an aircraft destroyed during OND\/OEF.  It will be in the Block II configuration and will include a new fuselage and materials."
