            "val": "The M107 is a .50 caliber rifle with attached optics\/electro-optics that supports all weather, day\/night tactical dominance via rapid-fire direct fire engagements with armor penetrating, incendiary, dual-purpose ammunition.  The M107 provides a man-portable, materiel destruction capability to the sniper team.  With a family of ammunition, the M107 enables sniper teams to employ destructive force at greater ranges and at a high rate of fire.  The M107 also replaced existing non-standard, M82A1, .50 caliber rifles in Explosive Ordnance Detachments as detonation tools.  The primary mission of this rifle is to engage and defeat materiel targets at extended ranges to include parked aircraft; command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) sites; radar sites; ammunition storage sites; petroleum, oil and lubricant facilities; and various other thin skinned (lightly armored) materiel targets out to 2,000 meters.  The M107 is used in a counter-sniper role, taking advantage of the longer stand-off range and increased terminal effect of opposing snipers armed with smaller caliber weapons out to 1,000 meters."
