            "val": "Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA) provides organic aviation support to Special Operations Forces (SOF) for worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. The approved requirement for Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) efforts is 61 aircraft. The aircraft are capable of operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions and harsh environments deep in enemy territory. They are used to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF. Currently, the MH-47 is the SOF platform of choice in executing Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) missions. The MH-47 SLEP procurement line item provides for airframe improvements by reducing vibration, changing the design of high crack propagation areas, reducing susceptibility to corrosion, implementing transportability improvements, and addressing equipment obsolescence issues. The MH-47 airframe has been in service since the 1960's and the SLEP is designed to extend the average life of the aircraft. The SLEP funds the non-recurring and recurring engineering, manufacturing, and parts and materials required, as well as Integrated Logistics Support to include spares, publications, and supplies. This program will provide ARSOA with a single heavy assault airframe type, the MH-47G. Program was increased by FY 2006, FY 2007, FY 2008, FY2010 Supplemental and FY 2011 OCO funding. The associated RDT&E is in Program Element 1160482BB.\nNote:  Congress transferred non-recurring engineering and the initial long lead procurement of FY 2011 funding to the MH-47G Chinook line item."
