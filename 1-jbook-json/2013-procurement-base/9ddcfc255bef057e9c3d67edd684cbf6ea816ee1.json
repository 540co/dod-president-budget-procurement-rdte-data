            "val": "The TH-67 Creek is a non-developmental commercial, three-seated, single engine, training helicopter with two main rotor blades.  It is a variant of the Bell Helicopter Textron, Incorporated 206B-3 helicopter.  It is used exclusively at the U.S. Army Aviation Center, Fort Rucker, AL, for Initial Entry Rotor Wing (IERW).  A mix of aircraft configured to support Visual Flight Rules (VFR), Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) and Basic War fighting Skills (BWS) training are used.  The VFR version is ideal for early stages of flight school because it is lighter, simpler, and less sensitive to the harsher flight maneuvering generated during the students' primary training.  The IFR is equipped for the more advanced instrument phase and is more complex and heavier, but does not undergo the harsher primary flight maneuvering generated in earlier training phases.  An enhanced configuration of the VFR is a third design which offers a training environment for the acquisition of basic navigation\/night\/night vision goggles skills.  All versions of the aircraft are designed to provide safe, effective and economical in-flight training when used to demonstrate and practice basic helicopter pilot skills."
