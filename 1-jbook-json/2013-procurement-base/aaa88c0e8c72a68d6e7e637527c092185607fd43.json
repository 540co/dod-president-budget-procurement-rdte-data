            "val": "The Single Channel Anti-Jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) Terminal provides a manportable, four simultaneous channel, full duplex data\/half duplex voice communications and data transfer system at 2400 bps per channel. SCAMP provides priority tactical ground users with the capability to transmit and receive intelligence, command, and control traffic from a base station.  It transmits in the Extremely High Frequency (EHF) band and receives in the Super High Frequency (SHF) band.  It provides Low Data Rate (LDR) secure voice at 2400 bps and secure data at 75-2400 bps, as well as interface with Common Hardware\/Software devices such as the Lightweight Computer Units and the Hand-Held Terminal Unit.  The SCAMP is fully interoperable within the Army C4I Technical Architecture.  The terminal has embedded COMSEC and TRANSEC with set-up and tear-down in less than 10 minutes.  In addition to operation on Milstar satellites, the SCAMP operates on all satellites which utilize the MIL-STD-1582D LDR waveform. It operates in environmental conditions that include rain, fog, snow, haze and dust, and operates in the transmit, receive or stand-by mode throughout an entire mission (typically 30 days).  SCAMP is the only EHF manportable terminal and provides direct support to the tactical warfighter mobile forces with greater anti-jam protection, lower probability of intercept, and lower probability of detection.  Army SCAMP terminals are designated for Commanders at Division and above levels. This program is designated as a DoD Space Program. SCAMP will transistion to sustainment by FY 2013.  The Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) for SCAMP is 346.\n\nAll funding supports Active component."
