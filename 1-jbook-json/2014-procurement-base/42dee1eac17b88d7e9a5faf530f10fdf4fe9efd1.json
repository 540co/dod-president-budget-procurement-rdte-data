            "val": "U.S. military forces operate in an information age where the need for precise, instantaneous intelligence and operational capabilities to increase and expand across the entire spectrum of military operations. However, this increasing technical sophistication leads to a dependency on technology that, in turn, may represent potentially crippling vulnerabilities. The Air Force (AF) addresses these vulnerabilities through Information Operations (IO), Offensive Cyberspace Operations (OCO) and Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO). These mission areas include those actions taken to gain, exploit, defend, and attack information and information systems. IO\/OCO\/DCO consist of actions conducted to attack an adversary's information and information systems while defending one's own.  \n\nOCO includes the integrated application of Electronic Warfare (EW), Psychological Operations (PSYOP), Military Deception (MILDEC), physical attack, Computer Network Attack (CNA), counter-intelligence, counter-deception, Computer Network Defense (CND), counter-propaganda, Information Assurance (IA), and Operations Security (OPSEC). The Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA), 67th Network Warfare Wing, and 688 Information Operations Wing, all located in San Antonio, TX, are responsible for IO\/OCO\/DCO and Command and Control Warfare (C2W) operations supporting joint, air component, and\/or national objectives. Procurement funds in this program provide the equipment vital to accomplishing and supporting cyberspace and C2W missions. \n\nRapid Cyber Acquisition (RCA) provides combatant commanders (CCDRs) with the ability to adequately and rapidly respond to emerging cyber needs that cannot be serviced via the JUON\/UON process and cannot wait for the normal DoD acquisition process to address. It provides rapid fielding capability to secure the United States Air Force (USAF) portion of the DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) in response to threat, technology and\/or environmental changes. It creates unique cyber capabilities through innovation and integration to provide critical interim cyber capabilities during the long-term acquisition of the next generation network\/cyberspace infrastructure. RCA refines operations by creating synergies and seamless cyber capabilities between offensive and defensive cyber efforts. It fields operationally responsive cyber capabilities in mission-relevant timeframes and provides network defense to DoD GIG gateways, USAF base boundaries, and to Command and Control, operations and security centers. It also generates network attack and cyber exploit capabilities in response to time-critical CCDR needs through all phases of warfare."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "1.  OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS (INFORMATION OPERATIONS (IO) SUPPORT): Procures computer, computer related memory storage, local and long-haul communications, infrastructure, and unique intelligence and analysis equipment required to support IO analysis which delivers timely AF IO capabilities. These procurements are vital for the exploitation, development, and fielding of IO reach-back capabilities. Also procures computer network defense equipment, which provides defensive counter information capability to protect AF computer systems and their information against unauthorized intrusion, corruption, and\/or destruction, be it deliberate or unintentional. This program procures equipment used in the development of offensive and defensive systems and provides the equipment used in the operational test ranges for developmental and operation tests of the developed systems. It also provides the range infrastructure for training, exercises and mission rehearsals to support real-world contingency missions. This program contains 688 IOW programs and initiatives to protect AF computers, whether they are stand alone, networked, or embedded in weapons systems, and provide IO threat predictions for AF systems. This effort is funded in PE 0208087F.\n\n2.  SENSOR HARVEST: This program is a Command and Control Warfare (C2W) and information tool designed to support strategic and operational planners. Funding provides upgrades of critical computers,processing systems and infrastructure to support holistic IO and nodal analysis in support of unique aspects of targeting that enable the shift from conventional to IO\/C2W targeting.  This effort is funded in PE 0208021F and 0208288F.\n\n3.  DISTRIBUTED MISSION OPERATIONS AND THREAT ANALYSIS:  The 453d Electronic Warfare Squadron (453 EWS) provides analytical capabilities and reachback support for DoD acquisition , planning and mission execution activities. These capabilities ensure electronic warfare (EW) systems and integrated combat platforms correctly recognize and respond to enemy, friendly and noncombatant systems operating within the electromagnetic environment.  The effort also includes Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR).  Funds used to procure specialized information technology systems used to identify electromagnetic spectrum emitter changes that impact combat defensive and electronic warfare systems and to conduct detailed analyses in support of operational mission planning, tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development, acquisition and test & evaluation. These analyses provide the means to understand the performance of their systems in hostile environments, directly impacting the survivability of combat-coded USAF aircraft and aircrews.  This effort is funded in PE0207439F.\n\n\n4.  INFORMATION OPERATIONS INITIATIVE: Funds will support an information operations initiative at the 688th IOW. This effort procures computers and other hardware supporting offensive environment and analysis equipment required to support cyber warfare capability development. This facility delivers solutions to information operations analysts at the \"speed of need\", and these procurements are critical to maintaining the advantage within cyber relevant windows of opportunity. This effort is funded in PE 0208021F.\n\n5.  AIR FORCE INTEL ANALYSIS AGENCY (AFIAA): AFIAA provides tailored substantive intelligence assessments and imagery products for SecAF, CSAF and staffs. Directs and manages all overhead imagery requirements for civil air analysis, global Tactics Analysis, effects based characterizations for operational course of action development. AFIAA was previously under AIA and is now a component of the Intelligence Directorate at the Air Staff (HAF\/A2).  This effort is funded in PE 0208021F.\n\n6. RAPID CYBER ACQUISITION (RCA): Air Force Life-Cycle Management Center's (AFLCMC) C3I & Networks Cyber Integration Division provides capabilities in support of US national security interests, to counter future cyber threats, and to enhance the nation's ability to operate in cyberspace. Funding expedites modifications of USAF and DoD cyber capabilities to provide solution sets for cyberspace operations: attack, defense, exploitation, critical infrastructure support, combat support, command and control, information, and weapon systems. Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements.  Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0305881F.\n\nItems requested in FY14 are identified on the following P-40A and are representative of items to be procured.  Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements."
