It sustains Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that is technologically and\/or economically obsolete.  Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provides increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity and cost avoidances to Army Program Managers.  Programmed funding will be used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at the Redstone Test Center (RTC), Huntsville, AL and Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, AZ."

            "val": "FY14 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $1.615 million support the following:  At RTC, replaces instrumentation (accelerometers, fuel flow meters, pressure transducers, etc.) used to collect flight test data from all types of Army aircraft.  Also replaces the current RTC navigation instrumentation with a modern system that continuously measures aircraft attitude, rates, and Global Positioning System position data, used in aircraft navigation testing.  At YTC, procures replacement aircraft instrumentation for the time-stamping and on-board recording and telemetering of data from standard data buses and sensors; and on-board recorders and telemetry equipment that can meet the environment and data speeds needed for production base aviation programs.  Funding will also provide upgraded Kineto Tracking Mounts (optical tracking equipment) used for trajectory estimates for aircraft fired munitions in the evaluation, integration and fault isolation of aircraft weapons systems (allows remote control of mounts for safety during tests with live munitions) and procure laser spot position measurement systems (cameras with specific scoring software) that will be used to evaluate laser target designators during aircraft weapons platform tests.  \n\nThe majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life.  This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data is collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized.  Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers.\n\nAll COMPO 1 Active"
