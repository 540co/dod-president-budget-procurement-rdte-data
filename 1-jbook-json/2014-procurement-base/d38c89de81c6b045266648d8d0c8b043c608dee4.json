The systems support intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance applications, and the major focus of this program is to support functional training on the newest generation of intelligence systems with an emphasis on computer-based training systems through modeling and simulation.  This equipment is essential for preparing military intelligence personnel to support warfighting commanders.  The equipment supports intelligence training for AF personnel and members of all DoD services at Goodfellow AFB, TX."

GOODFELLOW INTELLIGENCE TRAINING ARCHITECTURE (GITA) UPGRADE: The GITA upgrade encompasses consolidation of the unclassified and classified training networks at Goodfellow AFB.  The funds procure specific infrastructure upgrades for the replacement of servers and increased storage capacity for required intelligence training systems that support initial and advanced intelligence training courses.  The increased student throughput for Language and Intelligence Analysts required this upgrade and increase of servers\/data storage.  These funds also support the development of the enterprise architecture, which consolidates multiple networks and systems into an integrated GITA.  The funds will procure additional hardware for modernizing interactive courseware development labs, workstations supporting scenario-based exercise training, and servers and network equipment needed to support software used in the field and combatant commands.  Funding for this program is in program element 0804733F.  Items requested in FY14 are identified on the following P-40A and are representative of items to be procured.  Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements."
