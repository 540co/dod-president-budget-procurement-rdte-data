            "val": "The Defense Message System (DMS) program is DoD's official system of record for Organizational Command and Control Messaging, as established under ASD C3I memorandum dated 12 April 2001.  DMS consists of a web-based enterprise level messaging system employing the Automated Message Handling System (AMHS) software, which provides a single, secure, global inter-service messaging capability extending from the sustaining base to the Warfighter.  DMS' tactical implementation supports the Warfighter in the joint task force environment and across the continuum of Army operations.    \n\nDMS is:  1. Meeting Army Campaign Plan Objectives through deploying and sustaining a global messaging system for Joint and Coalition forces.  2. Designed to meet the Net-centric requirements of non-repudiation (digital signature), data security (digital encryption), assured and timely delivery, message traceability and storage.  3. Providing Authentication and Confidentiality through High Grade Class IV Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) encryption. This guarantees the identity of senders and recipients with the assigned organizational PKI certificates, and messages are encrypted between drafting organization and receiving organization.  The Body of the message is unreadable to all except intended recipients with authorized access.  4.  Supporting administrative and intelligence traffic from the sustaining base to the battlefield.  5.A critical tool which aids in the Central Command Area of Operation (CENTCOM) direction of both US and Allied forces within Multi-National Forces-Iraq (MNF-I).  6.  The only messaging system that allows the regional Combatant Commands (COCOMs) to officially communicate with their Allied partners, and other Services and Agencies, at the operational level.\n\nThese are all Joint Army Knowledge Management (AKM) Goal 3 initiatives.\n\nAll funds support the Active component."
