            "val": "FY 14 base procurement in the amount of $1.468 million supports post evaluation procurement of successful SEP initiatives. This shortens the time required to field capabilities initiated under SEP. Items in this category include COTS\/GOTS\/NDI optics, selected night vision devices, Soldier-worn power solutions and individual Soldier equipment. Capabilities envisioned for procurement include the Binocular Night Vision Device (BNVD) which provide an increased night vision capability through the use of a binocular Image Intensifier (I2) device in order to increase situational awareness and depth perception and the AN\/PAS-29 Clip On Thermal Imager (COTI) which attaches to existing NVDs with a bracket allowing improved visibility in no-light\/low-light by detecting thermal images and residual heat.  \n\n\"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for the use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.\""
