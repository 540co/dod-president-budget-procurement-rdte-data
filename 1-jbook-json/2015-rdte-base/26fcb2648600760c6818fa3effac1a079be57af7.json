            "val": "The DOD's Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP) was established by the Secretary of Defense, who assigned centralized responsibility for DOD joint research and development of non-lethal technology to the Commandant of the Marine Corps as the Executive Agent.  The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics provides direct oversight of the JNLWP.\n\nThe efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&T) investment decisions provided by the Joint NLW Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that executes the JNLWP for the Commandant of the Marine Corps.  This direction is based on the needs and capabilities of the Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document.  This coordinated joint S&T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the best non-lethal technologies and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&T investment.\n\nThis program funds Advanced Technology Development of next-generation Non-Lethal Weapons (NLWs) and includes performing analysis, technical development efforts, and modeling and simulation necessary to ensure optimum weaponization and use of these NLWs.  Investment areas include research and development of next-generation NLWs such as: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal counter-personnel technologies (acoustic, optical, and human electro-muscular disruption technologies), and advanced non-lethal materials (including materiels for vehicle\/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications).  Next-generation NLW systems focus on long-range localized Non-Lethal (NL) effects to identified threat individuals (or groups of individuals) and\/or their threat weapons systems operating in complicated environments such as urban areas, crowds, buildings, vehicles, vessels, and also in close proximity to high-value civilian facilities.  By order of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, the Commandant of the Marine Corps was established as the Executive Agent for DoD Joint Non-Lethal Weapons RDT&E.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This reduction slows the advanced prototype development and demonstration of a smaller, lighter active denial technology demonstrator based on most promising and mature 95 GHZ source technology.  It also delays the schedule of the modular prototyping of High Power Microwave (HPM) component hardware and defers initiation of behavior response research and analysis."

Typical metrics include both the effectiveness of the technology, human effects and effectiveness, mitigation of high priority joint NLW capability gaps, and potential for compliance with policy and legislation.  Overarching considerations include the advancement of related Technology Readiness Levels and Human Effects Readiness Levels, the degree to which project investments are leveraged with other performers, reduction in life cycle cost upon application of the technology, and the identification of opportunities to transition technology to higher categories of development."
