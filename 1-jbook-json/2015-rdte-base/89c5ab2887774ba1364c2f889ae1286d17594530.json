            "val": "This is a Joint Service Program. This program provides for the development of Explosive Ordnance Disposal tools and equipment for use by all military services. The responsibility is assigned to the Navy as single service manager, by Department of Defense Directive 5160.62 of 26 April 1989, for management of the Joint Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal Research and Development Program. Proliferation of sophisticated types of foreign and domestic ordnance and Improvised Explosive Devices necessitate a continuing development program to provide Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel of all military services with the special equipment and tools required to support this mission. This program also provides life support related equipment necessary to support the performance of Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal tasks underwater. This equipment must have inherently low acoustic and magnetic signatures in order to allow the Explosive Ordnance Disposal technician to safely approach, render-safe and dispose of sea mines and other underwater ordnance. This program also provides force protection of all military services against Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIED) to prevent initiation. The Navy has been designated as DOD Executive Agent and Single Manager for Military Ground-Based Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Electronic Warfare (CREW) Technology by DOD Directive 5101.14 of 11 June 2007, requiring RDT&E to develop capabilities that meet joint requirements."

UXO includes foreign and domestic, both conventional and non-conventional, including Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). High Fidelity Weapons Mass Destruction performs detection and identification of hazardous materials contained in devices using radiological and biological means. Advanced EOD Robot System (AEODRS) consists of multiple interoperable robot systems.

Contracting for RDT&E, if required is always competitive and when feasible, production options are included.\n\n\nThis ongoing program capitalizes on a User Operational Evaluation System (UOES) effort involving Fleet operators engaged in tactical experimentation with prototype UUVs prior to fielding baseline systems and capability improvement package increments. These UUV operators also participate in detailed requirements analyses and definition. Operational capabilities with UUV have been realized at designated operational units, with a competitive acquisition strategy. The addition of enhanced capabilities through an evolutionary acquisition approach to the UUV toolbox is programmed for delivery in accordance with approved CNO requirements and ONR TTAs. Further improvements to the toolbox to add basic mine and underwater explosive threats neutralization capabilities will be pursued."
