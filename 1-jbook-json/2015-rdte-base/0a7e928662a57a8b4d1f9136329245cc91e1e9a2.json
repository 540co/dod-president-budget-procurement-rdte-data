This PE provides combat effectiveness and Operating and Support (O&S) cost reduction enhancements for the Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Stryker Family of Vehicles (FOVs) through a series of product improvements.\n\nThe strategy for Abrams and Bradley will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future.  This effort was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY 2011.  \n\nThe Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 and M2\/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles are at or exceed Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations.  In order to host and restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle programs will execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record.  The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams and Bradley Platforms.\n\nStryker Improvement program (EE2), will enable the Stryker Family of Vehicles (FOV) to host the future network without further degrading vehicle performance.  The upgrade will increase available electrical power while ensuring adequate mechanical power, weight margin, and cooling.  Combined with an in-vehicle network, this will ensure the FOV can host the future network while retaining its protection and mobility.  Funding in FY 15-19 supports continued development engineering efforts on the Stryker Engineering Change Proposal (ECP)."

To restore lost platform capability and to host other Army Existing Programs of Record, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle program shall execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs). ECP 1 improves vehicle's track and suspension while ECP 2 improves the power train and electrical system to enable the A3 fleet to host inbound technologies from Army Program of Records, including Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) and Joint Battle Command \u2013 Platfom (JBC-P). The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirement documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Bradley platform. ECP2 development effort will lead to a production start in FY17.  A separate integration effort begins in FY14 for an underbelly armor kit for improved survivability against blast threats.  Additionally, Improved FLIR (IFLIR) integration effort will begin in FY16 that will replace the current second generation FLIR for increased lethality through improved target acquisition capability."

The ECP is scheduled to field in FY 2018 to address powerpack and electrical power upgrades, which will enable the vehicle to host Army directed inbound technologies with no further performance degradation to the vehicle. This ECP development will be executed on a sole source cost plus incentive fee contract to the current platform Original Equipment Manufacturer. Integration of the Improved Forward Looking Infrared (IFLIR) sights will be executed through a sole source cost plus contract with the Bradley Original Equipment Manufacturer beginning in FY16. The IFLIR system will be developed by Project Manager, Night Vision\/Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (PM NV\/RSTA) and be provided to Product Manager Bradley as a Horizontal Technology Integration effort."

Product Manager (PdM) AMPV also held an Industry Day on 22 - 24 of April 2013 to support a competitive acquisition approach. Following the industry day, PdM AMPV revised the performance specification and acquisition strategy based on industry feedback. PdM AMPV held a Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 13 Aug 2013 for final release of the RFP to industry. The DAE directed the Army to re-evaluate the EMD schedule, LRIP contract and RAM Growth Curve.  Changes based on this direction resulted in the plan to release another draft RFP to industry on 26 Sep 2013."

In May 2012, Phase I (Design) of the Stryker ECP program was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and Double-V Hull (DVH) variants (completed).  In March 2013, Phase II approved upgrading the mechanical power, electrical power generation, chassis upgrades and the in-vehicle network for the DVH vehicles.  ECP Phase II contract awarded in Novermber 2013, continues development engineering, prototype build test and evaluation.  The Phase III (Production) decision point will determine the production requirements of the technologies selected in Phase II.  Beginning in FY15, PE Number 0203735A\/Project EE2 funds the Stryker ECP program, which was originally funded by PE Number 0603653A\/Project C03 (FY13) and Project C51 (through FY14)."
