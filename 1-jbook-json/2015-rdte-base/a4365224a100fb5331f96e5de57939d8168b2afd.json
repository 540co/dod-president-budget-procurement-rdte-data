Walking Papers, Multi-modal Hostile Fire Detection System (MHFDS), RAPTOR, NexTech, and HA\/DR-Test Center will continue project developments.  New projects for FY 2014 will include:  Augmented Reality Clip-On (ARCO), which provides a software implementation to interconnect with a host device to display real-time points of interest as a heads-up display (HUD) on a suite of night vision goggles (NVGs); Wide Field of View Enhanced Binocular Night Vision Device (WFOV eBNVD), which develops NVG prototypes to increase the operator\u2019s field of view by 250 percent and provide enhanced depth perception; and the Net-Zero Engagement project, which will identify more cost effective ways of engaging in unstable and transitioning states.  Other new projects for FY 2014 under consideration include: Multi-Medium Identification System (MMIDS), which will test and evaluate the effectiveness of a novel detector for threat and illicit material detection\/identification in objects and conveyance in a variety of environments; and Enhanced Expeditionary Engagement Capability (E3C) which will provide warfighter input to the development of a precision-guided 81mm mortar.  Additional projects will be developed and informed by Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research & Engineering), Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Rapid Fielding (DASD RF), Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO) objectives and focus areas."

This expanded effort to address maritime capability gaps builds on and leverages the Stiletto dedicated maritime demonstration vessel.  Stiletto is a maritime demonstration platform designed to assist in the assessment of prototypes and the rapid transition of emerging technologies across the range of military operations to higher Technology Readiness Levels.  Stiletto, an 88-foot long boat, is an experimental, all carbon fiber craft that was purposefully designed to rapidly acquire, integrate, and employ new capabilities to explore the military utility of emerging technologies and concepts of operation for special and expeditionary forces.  The Stiletto program, managed in partnership with the Naval Surface Warfare Center\u2019s Combatant Craft Division and the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division\u2019s Warfare Innovation Cell, streamlines the experimentation process and helps facilitate the rapid demonstration, exploration, and risk reduction of emerging technologies and capabilities.  The demonstration process also encourages system developers to engage directly with the warfighter in the maritime environment to rapidly adapt technologies around warfighter needs.  The Stiletto vessel is home-ported in Norfolk, Virginia."

The project\u2019s goal was to mitigate long-term technical risks by integrating and demonstrating a suite of technologies with the potential to assist the development of future heavy-lift, airship programs.  The technology may enable the development of a nascent class of air vehicle which will reduce the energy use per ton-mile of airlift operations, permit high-payload operations directly into and out of austere regions with little infrastructure and enable long-endurance manned or unmanned air operations.

These prototypes will be delivered to joint and Service users to evaluate operational capabilities under realistic conditions and against current adversaries or anticipated threats.  Potential venues for prototype assessment include assets such as the Stiletto Maritime Demonstration Program, Thunderstorm integration exercises and the Joint Experimental Range Complex (JERC) in Yuma, Arizona.  (The JERC experimentation venue is supported in part by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office\u2019s Rapid Reaction Fund.)  Knowledge and experience gained through those demonstrations will help develop new warfighting concepts and inform requirements and technical feasibility of future acquisition programs.  These initial prototype efforts will help reduce the cost of future acquisition programs and stimulate efforts beyond traditional defense industrial base activities.  Development of advanced prototypes will involve partnerships with industry and academia and permit operational users to gain insight into future technology-enabled strategies and tactics.

Utilizing low cost, commercial, existing Programs of Record, or low technology options outside the typical DoD acquisition business model, this initiative will demonstrate capabilities with the potential to disrupt and change warfighting that are suitable for rapid fielding and acquisition.  Disruptive demonstrations can be stand-alone technology, new processes, services, or concept demonstrations.  Projects will be selected in the execution year based on evolving iterative requirements from Joint and Service participants.  \n\nThese include demonstrations to examine and characterize DoD networks; cognitive Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) projects to enhance metrics of Theater Security Cooperation Plan (TSCP) activities; Command and Control (C2) tools during pre-conflict periods; and enhanced Operations Security (OPSEC) procedures to protect acquisition and operational data. Additional plans include:\n- Complete high-fidelity model development of four prototype to address urgent Combatant Command needs to support land-based defense assessments.\n- Evaluate performance of alternative uses of Service systems in response to a Joint Chiefs of Staff tasking to support land-based defense assessments.\n- Evaluate undersea capability options, and develop necessary models to respond to a Combatant Command tasking to support land-based defense assessments.\n- Leverage previously developed hypervelocity projectile models to evaluate Powder Gun defense in partnership with the Navy and Army; inputs risks and performance drivers into Land-based Railgun and Powder Gun test plans to support land-based defense assessments. \n- Expand development of and end-to-end Railgun and Powdergun engagement models that can be integrated with higher-fidelity threat models, to support land-based defense assessments."
