These funds will support the development and procurement of an enterprise-wide energy data warehouse that will be integrated with existing and future real property systems.  AT&L has already conducted a comprehensive requirements analysis for this prospective warehouse using funds provided through the now-disestablished Business Transformation Agency.  We have defined a standard set of energy information management requirements and are now assessing and planning which information management technologies (future and current) will best support them.

This is critical both from  audit readiness and program management perspectives.  New policies are in place, but business systems must be modified to support data requirements.  This funding is used to determine requirements for the Department's Real Property inventory records as well as to develop and procure an enterprise wide data warehouse that will be integrated with existing and future energy and real property systems.  This warehouse will collect, maintain, and report on the inventory and assist the Components to implement inventory requirements, including data accuracy and completeness.  Without funding the components will return to services agency centric processes that do not allow for total DOD accountability."
