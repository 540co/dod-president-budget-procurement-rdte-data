Particular focus is given to OT&E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).

DOT&E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.

Of these, 4 were full IA and IOP, 6 were IA only assessments, and 2 were IOP only assessments.  Eight other approved assessments were cancelled due to the down-scoping or cancellation of the CCMD\/Service exercise.  The operational impact against specific critical mission threads was assessed in the 10 IA assessments conducted in FY 2013.  A more rigorous process to incorporate advanced cyber threats and the use of validated cyber TTP\u2019s by the supporting Red Teams was initiated in FY 2013 and is expected to continue as a primary objective of the assessment program.  Fiscal year 2013 IA and IOP evaluations included trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across CCMDs.  Critical findings were transmitted to Service and DoD leadership for their awareness and remediation actions, as appropriate.  DOT&E continued efforts to support the full implementation on the CJCS EXORD as part of the assessment planning process, including development of threat assessments of the advanced cyber adversary and alignment Red Teams with these threat assessments."
