The array calibration work focus' on in-situ array calibration systems and array performance measurements. Planned and carried-out signal capture & identification efforts to include signal clutter source studies, noise source studies, participated in exercises to collect field source data, develop field clutter rejection methodology \/ algorithms, and False Alarm Rejection Methodology. Completed planning to evaluate options for performing an experiment to evaluate measurement performance of IMS stations from a planned underground or under water detonation. The explosion will be non-nuclear in nature and will be configured to include the release of radioactive noble gasses in concentrations acceptable to environmental regulations and of a nature suitable to challenge IMS measurement technology."
