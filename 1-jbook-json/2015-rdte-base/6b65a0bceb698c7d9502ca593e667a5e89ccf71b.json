It serves as the Department\u2019s primary catalog of architecture data holdings and provides users the ability to register holdings metadata and search, retrieve, and use DoD architecture data in federated architecture data repositories across DoD.  DARS provides a key component of the Department\u2019s net-centric data management capability by federating enterprise architecture data across the Department.  It enables alignment of program architecture components with the Federal Enterprise Architecture Business Reference Model - consistent with OMB directives for exhibit 300s - via the DoD Business Reference Model.  DARS implements a federated search capability and metadata catalog that will interoperate with the Department\u2019s Net-Centric Enterprise Discovery Service and enterprise content metadata catalog.  Architecture metadata is searchable using the DARS federated discovery web service.  The discovery search results provide links to architecture data that is retrievable based on user roles and access permissions.  Implementations are accessible on both the NIPRNET (unclassified) and SIPRNET (Collateral Classified).  Key features of the DARS program focus on: (1) Making architecture data visible, accessible, trusted, understandable, and interoperable (2) enabling reuse of validated architecture data to build \u201ccomposite\u201d integrated architectures; (3) enabling architecture analysis; and, (4) integrating architecture data into the DoD mainstream decision-making processes.  The Department of the Air Force, Army, and Navy CIO\u2019s are collaborating in the development of DARS federation web services via the Federated Joint Architecture Working Group under the auspices of the DoD Enterprise Architecture Summit to ensure DoD-wide access to and usability of all components of the composite DoD enterprise architecture model."
