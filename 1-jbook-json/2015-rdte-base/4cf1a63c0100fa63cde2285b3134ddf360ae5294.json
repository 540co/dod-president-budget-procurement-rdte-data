The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. \n\nActivities and efforts in this program examine concepts and technologies that enable the transformation to network centric warfare. Network centric capabilities rely on information to connect assets and provide timely and accurate understanding of the environment. The mission area requirements for rapid, accurate decision-making; dynamic, efficient, mission-focused communications and networks; and pervasive and persistent sensing drive network centric S&T investments. The program focus is investments in the following Enabling Capabilities (ECs): Combat Identification (ID) Information Management of Coordinated Electronic Surveillance; Automated Control of Large Sensor Networks; OCO Focused Tactical Persistent Surveillance, Globally Netted Joint\/Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander, Dynamic Tactical Communications Networks; Dynamic C2 for Tactical Forces and Maritime Operations Center (MOC); High-bandwidth, Free-space Lasercomm; Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance; Pro-Active Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance; Fast Magic; Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Space; Advanced Tactical Data Link; and Autonomous Tactical Persistent Surveillance. In the context of the Naval Transformation Roadmap construct, this investment will achieve capabilities required by FORCEnet (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Time Sensitive Strike; and Sea Based Information Operations), Sea Strike (Ship-to-Objective Maneuver), and Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense). \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

                                        "val": "The overarching objective of this activity is to develop high throughput dynamic wireless communications and network technologies critical to the mission performance and robustness of naval communications for widely dispersed, mobile air, land, surface and submerged platforms.  These platforms are often size, weight and power (SWaP) limited, and will operate under constraints of cluttered RF spectrum, harsh electro-magnetic interference (EMI) and Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) conditions.  The technical payoff is increased network data rates, interoperability across heterogeneous radios, dynamic bandwidth management, and greater mobile network connectivity.  The operational payoff is that warfighters from the operational command to the tactical edge have near real-time access to information, knowledge and decision-making necessary to perform their tasks, including coalition and allied forces.  Emphasis is on tactical edge communications and networks to fully realize net-centric warfare, bridging the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the 'disadvantaged user', e.g., small-deck combatants, submarines, unmanned vehicles, distributed sensors and ground units in urban and radio frequency (RF) challenged environments.  The current specific objectives are:\n\na) Radios and Apertures: Develop technologies for high band radio, electrically-small and actively scanned antennas, addressing critical issue of radio spectrum bandwidth efficiency, spectrum contention and clutter, agile frequency communications with dynamic spectrum access, all-digital front-end with wide dynamic range, power amplifier efficiency, multipath effects, saltwater propagation and BLOS communications. Develop algorithms and signal processing for space-time-frequency diversity communications, including measures for electronic protection, such as low-intercept, antijam waveforms and modulation.  Develop affordable antenna technologies for small size and weight, high radiation efficiency, and wideband operation with rapid beam-steering.  Develop alternatives to RF communications in airborne and terrestrial environments as well as high data rate underwater communications for undersea warfare (distributed sensor netting, unmanned underwater vehicle data exfiltration, submarine Communications at Speed and Depth) using electro-optic\/infra-red (EO\/IR) technologies.  Develop secure, high bandwidth communications systems and the exploitation of existing and emerging network protocols that will avail development of new, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) based data transport mechanisms.\n\nb) Tactical Networking and Network Control\/Management: Develop advanced networking techniques for robust, highly dynamic environments; interoperable networks for secure communications and protocols, bandwidth and network management techniques that manage and allocate bandwidth across tactical and theater levels in support of net-centric operations. Develop rapidly auto-configuring and self-organizing networks with efficient and survivable routing, secure authentication, mobility management and Quality-of-Service guarantee, while optimizing network resources.  Address low bandwidth, synchronization and reliability for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)\/middleware architecture in both mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) and infrastructure-based Internet Protocol (IP) backbone networks. Develop cognitive network planning and operations engines whose criteria are based directly on mission objectives, while self-adapting and managing the spectrum allocation and radio resources in such a way that network operations, SOA community of interest, and computer network defense are integrated to form a single common tactical network picture that requires a minimum of human intervention and skill.  Develop technology for improving tactical edge networking and for improving voice communications.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is the reprioritizing of the Development of optical communications technologies for underwater platforms and research into multi-modal networking across undersea platforms with acoustic, optical, and RF communications.  \n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

It focuses on the development of algorithms and software technologies that identify and integrate informational content from multiple sources, leading to decision aids that support user-cognitive processes.  Because persistent sensors are generating massive amounts of data, the focus is on technologies that not only integrate information from diverse sources, but also provide indications of information significance in ways that support the user's decision needs, regardless of location and operational situation.  To achieve this, it must be possible to automate understanding of the battlespace by identifying objects, determining relationships among the objects, assessing intent, and automatically generating courses of action with associated risks and uncertainty.  Effort will also be devoted to developing technology for increasing assurance and security for C3 information systems and technology for improving information discovery and information presentation in such systems.  The Nano Electronics Technology activity is focused on developing ultra-low power, higher performance computing devices and components that are based on novel functionalities of nanometer scale materials and are enabled by improved understanding of nanomaterials, new devices and circuit design concepts, as well as new architectures uniquely suited for nanoscale systems.  \n\nEffective in FY 2013, this activity title has been changed from Computational Framework and Methods for Rapid Accurate Decision Making to Applied Information Sciences for Decision Making in order to completely capture the work being performed.  \n\nThe current specific objectives are:\na) Data Understanding (Formerly: Automated Intelligence Tools): Develop automated, image and signal intelligence understanding tools based on rigorous mathematical and statistical methods that lead to improved change detection, improve object and activity detection and recognition capabilities, context and scene understanding, and inferring of the threat levels to support decision making and persistent and adaptive surveillance.\n\nb) Information Integration (Formerly; Battlespace Sensor and Intelligence Integration): Develop innovative methods for combining traditional and non-traditional data from sensors and disparate sources to provide the best estimate of objects, events, and conditions in the battlespace, in terms of their identity, associated error or uncertainty, context, impact, while inferring relationships and their intentions.\n\nc) Mission Focused Autonomy (MFA): Develop proactive situational awareness and rapid decision making applications and analytics with information PUSH as well as PULL, where joint human controlled and automated analytic processes can collaboratively work together to solve tactical and strategic problems within a multi-level, secure environment.  The MFA system contains the following elements: a) access to enterprise level structured and unstructured data repositories and automated search and discovery of evidence collected across these heterogeneous databases; b) analytics that automate the ability to infer the meaning of evidence that is discovered; c) structured process (hypothesis or argument) that provides context in order to constrain and guide the search and analytic techniques toward goals that are focused on proving the hypothesis right or wrong; d) knowledge repository that maintains pedigree and state of hypothesis satisfaction or refutation; e) Collaborative environment wherein all analytic participants can share the state of hypothesis satisfaction and collectively contribute evidence data to solve the common problem. Develop rigorous and efficient methods for building sophisticated situational models, and develop automated reasoning techniques to categorize and recognize situations under a variety of conditions leading to methods that predict situations under different settings.\n\nd) Resource Optimization (Formerly: Automated Decision Tools): Develop automated decision tools based on mathematically rigorous techniques (e.g., mathematical optimization) that support decision-making to ensure the best use of scarce and\/or expensive resources, achieving optimal allocations for large complex scenarios, including ones that contain uncertainty, in drastically reduced amounts of time.  Develop methods that support decision making in networked sensor management and allocation to ensure sensor assets are deployed in an optimal, or near optimal, manner.\n\ne) Trusted Systems & Networks (Formerly: Secure Sensor Networks): Develop tools and methods to securely handle information without exposing intelligence information about the networks or systems to adversaries. \n\nf) Nanoscale Electronics: To develop novel nanometer scale (feature size near or below 10nm) logic\/memory devices and related circuits and architectures to deliver ultra-low power, light weight and high performance computational capability for autonomous vehicles and individual warfighters. Effective in FY 2014, Nanoscale Electronics has been transferred from Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research to Applied Information Sciences for Decision Making in order to completely capture the work being performed.\n\ng) Quantum Information Sciences: Conduct research supporting the efficacy of a free space optical quantum key distribution that would operate in a maritime environment. Understand the implications of imperfect hardware implementations upon the vulnerability of the known protocols. Develop new protocols and encoding schemes that lead to robust performance with high throughput. Conduct research that leads to an understanding of, and develop methods that compensate for atmospheric effects.  \n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is a result of the expanded investment in Mission Focused Autonomy research and the transfer of requirements and associated funding for Nanoscale Electronics Research from PE 0602271N.\n\nThe increase of funds from FY2014 to FY2015 is for the development and demonstration  of new naval capabilities providing improved cyber situational awareness and cyber toolkit development to assess vulnerabilities in Naval networks.  The funds will also explore new technologies to prevent\/ isolate intrusions to Naval networks and explore automated approaches to cyber policy implementation management.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

The CNO's new Maritime Strategy and the Commander Fleet Forces Command complementary plan to revise organization of Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) place high priority on the aforementioned FORCEnet and Sea Power 21 goals.  Specific objectives focus on improving small team, platform, task force, and battle group operations by developing advanced human factors technologies for incorporation into operational systems.  The goals and payoffs are to enhance human performance effectiveness; improve the timeliness and quality of decision making; develop strategies to mitigate high workload and ambiguity; reduce manning; improve situational awareness and speed of command through a deeper understanding of human capabilities and limitations; and improvement of team decision making in ad-hoc, complex problem solving scenarios.  The current specific objectives are:\n\na) Human Computer Interaction\/Visualization: Develop an understanding of the limitations of human perceptual and attentional systems in relation to maximizing user performance when interacting with complex Naval displays.  A combination of computational, cognitive modeling and psychological studies are employed to determine the capacity limitations on human performance that will undoubtedly have impact in reduced manning requirements, including information-rich weapons platforms.  Develop technology for improving human interaction with autonomous systems and for improving virtual reality systems for training purposes.\n\nb) Collaboration and Knowledge Interoperability: Develop an understanding of the high-level cognitive processes underlying team knowledge processing, decision making and collaboration in order to improve team performance in the autonomous, agile, quick-response combat team of the future.  Develop cognitive, science-based tools, models, computational methods, and human-agent interfaces to enhance team collaboration effectiveness and team performance in complex problem solving scenarios.  Specific objectives include application of discourse analysis methods and other process metrics to assess team performance.  A conceptual model of team collaboration will be constructed and computational relationships among processes and team performance will be developed.  Findings will be validated and demonstrated in operationally oriented testbeds by addressing issues including: rapid team analysis of large volume, uncertain data; knowledge interoperability in coalition ops; measures of team situational awareness; accelerated team synchronization; improved heterogeneous team performance; team collaboration performance metrics; cultural\/language\/experience-free representation and transfer of meaning.\n\nc) Organizational Design and Decision Support Systems: Develop quantitative, executable models, task graphs and optimization algorithms for the organizational design of MOC, consistent with the Navy's New Maritime Strategy. Investigate through modeling and simulation human competency requirements for staffing MOC.  Develop quantitative formalisms for monitoring and assessing the completeness, consistency and accuracy of rules of engagement (ROE).\n\nd) Social Network Analysis: Develop computational models and algorithms for the analysis of terrorist threats and counter-measures, and strategies against terrorist threats.  Develop new computational algorithms for the discovery of missing and hidden nodes in complex graphs applicable to the problem of understanding hidden information in terror networks.  Develop new approaches to calculation of network completeness.  Develop computational approaches to the study of factionalism in social movements using Islamist movements as exemplar data collectivities.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the transfer of requirements and associated funding to the Human Factors activities in the Warfighter Sustainment Applied Research PE 0602236N, to provide an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all Human Factors investments in a single PE.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity:"

This research would extend ongoing research in lightweight robotic arms.\n\nAutonomous Refueling - development of hardware, algorithms, and sensors for hybrid rigid-compliant robotic arms in rapidly changing environments, with specific application to autonomous refueling of USVs, UAVs and UGVs while moving in their environments, advancing beyond the DARPA-sponsored \"Rapid Autonomous Fuel Transfer Project\".\n\nLow Power Micro-robotics - development of onboard sensors, control electronics, and actuators requiring very low power, with specific application to robotic missions over long durations.\n\nAdvanced Manipulators and Tool-Changers - development of innovative robotic manipulators, tool changers, and associated sensors for challenging robotic manipulation tasks, with specific application to EOD and other robotic missions in difficult environments. This research would extend previous research by providing robust end effector technology and tool changing capability. The overall research outcomes will enhance DoD capability in the areas of explosive ordnance disposal, autonomous vehicle refueling, and innovative robotic arm control. Research deliverables will include hardware development in the areas of lightweight robotic arms, end effector tools and tool changers, and low power electronics and actuators.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles:\n- This effort will draw from current research and push the technology development to the next level to provide a leap-ahead capability in long endurance, deployable, autonomous, robotic air vehicle using fuel cell electric propulsion systems for high efficiency, even in small vehicles, which can provide robust airborne sensor capabilities for submarines, UUVs, small naval platforms and small dismounted units.\n\nUndersea Vehicles:\n- Funding would be used to acquire a medium sized (12.5 inch diameter) Autonomous Underwater Vehicle as an at sea test platform to advance the state of art of onboard intelligent autonomy. This medium sized UUV is readily amenable to vehicle and sensor testing in the wave pool in the Laboratory for Autonomous Systems Research facility. Subsequently, this would allow at sea testing of State of the art autonomy algorithms (e.g. goal driven autonomy, human cognitive models, Markov decision processes) that allow Navy underwater vehicles to carry out complex mission in denied areas by understanding the environment and adapting mission goals in the context of the commander's intent, with little or no human operator intervention.\n\nAutonomous Systems Integration:\n- To support the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) (ASD(R&E)) priorities in autonomous systems, and specifically to advance the state of the art in heterogeneous teams of autonomous platforms, (including sensor networks and mobile communication nodes) that can work seamlessly with the warfighter, funding will be applied to small air platforms and militarily relevant unmanned ground vehicles to integrate sensors and advanced power sources, and to develop the autonomy software that allows the individual platforms to work together, as well as to work at a peer-to-peer level with the warfighter. This includes advanced human-robot interaction techniques and information processing and presentation techniques that reduce the warfighter's cognitive load and allows him to work with a team of autonomous systems."
