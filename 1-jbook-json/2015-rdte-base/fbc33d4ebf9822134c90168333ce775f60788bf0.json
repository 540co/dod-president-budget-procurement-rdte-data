            "val": "The Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) provides comprehensive Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) simulation capabilities which prepares warfighters to conduct dominant operations in:  air, space, cyber, ground, and surface domains an environment for theater-level, full spectrum combat training for Air Force\/joint\/coalition partners.  This reaches 22 geographically separated LVC locations across 17 time zones representing such assets as:  real-world weapon systems, operator-in-the-loop, and constructive or computer-driven simulations.  It is responsible for development and integration of scenarios, models, and databases and the integration of participating sites into Virtual Flag (VF) training events via numerous network connections, DMOC-developed interoperability tools, and controlled interfaces in support of Air Force, joint, and coalition warfighter readiness.  In addition, activities include DMO technology and capability studies\/analyses which support both current and future program planning and execution.   \n\nThe DMOC utilizes RDT&E funding for the following to enhance DMO training:\n\n1. Distributed Mission Operations Capability\/Battlespace Systems Development:  The DMOC upgrades and enhances the capabilities of various environment generators (i.e. DMOC is in partnership with the US Naval Air Systems Command  (NAVAIR) to enhance the capabilities of the Next Generation Threat System (NGTS) from version 2.4.14 to version 3.5 over the next two-three years that will provide blue air and other capabilities), DMO tools (i.e. the DMOC Replay Tool is regularly upgraded to allow for a more complete mission review and debrief capability of the exercises as more sites and systems are added to events (future development will include the Multi-Level Security (MLS) capability), Tactical Air Information Datalink-J (TADIL-J) Doctor-J tool allows tactical datalinks to be communicated and translated between differing simulator communication formats), and other capabilities that enhance DMO training (i.e. the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)\/Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) project continues the improvement of damage state models used by intelligence analysts in exercises, and DMOC develops solutions for introducing Contested Degraded Operations (geographical and communications jamming) into DMO events.  \n\n2.  Certification & Accreditation (C&A) and Networthiness:  The DMOC supports requirements definition, integration test support, scenario development, analysis, systems engineering support, and C&A and Networthiness of core systems, and it implements requirements of Information Assurance (IA) Risk Management Framework and Continuous Monitoring.  Efforts include C&A of the Distributed Training Network Guard, a DMOC\/NAVAIR partnership and accreditation work for the DMOC Replay Tool, Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) rule set, and the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) filter tool.   \n\n3.  Distributed Training Sites & Systems Integration:  DMOC integrates distributed training sites and systems for DMO training events such as Virtual Flag (VF) and Coalition VF (four-eyes event) by resolving interoperability issues between disparate systems and networks so that all exercise participants can interact in the DMO environment.  New sites and systems are incorporated into DMO events each year based on emerging higher headquarters and Combatant Commanders (COCOM) requirements.     \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

It is responsible for development and integration of scenarios, models, and databases and the integration of participating sites into Virtual Flag (VF) training events via numerous network connections, DMOC-developed interoperability tools, and controlled interfaces in support of Air Force, joint, and coalition warfighter readiness.  In addition, activities include DMO technology and capability studies\/analyses which support both current and future program planning and execution.   \n\nThe DMOC utilizes RDT&E funding for the following to enhance DMO training:\n\n1. Distributed Mission Operations Capability\/Battlespace Systems Development:  The DMOC upgrades and enhances the capabilities of various environment generators (i.e. DMOC is in partnership with the US Naval Air Systems Command  (NAVAIR) to enhance the capabilities of the Next Generation Threat System (NGTS) from version 2.4.14 to version 3.5 over the next two-three years that will provide blue air and other capabilities), DMO tools (i.e. the DMOC Replay Tool is regularly upgraded to allow for a more complete mission review and debrief capability of the exercises as more sites and systems are added to events (future development will include the Multi-Level Security (MLS) capability), Tactical Air Information Datalink-J (TADIL-J) Doctor-J tool allows tactical datalinks to be communicated and translated between differing simulator communication formats), and other capabilities that enhance DMO training (i.e. the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)\/Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) project continues the improvement of damage state models used by intelligence analysts in exercises, and DMOC develops solutions for introducing Contested Degraded Operations (geographical and communications jamming) into DMO events.  \n\n2.  Certification & Accreditation (C&A) and Networthiness:  The DMOC supports requirements definition, integration test support, scenario development, analysis, systems engineering support, and C&A and Networthiness of core systems, and it implements requirements of Information Assurance (IA) Risk Management Framework and Continuous Monitoring.  Efforts include C&A of the Distributed Training Network Guard, a DMOC\/NAVAIR partnership and accreditation work for the DMOC Replay Tool, Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) rule set, and the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) filter tool.   \n\n3.  Distributed Training Sites & Systems Integration:  DMOC integrates distributed training sites and systems for DMO training events such as Virtual Flag (VF) and Coalition VF (four-eyes event) by resolving interoperability issues between disparate systems and networks so that all exercise participants can interact in the DMO environment.  New sites and systems are incorporated into DMO events each year based on emerging higher headquarters and Combatant Commanders (COCOM) requirements.     \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
