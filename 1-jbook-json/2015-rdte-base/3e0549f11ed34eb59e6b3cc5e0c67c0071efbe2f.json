            "val": "The OSD HSCB Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need.  The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces\u2019 ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools, and prototypes.  Work under PE 0604670D8Z will create transition ready software tools that will help intelligence analysts, operations analysts, operations planners, wargamers, and others represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.  This program focuses on maturing, hardening, and validating human, social, culture, and behavior modeling software for transition to meet the needs of the warfighter, integration into the architectures of existing programs of record, and\/or maturing software via open architectures to allow broad systems integration.  The Program provides a development to product transition pathway for sociocultural models, tools, and capabilities to rapidly meet immediate and emerging warfighter needs.  The work supports the testing, validation, and transition of model-based technology into existing and developing systems in coordination with Program Executive Offices\/Program Managers, Combatant Commanders, Joint and Service organizations, warfighters in need, and other transition customers.  The Program will mature sociocultural relevant data and tools to provide essential sociocultural understanding and forecasting capabilities at the strategic, operational and tactical levels."

W-ICEWS ingested over 30 million news articles covering the last 13 years.  iSENT ingested 25 million documents per month, including social media data.  The ingest pipelines supported fusion and further analysis of the data, including sentiment analysis, instability monitoring, forecasting of events of interest, an event browser, and other analysis tools supporting both short-term and long-term analytics.  The programs are in operational use by a variety of government organizations and hosted at U.S. Southern Command and will be transitioned to the Global Adaptive Planning Collaborative Information Environment (GAP CIE) ISPAN program of record.  Validated social radar tools and methods for collecting sociocultural behavior data from open sources, including social media.  Applied tools for extraction, integrated analysis, and fusion of data at scale from denied areas.  Demonstrated the social radar tools in near real-time to support short-term and long-term instability monitoring."
