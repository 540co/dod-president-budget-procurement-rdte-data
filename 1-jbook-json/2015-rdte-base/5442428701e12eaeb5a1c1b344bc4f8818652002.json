            "val": "The Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) is a satellite ground terminal network comprised of two communication nodes and 15 antenna systems.  The antennas are distributed around the globe at eight locations to ensure global coverage for 170 satellites in various orbits.  The AFSC conducts an average of 450 satellite contacts per day supporting Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT); Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); Missile Warning; Communications; Weather; Launch Vehicle Support; Research and Development (R&D) in support of Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operations.  While most of the 450 satellite contacts\/day are routine command and control activities, the AFSCN is also used for satellite emergencies (e.g. tumbling satellite) because its high power antennas are often the only earthbound assets that can contact a non-responsive satellite to re-establish command & control.  In FY13 alone, the AFSCN supported 10 space vehicle emergencies resulting in the preservation of $6B worth of satellites.\n\nIn addition to routine and emergency satellite operations C2, the AFSCN provides support to launch vehicle and early orbit operations, ensuring worldwide antennas receive telemetry as the rocket travels through the atmosphere and and transmit commands to a newly orbiting satellite to initiate early orbit checkout.  Finally, the AFSCN provides Compatibility Testing (FCT) to eusuresatellites and rockets can communicate via the AFSCN before the satellite is launched.\n\nThese funds are used to develop next-generation tools to improve the AFSCN and ensure the capability is available to support DoD, Intelligence, and civil users through 2020.  \n\nMISSION PLANNING UPGRADE: the Air Force will complete the Electronic Scheduling and Dissemination (ESD) 3.0 program, enabling worldwide antenna system scheduling to support all 170 satellites.  Satellite operators will be able to request contact time with their satellites via the shared AFSCN antennas and ESD 3.0 will de-conflict overlapping requests, create a schedule, and publish real-time to all users. FY15 funds support transition and operational turnover of ESD 3.0.\n\nSATELLITE ANOMALY RECOVERY AND SUPPORT UPGRADE: The Air Force will complete development testing of the enhanced High Power Amplifier (eHPA) first article.  The AFSCN is in jeopardy of losing the emergency high power satellite contact capability due to obsolete parts used in the legacy AFSCN system.  The eHPA program will develop a new high power amplifier that resolves the obsolescence issue well into the 2020's.\n\nUNIFIED S-BAND UPGRADE:  The Air Force is adjusting the AFSCN for spectrum-sharing with industry and preparing to migrate away from the current L-Band uplink\/S-Band downlink spectrum to the Unified S-Band (USB) spectrum.  RDT&E funds support a first article integration of USB into the AFSCN to begin supporting users that are migrating to USB.  The first article will complete the development, integration, test, and demonstration of USB on the AFSCN as a pathfinder for contemplated, future, AFSCN USB modifications.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because it supports a fielded system."

In FY13 alone, the AFSCN supported 10 space vehicle emergencies resulting in the preservation of $6B worth of satellites.\n\nIn addition to routine and emergency satellite operations C2, the AFSCN provides support to launch vehicle and early orbit operations, ensuring worldwide antennas receive telemetry as the rocket travels through the atmosphere and and transmit commands to a newly orbiting satellite to initiate early orbit checkout.  Finally, the AFSCN provides Compatibility Testing (FCT) to eusuresatellites and rockets can communicate via the AFSCN before the satellite is launched.\n\nThese funds are used to develop next-generation tools to improve the AFSCN and ensure the capability is available to support DoD, Intelligence, and civil users through 2020.  \n\nMISSION PLANNING UPGRADE: the Air Force will complete the Electronic Scheduling and Dissemination (ESD) 3.0 program, enabling worldwide antenna system scheduling to support all 170 satellites.  Satellite operators will be able to request contact time with their satellites via the shared AFSCN antennas and ESD 3.0 will de-conflict overlapping requests, create a schedule, and publish real-time to all users. FY15 funds support transition and operational turnover of ESD 3.0.\n\nSATELLITE ANOMALY RECOVERY AND SUPPORT UPGRADE: The Air Force will complete development testing of the enhanced High Power Amplifier (eHPA) first article.  The AFSCN is in jeopardy of losing the emergency high power satellite contact capability due to obsolete parts used in the legacy AFSCN system.  The eHPA program will develop a new high power amplifier that resolves the obsolescence issue well into the 2020's.\n\nUNIFIED S-BAND UPGRADE:  The Air Force is adjusting the AFSCN for spectrum-sharing with industry and preparing to migrate away from the current L-Band uplink\/S-Band downlink spectrum to the Unified S-Band (USB) spectrum.  RDT&E funds support a first article integration of USB into the AFSCN to begin supporting users that are migrating to USB.  The first article will complete the development, integration, test, and demonstration of USB on the AFSCN as a pathfinder for contemplated, future, AFSCN USB modifications.\n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because it supports a fielded system."
