Per the CDD, the JATAS will be an advanced Missile Warning System (MWS) designed to replace the legacy AN\/AAR-47(V) MWS and increase the survivability of Marine Corps and Navy tilt-rotor and rotary wing aircraft against infrared threats. Additionally, the system will provide aircrew with warnings of laser-enabled weapon systems such as range finders, illuminators, and beam riders. The JATAS will interface with existing AN\/ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispensing System, existing AN\/APR-39 Radar Warning Receiver, existing Department of the Navy Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure system, and other compatible Directed Infrared Countermeasures systems as part of an integrated electronic countermeasures response to attacking infrared missiles. Additionally, the JATAS will provide Hostile Fire Indication (HFI) of small arms, rockets and other unguided threats and provide situational awareness in Visually Degraded Environments. Per the CDD, JATAS was developed into two increments. Increment I (Phase I) includes the missile and laser warning capabilities and cueing of countermeasure systems. Increment I (Phase II) adds HFI capability against Type I and III threats during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase of this program. Increment II will develop HFI capability against Type II threats. The Joint and Allied Threat Awareness System (JATAS) Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase is being executed via a Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) contract over an approximate 48-month period of performance, with one FPIF option for the low-rate initial production lot and Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) options for the first seven full-rate production lots. A JATAS Technology Development phase contract was awarded in FY2009 and the EMD contract was awarded in 4th Quarter FY2011. 8 test articles were developed for various test events in FY 2013."

This project includes the development, integration, and testing of a laser-based directed infrared countermeasure system for United States Navy and United States Marine Corps assault aircraft.  This infrared countermeasure, when integrated with a missile warning detection system, will be capable of countering current and emerging IR threats.  An USD (AT&L) Acquisition Decision Memorandum dated 15 April 09 designated the Army as the lead service for developing this capability for all rotary-wing, tilt-rotor, and small fixed-wing aircraft across the Department of Defense. It also designated the program as an ACAT ID Special Interest program.  The Army has designated the acquisition effort for this capability as the CIRCM program."

During this time the contractors will develop twelve test articles for various test events with emphasis placed on reliability in FY 2016. Contractor(s) will concurrently develop preliminary designs for the CIRCM system; conduct Systems Requirements Review, System Functional Review, and Preliminary Design Review Systems Engineering Technical Review events at appropriate times in the schedule.  Upon completion of TD, the Army will conduct a competition for award of Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract(s). The EMD phase will be no more than 26 months and will include Critical Design Reviews, Test Readiness Reviews, EMD test assets and extensive testing.  Following EMD there will be a yet to be defined Low Rate Initial Production phase where full qualification testing is conducted to support a First Unit Equipped date of FY 2018."
