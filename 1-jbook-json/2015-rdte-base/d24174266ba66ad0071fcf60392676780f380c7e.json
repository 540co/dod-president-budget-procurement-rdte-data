Resources will be allocated for architecture design and development, portfolio management, enterprise-wide systems engineering and operational impact analyses related to C3 and non-intelligence space systems. The Common Joint Tactical Information funding line responds to the Department's requirement for joint and combined network-enabled tactical data link (TDL) capabilities and for communications which meet net-centric standards to ensure interoperability and seamless integration with joint communication systems. It will be used to assess and promote competition across TDLs DoD-wide and to provide acquisition oversight of TDL-related activities such as CDL waveforms, Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN) narrowband TDL gateways, Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) and datalink roadmaps to guide future investments. This funding line provides resources for acquisition support and management oversight of critical command, control, communications (C3) and non-intelligence space capabilities as the Department migrates to netcentric operations.They will also be used to provide expertise required for exercising technical direction over design, performance and cost parameters of key systems and their dependencies. The goal of this funding is to eliminate redundancy, reduce time to the field, evaluate projects and concepts for adherence to net-centric guidelines, minimize performance and operational risk of developing and fielding complex major systems which rely on networks and supporting applications, ensure program dependencies are documented and included in acquisition decisions and address interoperability requirements, gaps and best value technical solutions. Typical deliverables associated with the instantiation of net-centric capabilities for these mission areas include network and vulnerability assessments, migration plans, investment strategies, roadmaps and technical guidance documentation."
