The NISS will be the next generation enterprise capability, replacing the Industrial Security Facility Database (ISFD).  Additionally, NISS will provide seamless integration of other DSS systems and applications, such as eFCL, OBMS, DD-254, and Mobile Workforce Applications.  NISS will provide DSS with a comprehensive enhanced capability to manage its entire mission portfolio.  NISS will improve information sharing and collaboration, providing timely and accurate data for decision-making in the hands of field representatives.  The system will provide agency-wide metrics to measure and improve agency performance in providing security oversight and the protection of national security.  \n\nThe National Contract Classification System (NCCS).  The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires that a DD Form 254 be incorporated in each classified contract, and the National Industrial Security Operating Manual (NISPOM)(4-103a) requires that a DD 254 be issued by the government with each Invitation for Bid, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quote. The DD Form 254 provides to the contractor (or a subcontractor) the security requirements and the classification guidance that would be necessary to perform on a classified contract. Contract Security Classification Specification required by DoD 5220.22-4, Industrial Security Regulation and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) is to develop a federated system for the oversight and management of providing classified information access and guidance required for the performance on classified contracts. The DD 254, an underlying business processes, is critical to ensure access to our Nation\u2019s classified information is properly safeguarded."
