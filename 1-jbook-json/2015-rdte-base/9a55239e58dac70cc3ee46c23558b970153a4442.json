Providing insight into the performance of proposed concepts extends Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) ability to address evolving threats for the warfighter.  \n\nTo rapidly assess innovative technology concepts, cutting-edge data-collection methods, advanced modeling techniques, hardware-in-the-loop testbeds, and high-performance computing platforms are developed by working directly with universities, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARC), and small businesses. \n\nSubject matter experts provide independent assessments of government, university, and industry technology concepts, which are used in concert with systems engineering requirements to support acquisition strategy decisions and define technology focus areas.  Structured concept definition and assessment methodologies enable analysts to quickly validate technology focus areas, verify contractor technology solutions and models, and evaluate promising concepts in candidate future Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) architectures.\n\nACPA initiatives identify algorithms, models, and mathematical relationships that, when combined in integrated simulations characterize component\/system key parameters and define performance expectations for all Advanced Technology programs. This methodology was proved successful in the analyses of the Standard Missile-3 Block IIB program, where independent government analysts were able to process modeled concepts from industry to analyze their contributions to the BMDS.  This Better Buying Power philosophy has been incorporated and applied to the earliest stages of technology development to maximize technology investments in a limited budget environment."
