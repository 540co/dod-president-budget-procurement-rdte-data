            "val": "The FY 2013 President's Budget submission was broken down into three projects to support the initial concept of execution of the Army's Agile process, they are:\n \nProject DV1; BCT Equipment Integration and Experimentation, in FY 2013 it provided funds for development of the NIE architecture, Lab Based Risk Reduction, systems integration engineering for the NIE of both platforms and the Network, A-Kit development and vehicle integration, coordination of the NIE events, risk reduction activities, NIE test activities and data collection and analysis, and troubleshooting\/fixing integration and network problems in support of the Network Integration Evaluation events. \n\nProject DU8; Systems Under Evaluation Analysis and Integration, in FY 2013 it provided funding for the Industry and government programs that meet or exceed known technological gaps and funds prototypes (if required), FSR support, and platform and network integration into the Army's Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) Events.\n\nProject DU9; System of Systems Engineering, in FY 2013 in provided for the development of the Army's Baseline System of System Architecture and associated standards and guidelines, the supporting System of Systems Engineering to develop the standards and guidelines for the Army and the development and implementation of the Army's Common Operating Environment (COE) standards and validation and verification of systems against these standards. \n\nThe FY 2015 funding supports all of the efforts to plan and execute NIE 15.2 and 16.1 and Tactical Capability Set Synchronized Fielding Events.  The specific evaluation requirements for these NIEs will be derived from the gaps identified by the users in the Afghanistan Theater and the lessons learned from NIEs 13.2 and 14.1.  Current technologies are selected for integration into each Tactical Capability Set based upon its operational maturity relative to the Army's needs and its cost and schedule.\n\nProject DY3; NIE Test & Evaluation, in FY 2015, it provides for the planning and conduct of detailed experiments (NIE evaluations), tests and evaluation of potential Network, Software and Hardware systems for procurement and integration into the Army's Warfighter system.  It includes all test support activities such as Blade time for Helicopters, Satellite time for the network, med evacuation, and protection for the soldier.\n\nProject DY4; Network Integration Support, in FY 2015, it provides for Network Integration of all Network Systems Under Evaluation (SUE) (industry and government) Hardware\/Software into existing Communications Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) System Integration Laboratories at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) to simulate the Brigade Network for NIE and determine if new capabilities successfully resolve know gaps.  It includes the refinement of US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) developed requirements and development of the sources sought, Request For Proposal (RFP) and Horseblanket in support of upcoming NIE Events.  It also conducts evaluations in the labs of industry and government SUEs to ensure the systems fulfill known capability gaps and are integrated into the network prior to going to the field base evaluation.  Provides industry feedback of performance in the Lab and Network.  Lab Based risk reduction is also funded by this line to improve Network performance prior and when in the field.  It also includes any hardware and Field Service Representative (FSR) support required to support the lab based integration and risk reduction,\n\nProject DY5; Production\/Fielding Coordination for Tactical Capability Sets, in FY 2015, it provides for the development and coordination of Programs to produce, integrate, and field the NIE evaluated Brigade improvements to the Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs).  This effort does not fund the production, or integration, or fielding of the Tactical Capability Set, but it does fund the coordination of requirements and integration along with scheduling of all activities for the Army through the supporting Program Executive Offices (PEOs), Program Managers (PMs) and Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOMs).\n\nProject DY6; Brigade and Platform Integration Support, in FY 2015, it provides for the integration of the lab developed network solution onto soldier and vehicle systems to ensure an integrated network across the Brigade and battle field and the facility support requirements to complete these efforts.  This includes contractor, FSR and Government support to conduct vehicle integration along with integration of the network and vehicles into a Brigade Combat Team (BCT) for the NIE test.  This project funds the hardware and FSR support from contractors to support integration and evaluation.  This includes the support for the four phases of integration and test evaluation conducted at the NIE.  It also includes de-modification of vehicles after completion of the event.  Provides industry and Army leadership feedback of performance from the NIE to decide what systems to procure and field as part of the Tactical Capability Set.  \n\nProject DY7; Army System Engineering, Architecture & Analysis, in FY 2015, it provides for basis of all Agile Process Planning and implementation.  This includes the System of Systems SOS engineering and analysis that creates the Army top level architectures, Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP), and design that feed the planned Tactical Capability Sets, NIE plans, and Army Program Objective Memorandum (POM).\n\nProject DZ6; Army Integration Management & Coordination, in FY 2015, it provides for all \"shared\" functions (Human resources, Budget development and executions, Acquisition, Operations, Program Coordination, Facilities management) and headquarters functions that supports the technical aspects of the Network integration, Platform integration, Brigade Integration and the Production Integration and coordination and synchronized fielding teams.\n\nExecution of the above projects is in accordance with the Army Acquisition Executive's NIE and TCS Business Execution Ground Rules dated August, 1, 2012."

It will also purchase any additional hardware and support above and beyond the contractors proposed support. For Government SUEs, this project funds integration support that consists of FSRs to support integration and the test. If the NIE program requires additional prototypes above and beyond the Program of Record it will also purchase this equipment. This project also funds keeping the Network baseline up to date so that integration is always into the baseline network."

Beginning with NIE 13.2 the government will continue to focus on identifying and evaluating against the Army's identified gaps. For FY 2013 and out the government will use one of two acquisition strategies. First the government will issue a sources sought request to fill the known gaps. The government will then use either an existing government contract or an Request for Proposal (RFP) as the means of solicitation for industry's participation in the NIE, and will also include the participant's production options."

Create an environment that empowers the Acquisition Community through an unsurpassed agile, collaborative, productive, lean and trusted information enterprise.\n\nThis project establishes the capability to develop & deliver the architecture products that facilitate analysis & trades and provide timely relevant information to inform decision makers and guide the Army's efforts. This project provides for the development and implementation of a comprehensive set of system architectures & analysis results that can shape the Army's priorities and processes, and ensures that the analysis & architecture development capability across ASA (ALT) is cohesive within the Agile process. It provides for the overarching view of the Army's Reference System of Systems Architecture requirements and organizational responsibility, it provides for single authority within ASA (ALT) for Reference System Architecture oversight to manage governance and approvals of emerging designs, it also ensures the linkage of architecture products to events, processes, and customer requirements.  It further establishes Reference Architectures for all Key components of the Network Architecture and all Army formations and installations, across time, that form the basis for representing and communicating the Army's programmed plan to Program Executive Officers \/ Program Managers (PEOs\/PMs).  It also enables trades and analyses that use these architecture data to support informed systems acquisition decisions across the life cycle. The data is organized in order to support views and analysis across organizational, portfolio, and budgeting bins.\n\nIn early 2012 the U.S. Army ASA(ALT) formally unveiled its Common Operating Environment (COE) Implementation Plan designed to help industry partners and Army program managers by offering an approved set of network standards, processes and products, designed to enable them to quickly and efficiently develop and field interoperable software capabilities.  The plan helps establishes and makes public Army Network technical standards, which any sized vendor can understand, internalize and build towards.  This will help increase competition and help lower software and hardware integration burden and costs. The implementation plan is a living document that will remain flexible as the Army continues to evolve its network standards and fielding methods.  The Army will continuously seek industry and service input as they transition to the COE.  This project provides for technical support to oversee the execution of the COE Implementation plan, COE Orchestration, Verification and Validation (V&V), and Governance. It also provides for the development and execution of COE integration policies and procedures, the development and implementation of backwards capability testing, integration checklists and their verification, test hardware development and implementation support.  Provides for COE architecture validation, design baseline validation, and the verification of COE reference architecture compliance. Provides for the accreditation, certification and refinement of test plans and events."

This project includes efforts associated with designing the Army's integrated network and associated architecture, developing the infrastructure and test plans, conducting the integration and risk reduction activities, evaluating the potential solutions, and determining the final solution set for the next Capability Package.  It includes all integration and test\/evaluations efforts for the Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) 13.2 and 14.1 events, which includes Lab Based Risk Reduction (LBRR), Network Integration, Software Loading Exercises (LOADEX) and checkout, comprehensive Communication Exercises (COMMEX), and culminates in the Army's Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) field event.  The specific evaluation requirements for these NIEs are derived from the gaps identified by the users in the Afghanistan Theater and lessons learned from previous NIEs.  \n \nThe Agile Process consists of the following phases, which are coordinated and executed by the System of Systems Integration (SoSI) Directorate, Brigade Modernization Command (BMC) and Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC): In Phase 0, Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) defines near-term gaps in current operational capabilities using existing Operational Needs Statements and relevant assessments from ongoing and past analyses.  This analysis will be the basis for requirement sets for future Capability Packages.  Network test and evaluation will focus on improving and integrating emerging and existing technologies to minimize existing operational gaps.  During Phase I, SoSI solicits potential solutions from existing Army programs, tech base programs, and industry.  Also during this phase, SoSI obtains buy-in from stakeholders, funding and support, establishes initial objectives, solidifies architecture objectives, and establishes the viable candidate list for the NIE.  During Phase II, SoSI compiles the list of potential solutions that could meet the identified gaps and begins to develop the integration and testing concepts for the next capability package.  Phase III includes the coordinated efforts between BMC, ATEC and SoSI to finalize the brigade architecture, integration and test plans, training materials and combat mission evaluations.  Phase III also includes the initial integration phase where industry and Department of Defense (DoD) network hardware and software are integrated and initially evaluated for follow-on consideration at a government integration and test facility located at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG).  The results of this initial evaluation determine which industry and DoD SUEs continue in the NIE process.  It also develops the initial network configuration that will be used in execution of the NIE field event.  During Phase IV, SoSI details plans and executes the integration of all hardware and software into the brigade network.  The integration is validated and verified through the LBRR process.  In Phase V, SoSI executes the in-depth NIE field event.  Results of the NIE field event address and answer senior Army leadership's questions about force makeup and effectiveness, and provides Army leadership recommendations for improving operational requirements and enhancing technical specifications.  The results of Phase V are utilized during Phase VI, where the Army determines which systems to procure and field to improve the Army's Network.  \n\nThis project includes the following government efforts: System of system architecture and design standards for the NIE, Brigade Combat Team (BCT) Integration to support the NIE (hardware and software), A-Kit development and fabrication to support network integration onto platforms, integration of program of record, and non-program of record equipment and systems (both hardware and software) into a single synchronized network, BCT simulation to determine solution sets to potentially fill gaps, BCT experimentation and testing to validate and verify the increased capability for the soldier, and BCT Synchronized Fielding (logistics and training).  Based on feedback from integration and testing, SoSI provides input and changes to both operational requirements and technical specification for improved operational capabilities.  This project includes support to other DoD agencies for joint programs and collaboration efforts with SoSI and Capability Package portfolio integration.  The government effort includes cost for salaries, travel, overtime, training, supplies, facilities, and Information Technology (IT) support.\n\t\nFY 2014 will continue the NIE gaps and evaluation process.  For example, during NIE 13.1 there were 5 Systems Under Test (SUTs) and 24SUEs evaluated against one of the Army's nine NIE 13.1 gaps.  Out of the 96 SUE candidates that responded to the solicitation for NIE 13.1, the number of systems evaluated were 5 Systems Under Test (SUTs) and 24 SUEs.  The NIE 13.2 gaps are: (1) Commander's Applications for Mobile and Handheld Platforms, (2) Brigade S6 Staff Element Working Group, (3) Command Post Collaboration and Visualization, (4) Company Information Architecture, (5) Network Operations Visualized in the COP, (6) Aerial Layer Network - Air Ground Integration, (7) Cyber Electromagnetic (CEM) Staff Element, and (8) Integrated Employment of LandWarNet.  The NIE 14.1 gaps are: (1) Brigade\/Battalion Company Command Post Mobility and Scalability, (2) Commander's Applications for Mobile and Handheld Devices , (3) Network Visualization on the Common Operational Picture, (4) Integrated LandWarNet, Installation Networks and Training Resources, (5) Aerial Layer Network Extension, (6) Air\/Ground Network Architecture Roamers, (7) Low Overhead Products and Enablers for Home Station Small Unit Training, (8) Operational Energy \u2013 Monitor and Manage System Power, Supply and Demand, and (9) Operational Energy \u2013 Reduce Reliance on Petroleum Based Energy."

The project will conduct the actual Network Integration Evaluation at White Sands Missile Range, NM which evaluates the integrated soldier and weapon systems operational impact on the brigade to include DOTMLPF.  The results of Phase V will address and answer senior Army leadership's questions about force makeup and effectiveness and provides Army leadership recommendations for improving operational requirements and enhancing technical specifications.  The Army leadership will then determine which systems to procure and field in future Tactical Capability Sets to improve the Army's Network and Brigade Capability.  This project includes government and contractor efforts to develop detailed test scenarios and evaluation criteria for field based evaluations of the Brigade Combat Team, and then conduct the evaluations and verifications of the Brigade as part of that NIE. As part of the evaluation process, this project includes the development of the data collection plans, the instrumentation of the systems in the Brigade, and also the data collectors and analysis of the test results.  This project also includes the development and distribution of the detailed, technical evaluation reports which provides the ability to identify which equipment; needs further development, is ready for NIE participation, or is ready for integration into a future Tactical Capability Set.  Lastly, this project includes all the costs for supporting the test, such as, but not limited to; SATCOM satellite time, MEDEVAC support during test, helicopter blade time, POL and other test support materials, equipment, personnel and facilities."

Phase I solicits potential solutions from existing Army programs, tech base programs, and industry to eliminate capability gaps in the current force structure.  It establishes initial objectives, solidifies the architecture baseline and will establish a viable candidate list for Network Integration Evaluation (NIE).  During Phase II, the project supports the compilations of potential solutions that could meet the US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) identified gaps and begins to develop the integration and testing concepts for the NIE.  Phase III includes the coordinated efforts between System of Systems Integration (SOSI), Brigade Modernization Command (BMC) at Ft Bliss and the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) to finalize the brigade architecture \"horseblanket\", integration and test plans, training materials and combat mission evaluations.  Phase III also includes the initial integration phase where industry and government System Under Evaluation (SUE) hardware and software are integrated and initially evaluated for follow-on consideration at Aberdeen Proving Ground's (APG) Communications Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) labs through the Lab Based Risk Reduction (LBRR) process.  This effort continues into Phase IV as the network matures and becomes functional in the Lab.  The results of this detailed lab based testing\/evaluations will determine which industry and government SUEs will continue in the NIE (Phases IV\/V of the Army's Agile Network Integration process) and develops the initial Network configuration that will be used in NIE.  It also reduces risk to NIE execution by testing the Network in the lab, resolving issues found in the Network lab test and optimizing the Networks performance.  This is done in a lab environment that facilitates very efficient, cost effective determination of problems, and their subsequent corrections.  This project provides for Network Integration of all SUEs (industry and government) Hardware\/Software into existing CERDEC System Integration Laboratories at APG to simulate the Brigade Network for NIE and it determines if new capabilities successfully resolve known gaps and meets network performance requirements.\n\nFor industry SUEs, this project will integrate the industry SUE into the Network at the CERDEC labs which helps industry to include small businesses, interface and integrate with Government programs of record with unique military secure interfaces and protocols.  It also provides industry with technical assessment of their products in respect to Army know gaps\/requirements.  Purchase of any additional hardware and support above and beyond the contractors proposed support if required for Lab Based Risk Reduction is also funded within this project.  For Government SUEs, this project funds integration support at the CERDEC Labs.  If the NIE program requires additional prototypes above and beyond the Program of Record for the Lab based Risk Reduction, it will also purchase this equipment. This project also funds keeping the Network baseline up to date so that integration is always into the current baseline network."

But there are exceptions, which yield cost such as ensuring small business can participate and if the government needs additional FSR support or hardware to fully represent the Brigade requirements.  For FY 2013 and out, the government will use one of two acquisition strategies; First the government will issue a sources sought request to fill the known gaps (utilizing current practices), or the government will use either an existing government contract or a Request for Proposal (RFP) as the means of solicitation for industry's participation in the NIE, the RFP and contracts this will include a participant's production option. The Sources Sought process will be used to help clarify gaps definition and solution sets, where as RFPs will be used when the government's technical community can define the commodity desired to fill a gap with clear and concise selection criteria.  The Army is developing a DA PAM to document this process."

This project request funds for the coordination of the required activity plan with the applicable Program of Records (PEOs\/PMs). This project does not fund the actual production, integration, nor fielding costs associated with the Tactical Capability Set. This project includes government and contractor efforts to integrate and validate that the Army is fielding platforms, components and software that are integrated together to provide increased capabilities for the soldier that are supportable and trainable.  \n\nThis project includes the following efforts: Provides oversight and direct coordination between participating PEOs, PMs, RDECOMs and the Army's Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) receiving the Tactical Capability Set package, throughout all phases of the Vehicle Integration and Synchronized Fielding process.  This begins with an assembly of multiple programs of record (PORs) integrated into the Army Network to achieve enhanced network performance IAW the requirements validation, content and execution priorities received from the Army G-3\/5\/7 (DAMO LM).  The Capability Set process development is structured by working with the PORs to define materiel systems Basis of Issue (BOI)\/Network Architecture by type of Brigade Combat Team (BCT).  Capability Set products that have been Materiel Released\/Type Classified, have production funding and production are aligned a single Integrated Master Schedule for design integration, testing, production, kitting, platform integration, training and fielding.  This project also includes the direct support during each of the unit's \"New Equipment Training\" and \"New Equipment Fielding\", along with the preparation for the BCT's rotation through one of the Army's Combat Training Centers, (Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) or National Training Center (NTC).  Upon completion of the Combat Training Center (CTC) rotation the support teams provide oversight to ensure that all training assets are reset and moved to the follow-on BCT and that all After Action activities are closed out.  This project also includes coordination with DA staff for synchronization of NIE with Integration and Interoperability events leading to Army Interoperability Certification and coordinating mission command Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) baseline to support fielding. \n\nThe FY 2015 funding is supporting the CS fielding in CY 2015 and also conducting the planning for CS 16.  During FY 2015 the Army's current plan is to conduct seven (7) Tactical Capability Set-Sync Fieldings (CS-SF) and one (1) Division Headquarters utilizing three CS-SF teams."

But there are exceptions, which yield cost such as ensuring small business can participate and if the government needs additional FSR support or hardware to fully represent the Brigade requirements.  For FY 2013 and out, the government will use one of two acquisition strategies; First the government will issue a sources sought request to fill the known gaps (utilizing current practices), or the government will use either an existing government contract or a Request for Proposal (RFP) as the means of solicitation for industry's participation in the NIE, the RFP and contracts this will include a participant's production option. The Sources Sought process will be used to help clarify gaps definition and solution sets, where as RFPs will be used when the government's technical community can define the commodity desired to fill a gap with clear and concise selection criteria.  The Army is developing a DA PAM to document this process."

It creates a system of systems level environment that empowers the Acquisition Community through an unsurpassed agile, collaborative, productive, lean and trusted information enterprise. This project includes support to other DOD and international agencies for joint programs and collaboration efforts with NIE and Force Basing\/Tactical Capability Set portfolio integration.  The Government effort includes costs for salaries, travel, overtime, training, supplies, facilities, and IT support.\n\nThis project establishes the capability to develop and deliver the system of system engineering, analysis and architecture products that facilitate analysis & trades and provide timely relevant information to inform decision makers and guide the Army's modernization efforts.  This project provides for the development and implementation of a comprehensive set analysis and system architectures that shape the Army's priorities and processes, and synchronizes the enterprise architecture development capability across Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA (ALT)) is cohesive within the agile process.  It provides for development and maintenance of the overarching end-to-end LandWarNet (LWN) Network Capability Set (NCS) System of Systems (SOS) Reference Architecture with included NCS SoS Specification and all Army formations that form the basis for representing and communicating the Army's programmed plan to HQDA customers and Program Executive Officers\/Program Managers (PEOs\/PMs).  The LWN NCS SoS Reference Architecture is composed of the NCS Institutional Capability Set SoS Reference Architecture and the NCS Operational Capability Set SoS Reference Architecture. The Institutional Capability Set is composed of the Enterprise Component and Installation Component. Communications and computing for Base Camps and Brigade Combat Teams are included in the NCS Operational Capability Set. It enables analyses and trades that use the reference architecture design data to inform implementation architectures and support informed systems acquisition decisions across the life cycle.  It provides for single authority within ASA(ALT) for System of Systems Implementation Architecture oversight to manage governance and approvals of emerging system designs, it also ensures the linkage of architecture products to events (NIE, CS, Weapons Systems Reviews (WSRs), Integrated WSRs (I-WSR), supporting the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) process)), processes, and customer requirements.  The data is organized in order to support views and analysis across organizational, portfolio, and budgeting bins.\n\nAmong the key products\/processes developed by SOSE is the System of Systems Engineering Management Plan.  This plan provides the disciplined and coordinated SoS analysis, engineering and architectural products in order to support strategic and enterprise decision making, efficient capability growth and effective Army modernization.  Another is the Common Operation Environment (COE) vision, strategy, and implementation plan for the Army that aims to converge solutions to a common framework, increase cyber security, decrease life cycle costs, and improve interoperability, and leverage industry and GOTS solutions.  These documents establish and expose to industry the technical standards, which any sized vendor can understand, internalize and build towards.  This efficiency helps increase competition and helps lower software and hardware integration burden and costs.  The implementation plan is a living document that will remain flexible as the Army continues to evolve its network standards and fielding methods.  The Implementation Plan calls for the Army to continuously seek industry and service's input throughout the COE life cycle.  This project provides for technical support to oversee the execution of the COE Implementation plan, COE Orchestration, Verification and Validation (V&V), and Governance.  It also provides for the development and execution of COE integration policies and procedures, the development and implementation of backwards capability testing, integration checklists and their verification, test hardware development and implementation support.  It provides for COE architecture validation, design baseline validation, and the verification of COE reference architecture compliance."
