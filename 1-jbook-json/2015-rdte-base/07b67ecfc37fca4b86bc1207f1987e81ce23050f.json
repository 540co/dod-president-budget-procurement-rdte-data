            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE primarily develops and demonstrates prototype Mine Countermeasures (MCM) and Expeditionary Warfare system components that support capabilities enabling Naval Forces to influence operations ashore.  Third-world nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics, throughout the littoral battlespace.  Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat.  Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective.  This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities.  It supports the MCM-related Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (ECs).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three key transformational capabilities required by Sea Shield as well as technically enable the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within Sea Strike.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This activity supports the development and transition of technologies for the MCM-related FNCs.\n\nThis S&T investment supports the Joint Requirements Oversight Council of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) validated requirements for MCM.  This S&T investment of mine and obstacle detection provides critical S&T transitions to the Mine Warfare Mission package of the Navy's new LCS.  This investment in MCM S&T is reported as part of OPNAV's annual report to Congress in the MCM Certification Plan.  This plan is reviewed and approved by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and any deviations in ONR's reported S&T funding for MCM throughout the Future Years Defense Plan must be reported and justified through Navy and OSD.  Further, the MCM S&T investment plan structure is reviewed and authorized by the Navy's Technology Oversight Group that approves ECs, their supporting products, and funding profiles.\n\nFunding increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 due to the initiation of a laser interfermetric sensor\/system that can be integrated onto various platforms including EOD robots for detection and\/or diagnosis of buried objects. Highly dexterous dual manipulator systems will also be initiated in FY14 that can be integrated onto EOD robots for precision render safe and neutralization missions."

Another important metric is the scheduled transition of 6.3 advanced technology projects from the FNCs program into Navy and Marine Corps acquisition programs at agreed upon Technology Readiness Levels.  Technology-specific metrics include: Mine warfare data fusion capabilities yielding a 10%-25% reduction in time and risk to mine hunting activities; Mine hunting sensors - Probability of Detection = 95%, Probability of Identification of Proud Mines = 90%, Probability of Classification of Buried Mines = 80%; Unmanned Systems for MCM sized for inclusion in the Littoral Combat Ship Mine Warfare Mission Package; MCM sensors sized, packaged and capable of 12 hour missions with a search rate greater than .05 square nautical mines per hour; Mine sweeping: Modular magnetic and acoustic influence sweeping systems packaged for deployment from Unmanned Surface Vehicles; Minesweeping single sortie coverage > 9.4 square nautical miles at 20 nautical miles per hour during a 4 hour mission up to Sea State 3; Surface-laid mine and obstacle breaching capability > 90% in the Beach Zone (BZ) using unitary warheads, and > 80% in the Surf Zone (SZ)."
