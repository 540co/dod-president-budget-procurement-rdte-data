These in turn support the major research areas of the Navy and Marine Corps: Autonomous Systems; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Marine as a System; Information Analysis and Decision Support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Logistics; Materials; Operational Environments; Platforms; Power and Energy Technology; Sensors and Electronics; Warrior Performance and Protection; Weapons and Support (Education and Outreach).\n\nS&T investment in basic research also includes the National Naval Responsibilities (NNRs), fields upon which a wide range of fundamental Naval capabilities depend.

In the past, the Basic Research Challenge Program has been integrated into the legacy R2 Activities to illustrate its alignment with the mainstream Naval research disciplines, but with this update BRC is being identified as its own R2 Activity to call attention to the significance it provides to new areas of Naval importance.  The program stimulates new, high-risk basic research projects in multidisciplinary and departmental collaborative efforts, and funds topics that foster leading edge science and attract new principal investigators and organizations. Basic Research Challenge awards are for a period of four years. Topics are submitted by ONR program officers and are selected for BRC awards by ONR's director of research. Basic Research Challenge award topics are then issued as a broad agency announcement.\n\nIn FY 2014 the BRC is being identified under its own Research Activity to highlight its more prominent role in stimulating competitive multidisciplinary research between ONR departments. BRC research by its nature will likely cross the traditional Research Activity boundaries and produce standout results worthy of specific focused attention.  \n\nFunding decrease in FY 2015 due to normalization of annual investment following initial emphasis in program research."

Initial research focus is generally conducted in an unfettered environment because of the nature of basic research, but as more is learned and applications emerge, individual research projects take on a more applied focus.  Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs.  Example metrics include a biporous wick structure for thermal management of power electric modules capable of removing 900 watts per square centimeter which was recently developed by an academia\/industry team.  The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's congressionally directed \"Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research\" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively."
