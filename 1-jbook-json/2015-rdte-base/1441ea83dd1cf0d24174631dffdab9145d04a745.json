Provides for rapid implementation of US BICES Extended (US BICES-X) capabilities into the Distributed Common Ground\/Surface System (DCGS) and the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) intelligence decision applications and data mechanisms in support of the Under Secretary of Defense's (Intelligence) mission to ensure necessary intelligence information is being acquired, analyzed, and disseminated rapidly among our allies and coalition partners.  Develops US BICES-X as the \"enduring\" coalition intelligence support element of the DI2E.  Continues the development of the Trusted Network Environment (TNE) multi-level security database, web, and e-mail capabilities for U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), U.S. European Command (EUCOM), U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), and U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM).  Supports the research and development of 50+ High Assurance Connection Interfaces to Combatant Command identified bi-lateral and multi-lateral partners, develops the multi-level security rule sets and develops Ozone Widget Framework with applicable cloud widgets that can transverse the multi-level security boundaries.  Develops, tests, and integrates intelligence mission applications that interface with and support the development of the DoD\/CIO Coalition Partner Network (CPN).\n\nFunding transfers to Air Force starting in FY 2015."

Provides an increase in intelligence disciplines (Imagery Intelligence, Signal Intelligence, and potential Human Intelligence ) in support of US and Allied\/Coalition forces that currently is very limited to the warfighter.  Increased intelligence advanced analytics tools will be migrated from Joint Intelligence Operations Center-IT and DI2E developments and will significantly increase the timeliness of intelligence and bring US BICES\/NATO Special Operations Forces Headquarters\/NATO Intelligence Fusion Center capabilities into the current technology baselines.  Develops and provides a federated TNE that incorporates the Asian Pacific Intelligence Information Network being developed to support the National Defense Strategy as we transition out of Afghanistan and into the Pacific.  Provides multi-level security intelligence bi-laterals and multi-laterals to meet Combatant Commander Integrated Priority Lists.  Develops the Coalition Partner Network for CENTCOM, the Coalition Information Exchange Network for SOUTHCOM, and the Coalition Partner Network for EUCOM and AFRICOM.   Develops the US BICES connections with these bi-lateral and multi-lateral federated TNEs that make up the US BICES-X Enterprise Network in support of Commander SOCOM requirements for conventional and coalition operations as the US migrates into other Combatant Command regions."
