Equipment DMS issues will be resolved to support continued production and installation of requirements for the C-5 fleet.  Further, DMS issues will be resolved to support continued operations through studies, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, development, and redesign efforts.\n\nThe current C-5 lavatory system suffers inoperability and leakage of liquid sodium hypochlorite causing severe corrosion and burnt wires in the landing gear control panels.  A redesign of the Mission Systems Equipment program will increase safety, mitigate risk, and reduce man-hours required to repair extensive damage. \n\nBA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The strategy is for the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Aero (LMA), to procure the core mission computer chips and weather radar, integrate and test those components, and install on two (2) EMD aircraft. The LMA negotations were completed 4 Feb 14 and have an expected contract award date of March 2014. The contract method is sole source. The contract type will be predominately CPIF (Cost Plus Incentive Fee) with some FFP (Firm Fixed Price) elements. The mission systems equipment redesign will require RDT&E funding for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) proofing. Funds are required for validation and verification of the lavatory design and installation. The Mission Systems Equipment contract method was competitive through the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC). Wyle Science, Technical, and Engineering Group is the selected source, and the contract type is Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)."
