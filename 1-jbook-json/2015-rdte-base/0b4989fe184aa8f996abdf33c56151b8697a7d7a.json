This specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  These operations are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success."

SOF often deploys as small, independent, quick reaction, foot-mobile teams independent of primary logistics support. Existing weapons and combat equipment are frequently unsuited to these conditions.  Sub-projects include:\n\nWeapons Accessories (WPNAC).  This program effort enhances all SOF weapons, both individual and crew served, by leveraging the latest technological advances in optional accessories (up to 30 different functions\/capabilities) such as day scopes, clip-on night scopes, active aiming laser module, visible lights, grenade launchers, suppressors, hand grips, and close quarters battle sights. Miniature Day-Night Sight (MDNS) for Crew-served Weapons enhances all SOF weapons, by leveraging existing image intensification and thermal technology to improve combat effectiveness for all crew served weapon systems.  Development efforts include test and evaluation of the Advanced Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Laser (ATPIAL) hardening to withstand the live-fire shock profiles for the Combat Assault Rifle (CAR), Visual Augmentation Systems (VAS), and Family of Muzzle Breaks and Suppressors (FMBS).  Leveraging extensive modeling and simulation efforts executed by National Labs, competitively award RDT&E contracts to select vendors to develop suppressors and flashhiders for select SOF weapon systems. These accessories greatly improve the combat effectiveness of the weapon systems and the survivability of the SOF operator."
