Funding levels in each thrust area may vary from year to year.  Research will address the goal of assisting the DoD to retain a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries in the area of software-intensive systems.  The four main thrust areas are:\n\n1) Measurement techniques for the effectiveness of software technologies and methods.  Modern tools, integrated development environments, and software engineering processes have captured large data sets about development activities.  This thrust seeks to study the metrics that affect cost, schedule, quality, and performance based on real-world observation and experiment.  \n\n2) Design principles and tools for evolvable, scalable ecosystems.  The commercial world has many successful examples of software ecosystems, but the DoD has not capitalized on these to the same extent.  This thrust looks beyond implementing ecosystems in a DoD context and seeks to implement the underlying principles in a way that makes automated creation, evolution, and scaling of ecosystems easier.\n\n3) Models of Computational Behaviors.  System performance depends on end-to-end models of computational behavior that include the user, architecture, source and object code, firmware components, and processor hardware.  This thrust seeks to study emerging ideas that better model end-to-end computational behavior.  \n\n4) Cyber-tradecraft and analytics.  Cyberwarfare is an increasingly important and rapidly evolving dimension on the modern battlefield.  This thrust seeks to investigate methods that will give the DoD enduring advantages in the cyber battlespace such as reverse software engineering, automated code & malware analysis, code-level software resiliency (e.g., randomizing and time variant techniques), and other techniques such as those found in the Software Security Assurance State-of-the-Art Report.  \n\nThe SEI Applied Research PE will also conduct research in multicore computing, architecture-led iterative incremental development (Agile at scale); and emerging software and computer science areas that can act as catalysts for acquiring DoD systems with improved performance."
