Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements, a thorough market survey, and development of a viable acquisition strategy.  \n\nSince the program's inception in 1980, OSD has initiated 671 projects; 619 projects have been completed to date.  Of the 324 evaluations that met the sponsors' requirements, 252 led to procurements worth approximately $11.000 billion in FY 2013 constant year dollars.  With an OSD investment of about $1.170 billion, the FCT Program realized an estimated research, deve lopment, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) cost avoidance of $7.800 billion in FY 2013 constant year dollars.\n\nThe FCT program is a catalyst for teaming and other business relationships between foreign and U.S. industries.  Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of the qualified foreign item in the U.S. Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the U.S. defense market and the resultant strengthening of the \"two-way street\" in Defense procurement.  The result often means the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies throughout the United States.  To date, companies across 33 states benefited from FCT projects."

This prototype process has had very promising results and has the potential to reduce the weight and improve the ballistic performance of personal body armor at a lower cost.  The current SAPI plates are made by conventional processing techniques which use low pressure autoclave to bond ceramic tiles and high performance fiber composites together.  The fiber composite materials are processed separately using hot press prior to the final bonding process.  This production method cannot provide uniform high pressure throughout the entire processing and therefore, the ballistic performance of current SAPI plates is not optimized.  The proposed technology has demonstrated the capability to provide absolute uniform and high pressure for the entire process and also to combine fiber composite consolidation and plate integration into a one-step process.  This technology will maximize the bonding strength between fiber composite layers and between composite and the ceramic which will significantly improve the ballistic performance of SAPI plates.  Uniform and high pressure processing technology will also dramatically reduce the performance variation which will provide more trade space for weight reduction.  The technology developed provides a new manufacturing technique that is unique and unavailable from domestic sources."

In particular, it can be used for meteorological data processing and visualization, contain interactive forecasting tools, enhance forecast production and workflow management, and develop adherence to the Open Geospatial Consortium's (OGC) standards for Web Mapping Services (WMS), Web Coverage Services, and Web Feature Services (WFS).  In addition, Visual Weather is compatible with the Joint Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Broker Language (JMBL), which is Air Force Weather\u2019s current Web service approach to the exchange of information between meteorological and oceanographic data providers and user applications.  The use of Visual Weather reduces the time the weather forecaster spends on product generation and allows more time for quality control of the resultant weather product.  The distribution of data across the Air Force Weather Enterprise will also provide a level of Continuity of Operations that currently does not exist if connection to the Air Force Weather Agency is lost."
