ASD is an R&D program to develop next generation ASD.  New ASD requires low profile and alternative power to allow safe spotting of all aircraft aboard carrier\/amphibious class ships. CV\/AACC is required to remove damaged aircraft from the flight line.  R&D resources are needed to identify not only replacements, but new technologies, which can increase the reliability and maintainability of this flight ops critical piece of equipment.  \n\nPEMA funding supports the evaluation, testing and integration to develop Portable Electronic Maintenance Aids (PEMA) Commercial Off the Shelf solution for portable device deployments across the Naval Aviation Enterprise.

An R & D effort will be required to design its replacement.  Advances in batteries and alternating current motor drive systems in the past decade have made it feasible to design an electrically powered vehicle for the CV, CVN, and L-Class hanger deck spotting missions.  Such a vehicle will be inherently more reliable, reduce maintenance, and eliminate the fumes and noise generated by a diesel engine.  An electrically driven vehicle will provide much greater motion control for slow speeds to aid in the engagement to the aircraft nose gear.  Proximity sensors will be incorporated to automatically stop the spotting dolly prior to accidental impact with the aircraft, other support equipment or bulkheads, increasing the safety of the spotting operations.  The legacy ASD is close to thirty years old and experiencing parts obsolescence issues and general efficiency degradation."

Two bids were received, and after a complete evaluation with many rounds of discussions with the companies bidding, both proposals were found to be technically inadequate and the procurement effort was discontinued. As a result, the crash cranes have continued operation unchanged. Designed in the late 1980's, major systems are beginning to experience the obsolescence of spare parts and are in need of updating. R&D resources are needed to identify not only replacements, but new technologies, which can increase the reliability and maintainability of this flight ops critical piece of equipment. Systems updates would include the engine\/generator and electrical updates to the motor drive\/control system. An exploration of power sources other than diesel engines would be considered and a corrosion resistant boom."

The legacy CASS system was designed and developed in the 1980's and commenced fielding in 1992.  As such, it is reaching the end of its useful life due to obsolescence issues.  eCASS is the replacement system for legacy CASS systems, which provides Naval aircraft avionics component maintenance and repair support at Intermediate and Depot maintenance facilities both shore-based and afloat.  As a CASS replacement program, the eCASS program objectives remain the same as that of CASS.  Specifically:  (1) increase material readiness; (2) reduce life cycle costs; (3) improve tester sustainability at depot and intermediate maintenance levels; (4) reduce proliferation of unique test equipment, and (5) provide test capability for existing and emerging avionics\/electronics aircraft weapon systems.\n\nThe Test Technology Development project involves analysis, application, maturation, integration and testing of emerging electronic, mechanical and optical test technologies for potential military utility in support of Naval avionics testing and repair.  Specific technologies being developed include synthetic instruments, new Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared electro-optics capabilities, multi-analog test capability to enable functional testing, and modernization elements for the CASS family of automatic test systems."

It also provides a transition vehicle to deploy Total Ownership Cost reduction initiatives through flight-test support and Fleet Test & Evaluation. It meets affordable readiness objectives by providing a cost-effective solution to obsolescence problems encountered when service lives are extended. AERMIP promotes commonality and standardization across aircraft platform lines and among the services through extension of application and use of non-developmental items. AERMIP also decreases life cycle costs through reduced operational and support costs. AERMIP facilitates the Operational, Safety and Improvement Program by applying proven low-risk solutions to current fleet problems. AERMIP also funds high-priority flight testing which is not associated with any acquisition or development program under the Flight Test General task."

                            "val": "The Propulsion and Power (P&P) Component Improvement Program (CIP) provides the only source of critical design and development engineering support to resolve safety, reliability  and maintainability deficiencies of in-service Navy and Marine Corps aircraft propulsion systems. The highest priority issues P&P CIP addresses concern safety-of-flight deficiencies, which account for approximately 80% of P&P CIP efforts. The program also corrects service-revealed deficiencies, improves Operational Readiness and Reliability and Maintainability, and reduces platform Life Cycle Cost. Budgets are allocated across platform-specific teams and multi-platform product support teams based upon long term strategies to achieve  safety and affordable readiness goals; the R-3 exhibit details annual portions of those long-term strategies. P&P CIP tasks have reduced the rate of in-flight aborts, safety incidents, non-mission capable rates, scheduled and unscheduled engine removals, maintenance work hours, and overall cost of ownership. This is accomplished through the maintenance and validation of specification performance, testing to qualify engineering changes, verifying life limits, and improving the inherent reliability of the propulsion and power systems as an integral part of Reliability Centered Maintenance initiatives. Historically, the missions, tactics, and environmental exposure of military aircraft systems change to meet new threats or operational demands, and often result in unforeseen problems, which if not corrected, can cause critical safety\/readiness degradation, such as those experienced during OPERATIONS DESERT SHIELD\/DESERT STORM, ENDURING FREEDOM, and IRAQI FREEDOM due to sand erosion. In addition, new problems arise through actual fleet deployment and usage of the aircraft. System development programs, while geared to resolve as many problems as possible before deployment, cannot duplicate actual operations or account for the vast array of environmental and usage variables, particularly when aircraft missions vary from those that the aircraft was designed to perform. Therefore, it has been found that P&P CIP can provide an immediate engineering response to these flight-critical problems and accelerated engine testing can avoid potential problems. P&P CIP starts after development and Navy acceptance of the first production article and addresses usage and life problems not covered by warranties. P&P CIP addresses engines, transmissions, propellers, starters, auxiliary power units, electrical generating systems, aircraft wiring, and fuel and lubricant systems. These efforts continue over the system's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level sufficient to maintain the reliability, and decrease the operating costs, of older inventory. P&P CIP is a highly leveraged and cooperative tri-service program with Foreign Military Sales participation."
