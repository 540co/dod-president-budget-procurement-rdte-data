            "val": "The mission of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is to safeguard the United States and its Allies from Global Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) threats by integrating, synchronizing, and providing responsive expertise, technologies, and capabilities unequalled by our adversaries.  This mission directly reflects several national and Department of Defense (DoD) level guidance\/vision documents to include the National Security Strategy, Unified Command Plan, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Counterproliferation Interdiction, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, National Military Strategy, Global Development of Forces, Global Employment of Forces, National Military Strategy for Combating WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex), and Nuclear Posture Review.  To achieve this mission, DTRA has identified principal objectives along with strategies and tasks to ensure the objectives are met.  These objectives are: \n1)\tEnsure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent;\n2)\tAnticipate emerging WMD threats;\n3)\tProvide Combating WMD situational awareness;\n4)\tAssess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities;\n5)\tPrevent proliferation and use of WMD;\n6)\tDefend against WMD threats;\n7)\tDefeat WMD threats;\n8)\tRecover from WMD consequences;\n9)\tSynchronize countering WMD activities. \n \nA focused and strong threat reduction technology base is critical to meeting these objectives and ultimately achieving DTRA's mission.  This technology base is closely tied with the operational support programs that make up DTRA\u2019s combat support mission.  DTRA has taken the steps to develop this technology base and provide a foundation for transformational activities within the WMD arena.\n\nActivities funded by Program Element 0602718BR implement a wide set of National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 17 and emerging Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) guidance for prevention of proliferation of WMD and WMD terrorism.  Projects support strengthening nonproliferation, through the development of the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES) and Arms Control inspection training and operational capabilities.  Through development of new sensor systems, sensor networks, counterforce and fundamental CWMD research, these programs contribute to securing and interdicting WMD, WMD delivery systems and related materials.  Finally, programs in this area fund development and operational support of the DTRA Technical Reachback analysis center, which supports United States (U.S.) and Allied Forces, interagency and civil authorities with 24\/7 Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-yield Explosives (CBRNE) event analysis support.\n\nProject RA (Information Science and Applications) develops innovative technologies and modeling and simulation (M&S) capabilities; collaborative net-centric CBRNE modeling access and support capabilities between DoD and key interagency and international partners;  and provides Technical Reachback support to create decision advantage for the U.S. and our Allies through improved situational understanding across the complete CWMD mission space.\n\nProject RE (Counter Terrorism-Technologies) provides research and development support to Joint U.S. Military Forces, specifically U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in the areas of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Device Defeat and counter-WMD technologies for warfighters.\n\nProject RF (Detection and Forensics Technologies) develops technologies, systems and procedures for post detonation nuclear forensics, and to detect, identify, track, tag, locate, monitor and interdict strategic and improvised nuclear and radiological weapons, components, materials, or infrastructure in support of Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counterproliferation and nonproliferation, homeland defense, and international initiatives and agreements.  \n\nProject RG (Defeat Technologies) develops advanced technologies and weapon concepts and validates their applicability as counter WMD weapon systems.\n\nProject RI (Nuclear Survivability) provides the capability for DoD nuclear forces and their associated control and support systems and facilities in wartime to avoid, repel, or withstand attack or other hostile action, to the extent that essential functions can continue or be resumed after the onset of hostile action.  \n\nProject RL (Nuclear & Radiological Effects) develops nuclear and radiological assessment modeling tools to support military operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design decisions.  \n\nProject RM (WMD Counterforce Technologies) provides (1) novel and enhanced weapons energetic materials and structures, full-scale testing of counter WMD weapons effects, weapons effects modeling, and weapon delivery optimization, (2) WMD sensor, surveillance and data processing technologies, and (3) the DTRA Experimentation Lab.  \n   \nProject RR (Combating WMD Test and Evaluation) provides a unique national test bed capability for simulated WMD facility characterization, weapon-target interaction, and WMD facility defeat testing to respond to operational needs by developing and maintaining test beds used by the DoD, the Services, the Combatant Commanders and other federal agencies to evaluate the implications of WMD, conventional, and other special weapon use against U.S. military or civilian systems and targets. \n\nProject RU (Fundamental Research for Combating WMD) fosters transition of early applied research into technology development.  Provides (1) strategic studies to support DoD, (2) decision support tools and analysis to support combating WMD research and development investments, and (3) early applied research for technology development."

The advanced analytics program provides SE and research and development with requirements, technology, architecture analyses and proof-of-principle capabilities necessary for making decisions on strategic planning, research and development investments, new initiatives, cooperation, and ventures with new customers, and accomplishment of high-level, short notice special projects.  It also conducts the development, validation, and fielding of the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES) as a part of the United States commitment under arms control treaties.  The innovative counterproliferation effort conducts research and development to investigate, identify, develop, and transition short term, high payoff technologies from Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), other government agencies, industry, academia, and international Science and Technology (S&T) partners into the respective DTRA, and other research and development programs, and to end user organizations.  The Technical Reachback effort provides 24 hour\/7 days per week information and analyses on potential impacts of WMD events to Warfighters and First Responders in consult with DTRA\u2019s Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Research and Development subject matter experts.  Net-centric modeling access and support provides a real-time accessible framework which enables the DTRA Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-yield Explosives (CBRNE) modeling and simulation codes to provide an integrated suite of CWMD decision support capabilities.

This project researches, develops, demonstrates, and transitions advanced technologies to improve operational capabilities to detect and identify nuclear and radiological weapons.  It supports the attribution process through development, demonstration, and transition of improved post-detonation National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) operational capabilities in the areas of materials collection, debris diagnostics and materials analysis, and prompt diagnostics and device reconstruction.  Efforts under this project also support international peacekeeping and nonproliferation objectives, on-site and aerial inspections and monitoring, on-site sampling and sample transport, and on-site and off-site analysis to meet forensic, verification, monitoring and confidence-building requirements.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the redirection of the nuclear detection portfolio toward a more holistic Nuclear Threat Detection portfolio that integrates both passive and active radiation detection into a comprehensive Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) solution. This resulted in a decreased investment in advanced detector technology to fund increased investment in nuclear weapons effects in Project RI - Nuclear Survivability and system vulnerability and assessment capabilities in Project RL - Nuclear and Radiological Effects.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominantly due to reduced investment in concept studies and prototype testing of CWMD defeat technologies."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of advanced technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems or rapid WMD elimination capabilities that are most relevant to the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) WMD Defeat Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and their Area of Responsibility (AOR).  This program includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation (DT&E) of next-generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved based on this technology.  The program is addressing defeat of adversaries' offensive WMD programs through integration of current conventional weapons capabilities and next generation kinetic and non-kinetic solutions to provide full-spectrum asymmetric defeat options.  The program addresses requirements delineated in the Quadrennial Defense Review and Strategic Planning Guidance as codified in the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), Service requirements documents, and COCOM and Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Combating-WMD capability.\n\nThe program places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within some mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials.  Our end-state is to provide COCOMs with accurate and timely WMD defeat expertise, tailored technologies, and customized solutions that provide offensive weapons and capabilities to combat WMD in any target while mitigating collateral contamination effects.  Without these capabilities our nation cannot effectively hold at risk our adversaries\u2019 WMD capabilities thus giving them strategic advantage.\n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the net effect of Congressional reductions in FY 2013 and increased investment in Counter-WMD (CWMD) hard target defeat weapons development in FY 2014.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominantly due to reduced investment in Next Generation CWMD Weapon Concept research and demonstration of Agent Defeat Penetrator technologies."

Emphasis is on ionizing radiation effects. The Nuclear Survivability project provides Radiation Hardened (RadHard) Microelectronics and Nuclear Weapons Effects (NWE) experimentation research.  Funding in this project also supports the expanding role of the Nuclear Test Personnel Review (NTPR) program into Science & Technology development for human survivability.\n\nPulsed power and laser-driven NWE simulators are available to validate nuclear survivability requirements for DoD missile and space systems, conduct radiation effects research in materials and electronics, and validate computational models.  The Nuclear Survivability Experimental Capabilities program is working with the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the United Kingdom (UK) Atomic Weapons Establishment to jointly develop new, enabling technologies for improved NWE experimentation capabilities for x-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons.\n \nThe Nuclear Technology Analysis Support provides support for the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group (JAIEG) and the international Weapon Effects Steering Committee (WESC) through the NWE Users\u2019 Group.  The WESC establishes standards for United States. and UK nuclear weapons effects simulation codes and models as defined and prioritized by the nuclear community, and serves as a forum for sharing information on nuclear technologies, capability gaps, and plans.\n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the relative net impact of Congressional reductions in FY 2013 and increased investment in nuclear weapons effects experimental capabilities.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominantly due to reduced investment in nuclear effects simulation\/experimentation capability and radiation hardened nanoelectronics."

The project conducts weapon effects phenomenology (WEP) tests, analyzes data, conducts high performance computer simulations, and creates\/modifies software to more accurately model cratering effects, fragmentation (both primary & secondary), internal air blast, equipment\/container damage, structural response, agent release, near miss lethality, and penetration.  These efforts will lead to advanced modeling and simulation capability in the countering WMD planning tools, to include the Integrated Munitions Effects Assessment (IMEA) planning tool used for weaponeering and the Vulnerability Assessment and Protection Option (VAPO) planning tool used for force\/structure protection.  The Advanced Energetics Program develops new novel energetic materials and weapon design technology for rapid, directed and enhanced energy release, providing new capability to defeat difficult WMD\/HDBTs. The Advanced Energetics Program develops new high energy systems well above current chemical energy levels to defeat WMD targets beyond the reach of traditional high explosive blast\/frag warhead technology.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the relative impact of Congressional reductions in FY 2013 and reduced investment in DTRA wargaming.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominantly due to reduced investment in small and medium-scale validation and parametric study experiments for advanced energetics."

It leverages fifty years of testing expertise to investigate weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferate nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD (nuclear, biological and chemical).  The project maintains testing infrastructure to support the testing requirements of warfighters, other government agencies, and friendly foreign countries on a cost reimbursable basis.  It creates testing strategies and a WMD Test Bed infrastructure focusing on the structural response of buildings and Hard & Deeply Buried Targets that house nuclear, biological, and chemical facilities.  It provides support for full and sub-scale tests that focus on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels.  This capability does not exist anywhere else within the DoD and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Combat WMD.\n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the net impact of Congressional reductions in FY 2013 and the realignment of test bed facilities from RT-Target Assessment Technologies in Program Element (PE) 0603160BR to RR-Test Infrastructure in PE 0602718BR to better reflect the nature of those activities.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominately due to decreased investment in test technology."
