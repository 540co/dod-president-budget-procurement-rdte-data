The automated GFM Toolset is the first downstream consumer of force structure data resident in the seven organization (org) servers that are made available by the GFM DI effort.  CIRT has streamlined force management, increased common understanding of force assignment, and supported timely force management decisions.  The objective is to automate the generation of the Global Force Management Implementation Guidance (GFMIG) and Forces For Unified Commands (Forces For) Assignment, Apportionment, and Allocation tables.  These efforts will flatten, streamline, and automate the current process while providing high fidelity data and transparency, and enhance Combatant Commander risk assessment to operational plans.  The Joint Organizational Server (JOS) will be the enabler system for Joint Staff personnel to be entered, near-real-time, into the automated Forces For Process.  Failure to fund for this effort negatively impacts the ability of the Services, CCMDs, JS and OSD to efficiently manage force structure resources."
