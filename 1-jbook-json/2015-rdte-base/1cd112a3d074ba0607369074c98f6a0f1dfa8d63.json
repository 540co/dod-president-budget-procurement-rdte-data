            "val": "This Program Element (PE) establishes the dedicated funding line to carry out the duties as described in Title 10 US Code, Section 139, the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009.  The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Engineering (DASD(SE)) is the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) on systems engineering, development planning, and related technical fields in the Department of Defense.  The DASD(SE) develops policies and guidance for (1) the use of systems engineering principles and best practices; (2) the use of systems and software engineering planning and contracting approaches to enhance reliability, availability, and maintainability on major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs); (3) the systems engineering plans (SEPs) for MDAPs including software, and systems engineering considerations in support of lifecycle management and sustainability; and (4) the inclusion of provisions relating to systems engineering and reliability in requests for proposals.  The DASD(SE) reviews and approves the SEP for each MDAP and monitors and reviews the systems engineering and development planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs as directed by the Secretary of Defense or the USD(AT&L).  Based on the DASD(SE)\u2019s continuous program engagement, the DASD(SE) advises and makes recommendations to the Secretary of Defense and the USD(AT&L) regarding systems engineering, development planning and the execution of these activities.  As a member of the Defense Acquisition Board, the DASD(SE) provides independent assessments of defense acquisition program\u2019s systems engineering, development planning, technical execution, and risk.  The DASD(SE) also provides input on the inclusion of systems engineering requirements as part of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's process for joint military requirements, to include developing specific inputs relating to each capabilities development document.\n\nThe DASD(SE) issues guidance to, and consults with, the Services and Agencies with respect to systems engineering in the Department, providing advocacy, oversight, and guidance to elements of the acquisition workforce responsible for systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability functions and developing policies and guidance for the integration of specialty engineering functions.  \n\nThe DASD(SE) periodically reviews the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability, and identifies needed changes or improvements to such organizations and capabilities. The DASD(SE) prepares and submits an annual report to Congress on systems engineering activities and effectiveness.\n\nThis PE includes efforts by the office of the DASD(SE) in implementing the Department\u2019s Trusted Defense System Strategy.  Specifically, the PE will develop and mature the critical sub discipline of systems engineering - system security engineering and the Comprehensive Program Protection Planning process that implements a risk-based approach to protection of critical technology, components and information in acquisition programs.  This includes study and maturation of policy, guidance and SSE discipline fundamentals such as engineering methods, tools and best practices.  These activities will be promulgated in defense acquisition as a fundamental element of DASD(SE) systems engineering and technical reviews."

Comprehensive Program Protection Planning links high level policies and practical expertise to specific acquisition practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department will pilot activities with the DIB to reduce risks in sharing and storing critical program information, better understand and mitigate supply chain risks, improve program protection planning, and improve and streamline program protection engineering.  Activities carried out support implementation of DoD Directive 5200.44 Trusted Systems and Networks with the use of proven mitigation techniques and tools, the ongoing refinement of risk management processes, and creation of needed technology."

As a UARC, the SERC is a strategic resource to further systems research and increase its impact on the Department\u2019s ability to meet its mission.  Greatly improved systems engineering is essential to the president\u2019s strategy for the Department to field systems that are agile, affordably sustainable, flexible, and ready for a full range of contingencies in the face of declining budgets and a shrinking workforce.  The SERC consists of a network of eighteen research universities from across the US that work collaboratively to bring the best talent in the nation to bear on DoD\u2019s systems engineering research problems. \n\nIn prior years, DASD\/SE has resourced the SERC at $1.000 million per year from P142. \n\nThe additional funding, beginning in FY 2014, will increase the Department\u2019s engagement with SERC, supporting additional research on topics of strategic importance to DoD.  \n\nThis new project code, established within the Systems Engineering Program Element:  (1) provides core funding for the SERC; (2) provides adequate stable resources for the SERC research agenda; and (3) enables the SERC to take full advantage of the university collaborators, enabling them to address DoD needs much more effectively."
