PE 0603925N will use the LBRG as funding leverage to produce a common Railgun and mount that will be capable for use onboard Navy warships.\n\nRailgun provides increased capability for the following mission sets: Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS), Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), Fast Attack Craft and Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FAC\/FIAC), and future potential for Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW).  Railgun will launch the Hypervelocity Projectile (HVP), currently in development as a Future Naval Capability (FNC).   \n\nRailgun uses electromagnetic energy, vice traditional propellant (powder), to launch projectiles, providing the following advantages: increased range (i.e. 110nm vice 13nm for NSFS); increased ammunition storage capacity; improved ship safety due to decreased explosives safety hazards; decreased costs when compared to current land attack missiles."
