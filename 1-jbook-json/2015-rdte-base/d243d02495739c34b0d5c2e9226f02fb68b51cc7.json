This includes sensors and components, processing, post-processing, data recording and display capabilities to address regional threat scenarios against surfaced or submerged conventionally and nuclear powered submarines. Key objectives are platform accommodations of advanced active and passive sensors and components, improved detection, classification, localization, tracking, and increased capacity and flexibility to handle multi-sensor data loads. Programs being funded during the FYDP will investigate technologies such as: Over the Horizon (OTH) Communications, Distributed Netted Sensors, transient signals, and source and receiver improvement technologies that will enhance passive and Multi-static Active Sensor Systems capabilities. Other programs being funded during the FYDP will provide for the development and maturization of persistent tactical search technologies that will allow transition to the localization and attack phase in all operationally relevant environments. In addition, the program will provide for the development and subsequent experimentation, including data collection and engineering measurement, of Multi-static Active Coherent sources and receivers, laser technologies, electro-optical and Multi-Spectral camera technologies, Radar, and Magnetic Anomaly Detection sensors.  Those technologies that are deemed mature and provide increased operational capability will be approved for a production Rapid Capability Insertion (RCI) build.  The test articles, which consist of passive\/active sensors\/components and associated processors, will support at-sea trials and experiments."
