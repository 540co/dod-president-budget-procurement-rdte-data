The Joint Engineering Data Management Information & Control System (JEDMICS) program manages and controls 106,000,000 engineering images and has 25,000 authorized users responsible for over 70,000 user sessions per month.  Over 1.5 million digital images are retrieved each month.  New data and new users are added each month as DoD re-engineers its business processes to take advantage of digital data that is managed and controlled for corporate reuse.  The JEDMICS system is deployed at 6 interoperable sites that service 600 locations worldwide.   Data stored in JEDMICS is used for Logistics Support,  Spares re-procurement, Weapons Systems procurement, Engineering, Maintenance, Distribution, Manufacturing, Air National Guard and  Deployed Engineering Technical Services organizations.  JEDMICS facilitates work process re-design since it brings the electronic drawings to the desktop, shop floor or flight line in real time eliminating walk, wait and slack time to retrieve drawings.  Additionally, Administrative Lead Time, Repair Turn Around Time, Engineering Change Proposal processing time, demilitarization time, and all cycle times dependent on engineering data have decreased with the real time availability of digital engineering data.  JEDMICS also facilitates Electronic Commerce since it produces digital technical data packages that can be forwarded along with an electronic order.  Funds are for Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) test, evaluation and integration.  JEDMICS development efforts are required to integrate and test COTS upgrades."

The NAVSUP Logistics R&D program has an established infrastructure and business process for ensuring that R&D funds are applied to projects that address high priority enterprise needs established in accordance with OPNAV goals and the NAVSUP Commander's Guidance.\n\nFrom a process perspective, Log R&D investments are governed by a NAVSUP enterprise-wide Executive Steering Group (ESG) chaired by the NAVSUP Vice Commander, and comprised of SES and Command leadership representatives.  The ESG ratifies capability\/technology gaps identified by all activities within the enterprise, and then assesses and prioritizes all proposed Log R&D initiatives in accordance with their potential for filling the established gap and generating return on investment.\n\nThe established Log R&D business management process has currently identified capability\/technology gaps in the following general areas:  1) the need to develop technology enhancements promoting the movement of shipboard supply operations ashore, especially as it relates to optimally manned ships, 2) developing and\/or modernizing shipboard equipment, material or processes for which NAVSUP exercises Technical Authority, 3) developing and modernizing Information Technology (IT) and Automatic Identification Technology (AIT) applications to enhance performance of supply chain management and logistics functions (e.g., remote diagnostics\/prognostics, in-transit visibility, unique item identification) that are not supported by Navy ERP, and 4) collaborating with acquisition program managers to reduce total ownership costs.  This modest R&D investment will establish a NAVSUP Logistics R&D Program to explore additional technologies and significantly increase potential cost savings.\n\nExamples of specific issues\/projects that are under consideration for investment of Log R&D funding as a result of the FY10 NAVSUP capability gap and initiative review include:  Automated inventory management system; Shipboard ozone laundering; Improved general purpose protective equipment (helmet protection and anti-vibration gloves); Non-plastic waste bags; Counterfeit parts detection methodology; Afloat automatic identification technology architecture.\n\nThis list of potential projects for addressing capability gaps will be updated and prioritized over time, under the oversight of the NAVSUP Log R&D ESG, to ensure that funds allocated provide the highest return on investment consistent with Navy\/NAVSUP goals and objectives."
