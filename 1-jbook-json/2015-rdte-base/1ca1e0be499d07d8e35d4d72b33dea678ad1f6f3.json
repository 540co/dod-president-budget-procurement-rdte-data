The Electronics Technology program element supports the continued advancement of these technologies through the development of performance driven advanced capabilities, exceeding that available through commercial sources, in electronic, optoelectronic and MEMS devices, semiconductor device design and fabrication techniques, and new materials and material structures for device applications.  A particular focus for this work is the exploitation of chip-scale heterogeneous integration technologies that permit the optimization of device and integrated module performance.\n\nThe phenomenal progress in current electronics and computer chips will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology in the early 21st century, a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue.  Another thrust of the program element will explore alternatives to silicon-based electronics in the areas of new electronic devices, new architectures to use them, new software to program the systems, and new methods to fabricate the chips.  Approaches include nanotechnology, nanoelectronics, molecular electronics, spin-based electronics, quantum-computing, new circuit architectures optimizing these new devices, and new computer and electronic systems architectures.  Projects will investigate the feasibility, design, and development of powerful information technology devices and systems using approaches for electronic device designs that extend beyond traditional Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) scaling, including non silicon-based materials technologies to achieve low cost, reliable, fast and secure computing, communication, and storage systems.  This investigation is aimed at developing new capabilities from promising directions in the design of information processing components using both inorganic and organic substrates, designs of components and systems leveraging quantum effects and chaos, and innovative approaches to computing designs incorporating these components for such applications as low cost seamless pervasive computing, ultra-fast computing, and sensing and actuation devices.  \n\nThis project has five major thrusts: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research."

The Adaptive Radio Frequency Technology (ART) program will provide the warfighter with a new, fully adaptive radio platform capable of sensing the electromagnetic and waveform environment in which it operates, making decisions on how to best communicate in that environment, and rapidly adapting its hardware to meet ever-changing requirements, while simultaneously significantly reducing the SWaP of such radio nodes.  ART technology will also provide each warfighter, as well as small-scale unmanned platforms, with compact and efficient signal identification capabilities for next-generation cognitive communications, and sensing and electronic warfare applications.  ART technology will also enable rapid radio platform deployment for new waveforms and changing operational requirements.  The project will remove the separate design tasks needed for each unique Radio Frequency (RF) system, which will dramatically reduce the procurement and sustainment cost of military systems.

This suite of sensors, when integrated into an inertial measurement unit (IMU), will enable self-contained navigation and timing in the absence of signals from the Global Positioning System (GPS), due to environmental interference or adversary action such as GPS jamming.  The micro-PNT program is developing miniature high performance gyroscopes, accelerometers, and clocks, based on both solid state and atomic technologies.  Advanced micro-fabrication techniques under development will enable the fabrication of a single package containing all the necessary devices in a volume the size of a sugar cube.  Co-location of atomic physics and MEMS-based devices opens the possibility for utilization of combinatorial algorithms to enable fast start-up time and increased bandwidth of MEMS with the long-term stability and accuracy of MEMS sensors, thus effectively providing very accurate navigation devices in highly dynamic environments.  The small SWaP+C of these technologies will enable ubiquitous guidance and navigation on all platforms, including guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and individual soldiers.\n\nThe successful realization of micro-PNT depends on the development of new microfabrication processes and novel material systems for fundamentally different sensing modalities, understanding of the error sources at the micro-scale, and understanding of scaling relationships for the size-reduction of sensors based on atomic physics techniques.  The micro-PNT program includes research into novel techniques for fabrication and integration of three-dimensional MEMS devices as well as theoretical and experimental studies of new MEMS architectures and geometries for inertial sensing.  Atomic physics research includes the development of new geometries and architectures for atomic inertial sensing and the development of techniques for improving the sensitivity and accuracy of miniaturized devices.  Advanced research for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-12."

The MPD program will focus on development of fast, small, reliable, high-carrier-density, micro-plasma switches capable of operating in extreme conditions, such as high-radiation and high-temperature environments.  Specific focus will be given to methods that provide efficient generation of ions that can perform robust signal processing of radio frequency (RF) through light electromagnetic energy over a range of gas pressures.  Applications for such devices are far reaching, including the construction of complete high-frequency plasma-based circuits, and microsystems with superior resistance to radiation and extreme temperature environments.  It is envisaged that both two and multi-terminal devices consisting of various architectures will be developed and optimized under the scope of this program.  MPDs will be developed in various circuits and substrates to demonstrate the efficacy of different approaches.  MPD-based microsystems are demonstrated in DoD applications where electronic systems must survive in extreme environments.\n\nThe MPD applied research program is focused on transferring the fundamental scientific advances funded by PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 to produce complex circuit designs that may be integrated with commercial electronic devices.  It is expected that the MPD program will result in the design and modeling tools, as well as the fabrication capabilities necessary to commercially manufacture high-performance microscale-plasma-device-based electronic systems for advanced DoD applications."

The vision of the program is to offer the warfighter a small and versatile infrared (IR) camera that would be affordable for individual soldiers and provide multiple IR band imagery with fusion capability to take full advantage of different wavelength-band phenomenology in a compact single unit.  In the future, the availability of the PIXNET camera would enable a peer-to-peer networked system for image sharing within a squad, thereby providing a better common operating picture of the battlefield and significantly enhancing the warfighter's situational understanding.  The program aims to develop a low size, weight and power (SWaP), low cost, soldier-portable multiband infrared camera that will provide real-time single and multiple band imagery using thermal and reflected-illumination bands.  The camera will also provide fused reflective and thermal band imagery on demand.  The use of fused imagery in the PIXNET design will allow the soldier to detect camouflaged targets and distinguish targets from decoys.  The PIXNET camera will eliminate limitations posed by current capability, allowing  detection, recognition and identification of targets whether in daylight or no-light conditions.\n\nThe PIXNET program will focus on a significant reduction in SWaP and cost of infrared sensor components to enable portability and ability to deploy widely to all participants in the theater.  The emphasis on a small form will naturally enable new opportunities such as surveillance with small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)s, rifle sights with multiple bands, and vehicle-mounted, helmet-mounted and handheld surveillance systems.  The phenomenology of different infrared wavelengths will be exploited.  The combination of a smart phone and PIXNET camera at the soldier level will enable more effective tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) over the current capability.  The PIXNET program takes advantage of the computing capability of smart phones to process and fuse multicolor images and send them as videos or still images to the warfighter's helmet-mounted display via a wireless or wired connection.  PIXNET capability could be further exploited to enable a fully networked system, such as the Nett Warrior integrated multiple soldier systems capability, with multi-spectral still image and video sharing."

The sensitivity of an IR focal-plane array (FPA) is improved by cooling its detectors to cryogenic temperatures.  The disadvantages of state-of-the-art Stirling cryo-coolers used for high performance IR FPAs are large size, high power and high cost.  On the other hand, thermoelectric (TE) coolers used in low performance IR cameras are relatively small, high power, and it is difficult to achieve temperatures below 200 Kelvin (K).\n\nTo reduce IR camera SWaP-C, innovations in cooler technology are needed.  This program will exploit the Joule-Thomson (J-T) cooling principle, in a silicon-based MEMS technology, for making IR FPA coolers with very low SWaP-C. MEMS microfluidics, piezoelectric MEMS, and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics will be used to demonstrate an integrated cold head and compressor, all in a semiconductor chip.  Since a J-T cooler works by cooling from gas expansion, the coefficient of performance is expected to be much higher than state-of-the-art TE coolers, while being significantly smaller than Stirling coolers.  The chip-scale J-T cooler will be designed for pressure ratios of 4 or 5 to 1 with high compressor frequency in a small volume.  The goal of the MC-FPA program will be to demonstrate cooling down to 150 K.  The chip-scale micro-coolers will cost less and will be significantly smaller than current Stirling coolers.  Once the proof-of-principle is demonstrated, the subsequent program effort will focus on transitioning to chip-scale manufacture on 8-12 inch wafers, resulting in cooler costs decreasing to as low as $50.  An extended wavelength-range short-wave IR detector will be integrated with a micro-cooler for demonstration of the MC-FPA.  The basic research component of this program is budgeted under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01."

The program will develop and establish an initial set of materials and components along with integration and manufacturing capabilities to undergird a fundamentally new class of electronics defined by their performance and transience.  These transient electronics ideally should perform in a manner comparable to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems, but with limited device persistence that can be programmed, adjusted in real-time, triggered, and\/or sensitive to the deployment environment.  Applications include sensors for conventional indoor\/outdoor environments (buildings, transportation, materiel), environmental monitoring over large areas, and simplified diagnosis, treatment, and health monitoring in the field.  VAPR will build out an initial capability to make transient electronics a deployable technology for the DoD and Nation.  The technological capability developed through VAPR will be demonstrated through a final test vehicle of a transient beacon.  Basic research for the VAPR program is being performed in PE 0601101E, Project TRS-01.\n\nTo manufacture transient systems at scale will require significant research and development into: higher levels of circuit integration and complexity to realize advanced circuit functionalities; integrated system designs to achieve required function (in modes that offer programmed or triggered transience); integration of novel materials into circuit fabrication processes; and development of new packaging strategies.  The efficacy of the technological capability developed through VAPR will be demonstrated through a final test vehicle of a transient sensor system.

The field of atomic physics was revolutionized in the 1980's with the development of the technique of laser cooling of atoms.  Utilizing precisely tuned lasers with high spectral purity (narrow linewidth), atoms may be cooled down to nearly absolute zero temperature. So-called  cold atoms  are of great practical value to DoD position, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems, for two reasons.  First, because the atoms are nearly unmoving, it is possible to make relatively long-duration measurements of their internal state, with minimal collisions between atoms or between atoms and the walls of the containing vessel.  This has led to the development of high-performance laboratory-based cold-atom fountain clocks, such as the U.S. national time standard, NIST-F1, and the rubidium fountains that underpin the U. S. Naval Observatory master clock.  Secondly, taking advantage of the relatively slow velocities of cold atoms, atomic interferometers have been demonstrated, which provide the highest precision measurements of rotation and acceleration.  Under the DARPA micro-PNT program, miniature high-performance cold atom-based atomic clocks, gyroscopes, and accelerometers are being developed and have demonstrated superior performance in relatively low size, weight, and power (SWaP).\n\nThe Cold-Atom Microsystems (CAMS) program will develop enabling component technologies to support the practical deployment of cold-atom based microsystems, including low-SWaP atomic clocks, gyroscopes, and accelerometers.  Technologies under investigation include high-efficiency narrow-linewidth laser sources, high-efficiency optical modulators, miniature high-isolation optical switches, compact low-loss optical isolators, miniature systems for laser frequency locking and agile frequency control, miniature ultra-high vacuum chambers and vacuum pumps, and techniques for controlling the vapor pressure of alkali metal atomic species over the DoD operating temperature range."

The Fast and Big Mixed-Signal Designs (FAB) program proposes to engage with a semiconductor fabrication partner to develop a SiGe fabrication process integrating 14nm CMOS.  The SiGe technology will enable the development of faster, more precise RF and signal acquisition components, while the 14nm CMOS process will enable low-power digital circuitry that can provide the large throughput required for data from the analog components.  The ability to mix massive digital computation at lower power with the fast sampling enabled by Silicone Germanium (SiGe) HBTs gives a powerful platform for future generations of Electronic Warfare (EW) systems.  This program will seek to overcome the tradeoffs in providing the highest performance analog performance versus the densest and lowest power digital processes.  Success will enable higher performance, lower cost, and more rapid insertion of advanced process technology into military electronics."

Such an integrated microsystem will support military applications requiring several hundred Megahertz (MHz) of RF envelope bandwidth at large peak-to-average power ratios.  This integration approach will realize RF systems with significantly higher overall power efficiency and waveform diversity by changing from a fixed power supply architecture to a dynamic power supply architecture.  The program is structured in two technical tracks.  The first track is developing high-speed power switch technology to be used in the design of dynamic power supply and modulator circuits.  The second track is developing the simultaneous co-design and integration of the RF power amplifier and dynamic power supply circuits to achieve maximum overall power efficiency for the desired waveforms of interest.  The impact of this program will be the increased deployment of MPC RF transmitter systems on DoD platforms due to their more compact size, high efficiency, lower lifecycle cost and enhanced RF performance enabling, for example, significantly communications rates."

A self-healing integrated circuit is defined as a design that is able to sense undesired circuit\/system behaviors and correct them automatically.  As semiconductor process technologies are being scaled to even smaller transistor dimensions, there is a dramatic increase in intra-wafer and intra-die process variations, which has a direct impact on yield and realized circuit performance, including significantly increased sensitivity to temperature and aging effects.  The Self-HEALing mixed-signal Integrated Circuits (HEALICs) program developed technologies to autonomously maximize the number of fully operational mixed-signal systems-on-a-chip (SoC) per wafer that meet all performance goals in the presence of extreme process technology variations, and to sustain circuit performance in the field in the face of changing environmental conditions and component aging.  \n\nThis applied research program developed techniques to regain lost performance and stabilize operation of mixed-signal SoCs over system lifetimes.  Consequently, the long-term reliability and performance of DoD electronic systems may be enhanced."

The high levels of integration possible in silicon technologies enable on-chip linearization, complex waveform synthesis, and digital calibration and correction.  Military applications include ultra-miniaturized transceivers for satellite communications-on-the-move, collision avoidance radars for micro-\/nano-air vehicles, and ultra-miniature seekers for small munitions.  The technology developed under this program was leveraged to improve the performance of high-power amplifiers based on other non-silicon technologies, through heterogeneous integration strategies.  Significant technical obstacles were overcome including the development of highly efficient circuits for increasing achievable output power of silicon devices (e.g., device stacking, power combining) at mm-waves; scaling high-efficiency amplifier classes to the mm-wave regime; integrated linearization architectures for complex modulated waveforms; and robust RF\/mixed-signal isolation strategies."

The A-to-I Look-Through program developed ultra-wideband digital radio frequency (RF) receivers based on Analog-to-Information Converter (AIC) technology.  Compared to conventional RF receivers, AIC-based designs increased receiver dynamic range and frequency band of regard while reducing data glut, power consumption and size.  Likewise, limitations of current-art power amplifier technology in simultaneously achieving high operational bandwidth, linearity, efficiency and power has resulted in well documented instances of electronic fratricide.  This program overcomes these limitations by converting digital signals directly to high power RF analog signals, thus eliminating the traditional high power amplifiers that are limited by the above-mentioned tradeoffs.  Transition is anticipated into airborne SIGINT and electronic warfare systems, as well as ground-based special operations forces systems."
