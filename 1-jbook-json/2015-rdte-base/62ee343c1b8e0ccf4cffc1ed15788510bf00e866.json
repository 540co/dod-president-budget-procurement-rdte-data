ETIMS activities include  studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and program execution to include Nuclear Weapons Related Material (NWRM) technical data requirements.\n\nProject 675042: LALI includes funding for Logistics, Installations and Mission Support - Enterprise View (LIMS-EV) and F-35 User IT Data Exchange Service (UIDES).  \n\nLIMS-EV provides integrated, singular information from multiple source systems through the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) Integration Framework (IF) to Air Force decision makers.  Funding for LIMS-EV supports Business Intelligence (BI) development efforts that enhance the AF logistics community's ability to perform configurable alerting, predictive\/what-if analysis and further integrate support equipment, vehicle, munitions, supply, commodities and components (e.g. engines, landing gears, fuel) to increase weapons system  and total asset visibility (TAV).    \n\nFunding for F-35 UIDES will continue Air Force development of a F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) - User IT Data Exchange Service that supports current and future Information Exchange Requirement (IER) data transfer capability from the F-35 ALIS into data reports and configurable tables to receive, store and integrate F-35 operations, maintenance, training and financial data within existing Air Force enterprise views to support the growing fleet of AF F-35 aircraft.  Funding supports development of an enhanced data sharing capability (ability to consume increased volume and variety of ALIS IER data) to support depot data configuration and integration requirements.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program\/project planning and execution and future program\/project planning.\n\nIn the FY15 PB, funding is requested to continue development of ETIMS, LIMS-EV and F-35 UIDES in support of the Air Force's logistics Information Technology modernization requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
