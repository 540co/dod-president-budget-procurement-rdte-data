Future development of the Mounted CE will leverage JBC-P hardware and software to consolidate and integrate multiple warfighting systems in the Platform (Mounted) environment. This integrated Mounted CE, with its open standards, enhanced interoperability, and simplified end-user interface will speed delivery of new Mission Command applications to the warfighter while improving the effectiveness and value of current systems.\n\nFiscal Year 2015 funding provides Software Design and Development, System Engineering, associated Test and Integration, and Program Management that supports the development of the Mounted Computing Environment."

Completed Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) as part of Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) 13.2 in 3QFY13. The IOT&E tested the JBC-P system software on existing FBCB2 hardware (non-dismountable vehicle systems) and future production-representative hardware. The MDA authorized entry into Full Rate Production (FRP) and deployment for JBC-P V1.4, December 2013, conditional on achieving Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) and Joint Interoperability Test Certification (JITC) prior to fielding.    \n \nAs encouraged by DoD policy, development efforts are being performed by the Software Engineering Directorate (SED) of the Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC).
