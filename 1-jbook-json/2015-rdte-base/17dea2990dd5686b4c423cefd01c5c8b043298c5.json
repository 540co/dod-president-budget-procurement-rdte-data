The JCTD was a 27 month risk reduction program that was awarded to two Contractors in 3rd QTR FY08 to perform design, test, and manufacturing activities leading to a down-select to a single Contractor for Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) and production. The JCTD was completed in 3rd QTR FY10 and the EMD contract was awarded to a single Contractor in 2nd QTR FY11. HTVSF is designed to prosecute harder, deeper, and more complex targets that exceeded design parameters of existing conventional kinetic strike capabilities. HTVSF will be used only with BLU-109 Joint Direct Attack Munitions. \n\n\nNote: First test article quantity for HTVSF includes FY 12-Quantity 26 , FY13-Quantity 3, FY14-Quantity 3"
