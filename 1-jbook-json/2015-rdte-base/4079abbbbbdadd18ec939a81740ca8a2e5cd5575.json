The diverse and complex Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) \u2013 nuclear, biological and chemical threats \u2013 mission space requires an integrated approach towards capability development. Capability development must be based on a systems perspective that links strategic objectives with interrelated tasks and associated capabilities. The broad CWMD military strategic objectives and mission areas encompass many nontraditional capabilities for the Warfighter, and CWMD is not an isolated mission set unique to DoD \u2013 it is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense. Accordingly, developing an overall CWMD capability should and must leverage complementary capabilities through integration and synchronization. A global CWMD situational awareness capability will be established and deployed worldwide via current communications systems and common operating pictures in support of this mission.  This program will incorporate portfolio management tools and comprehensive analyses to enable a balanced and integrated CWMD systems portfolio, an optimized CWMD force structure, and the integration with and utilization of existing military assets to fill intelligence, sensor and reconnaissance gaps in CWMD.\n\nThis program also responds to the strategic needs outlined in the President's initiative, stated in his April 2009 speech in Prague; the US Combatant Commands integrated priorities and requirements; the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review; and the FY12-16 Defense Planning and Programming Guidance by providing improved timeliness and relevance through modernizing CWMD support to the Combatant Commands, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Intelligence Community (IC), and other U.S. Government agencies as required. This program is designed to leverage existing DoD resources and proven approaches to achieve its goals and rapidly deliver a capability to the Warfighter. It will ensure sufficient funding is available for travel to support the requirements of this program element.\n\nThis Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.\n\nThis appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts."

It assisted DoD in both preventing the loss of sensitive materials and technologies (and the deliberate or natural spread of disease), and responded to attacks and outbreaks when they  occurred.  It integrated with information systems that the combatant commands and Services already used in their day-to-day operations.\n\nGCAS OPERATIONAL SUPPORT\n\n\u2022 Completed the GCAS Concept of Operations (CONOPS).\n\u2022 Completed the analysis of organizational and structural infrastructure options and requirements for GCAS. Focus on the personnel requirements for the centralized component of GCAS i.e. the home base for operations or analysis center.  Select location for deployment of the Initial Operating Capability.\n\u2022 Continued the structured assessment of DoD organizational capabilities to accomplish the integrated global CWMD mission set.  FY13 efforts included Security Cooperation and Partner Activities, Threat Reduction Cooperation, and Passive Defense.\n\nGCAS PROGRAM, SYSTEMS ENGINEERING and SYSTEMS INTEGRATION\n\n\u2022 Began information model and information architecture development.  Complete system functional and performance requirements, and specifications. \n\u2022 Completed technical and operational assessments for data integration and information processing, including data management and visualization alternatives.  Analysis included demonstrated commercial and government available and applicable towards the system requirements for GCAS.\n\u2022 Conducted limited evaluation and downselection of integration and information processing tools based on the candidates evaluated in FY12.  Completed technology readiness evaluations as required.\n\u2022 Continued and expanded the methodology for determining what Situational Awareness information should be generated to fulfill information needs to describe steady state and event tracking\/crisis monitoring. Determined the need for additional data streams to support and their availability.\n\u2022 Transitioned GCAS demonstration capability to an operational prototype in FY13 with the intention for fielding an initial operating capability in FY14.\n\u2022 Developed GCAS prototype. Identify, leverage and integrate appropriate existing technologies, data and fusion methodologies to produce a GCAS capability with minimal new development efforts.  Extended the Haystack data fusion demonstration system to include broader set of data streams and incorporate complementary and orthogonal analytic tools to facilitate the generation of the CWMD situational awareness actionable data.\n\u2022 Developed and implement interfaces to acquire biosurveillance and chemical data from national, international programs and sources.\n\u2022 Developed and implement interfaces to acquire nuclear threat data from nuclear security, nuclear treaty verification, nuclear monitoring, and radiation detection sources and programs.\n\u2022 Initiated experimentation of Warfighter prioritized real-world Use Cases using the operational prototyping.\nCWMD PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT\n\n\u2022 Refined the development of a CWMD systems architecture to enable comprehensive and systematic evaluation of needed capabilities as well as their relationship to each other.\n\u2022 Refined qualitative metrics and assessment criteria and begin development of quantitative metrics for evaluation, where applicable.\n\nMAJOR DEFENSE ACQUISITION PROGRAM ENHANCEMENTS\n\n\u2022 Integrated capability into lead COCOM\u2019s existing common operating picture and processes to improve and enhance CWMD situational awareness."
