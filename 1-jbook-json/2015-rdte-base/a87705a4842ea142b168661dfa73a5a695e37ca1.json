This funding supports development and enhancements to the Predator weapon system to include:  aircraft and Ground Control Stations (GCS) and associated software, sensors, communication equipment, training systems and support elements.  The system is designed to be modular and open-ended.  Mission-specific equipment is employed in a 'plug-and-play' mission kit concept allowing specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.    \n\nThe MQ-1 aircraft is a single-engine, propeller-driven, remotely piloted aircraft (formerly called Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle, UAV) designed to operate over-the-horizon for long endurance sorties.  The aircraft is designed to provide real-time Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Target Acquisition (ISR TA), and attack capability to aggressively prosecute Time Sensitive Targets (TSTs).  The aircraft is configured to carry Hellfire laser-guided missiles.  The MQ-1 operates primarily at medium altitudes, integrating with joint aerospace, ground, and maritime forces as well as coalition and Allied forces, to execute combatant commander priority missions.  The aircraft carries a Multi-spectral Targeting System (MTS) (a sensor turret that incorporates Electro-Optical (EO), Infra-Red (IR), laser designator, and IR illuminator) capable of transmitting real-time Full Motion Video (FMV) imagery throughout the operational theater.  \n\nThis program will address interoperability among developed systems through common standards and tools.  Additionally, this program will continue to address reliability and maintainability, safety of flight, and warfighter needs as they arise.\n\nThe GCS, common with the MQ-9 Reaper, functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond LOS (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communications.  The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support Remote Split Operations (RSO).  The GCS has the capability to perform mission planning; provide a means for manual control; allow control of multiple aircraft and payloads; allow personnel to launch, recover, and monitor aircraft, payloads, and system communications status; secure data links to receive payload sensor data and command links; monitor threats to the aircraft; display a common operational picture; and provide support functions.  Additionally, GCS allows for servicing, systems checks, maintaining, launching, and recovering aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed facility GCS. Congressional Adds in FY11 and FY12 began Predator C development, integration, and testing. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support Remote Split Operations (RSO).  The GCS has the capability to perform mission planning; provide a means for manual control; allow control of multiple aircraft and payloads; allow personnel to launch, recover, and monitor aircraft, payloads, and system communications status; secure data links to receive payload sensor data and command links; monitor threats to the aircraft; display a common operational picture; and provide support functions.  Additionally, GCS allows for servicing, systems checks, maintaining, launching, and recovering aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed facility GCS. Congressional Adds in FY11 and FY12 began Predator C development, integration, and testing. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
