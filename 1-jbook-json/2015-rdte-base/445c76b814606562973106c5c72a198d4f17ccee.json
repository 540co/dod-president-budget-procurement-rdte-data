            "val": "Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) efforts will ensure the extension of the operational life of the Minuteman III ICBM weapon system through 2030.  \n\nThe Support Equipment program designs, develops, and tests replacement of obsolete\/non-serviceable weapon system support and flight test equipment.  The efforts include design, development, and testing of support equipment such as Electrical-Electronic Equipment Test Sets (EEETS), Reentry Field Support Equipment (RFSE), Code System Media (CSM), Payload Transporter Replacement (PTR), Higher Authority Command\/Rapid Message Processing Element (HAC\/RMPE) Message Generator, Strategic Targeting Application Computer System (STACS), and Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP).  In FY15, efforts listed above in PE 0604851F, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile - EMD, Project 655037, Support Equipment will be included in PE 0101213F, Minuteman Squadrons, Project 672985, MM Support Equip.  Also in FY15, PTR funding was eliminated pending revalidation of the requirement through an ICBM Transportation Security Study due July 2014.  PTR development will continue in FY14.  \n\nEfforts also include the design, development, and testing of replacement flight test equipment necessary to conduct Force Development Evaluations (FDEs) and ICBM Fuze Modernization flight tests such as the Instrumentation Wafer Replacement Program (IWRP) and the Signal Conditioner Monitor (SCM) replacement program.  FDEs are required by USSTRATCOM and the Department of Energy to determine continuing reliability and effectiveness of the ICBM weapon system.  Beginning in FY 2015, IWRP and SCM efforts previously included in PE 0604851F, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile - EMD, Project 655037, Support Equipment will be included in PE 0101213F, Minuteman Squadrons, Project 672984, MM III Baseline Support as one combined program, the MM III Instrumentation Wafer Replacement Program (MMIWRP).  \n\nIntercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Cryptography Upgrade Increment II (ICU II) executes USSTRATCOM, Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), and Nuclear Weapon Safety Center (NWSC) requirements by implementing the KS-60 capabilities of remote key\/code change and irreversible transformation as mandated in the approved Capabilities Development Document (CDD) dated 4 January 2005 and addresses Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group Operational Safety Review (NWSSG OSR) requirements 98-2, 00-1 and 02-2.  It also incorporates continuous signal lockout capabilities to prevent the widespread loss of status monitoring.  These features will greatly increase security during code changes by reducing the frequency of open sites 75 days annually and will reduce associated resource costs for 450 launch facilities (LF) and 45 launch control centers (LCC).  In FY 2015, ICU II effort previously included in PE 0604851, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile - EMD, Project 655081, ICBM Crypto will be included in PE 0101213F, Minuteman Squadrons, Project 672986, MM Crypto Mods.\n\nThe Operational Equipment program designs, develops, and tests replacement of weapon system equipment.  The effort includes the Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) Modernization effort to define operational requirements, investigate available technologies and prepare an acquisition strategy for SRM development.  This effort, coupled with the Propulsion Application Program under PE 0603851F, ICBM Demonstration\/Validation, will support development of requirements and implementation timeline for a follow-on SRM program.  In FY 2015, new efforts related to the Operational Equipment will start under PE 0101213F, Minuteman Squadrons, Project 672987, MM Ops Equip.\n\nThis program is Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

As these efforts are conducted and results from SRM aging and surveillance activities and Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) Analysis of Alternatives become available, a follow-on SRM Modernization strategy will be established.\n\nFY13 SRM Modernization funding will be disbursed using two contract vehicles. The first contract will utilize Hill AFB's Design Engineering Support Program (DESP III).  This will be a competitive source selection, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (ID\/IQ), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract.  The second effort will use the existing Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) GSA contract which is a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract."
