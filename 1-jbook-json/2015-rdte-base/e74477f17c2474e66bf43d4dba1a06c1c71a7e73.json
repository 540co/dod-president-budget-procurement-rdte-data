            "val": "The Quick Reactions Special Projects (QRSP) Program supports five separate projects that provide rapid funding to expedite development and transition of new technologies to the warfighter.  These projects are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF); 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF);  3) Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) Architecture and Integration (RAI) 4) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support; and 5) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) support.  QRSP provides the flexibility to respond to emergent DoD issues and address technology surprises and needs within the years of execution outside the two year budget cycle.  These efforts field new capabilities at low cost in short time-frames, inform the traditional acquisition cycle, and inject innovative technology into programs of record.\n\nThe QRF Program objectives are to develop prototypes in response to emergent conventional warfare needs during the execution years that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies.  The QRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office.  Examples of the types of projects that are envisioned include: force protection projects to enhance anti-access and area denial capabilities, undersea offensive capabilities and broad electronic warfare capabilities.  The QRF focuses on maturing technologies critically needed for the COCOMs.  QRF projects are typically 12 months in duration and produce prototypes with new capabilities for demonstration and evaluation.\n \nThe Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) objectives are to leverage the DoD science and technology (S&T) base and those of the other federal departments, as well as academia and the commercial sector to identify emerging capabilities and counter evolving threats.  The RRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  RRTO works to anticipate adversaries\u2019 exploitation of new technologies and advanced capabilities and develop cost saving prototype capabilities to counter emerging threats.  Additionally, RRTO works to leverage technology developed outside of the DoD in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas, and small, non-traditional businesses to address specific DoD needs areas as identified by Combatant Commanders, Military Service organizations, other Defense agencies and interagency organizations.  Typical RRF programs are 6-18 months in duration and aim to mature a capability to demonstration.  The RRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 40 percent for demonstration programs (DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D).      \n\nThe Architecture and Integration (RAI) program objectives are to enhance and expand rapid technology architecture and assessment capabilities in general; and, to enhance the Joint Experimentation Range Complex (JERC), Stiletto maritime test platform and the Thunderstorm Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) exercise series.  The JERC provides a venue to evaluate a wide range of new technologies in a dessert environment.  RAI funding also supports Stiletto, a maritime test vessel that routinely hosts numerous new technologies for evaluation in a maritime environment.  Thunderstorm, an ongoing ISR exercise series, is also supported by this budget line.  Thunderstorm brings emerging ISR technologies together in a common architecture for exercise and operational demonstration.  Due to the draw down in Afghanistan in FY 2014, projects in RAI are either being concluded or aligned to other QRSP programs  \n \nThe Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) Program objectives focus on responding to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) that have been submitted by Combatant Commanders and validated by the Joint Staff.  In addition, the JRAC\u2019s objectives are to manage the delivery of capabilities as requested by the Combatant Command (COCOM) in a time frame acceptable to the COCOM.  Efforts, in most instances, are conducted outside of the processes described in the Defense Acquisition System in DoD Directive 5000.1 and utilize contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.\n\nThe Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) cell program objective is to support all COCOMs, Joint Force Commanders, and other government agencies by assessing complex operational\/technical challenges which require multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the United States Government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA cell develops solution options to COCOM generated challenging problems and informs the command\u2019s senior leadership.  Each SMA cell effort is initiated at the request of COCOM senior leadership.  Priorities for SMA Cell programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy for Operations.  Products are typically produced within six months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the COCOM\u2019s senior leaders."

The QSRP Program provides the flexibility to mitigate emerging threats and address technology surprises and needs that may arise outside the two-year budget cycle. \n\nThe Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) is fully executed through the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  The RRTO was established to accelerate the transition of high-potential science and technology (S&T) projects into operationally useful prototypes in the execution years.  The RRTO leverages the Department of Defense (DoD) S&T base and those of the other Federal Departments, academia, and industry; stimulates interagency coordination and cooperation; accelerates the fielding of prototypical capabilities and concepts to counter emerging threats; and, provides feedback to the S&T community to guide long term developmental strategies.  With projects supporting each Combatant Command and with a global perspective, the RRTO anticipates adversaries' exploitation of technology, including available and advanced commercial capabilities.  Prototypes delivered by RRTO provide cost effective capabilities to operational users faster than the typical acquisition cycle.\n\nIn prior years, RRTO has explored methods and approaches of persistent surveillance stimulation for counter-insurgency; developed alternate power sources for sensors and systems; provided low-cost capabilities for small-footprint operations; expanded human, social and cultural knowledge; increased small unit situational awareness; advanced the interface between law enforcement and military operations; developed biometrics and forensics capabilities; supported denied area operations; strategic multi-layer assessments; and, established an innovation outreach cell that is facilitating better interactions with small companies with emerging technologies that do not normally do business with the DoD.  \n\nIn FY 2014 and FY 2015, RRTO will continue to explore new and emerging capabilities to support irregular warfare operations while working to support the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology & Logistics), the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Rapid Fielding goals.  With project selection occurring during the execution year, the RRTO's potential focus areas for FY 2014 and FY 2015 projects include:  capabilities to operate in denied areas, navigation in Global Positioning System denied environments,  persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) architecture; ISR sensors; global warming\u2019s impact on operations in the Arctic, novel power sources for unmanned vehicles, interface of law enforcement and military operations; commercial product vulnerabilities and applications; biometrics and forensics S&T; autonomous operations; data processing, exploitation and dissemination; cyber security; exploitation of new and emerging cell phone technologies; counter proliferation initiatives;  strategic communications and multi-layer assessments; and, non-traditional approaches to leverage innovative businesses.  \n\nThe typical length of a RRTO project falls within a 6 to 12 month range in order to more effectively respond to the Warfighter."

Bluegrass data has been provided to more than 150 organizations to facilitate development of new Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.  In FY 2013, RRTO collaborated with the intelligence community and subject matter experts to make final plans to execute the Bluegrass II data collect which will explore the applications of low cost, low-access sensing such as urban video networks and social media to augment or replace traditional ISR sensors.  These efforts inform and enable development of ISR capabilities needed for future military operations in denied or austere areas.  Specific Bluegrass II objectives include developing an algorithm to track an individual across a dense urban video network, developing a technique to discover threat communications in social media, and developing a methodology to discover and characterize all Red Team nodes."

This expanded effort to address maritime capability gaps builds on and leverages the Stiletto dedicated maritime demonstration vessel.  Stiletto is a maritime demonstration platform designed to assist in the assessment of prototypes and the rapid transition of emerging technologies across the range of military operations to higher Technology Readiness Levels.  Stiletto, an 88-foot long boat, is an experimental, all carbon fiber craft that was purposefully designed to rapidly acquire, integrate, and employ new capabilities to explore the military utility of emerging technologies and concepts of operation for special and expeditionary forces.  The Stiletto program, managed in partnership with the Naval Surface Warfare Center\u2019s Combatant Craft Division and the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division\u2019s Warfare Innovation Cell, streamlines the experimentation process and helps facilitate the rapid demonstration, exploration, and risk reduction of emerging technologies and capabilities.  The demonstration process also encourages system developers to engage directly with the warfighter in the maritime environment to rapidly adapt technologies around warfighter needs.  The Stiletto vessel is home-ported in Norfolk, Virginia."

The Inflatable Catamaran project continued its development to improve the existing design and construction processes for the Special Forces\u2019 inflatable hull component of the Combatant Craft Light inflatable catamaran with an initial operating capability in FY 2016.  The improved hull form will increase durability, reliability and maintainability.  The new design will provide significantly increased speed, range, payload, and improved riding, supporting missions such as Maritime Area Denial.  The Common Maritime Technology Working Group (CMTWG) identified the lead organizations for Stiletto Capability Demonstrations and produced an analysis of common small craft technology needs in FY 2013.  CMTWG worked within its membership to bring an advanced Multi-Fuel Engine into the Navy catalog.  The Maritime Irregular Warfare focus area supported three Stiletto Capability Demonstrations of emerging Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), Command and Control, and maritime Unmanned Vehicle Aerial Vehicle (UAV) launch and recovery capabilities on the boat in FY 2013, supporting Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC), Trident Spectre 2013, and the UK Ministry of Defence.  Technology Demonstration periods also occurred throughout the year to support industry partners with emerging and innovative capabilities."

The flagship project for this portfolio is Thunderstorm, an enduring multi-Intelligence technology demonstration for the Office of Secretary of Defense, interagency partners, Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Services, academia, government laboratories and commercial vendors.  Thunderstorm demonstrations provide an opportunity to evaluate and assess the capabilities of new, prototype, emerging and transformational ISR technologies, and related information collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) capabilities in mission-related, geographically, and operationally relevant environments prior to full-scale employment.  Thunderstorm demonstration objectives, performance measures, lessons learned, post-demonstration assessments and data evaluation serve to inform future DoD ISR concepts of operations and remote PED capabilities.  Thunderstorm aims to identify new capabilities and\/or new ways to employ existing capabilities that enhance our ability to \u201cDeter, Predict, and Interdict\u201d threats while assessing how to bridge capability gaps that cross multiple Departments and Agencies."

In partnership with Joint Interagency Task Force South, Customs and Border Protection, United States Coast Guard, United States Navy, National Geo-Spatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, United States Southern Command, United States Northern Command and the Texas Department of Public Safety, Spiral 13-1 technologies were utilized to detect and discriminate suspicious behavior in the open water, littoral and maritime-to-land transition space.  The highlight of this Spiral was the capability to share information in near real-time among eight data nodes.  Spiral 13-2 built upon lessons learned from Spiral 13-1, placed emphasis on the maritime-to-land transition activity and the ability to prosecute suspicious actors as they quickly meld themselves into urban or rural populations.  This information was gathered and then shared in near real time to the data nodes.  In FY 2013, Thunderstorm spirals demonstrated 28 emerging capabilities in operationally realistic environments with a broad range of potential operational users providing support.\n\nIn the space arena, a classified project in partnership with the NRO successfully demonstrated the ability to use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) equipment for transferring large data files from theater to the U.S.  The project used a COTS SATCOM High Data Rate Modem to improve the bandwidth throughput by 100 percent.  This was a prototype demonstration and this concept of operations will be adapted to other satellites."

The second component was a case analysis of the drivers of buffers to political, social, economic and environmental instability in the Dhaka, Bangladesh population center.  The third component of the study was an assessment and testing of novel ways to present and visualize megacity stability data.  This benefited COCOM planners with forecasting socio-cultural trends affecting state, regional, or community level stability.  Also, this effort answered the need for quantitative stability assessment approaches to address key national security considerations including the potential for resurgence of violent extremism; humanitarian crisis; reinforcement of outlier state behavior and consideration of partner and ally relations."
