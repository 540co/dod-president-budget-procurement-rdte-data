            "val": "The Operational Test Activities and Analyses (OTA&A) programs are continuing efforts that provide management and oversight of test and evaluation functions and expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD).  The OTA&A programs consist of three activities:  Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E); Threat Systems (TS); and Center for Countermeasures (CCM).\n\nJoint Test and Evaluation complements the DoD Acquisition System by developing new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to improve the effectiveness of existing fielded systems.  JT&E projects are test and evaluation activities conducted in a joint military environment that develop process improvements.  These multi-Service projects, chartered by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and coordinated with the Joint Staff, appropriate combatant commanders, and the Services, provide nonmaterial solutions that improve: joint interoperability of Service systems, technical and operational concepts, joint operational issues,  development and validation of joint test methodologies, and test data for validating models, simulations, and test beds.  The JT&E projects address relevant joint war fighting issues in a joint test and evaluation environment by developing and providing new TTPs to improve joint test capabilities and methodologies.\n\nThreat Systems, based on a memorandum of agreement between the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) and the Defense Intelligence Agency, provides DOT&E support in the areas of threat resource analysis, intelligence support and threat systems investments. Threat Systems provides threat resource analyses on the availability, capabilities and limitations of threat representations (threat simulators, targets, models, U.S. surrogates and foreign materiel) and analysis of test resources used for operational testing to support DOT&E\u2019s assessment of the adequacy of testing for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&E and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD(AT&L)).  Threat Systems provides DOT&E assessment officers and other DOT&E activities with program specific threat intelligence support. Threat Systems also funds management, oversight, and development of common-use threat specifications for threat simulators, threat representative targets, and digital threat models used for test and evaluation.\n\nThe Center for Countermeasures (The Center), a Joint Service Countermeasure (CM) Test and Evaluation Center, serves as DoD\u2019s independent evaluator for electro-optical systems with emphasis on rotary wing survivability, precision guided weapons (PGWs), CMs\/counter-countermeasures (CCMs) employment, and warning devices.  The Center conducts tests, analyzes test results and provides CM expertise that benefits the Services, Joint activities, T&E Agencies, DoD Acquisition Community, the Intelligence Community, Homeland Defense and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  Data collected during Center test activities provides valuable information to OSD assessment officers for select oversight programs.  The Center assesses current and developing systems, using carefully developed test and evaluation methodologies to provide the basis for understanding how CMs might affect systems used in current and future battlefields.  Additionally, the Center develops CM specific test equipment that can be used for both Title 10 Acquisition Systems and OCO urgent operational needs.\n\nThis Program Element is budgeted in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support, to support management activities for the DOTE oversight responsibilities of test and evaluation functions."

The JT&E staff and the program\u2019s stakeholders developed a concept of operations (CONOPS) in FY 2012 that provided the details of the new business model, based on the revised budget.  The most significant changes in the new model are shorter timelines for project development and execution, as well as the designation of permanent facilities to house test teams.  These two changes will allow test teams to share resources, as well as staff and execute new projects quickly.  Additionally, the selection cycles of the program\u2019s quick reaction tests and joint tests will be aligned so that the program\u2019s governing bodies will meet concurrently to maximize effectiveness and minimize travel costs.\n\nThe program had three joint tests close and four joint tests continue in the fiscal year.  One of the three tests to close was the Joint Integration of Maritime Domain Awareness for Homeland Defense Joint Test, which developed joint tactics, techniques, and procedures to synchronize information concerning the maritime domain for key decision markers across operations centers for homeland defense, completed in October 2012.  The next test to close, Joint Cyber Operations Joint Test, developed and evaluated tactics, techniques, and procedures to enable the use of an adaptive cyber defense strategy for critical C2 services against cyber threats across the DoD Global Information Grid.  The third test that closed at the end of the fiscal year was the Joint Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Digital Information Exchange Joint Test, which developed joint tactics, techniques, and procedures to standardize the information exchange methods and dissemination paths to integrate UAS-derived information across the Services to support both deliberate and dynamic targeting requirements.\n\nThe program did not start any new joint tests in FY 2013 due to the lack of nominations that met the new submission guidelines.  The program did initiate ten quick reaction tests, which are short term projects directed to work on problems of limited scope.  The program also initiated one special project.  Four feasibility studies will be conducted in the second half of the fiscal year instead of the programmed two studies.  Out of the four studies, two will be selected to conduct joint tests to place the program on track for project execution in FY 2014.  \n\nThreat Systems\n\nThreat Systems continued test planning working group participation to identify threat shortfalls; conducted special studies and provided current intelligence support tailored to specific U.S. weapon systems acquisitions; continued the development of Global Positioning Satellite jamming capabilities to increase threat realism at our test ranges, and continued the development of an ammunition and rocket propelled grenade signature model for use in hostile fire indicator systems. \n\nIn FY 2013, Threat Systems became the lead for implementing the threat M&S roadmap to ensure threats to US and Allied infrared countermeasure systems are available for testing.  Threat Systems established a formal configuration management system for the development, maintenance, anomaly resolution and distribution of threat performance models with tri-Service and Allied representation.  Threat Systems also initiated an investigation of ballistic missile related threats; began development of the follow-on next generation threat GPS jammer; and identified representative cyber warfare threats for testing.  In addition, Threat Systems managed a series of technical analyses of WESTPAC threats by each of the Intelligence Production Centers to determine characteristics the test community needs to adequately emulate current threats and their densities in potential engagements.\n\nThese activities help DOT&E carry out its Title 10 responsibilities to assess test adequacy and determine whether testing is realistic and suitable, and promotes common solutions to Service threat representation needs.\n\nThe Center\n\nThe Center completed over 50 T&E activities and analyzed and reported on more than 40 different systems, with special emphasis on rotary wing survivability, CM\/CCM employment, warning and targeting systems, and PGWs.  Most programs supported received an independent assessment of our data\/findings and test support for their CM\/CCM evaluations.  Approximately 49% of the Center\u2019s efforts were spent on aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) testing; with the majority of these efforts in support of rotary wing aircraft.  About 11% of the Center\u2019s efforts were spent on PGW, foreign systems, and other types of field testing not related to ASE.  Approximately 6% of the Center\u2019s efforts were dedicated to OCO support, with emphasis on CM\u2013based, pre-deployment training for rotary wing units.  Thirty two percent of the Center\u2019s efforts were spent on internal programs to improve test capabilities and to develop test methodologies for new types of T&E activities, much of which was accomplished in concert with the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP).  Programs include the CTEIP-sponsored, Joint Mobile Infrared Countermeasure Test System (JMITS), Towed Aerial Plume Simulator (TAPS) and Multi-Spectral Sea and Land Target Simulator (MSALTS).  The Center is expanding in the electronic warfare (EW) realm with a new internally funded Portable Range Threat Simulator (PRTS) capability.  These systems, as well as the new remote launch systems (RLS) and the Hostile Fire Signature (HSIG) Models, will be used in support of testing for both Title 10 programs and OCO ASE urgent operational needs.  Our support was distributed across all the Services, as well as intelligence agencies and research and development activities.\n\nAbout 2% of the Center\u2019s efforts consisted of providing subject matter expertise and other support not directly related to scheduled test activities.  The Center provided expertise to many organizations and was actively involved in the following panels:  Joint Expendable Countermeasures (JECM) Integrated Product Team, Joint Infrared Countermeasures Multi Sensing Symposia Working Group (MSS IRCM WG), Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), Foreign Material Exploitation Working Group, Foreign Material Program T&E Subcommittee, Joint Project Mallari Working Group, Joint  Countermeasures T&E Working Group (JCMT&E WG), and  JCMT&E WG Hostile Fire Indicator (HFI) subgroup lead."

In addition to these test activities, the Center will continue to provide CM expertise in pre-deployment events and training, as well as CM\/CCM-focused tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development.  The Center will complete the initial development of the CTEIP-sponsored MSALTS, which will be used in support of testing for both Title 10 programs and ASE urgent operational needs.  The Center will work with CTEIP and AEDC on the development of JSIS to add enhanced data collection for radiometric events. The Center will complete the development of a new RLS capable of launching larger diameter missiles.
