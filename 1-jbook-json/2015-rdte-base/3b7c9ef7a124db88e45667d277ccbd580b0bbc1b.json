The ATEA is responsible for developing and implementing Anti-Tamper (AT) policy, coordinating and providing financial support for AT technology development and evaluations, hardware\/software vulnerability assessments, laboratory infrastructure, establishing and maintaining a data bank\/library of Anti-Tamper technologies, providing proper security mechanisms, and conducting effective validation and verification of  AT implementations.  The purpose of AT is to protect critical program information in U.S. weapon systems that may be sold to foreign governments or that could possibly fall into enemy hands.  AT protections will permit the U.S. to preserve its technological advantage of critical weapons systems while supporting the warfighters mission requirements.  Furthermore, AT will add longevity to DoD critical technologies by deterring efforts to reverse engineer or develop weapon countermeasures against a system or system component. \n  \nThe DoD ATEA will coordinate technology development and enhancement efforts among the DoD Services\/Agencies, National Laboratories, and industry.  The DoD ATEA acquisition strategy is to fund development of new AT technology, as well as enhancing existing AT technology efforts to increase the technology readiness level (TRL).  The AT technology development and enhancement efforts will occur in multiple areas, including the following:  Advanced sensor hardware, secure processing, crypto-analysis, tamper penalties, and power solutions.  Emerging research in the areas of materials, cryptography and electronic circuits has the potential to bring new AT capabilities that have reduced power needs and smaller form factor.  The goal of the research is to mature promising technologies to the point that they can be transitioned to a program office or industry for implementation in our weapons systems.  Priorities will be given to those technologies that most benefit the DoD AT community.\n\nAll DoD acquisition programs, Foreign Military Sales, and Direct Commercial Sales with critical program information (CPI) and\/or resident-critical program information (R-CPI) require a validated AT Plan. The AT program includes resources required for the subject matter experts (SMEs) to review AT Plans and conduct AT validation, and perform AT assessments of both commercial off the shelf and government of the shelf products.  To maintain its advantage, the AT program continues to improve its AT hardware\/software assessment capabilities.   These capabilities include the acquisition of specialized equipment, maintenance and\/or renovations to support the integration of this equipment, and modifications to new and\/or existing laboratory facilities to meet equipment and security requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding."

The AT program includes resources required for the subject matter experts (SMEs) to review AT Plans and conduct AT validation, and perform AT assessments of both commercial off the shelf and government of the shelf products.  To maintain its advantage, the AT program continues to improve its AT hardware\/software assessment capabilities.   These capabilities include the acquisition of specialized equipment, maintenance and\/or renovations to support the integration of this equipment, and modifications to new and\/or existing laboratory facilities to meet equipment and security requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding."

Emerging research in the areas of materials, cryptography and electronic circuits has the potential to bring new AT capabilities that have reduced power needs and smaller form factor.  The goal of the research is to mature promising technologies to the point that they can be transitioned to a program office or industry for implementation in our weapons systems.  Priorities will be given to those technologies that most benefit the DoD AT community."
