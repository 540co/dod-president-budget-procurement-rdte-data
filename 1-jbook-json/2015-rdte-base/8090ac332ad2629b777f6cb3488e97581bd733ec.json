Of the 324 evaluations that met the sponsors' requirements, 252 led to procurements worth approximately $11.000 billion in FY 2013 constant year dollars.  With an OSD investment of about $1.170 billion, the FCT Program realized an estimated research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) cost avoidance of $7.800 billion in FY 2013 constant year dollars.\n\nThe FCT program is a catalyst for teaming and other business relationships between foreign and U.S. industries.  Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of the qualified foreign item in the United States.  Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the United States defense market and the resultant strengthening of the \"two-way street\" in Defense procurement.  The result often means the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies throughout the United States.  To date, companies across 33 states benefited from FCT projects."

The original version used a thin steel barrel liner containing the rifling, strengthened by a carbon fiber outer sleeve.  External steel parts were eventually replaced with aluminum alloys or plastics thereby reducing the weapon weight from 36 pounds to 21 pounds.  At 21 pounds the weapon is extremely heavy, especially when also carrying 84mm ammunition.  This M3A1 project will eliminate 6 pounds (28 percent) from the existing system by replacing various components (bolt, trigger, venturi, and ancillary parts) without changing the firing procedures, operations or ammunition.  Since the weapons\u2019 operational characteristics will not be changed, this low risk approach will produce a lighter weight 84mm shoulder fired weapon without going through a costly and time consuming process to test, qualify, and re-certify an entirely new modernized weapon system.  This is continuing project which was previously funded during FY 2014 in PE 0605130D8Z."
