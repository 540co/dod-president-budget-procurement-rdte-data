            "val": "The Combat Training Range (CTR) program provides equipment and support to Air Force units and combat training ranges for mission testing, training, and evaluation of aircrews, as well as the operational testing of weapon systems and tactics under simulated combat conditions.  This program provides funding for the development and integration of electronic warfare training capabilities to include P5 Combat Training Systems (P5CTS), threat emitters, communication jammers, instrumentation equipment\/systems, and evolutionary upgrades to facilitate standardization and integration across all platforms to include coalition and 5th Generation aircraft.  The P5 Combat Training System, a collaborative development between USAF and USN, provides air combat training systems for the services at operational locations worldwide.  Increments include: hardware and software upgrades; an encrypted software communications architecture compliant data link to facilitate interoperability in a security environment and training with 5th Generation aircraft; internal pod replacement subsystems; integration of new aircraft Operational Flight Programs. This program also includes the development of advanced threat emitters. The Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) continues the development of a comprehensive suite of threat signals for aircrew tactics and electronic combat training for simulated penetrations of hostile airspace. This program complements existing range threat simulators by emulating signals that simulate current and future air defense and threat radars. JTE awarded a follow-on production contract to improve the current baseline by removing obsolescence and proprietary software to enable full organic sustainment. The follow-on production contract includes the development of a non-proprietary software baseline and the procurement of that source code in addition to JTE systems, Mobile Command and Control Units (MC2U), Fixed Command and Control Units (FC2U), and additional spares. Consistent with an evolutionary acquisition strategy and documented ACC training requirements, development will continue with next generation threat systems. Future developments will continue to add additional capability to the warfighter's training ranges. The Advanced Radar Threat System (ARTS) program, formerly named JTE Increment 2, will develop, design, build and test threat system simulators based on advanced foreign fielded surface-to-air missile (SAM) radar threat systems. ARTS is designed to be used at Department of Defense (DoD) training ranges for aircrew training and tactics development to increase combat effectiveness and aircrew survivability by training aircrews to engage or defend against an advanced SAM threat before encountering it in actual combat. Various aircraft platforms may train against ARTS, but the most stringent requirements placed on ARTS design come from 5th generation aircraft capabilities. The ARTS-Variant 1 (ARTS-V1) is focused on strategic, long-range, re-locatable radar threat systems while ARTS-Variant 2 (ARTS-V2) is focused on tactical, mobile, short\/medium-range radar threat systems. Since a similar ARTS-V1 capability is being developed through the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program, ARTS-V2 development is being accelerated. It was originally to start development after ARTS-V1 was in procurement. This program also funds development of replacement components for Legacy Range Threat Systems (due to obsolescence) to extend the system's service life .  Legacy Systems include the Multiple Threat Emitter System (MUTES), the Miniature Multiple Threat Emitter System (Mini-MUTES), the Modular Threat Emitter (MTE) system, the Tactical Radar Threat Generator (TRTG) system, the Band Simulator, the Common Electronic Attack Receiver (CEAR) and the Unmanned Modular Threat Emitter (UMTE) system. Additionally, this program funds ongoing analyses, studies, risk reduction efforts, and technology development to enhance range systems, such as combat training range equipment integration into a Live Virtual Constructive architecture, communication and GPS jammers, weapon drop scoring systems and infrastructure networks. These enhancements add a critical dimension to exercises and optimize warfighter training.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5 - Systems Development and Demonstration because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements."

The Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) continues the development of a comprehensive suite of threat signals for aircrew tactics and electronic combat training for simulated penetrations of hostile airspace. This program complements existing range threat simulators by emulating signals that simulate current and future air defense and threat radars. JTE awarded a follow-on production contract to improve the current baseline by removing obsolescence and proprietary software to enable full organic sustainment. The follow-on production contract includes the development of a non-proprietary software baseline and the procurement of that source code in addition to JTE systems, Mobile Command and Control Units (MC2U), Fixed Command and Control Units (FC2U), and additional spares. Consistent with an evolutionary acquisition strategy and documented ACC training requirements, development will continue with next generation threat systems. Future developments will continue to add additional capability to the warfighter's training ranges. The Advanced Radar Threat System (ARTS) program, formerly named JTE Increment 2, will develop, design, build and test threat system simulators based on advanced foreign fielded surface-to-air missile (SAM) radar threat systems. ARTS is designed to be used at Department of Defense (DoD) training ranges for aircrew training and tactics development to increase combat effectiveness and aircrew survivability by training aircrews to engage or defend against an advanced SAM threat before encountering it in actual combat. Various aircraft platforms may train against ARTS, but the most stringent requirements placed on ARTS design come from 5th generation aircraft capabilities. The ARTS-Variant 1 (ARTS-V1) is focused on strategic, long-range, re-locatable radar threat systems while ARTS-Variant 2 (ARTS-V2) is focused on tactical, mobile, short\/medium-range radar threat systems. Since a similar ARTS-V1 capability is being developed through the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program, ARTS-V2 development is being accelerated. It was originally to start development after ARTS-V1 was in procurement. This program also funds development of replacement components for Legacy Range Threat Systems (due to obsolescence) to extend the system's service life .  Legacy Systems include the Multiple Threat Emitter System (MUTES), the Miniature Multiple Threat Emitter System (Mini-MUTES), the Modular Threat Emitter (MTE) system, the Tactical Radar Threat Generator (TRTG) system, the Band Simulator, the Common Electronic Attack Receiver (CEAR) and the Unmanned Modular Threat Emitter (UMTE) system. Additionally, this program funds ongoing analyses, studies, risk reduction efforts, and technology development to enhance range systems, such as combat training range equipment integration into a Live Virtual Constructive architecture, communication and GPS jammers, weapon drop scoring systems and infrastructure networks. These enhancements add a critical dimension to exercises and optimize warfighter training.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5 - Systems Development and Demonstration because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements."
