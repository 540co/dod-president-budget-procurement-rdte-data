The U-2S model airframes were constructed in the late 1980s, with the last aircraft rolling off the assembly line in 1989. The U-2S provides global reconnaissance signals intelligence (SIGINT) and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) 24 hours a day, seven days a week in support of national and DoD worldwide missions. The U-2 is currently deployed to forward operating locations (FOL) around the world. Modifications to the aircraft are required to ensure continued operations.\n\nIn 2012, the Air Force decided to retain the U-2 weapon system capability instead of retiring it.  Prior to 2012, the U-2 weapon system fell under the \"sunset clause\" IAW Title 10 U.S.C 2244a, Equipment Scheduled For Retirement Or Disposal: Limitation On Expenditures For Modifications, stating that modifications to any aircraft (i.e., a given tail number), weapon, or other item of equipment that the SECAF plans to retire or otherwise dispose of within five years after the date on which the modification would be completed, are prohibited.  Therefore, many required modifications to address diminishing manufacturing sources or vanishing vendor items were not accomplished.\n\nThe U-2 Program will continue to address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues and support U-2 integration of other payload and capability development activities. Activities also include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution, and studies supporting analysis and investment in future U-2 program planning. In FY16, the AF may start divestiture.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
