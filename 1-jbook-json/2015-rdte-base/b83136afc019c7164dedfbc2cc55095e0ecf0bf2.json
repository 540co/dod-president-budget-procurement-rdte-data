The ability to reason, learn and adapt will raise computing to new levels of capability and powerful new applications. \n\nThe Cognitive Computing project will develop core technologies that enable computing systems to learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience, and respond intelligently to things that have not been previously encountered.  These technologies will lead to systems demonstrating increased self-reliance, self-adaptive reconfiguration, intelligent negotiation, cooperative behavior and survivability with reduced human intervention.\n\nThe Collective Cognitive Systems and Interfaces project will dramatically improve warfighter and commander effectiveness and productivity using advanced cognitive approaches that enable faster, better informed, and more highly coordinated actions than those of our enemies.  This will be accomplished by developing revolutionary methods that increase our information processing capabilities, enhance our situational awareness, and enable more cohesive group action by our forces.  Critical technical areas addressed in this project include automated coordinated decision support, information sharing, and ensured communications."

A key objective is intelligent control of manipulators to independently perform subtasks over a broad range of domains of interest to the warfighter, thereby reducing operator workload, time on target, training time, bandwidth, and hardware complexity.  Current manipulation systems have many limitations.  For example, while they perform well in certain mission environments, they have yet to demonstrate proficiency and flexibility across multiple mission environments; they require burdensome human interaction and the full attention of the operator; and the time required to complete tasks generally exceeds military users' desires.  ARM will create manipulators with a high degree of autonomy capable of serving multiple military purposes across a wide variety of application domains including, but not limited to, counter-improvised explosive device, countermine, search and rescue, weapons support, checkpoint and access control, explosive ordnance disposal, and combat casualty care (including battlefield extraction).  ARM will enable autonomous manipulation systems to surpass the performance level of remote manipulation systems that are controlled directly by a human operator."

Critical technical areas addressed in this project include automated decision support, information sharing, ensured communications, and advanced informatics."

Of particular importance is development of a new data synchronization architecture between the handhelds and the backend computing\/storage nodes.  Additionally, appropriate middleware services and libraries are being developed to facilitate shared capabilities such as map viewing, apps management, and collection of logs, usage statistics, and user feedback.  Apps, together with handhelds and networks, are tested in different training environments as well as in deployed environments.  Performance and usage are carefully tracked and user feedback collected to guide rapid enhancement of apps.  The effort is creating a military apps development community by reaching out to non-traditional performers and will explore new models for software acquisition based on end-user empowerment."
