            "val": "Paladin Integrated Management (PIM) is an ACAT 1D Acquisition Program. The program will replace the current fleet of M109 Family of Vehicles (FoV) consisting of the M109A6 Paladin Self Propelled Howitzer and M992A2 Field Artillery Ammunition Supply Vehicle (FAASV). PIM is an Army Modernization Program that addresses a critical capability gap created by the Non-Line of Sight Cannon termination in June of 2009 as well as obsolescence and size\/weight and power (SWaP) issues in the M109 FoV current Fleet. The PIM system integrates current Bradley Fighting Vehicle suspension and drive train items, Future Combat Systems (FCS) developed Electric Gun Drive systems and current fleet (M109A6) fire control systems into a new chassis that provides better force protection, survivability and increased electrical power over the current fleet.  PIM is a two vehicle system:  Self Propelled Howitzer (SPH) and Carrier Ammunition Tracked (CAT). The SPH has all characteristics listed above.  The CAT utilizes all these same components and traits less those that relate directly to the cannon system. The PIM system replaces the current M109 FoV on a one for one basis, in the cannon fires battalions in the Armored Brigade Combat Team Formations and the Echelons above Brigade (EAB). The overall intent is to increase Soldier force protection, vehicle survivability, provide an appropriate amount of SWaP capacity to add future capabilities, reduce life cycle costs and extend the life of the M109 FoV through FY2050.\n\nThe Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155), also known as the M777A2, provides direct, reinforcing, general support fires to maneuver forces and direct support artillery. It replaces all howitzers in all missions in the USMC and replaces the M198 howitzer as the general support artillery for light forces in the Army. The LW155 fires unassisted projectiles to a range of 15 miles and assisted projectiles to 19 miles. The addition of the digital fire control system enables the weapon to program and fire the improved Excalibur precision-guided munitions to ranges in excess of 25 miles with better than 10-meter Circular Error Probable (CEP) accuracy. The LW155 is the first ground combat system whose major structures are made of high strength titanium alloy and the system makes extensive use of hydraulics to operate the breech, load tray, recoil and wheel arms. The combination of titanium structures and the use of hydraulic systems resulted in a significant weight savings of 7000 lbs over the M198 system.  Compared to the M198, the LW155 emplaces three-times faster and displaces four-times faster. It traverses 32 percent more terrain worldwide and is 70 percent more survivable than the M198. It is a successful joint service program between the Marine Corps and Army working together to develop, produce, field, and sustain the howitzer.\nThe LW155 was first introduced into the Marine Corps in April 2005 and the Marines have now fielded the howitzer to all active units. The Army has fielded the howitzer to its Stryker Brigade Combat teams (SBCT), Fires Brigades and National Guard. Fielding of the Infantry Brigade Combat Teams\n(IBCT) will commence in FY14 and continue through 2018. The LW155 saw extensive action in Afghanistan, receiving high marks for its performance.\nHaving now been in the field for almost 10 years, the howitzer will be going through obsolescent replacement of electronic components in its digital fire control system.  New start in FY-15.\n\nFunding supports engineering studies for capabilities identified in the Joint Operation Requirements Document (JORD) but deferred during Engineering Manufacturing and Development due to technology maturity, cost and schedule.  This includes a digital direct fire site for the Digital Fire Control System and low temperature, high density power solutions to achieve full operational requirements."

The program will replace the current fleet of M109 Family of Vehicles (FoV) consisting of the M109A6 Paladin Self Propelled Howitzer and M992A2 Field Artillery Ammunition Supply Vehicle (FAASV). PIM is an Army Modernization Program that addresses a critical capability gap created by the Non-Line of Sight Cannon termination in June of 2009 as well as obsolescence and size\/weight and power (SWaP) issues in the M109 FoV current Fleet. The PIM system integrates current Bradley Fighting Vehicle suspension and drive train items, Future Combat Systems (FCS) developed Electric Gun Drive systems and current fleet (M109A6) fire control systems into a new chassis that provides better force protection, survivability and increases electrical power over the current fleet. PIM is a two vehicle system:  Self Propelled Howitzer (SPH) and Carrier Ammunition Tracked (CAT).  The SPH has all characteristics listed above.  The CAT utilizes all these same components and traits less those that relate directly to the cannon system. The PIM system replaces the current M109 FoV on a one for one basis, in the cannon fires battalions in the Armored Brigade Combat Team Formations and the Echelons above Brigade (EAB). The overall intent is to increase Soldier force protection, vehicle survivability, provide an appropriate amount of SWaP capacity to add future capabilities, reduce life cycle costs and extend the life of the M109 FoV through FY2050."

Subsequent work directives were awarded under BAE STS contract W56HZV-07-C-0256 to further define the configuration of the PIM vehicles.  On 14 August 2009, a Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) Contract W56HZV-09-C-0550 was awarded to BAE Systems Inc. for the Prototype Development and Fabrication of 7 prototype vehicles (5 PIM Self Propelled Howitzer Systems (SPHS) and 2 PIM Carrier Ammunition Tracked (CAT) vehicles).  A Comprehensive Contract Modification (CCM) award to the RDT&E contract was accomplished on 6 Jan 2012.  This modification allows for the completion of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase and transfers the system responsibility for the program from the Government to BAE Systems Inc. The planned Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract is of a Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF) contract type for procurement of vehicles with a period of performance running from Nov 2013 through approximately Jun 2019.  The LRIP contract will provide for three LRIP years with the initial base year including 19 SPHs and 18 CATs and the remaining two option years with 18 sets and 30 sets, respectively (each set consisting of one each SPH and CAT) of PIM vehicles.  The Full Rate Production (FRP) contract is planned as a FPIF contract that converts to a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract after the second year of FRP.  The FRP contract provides for the remaining PIM vehicles to fulfill the requirement up to the Army Acquisition Objective of 580 sets."
