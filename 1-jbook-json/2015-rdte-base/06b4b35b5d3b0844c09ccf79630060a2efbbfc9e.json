The PE funds advanced technology development for Joint Service and Service-specific requirements in both medical and physical sciences CBR defense areas.  \n\nIn the physical sciences area, Project CB3 focuses on demonstrations of CB defense technologies, including biological detection, chemical detection, information system technology for hazard prediction and systems performance, and protection, and decontamination.  The Project continues to pursue solutions against traditional agents. \n\nAll non-traditional agent (NTA)-dedicated research (both medical and non-medical) is consolidated in Project NT3.  This Project includes NTA chemical diagnostics, medical pretreatments, therapeutics, detection, and protection and hazard mitigation.\n\nThe medical program in Project TM3, aims to produce biological diagnostic assays and reagents, diagnostic device platforms, pretreatments and therapeutics for bacterial, viral, and toxin threats as well as for chemical threats, and medical devices, as countermeasures for CBR threat agents.  Specific areas of medical investigation include: prophylaxis, pretreatment, antidotes and therapeutics, personnel and patient decontamination, and medical management of casualties.  \n\nProject TT3, Techbase Technology Transition, pursues efforts to enhance military operational capability, concepts of operation, WMD elimination, and hazard mitigation following a biological warfare or chemical warfare attack.\n\nThe PE is dedicated to conducting proof-of-principle field demonstrations, and testing system-specific technologies to meet specific military needs.  Work conducted under this PE will transition to and will provide risk reduction for PE 0603884BP\/PE 0604384BP activities."

Efforts supply test methodologies and supporting science to verify capabilities, develop protection and hazard mitigation options, expand hazard assessment tools, and develop MCMs against NTAs.  This project is a comprehensive and focused effort for developing NTA defense capabilities, coordinated with specific interagency partners for doctrine, equipment, and training for the Warfighter and civilian population for defense against NTAs.  This project funds advanced technology development of NTA defense science and technology initiatives and transitions them to Budget Activities 4 and 5."

Innovative biotechnology approaches to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to biological threat agents will be evaluated.  In addition this project supports the advanced development of medical countermeasures to include prophylaxes, pretreatments, antidotes, skin decontaminants and therapeutic drugs against identified and emerging chemical warfare threat agents.  Entry of candidate vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic technologies into advanced development is facilitated by the development of technical data packages that support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) processes, DoD acquisition regulations, and the oversight of early phase clinical trials in accordance with FDA guidelines.  This project also supports the advanced development of medical countermeasures to protect the Warfighter against radiological\/nuclear exposure.\n\nThe Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities, providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the Warfighter and national security needs.  MCMI efforts within science and technology (S&T) are concentrated in advancing two areas: 1) regulatory science and 2) flexible manufacturing technologies and processes for MCMs.  Efforts conducted in these areas are enablers supporting the DoD Medical Countermeasures Advanced Development and Manufacturing (MCM-ADM) capability."

These programs offer an opportunity to identify and efficiently mature emerging technologies including limited objective experiments, laboratory experiments, risk reduction efforts, engineering and integration.  These demonstrations and programs seek to demonstrate the potential for enhanced military operational capability and\/or cost effectiveness.  This project addresses four family of products areas: Biological Resiliency, Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Elimination, Hazard Mitigation and Facilities Protection.  Biological resiliency efforts are targeted to reduce biological threats by: (1) improving Department of Defense (DoD) access to the life sciences to combat infectious disease regardless of its cause; (2) establishing and reinforcing DoD concept of operations (CONOPS) against the misuse of the life sciences; and (3) instituting a suite of coordinated DoD and interagency activities that collectively will help influence, identify, inhibit, and\/or interdict those who seek to misuse the life sciences.  WMD Elimination addresses detection, identification, verification and baseline assessments in support of expeditionary forces deployed in non-permissive environments.  Hazard Mitigation addresses Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) remediation and decontamination processes and demonstrates technologies and methods to restore assets such as mobile equipment, fixed sites, critical infrastructures, personal, and equipment to operational status as a result of having reduced or eliminated CBR contamination.  Facilities protection transitions mature technologies to improve individual and critical infrastructure protection capabilities for U.S. and coalition Warfighters.\n\nThree demonstrations will be ongoing in FY15: Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System (JBADS) JCTD- Demonstration of the operational utility of a interior-exterior airframe decontamination capability; Thermal Imaging Dual-Use for Aerosol Monitoring Alarms and Security (TIDAMAS)- Evaluation of a dual capability that can perform chemical standoff detection and ISR; and Joint Concept Development and Experimentation (JCDE)\/Rapid Military Utility Assessment Initiative - a partnership with Maneuver Support Center of Excellence (MSCOE) to better ensure S&T solutions address warfighter needs."
