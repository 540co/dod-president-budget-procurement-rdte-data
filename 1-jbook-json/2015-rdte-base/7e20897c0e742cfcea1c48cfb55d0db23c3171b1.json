The OCPL establishes a flexible and balanced approach to rapid acquisition of cyber operational capabilities.  OCPL effectiveness comes from consciously balancing funding into four capability areas required for effective operations: platforms (includes Cyber Mission Platform (CMP), access, and payloads.  The program office investigates and selects the highest potential cyber and Information Operations (IO) technologies to meet specific shortfalls, deficiencies, and requirements documented by major commands (MAJCOMs), unified commands, and IO agencies in Mission Area Plans (MAPs) and capabilities documents. In accordance with AF Policy, the program office develops capabilities in the following cyberspace superiority core capability areas. \n\nOCPL efforts provide advanced cyber warfare capabilities to the 24th Air Force in direct support of USCYBERCOM and other combatant commanders. OCPL efforts also directly support the AF Information Operations Capability Plan (IOCP) and the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO). OCPL efforts will be prioritized and guided by the Air Force Space Command in support of the Joint Net Attack ICD and other applicable requirements documents. Planned areas of study, prototyping, and technology demonstration will be used to provide warfighters access, platforms, Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO) production (e.g. test and budgets), infrastructure (e.g. mission planning, intelligence, command and control), and tools needed to exploit enemy networks, telephony, Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), electronic warfare operations and Command and Control (C2) systems. These advancements will be used to develop and deliver cutting edge technologies to the warfighter. This capability area utilizes cyber technology investments by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and DoD national laboratories. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging cyber technologies into all regions of the Global Information Grid.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  Program activities are protected under AF Network Warfare Special Access Program(s).\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

These plans are intended to meet the written acquisition planning requirements and guidance.  All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process.  The Offensive Cyber program office will utilize existing vehicles such as Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV), etc), General Services Administration (GSA)and Federal Supply Schedules.  Multiple award vehicles provide a wide range of commercially available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to offensive cyber operations.  These multiple award vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) and only require that we provide a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies."
