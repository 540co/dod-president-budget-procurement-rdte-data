            "val": "This Navy unique program addresses all technology areas associated with Navy\/Marine Corps aircraft operations aboard ships. The program includes:\n\n- (2208) - Development of ship hull, mechanical, propulsion, electrical, aviation, and combat support systems, subsystems and components to significantly improve aircraft carrier affordability, manpower requirements, survivability, and operational capabilities, and to meet the requirements of existing and pending regulations and statutes critical to the operation of existing and future aircraft carriers. Funding for this project continues in PE 0604112N in FY 15 and later. \n\n- (3216) - The AN\/SQQ-34 Aircraft Carrier Tactical Support Center (CV-TSC) contributes to Aircraft Carrier (CVN) self defense capabilities. The system provides shipboard support of multi-mission aircraft operating organic to the CVN or under control of the Carrier Strike Group (CSG), providing primary mission support for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Surface Warfare (SUW). The AN\/SQQ-34 also provides auxiliary support for secondary missions such as search and rescue.  The system provides the capability to collect, process, analyze, display, and distribute sensor and tactical data in support of detection, classification, and localization of targets. The AN\/SQQ-34 is incrementally upgraded to support new air platforms and their sensors, centrally integrate ASW capabilities on the CVN, transition maturing technologies, and maintain interoperability with interfacing systems. The system provides support for both rotary wing aircraft (SH-60F, MH-60R) and future support for fixed wing aircraft operating within the CSG (P-8, BAMS).\n\n- (4004) - Development of an advanced technology aircraft launch system in support of the CVN 78 Class design and construction schedule. The Electro Magnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) will replace the current steam catapult on CVN 78 Class ships. EMALS provides better control of applied forces, both peak and transient dynamic, improved\nreliability and maintainability, increased operational availability and reduced operator and maintainer workload. Funding for this project continues in PE 0604112N in FY 15 and later. \n\n\n\n- (4005) - The In-Service Carrier Systems Development Demonstration and Validation program exploits available technologies to deliver an affordable, robust, operator-friendly automation control environment for Navy Aircraft Carrier shipboard equipment. The program provides the system architecture, requirements\/specification development, technology selection, software development (including software baseline), as well as land-based and shipboard testing of new technologies to improve shipboard operations and to reduce workload, manpower requirements, and Total Ownership Costs (TOC)."

This project transitions the most promising technologies from the Navy technology base, other government laboratories, and the private sector into specific advanced development efforts. All systems developed in this project have the potential to support emerging requirements and other promising systems technologies for insertion into new aircraft carrier designs. The emphasis is directed toward developing ship hull, mechanical, propulsion, electrical, aviation, warfare systems, and combat support systems, sub-systems and components to significantly improve aircraft carrier affordability, manpower requirements, survivability, and operational capabilities and to meet the requirements of existing and pending regulations and statutes critical to the operation of future aircraft carriers. This project also encompasses those tasks required to support CVN 78 procurement, including, but not limited to engineering support, programmatic and program support, logistics support, modeling and simulation, test and evaluation, manpower and program related studies, and design support systems, such as the Integrated Digital Environment (IDE). Funding for this project continues in PE 0604112N in FY 15 and later."

The system provides shipboard support of multi-mission aircraft operating organic to the CVN or under control of the Carrier Strike Group (CSG), providing primary mission support for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Surface Warfare (SUW). The AN\/SQQ-34 also provides auxiliary support for secondary missions such as search and rescue.  The system provides the capability to collect, process, analyze, display, and distribute sensor and tactical data in support of detection, classification, and localization of targets. The AN\/SQQ-34 is incrementally upgraded to support new air platforms and their sensors, centrally integrate ASW capabilities on the CVN, transition maturing technologies, and maintain interoperability with interfacing systems. The system provides support for both rotary wing aircraft (SH-60F, MH-60R) and future support for fixed wing aircraft operating within the CSG (P-8, BAMS).\n \nAdditionally, this project will mature the development of low-cost multi-beam Ku-Band planar phased arrays and associated integrated radio systems, and addresses the major cost drivers of planar arrays and their associated radios. This effort will be the first spiral of a major cost reduction effort for multi-beam arrays, with the goal of showing a path to a production cost of less than one third the cost of existing array technologies. This development will produce key integrated components needed to reduce the cost of arrays and will provide prototype multi-beam Ku-Band receiving and transmitting arrays\/radios using these components. The effort will also emphasize advances in technologies associated with multi-path interference, scan angle losses and networking waveforms.\n(Speed to Fleet) The CV-TSC program provides increased situational awareness to the Carrier Strike Group (CSG) in support of force protection, primarily in the area of Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW).  A portion of this program will focus on maturing low-cost multi-beam Ku-Band planar phased arrays and associated integrated radio systems that will be used to support data links to multiple MH-60Rs.  This specific effort will address the need for low cost communications security (COMSEC) devices that are compatible with phased array systems, and that are needed to secure these data links."

The Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) will be the aircraft catapult for CVN 78 Class ships.  EMALS provides better control of applied forces, both peak and transient dynamic, improved reliability and maintainability, increased operational availability, and reduced operator and maintainer workload. Funding for this project continues in PE 0604112N in FY 15 and later."

The program provides the system architecture, requirements\/specification development, technology selection, software development (including software baseline), as well as land-based and shipboard testing of new technologies to improve shipboard operations and to reduce workload, manpower requirements, and Total Ownership Costs. Initial technologies include the Ship Control System Governor Software Development, Tank Preservation, Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) Replacements, Advanced Damage Control System (ADCS), Weapons Elevator Control Accumulator Replacement, and the Integrated Condition Assessment System. Demonstration technologies include Advanced Damage Control System (ADCS) software improvements, A\/C Plant Model, Input\/Output Controller (IOC) Replacement, Fleet Wireless Personal digital Assistant (PDA), Weapons Elevator Laser Positioning System, Legacy Steering Interface upgrades, CVN Integrated Topside Design (ITD) location option evaluation tools, Antenna to Antenna coupling analysis tools.  Wireless systems, smart sensors, lighting systems, knowledge-based systems, automated casualty control, automated technology for workload reduction, linked smart devices, common software tools for interoperability, and self-healing network are technologies being considered for future applications including the following: Integrated Bridge control Data Logger, C4I Network Performance Modeling and Analysis, NCDS Packet Filtering Device, Network Data Logger Device, Portable Communication System (PCS) proof of concept, Ship Control System (SCS) Onboard trainer, Universal Portable Command and Control Unit (PCCU)."
