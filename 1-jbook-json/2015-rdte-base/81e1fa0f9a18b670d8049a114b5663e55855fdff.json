            "val": "The Joint Warfighting Program (JWP) is a relatively small but pivotal resource that synchronizes two Department-wide domains, military requirements and acquisition, with shared analyses and actionable assessments.  The account underwrites two related activities supporting development of the Department's joint warfighting capability.  These resources are a slim residual of much larger accounts supporting unique warfare capability analyses for joint customers including major combatant commander staffs and the Joint Staff.  These analyses and assessments deliver independent perspectives on ways to align Service and Agency investments and potential solutions for capability gaps created by evolving threats not aligned to single Component missions.  Iterative military budget reductions to joint mission support programs significantly increased demand for JWP support from joint staffs and \u201cunits in the field\u201d assigned to joint missions. \n\nThe JWP resources are dedicated to analytic support for joint capability analysis and joint customers.  JWP provides a safety net for analytic support responding to emergent joint capability requirements and capability gaps for identifying potential material solutions.  Typical projects funded with JWP include translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements, identification of candidate solutions via experimentation, translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations, and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources dedicated to direct support joint commands provides analytic expertise not normally allocated via formal staffing billets.  In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.  JWP resources also support Mission Area Portfolio Assessments (MAPA), and the development of tools supporting joint analytic efforts.\n\nThe balance of JWP funds contributes resources to examination of potential remedies for joint mission capability gaps.  These early assessments of potential capability gap solutions can accelerate engineering development, subsequent field experiments, and capability demonstrations in field conditions.  This segment of JWP often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.  The resources sustain a small segment of civilian operation research analysis (currently hosted by the Institute for Defense Analysis \u2013 IDA and the Naval Postgraduate School - NPS).  Administered by the Joint Operations Support (JOS) division within OSD\u2019s AT&L organization, JOS works closely and continuously with joint customers around the world.  Analytic project selection is undertaken in consultation with the OSD staffs serving AT&L and Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff."

Joint warfare independent analysis often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.  These resources leverage a small analytic framework (currently consisting of analysts at the Institute for Defense Analysis \u2013 IDA, and the Naval Postgraduate School - NPS).  Administered by the Joint Operations Support cell within OSD\/AT&L, this fund capability gap definition and technology based initiatives.  Project selection is undertaken in consultation with the OSD staffs serving AT&L and Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff."
