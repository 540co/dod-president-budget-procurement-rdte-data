CCS-C uses modified commercial off the shelf hardware\/software to control all emerging and legacy MILSATCOM systems including Milstar, Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS), Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) and Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellites.  \n\nThe CCS-C project 644870 funds software and database development for WGS Block I and II satellites, and AEHF satellites 1 through 3.  The WGS and AEHF procurement program elements will fund the mission unique software and databases for the WGS Block II Follow-On satellites and the AEHF 4-6 satellites, respectively.  CCS-C will also evolve the system architecture to provide increased performance for additional satellites; to comply with DoD, Air Force, and AFSPC-directed standards for Information Assurance, Satellite Control Standardization, and Net-Readiness; and to add space situational awareness and new C2 training system capabilities.    \n\nIn FY14, due to a change in Budget Activity from 4 to 5, funds transfer to PE 0605433F, Project 657102.  \n\nFunding is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, as it supports component development and prototyping for MILSATCOM satellites."
