The data and reports from ADSS provide the vital feedback mechanism essential to an effective programming and management process.  The hardware and software components of ADSS interact and communicate via the DOD standard communications infrastructure.  The system uses DOD information transfer assets that provide seamless communications within and across systems and media.  Full Operational Capability (FOC) occurs in FY2014.  \n\nThe Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) is the authoritative data source for recording and managing aircrew training information, aircrew\/parachutist management, flying hour tracking, flight pay management, and flying gate tracking for 70,000 Air Force members. The Air Force uses this information to enhance safety-of-flight operations and to determine eligibility to perform aviation related events. New development work is required to provide additional flying operations information, which will aid in better portraying Air Force readiness, and to feed this data into Defense Readiness Reporting System Strategic (DRRS-S). These enhanced capabilities, to be developed incrementally, include the following:  electronic flight record, support enhanced flying hour management\/execution, simulator and remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) management\/utilization, full career logbook, training look-back, aircrew member man-month allocation, enhanced resource and jump module management, and interface with DRRS-S.  ARMS data will also be used to support Headquarters Air Force\/Major Command (HAF\/MAJCOM) level readiness decision reports\/analytics.  New development work in support of ARMS needs to be accomplished with RDT&E versus O&M funds. \n\nThis program is Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The Air Force uses this information to enhance safety-of-flight operations and to determine eligibility to perform aviation related events. ARMS interfaces with the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) and multiple operations and flight scheduling systems such as Patriot Excalibur (PEX), Graduate Training Integration Management System (GTIMS), Center Operations On-Line (COOL), Global Decision Support System (GDSS), and Automated Aircrew Management System (AAMS) and is used to determine whom to select for flying operations, assignment actions, and promotion of aircrew members.\n \nNew development work is required to provide additional flying operations information, which will aid in better portraying Air Force readiness, and to feed this data into Defense Readiness Reporting System Strategic (DRRS-S). These enhanced capabilities, to be developed incrementally, include the following:  electronic flight record, support enhanced flying hour management\/execution, simulator and RPA management\/utilization, full career logbook, training look-back, aircrew member man-month allocation, enhanced resource and jump module management, and interface with DRRS-S.  Additional development work on the existing ARMS, such as database flattening and Business Process Reengineering (BPR) actions, is required prior to incorporating these enhanced capabilities."
