This is accomplished through engineering changes resulting from continuous review of sub-systems to maintain system supportability, safety, reduce total ownership costs, improve fleet readiness, address obsolescence issues, and improve vehicle survivability and performance.  The AAV program also includes a survivability upgrade which will increase AAVP7A1 survivability and force protection while maintaining the required land and water mobility performance.  This upgrade is derived from the need for an operationally effective amphibious armored personnel carrier capability bridge until the future amphibious portfolio of vehicles reaches full operational capability.\n\nThe increase from FY14 to FY15 represents the AAV Survivability Upgrade prototype build contract option award, and design engineering for AAV turret, power train, and suspension improvements; as well as nonrecurring engineering and design for AAV electrical characterization, automatic fire supression system, C2 system enhancements, and AAV obsolescence and safety modifications."

The LAV Product Improvement Program funds modification and sustainment activities and the development and testing of modifications of three programs; the LAV Modification Program, the LAV Anti-Tank Modernization (ATM) Program, and the LAV Survivability Upgrades Program. These programs will ensure that the LAV FOV will be capable of conducting its assigned missions by enhancing lethality and survivability; reliability, availability, maintainability and durability; as well as reducing operations and support costs.  \n\nThe funding decrease from FY14 to FY15 reflects adjustments to the LAV Acquisition Program Changes and resulting realignment of funds.

The Marine Corps PM-LAV Modification Team uses multi-disciplined integrated project teams consisting of engineering, logistical, contracting and financial personnel to manage Modification projects.  The majority of contracts issued under the Modification line are subject to the competitive acquisition process. Currently the LAV Modification and Sustainment program will capture the Mobility and Obsolescence kits consisting of Power Pack, Driveline, Steering, Electrical System, Suspension, Hull Modifications and Ballistic Protection Upgrade Package (BPUP) Kits.  The Mobility and Obsolescence program will address the Family of Light Armored Vehicles (FOLAV) automotive system obsolescence and reduced performance due to increased Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW).  This will be achieved through acquisition and the integration of replacement Powerpack, Driveline, Steering, Electrical System, Suspension, Hull Modifications and Ballistic Protection Upgrade Package (BPUP) Kits.  This effort will require deliverable kits during the Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, to include Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) and Modification Instructions (MI) for each of the 7 LAV variants and all Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) products (training, technical publications, tools, test equipment, provisioning, etc.) to support Developmental Testing, Operational Assessment, Independent Operational Test and Evaluation and fielding.  \n\nThe LAV Anti-Tank Modernization (ATM) program will focus on integrating a new turret into the LAV-AT variant with options for production.  The LAV-ATM is a replacement for the obsolete M901A1 turret to correct operational and readiness deficiencies.  It will be capable of firing the current family of Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided (TOW) missiles and be forward compatible with the next generation of heavy anti-armor missiles.  The program was approved in December of 2009 as part of the Material Development Decision to enter at Milestone B (MS B) based on the technical maturity of the capabilities required, schedule, and budget.  Milestone B approval was achieved in Mar 2011 and the EMD contract was awarded in Apr 2012. Once the EMD phase is complete, a combined MS C and Full Rate Production Review (FRPR) are planned to be followed by a Production and Deployment Phase and Operations and Support Phase.\n\nThe Survivability Upgrades program will only include replacing and relocating the legacy LAV-25 fuel cells (currently located under the scout seats in the LAV-25) with self sealing fuel cells and adding blast attenuating seats for all 7 LAV variants.  These projects are being executed as ECPs."

FOSAM is a level of effort program that provides for research and development, procurement, and assessment of optical systems and implementation of modifications for these systems as well as life-cycle management efforts.  The research and development of future capabilities include, but are not limited to, fused\/multi-spectral (e.g., combined image intensifier and thermal imaging) optical and laser systems.  Additionally, this line supports the procurement of over 600,000 magnified day optics, thermal imagers, image intensifier, lasers, and illuminators principle end items (PEI) due to combat losses, wash-outs, and increases in Approved Acquisition Objectives.  Sustainment efforts include sustainment of optics capabilities and\/or improvements to the performance, maintainability, supportability, service life, ergonomics, and safety enhancements."

Physical integration, capability analysis, modeling and simulation, ergonomics, and configuration management are facilitated by this program in working with the various program managers and project officers in the development of their unique items that contribute to the squads overall capabilities. Weight and volume management are fundamental considerations in the insertion or modernization of any squad equipment. MERS works with Joint and NATO soldier modernization programs to harvest new technologies to increase the capability of the rifle squad. The program also ensures the integration of the rifle squad into the various mobility platforms currently in service and being developed to ensure a Marine and his equipment can operate effectively. This program is essential to ensure the combined synergistic equipment effects enhance the war-fighting functions of the Marine rifle squad towards the strategic Marine Corps war-fighting vision for the future.\n\nMarine Enhancement Program (MEP) provides Research, Development, Test and Evaluation funding for low visibility, low cost items. It focuses on items of equipment which will benefit the individual Marine by reducing the load, increasing survivability, enhancing safety, and improving combat effectiveness. The emphasis of the program is on non-developmental item\/commercial off the shelf (NDI\/COTS) available items which can be quickly evaluated and fielded. This program is coordinated with the Army's Soldier Enhancement Program (SEP).\n\nAmmunition Life Cycle Management Program responsibility for Total Life Cycle Management for ground conventional munitions.  Accordingly, PM Ammo is a member of the joint services Ammunition Logistics Research and Development IPT (ALR&D IPT). Each year the IPT solicits R&D projects from all of the services.  The IPT looks for innovative ideas to enhance logistical support for munitions.  Approximately 20 Ammo Logistics R&D projects are voted on each year by the IPT.  They are prioritized by voting actions of the Senior Review Board and funding sources are identified. Since the funding for ammunition will likely decrease as the Marine Corps draws down and we end our participation in OEF, ammunition logistics R&D projects designed to extend the shelf life of our current inventory, provide enhanced packaging to protect our munitions, and other such projects will go a long way to ensure the Marine Corps can maintain a reliable conventional ammunition inventory into the future.

It replaces all howitzers in all missions in the USMC and replaces the M198 howitzer as the general support artillery for light forces in the Army. The LW155 fires unassisted projectiles to a range of 15 miles and assisted projectiles to 19 miles. The addition of the digital fire control system enables the weapon to program and fire the improved Excalibur precision-guided munition to ranges in excess of 25 miles with better than 10-meter Circular Error Probable (CEP) accuracy. The LW155 is the first ground combat system whose major structures are made of high strength titanium alloy and the system makes extensive use of hydraulics to operate the breech, load tray, recoil and wheel arms. The combination of titanium structures and the use of hydraulic systems resulted in a significant weight savings over the M198 system (7000 lbs.). Compared to the M198, the LW155 emplaces three-times faster and displaces four-times faster. It traverses 32 percent more terrain worldwide and is 70 percent more survivable than the M198. The LW155 was first introduced into the Marine Corps in April 2005 and since then 10th, 11th, 12th and 14th Marines and the schoolhouses have been fielded. The Army has been fielding the system to its Stryker Brigades and Fires Brigades. The LW155 is currently in OEF with both Services."

Its portable configuration allows Marines to train in areas where there are few options for training garrison, aboard ship, at remote reserve locations, and deployed. DVTE training includes language and culture training, platoon and squad level tactics, employment of supporting arms, and various Recognition of Combatants (ROC) packages. DVTE is part of a Commander's \"training toolkit\" contributing to the building block approach to standards based training focusing on achieving an improved level of combat readiness.\n\nDue to DVTE being non-MAGTF Integration Plan compliant, there is minimal risk of losing the expanded training capability.  As a result, funds were reduced throughout the FYDP.  DVTE will utilize operations and maintenance funding for future software updates."

Items approved for procurement will transition into Procurement Marine Corps and the Operation and Maintenance Marine Corps lines for Individual Combat Equipment, Medical Equipment and Shelters. The focus is to provide state of the art combat equipment (e.g. lightweight helmet, sleeping bags, load bearing systems, etc.), medical equipment (e.g. Authorized Medical Allowance (AMAL)\/Authorized Dental Allowance (ADAL), Enroute Care, Mobile Medical Monitors, etc.), and Family of Shelters (soft wall, different frames and fabrics, etc.). The benefits will be reduced logistics, less weight, improved combat effectiveness, better echelon I and II care for Marines, improved individual and unit protection, tactical mobility, etc. The employment of state-of-the-art equipment will ensure Marines are equipped with the best items that technology can offer."

A key component of all of the BAD programs is that as new threats emerge on the battlefield, BAD equipment must constantly adapt to meet these new threats. BAD programs are truly a force multiplier on the battlefield of today and tomorrow.

The system includes one launcher, two Re-Supply Systems, and the MFOM. HIMARS will provide the Fleet Marine Force with 24 hour ground-based, responsive General Support\/General Support Reinforcing (GS\/GSR) indirect fires which accurately engage targets at long range (60+km), with high volumes of lethal fire under all weather conditions throughout all phases of combat operations ashore, to include irregular warfare and distributed operations. HIMARS is a significant improvement over previously fielded ground fire support systems. During a 24 hour period, the system is expected to conduct multiple moves and multiple fire missions. Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) is the primary munition for units fielded with the HIMARS and MLRS rocket and missile platforms. GMLRS provides close, medium, and long range precision and area fires to destroy, suppress, and shape threat forces and protect friendly forces against cannon, mortar, rocket and missile artillery, light material and armor, personnel, command and control, and air defense surface targets. GMLRS integrates guided and control packages and an improved rocket motor achieving greater range and precision accuracy, requiring fewer rockets to defeat targets, thereby reducing the logistics burden.\n\nThe two fielded variants are GMLRS with Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM\/Increment 1) and GMLRS Unitary (U\/Increment 2), a 200 pound class high explosive warhead. The GMLRS U is the only variant currently in production, integrating a multi-mode fuse and high explosive warhead making it an all weather, low collateral damage, precision strike rocket. GMLRS U expands the MLRS target set into urban and complex environments by adding point, proximity, and delay fusing modes. GMLRS U are being fired in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), and has demonstrated high effectiveness and low collateral damage while supporting Marines in combat. A third variant of GMLRS, the alternative warhead (AW\/Increment 3) is being developed to replace DPICM and meet the requirements outlined in a 25 June 2008 cluster munitions policy, which requires all cluster munitions by 2019 to produce less than 1% Unexploded Ordinance (UXO) on the battlefield. HIMARS satisfies the Marine Corps requirement for an indirect fire system that is responsive, maneuverable, and is capable of engaging targets at long range. The Reduced Range Practice Rocket (RRPR) includes training devices for tactical training, classroom training and handling exercises."

The Marine Corps launcher and ammo requirements closely match U.S. Army requirements. The U.S. Army HIMARS program received increased funding and is now an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC level program. Marine Corps Resupply System requirements are unique. Accordingly, the Marine Corps is an integrator and must ensure the required warfighting capability is fielded to the Marine Corps operating forces. The USMC has aligned funds to reflect an emphasis on not only hardware development, but also the integration of these principle end items while providing associated evaluation and oversight, and the development of associated rocket munitions in conjunction with the Army. Additionally, the Marine Corps program is establishing the training and support methodologies that will result in associated skill sets required within the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps strategy is incorporating acquisition and capability upgrades to both the systems and rocket munitions. These improvements parallel the U.S. Army's acquisition strategy."

                            "val": "This project develops Joint and Marine Corps unique improvements to artillery fire support technology that supports the artillery triad of fires and fire support equipment. These initiatives include but are not limited to the following: the Expeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS), munitions development & testing (to include rocket munitions), as well as testing and development of the Family of Artillery Munitions (FAM), Common Laser Ranger Finder (CLRF) integrated capability, and the Modeled Meteorological Information Manager (MMIM).  \n\nEFSS is an all-weather, ground based indirect fire system designed to support the vertical assault element of the Ship-To-Objective Maneuver (STOM) force.  The EFSS is defined as a Launcher, Mobility Platform (prime mover), Ammunition, Ammunition Supply Vehicle, and Technical Fire Direction and Control equipment necessary for orienting weapons to an azimuth of fire.  EFSS supports irregular warfare and distributed operations.  \n\nFAM is used to develop and mature artillery munitions for the Marine Corps triad of fire.  \n\nThe CLRF is a lightweight, eye-safe target laser rangefinder capable of being carried and employed by a single Marine.  CLRF Integrated Capability (CLRF IC) is a replacement to the existing CLRF Suite of Equipment.  CLRF IC provides the observer the ability to perform target detection, recognition, identification, and location determination in a suite of systems.  \n\nThe Modeled Meteorological Information Manager (MMIM) will be the primary artillery meteorological capability at the artillery battalion and regiment providing the ability to create, receive, manage, and transmit near real time gridded meteorological information supporting artillery and target acquisition systems significantly enhancing the accuracy of meteorological information.  \n\nThe Fire Support Mod Line is a set of Marine Corps efforts to address critical operational and logistics deficiencies in existing, fielded fire support\/weapons systems and equipment.  The line provides technical refresh, development of target acquisition, and artillery survey and meteorological systems.  Funding is used to ensure Clinger Cohen Act (CCA) and Information Assurance (IA) requirements are met, execution of product improvements\/modifications, and upgrades to system hardware and software for the Ground Counter Fire Sensor (GCFS), Marine Artillery Survey Set (MASS), Meteorological Station Group (MSG), Global Positioning System Survey (GPS-S) and the Improved Position Azimuth Determining System (IPADS), Lightweight Target Designator (LTD) and the CLRF as well as for upgrades, engineering change proposals, and modifications for guided munitions and fire control systems.  Funding is also used for upgrades, engineering change proposals (ECPs) and modifications for guided munitions and fire control systems which falls within Fire Support Systems for the Marine Corps. \n\nThe Internally Transportable Vehicle (ITV) is a program in this project that is a lightweight, highly mobile vehicle that provides a deployed Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) with a ground vehicle internally transportable in the MV-22 and CV-22 tilt-rotor aircraft as well as the CH53-E and MH-47 aircraft. The ITV has two configurations: The Light Strike Vehicle (ITV-LSV) and EFSS Prime Mover (ITV-PM).\n\nInsensitive Munitions Program's purpose is to field munitions that are insensitive munitions (IM) compliant.\n\nConventional Ground Ammunition project identifies and develops Insensitive Munitions (IM) Technologies to address IM shortfalls in new Marine Corps development or improvements to legacy Conventional Ground Ammunition to meet OSD mandated IM compliance requirements.  These IM Technology investments directly support the development of the bi-annual Marine Corps Insensitive Munitions Strategic Plan (IMSP) to address the identified IM technology needs of the Marine Corps."

These IM Strategic Plans, Supporting Plan of Actions, and Milestones, with funding trial, are submitted to the JROC, demonstrating each Service's commitment to the continuing effort to improve IM, for approval.

IM\ncompliancy is measured by the performance of munitions to six tests; Fast Cook-Off, Slow Cook-Off, Bullet Impact,\nFragment Impact, Sympathetic Detonation, and Shape Charge Jet. Services are required to submit IM Strategic Plans annually delineating how they intend on executing their Service IM effort to maximize IM improvements to both new development and legacy conventional ground ammunition. These IM Strategic Plans, Supporting Plan of Actions, and Milestones, with funding trial, are submitted to the JROC, demonstrating each Service's commitment to the continuing effort to improve IM characteristics of Conventional Ground Ammunition, for approval. In order to achieve the system's IM performance, the Conventional Ground Ammunition developer\/owner must have new technology identified and available to address IM shortfalls at the onset of the ammunition development or available for insertion during improvement opportunities for legacy ammunition. Under this program, the USMC invests in IM technology which will improve its existing munitions IM reactions or ability to reliably initiate IM technologies and complies with the OSD mandate for maximum feasible IM compliance."

Development will typically be conducted at government labs.  \n\nEfforts that fall under the Expeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS) funding line include; The EFSS system; the High Explosive Rocket Assisted Projectile (HE-RAP); and the Precision Extended Range Munition (PERM).  The strategy for HE-RAP consists of procuring 350 HE-RAP test articles that can be utilized to conduct some minor characterization testing and data gathering for future Marine Corps operations.  The acquisition approach for PERM is being conducted in two phases; In Step 1, two CPFF contracts were awarded to two vendors for the development and delivery of production representative rounds.  Step 1 allows the development of existing technology, the management of technology risks, and demonstration of PERM designs prior to Milestone C (MS C). In Step 2 one FFP contract will be awarded for the production and delivery of the Total Munitions Requirement (TMR) and a priced option for the procurement of the vendor's Technical Data Package (TDP) for the approved material solution.  PERM will supplement the capability of EFSS by increasing the effective range from 8km to up to 20 km.  \n\nCurrently the Family of Artillery Munitions (FAM) Program includes four (4) artillery munitions which are being developed by the Army. The Army is in possession of these programs but continues to interact with the FAM IPT to ensure USMC requirements and capability needs are met. This allows the USMC to become users of the munition and certify the round for naval transportation. The munitions include but are not limited to; XM1156 Precision Guidance Kit (PGK), Excalibur, Joint Extended Range Illumination Projectile (JERIP), and XM1128 155mm RAP Round. Each munitions status is tracked to ensure Marine Corps requirements are satisfied throughout the systems lifecycle.  The Marine Corps guides WESRB certification to bring ordnance from the Army into the Marine Corps inventory. Fire power enhancement used selected upgrades from Army developmental programs to create a system that more readily meets Marine Corps requirements.  \n\nCLRF-IC will be procured using competitive contract strategy upon completion of the Engineering Manufacturing Development phase.  \n\nMMIM was procured and is managed by the US Army.  The Marine Corps is an active participant in the Army program.\n\nFire Support Mods:  A Sole Source contract was awarded to upgrade the GCFS command post computer and procure an Interface Control Document that will allow the program office to complete the digital communications requirement using competitive contracting.  Limited research and analysis will be done as necessary to support ECPs for the MASS, IPADS and miscellaneous targeting devices.\n\nThe ITV Program will identify existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), government off-the-shelf (GOTS), and military off-the-shelf (MOTS) components to improve ITV reliability and safety by utilizing the Nevada Automotive Test Center (NATC).\n\nThe Insensitive Munitions Program is intended to invest in technologies that will improve the IM responses of currently fielded USMC priority munitions items in accordance with the USMC IM Strategic Plan and the OSD mandate to field IM compliant munitions to the maximum extent practicable.\n\nThe Conventional Ground Ammunition strategy is to invest in Insensitive Munitions (IM) technologies to address IM shortfalls of priority programs identified in the bi-annual Marine Corps Insensitive Munitions Strategic Plan (IMSP).  Once the IM technologies have been successfully demonstrated and matured, the intent is to insert the new technologies into new conventional ground ammunition development as well as provide opportunities to improve legacy munitions IM characteristics.  The IM R&D effort directly addresses the mandated OSD requirement to obtain incremental IM improvement in pursuit of becoming fully IM compliant to the maximum extent practicable."
