            "val": "The National Defense Education Program (NDEP) engages the full science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) continuum to ensure the Department of Defense (DoD) will have access to high-quality STEM personnel vital to national defense now and in the future.  STEM degree production compared to U.S. employment projections show that there is likely to be a significant shortage of STEM professionals, especially in computing, information technology, and electronics engineering, DoD mission critical occupations for which NDEP\u2019s continuum of initiatives provides a pool of exceptional talent.  NDEP\u2019s portfolio provides short, medium, and long-term solutions to the perfect storm of workforce challenges, which include: (1) impending retirement of 33 percent of DoD\u2019s STEM workforce; (2) low college readiness rate and interest in STEM majors; and (3) challenges that DoD, like other Federal employers, face in recruiting and retaining high-quality STEM talent in a competitive environment.\n\nNDEP aligns to the DoD Science and Technology (S&T) priorities and the integrated STEM\/Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU\/MIs) program, synchronized with the Federal 5-Year STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic and Implementation Plans and the DoD Strategic Workforce Plan (in progress).  NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation as required by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.\n\nScience, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 academic STEM disciplines and moves graduates directly into DoD's workforce following graduation.  Internships engage SMART scholars in hands-on, authentic research and work experiences in DoD facilities, thereby enhancing their educational experience and building a public service commitment to the Department\u2019s mission.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has supported ~1,455 students from bachelor to doctoral levels and to date ~900 have completed program studies and transitioned into the DoD workforce.  SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of high-quality U.S. technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD\u2019s mission. \n\nNational Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) currently supports 29 world-class researchers (NSSEFF Fellows) in scientific areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional future talent.  The NSSEFF Fellows work with ~100 undergraduate students, ~270 graduate students, and ~150 post-doctoral scholars at their respective academic institutions.  Three cohorts of NSSEFF Fellows, with the first selected in FY 2008, provides a critical resource for connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise. Fellows\u2019 work spans all seven DoD S&T priorities and defines a broad set of emerging scientific research areas, critical to the development of future DoD technologies.  NSSEFF Fellows serve as speakers at DoD events, reviewers on panels for DoD science, and as collaborators with scientists and engineers at DoD\u2019s laboratories and other research facilities.  The NSSEFF program is realigned to PE 0601110D8Z Basic Research Initiatives in FY 2015.\n\nNDEP Pre-Kindergarten (PK)-12 engages, develops, and attracts STEM talent for future DoD military and civilian workforce needs via 68 local sites and nine national organizations.  NDEP PK-12 leverages the DoD\u2019s STEM expertise to connect students, teachers, schools, and public sector and industry partners with DoD subject matter experts (SMEs) primarily in those communities adjacent to DoD laboratories and bases where the talent pool resides.  Authentic STEM experiences for teachers and students include hands-on activities that are aligned with DoD\u2019s technical workforce requirements.  Since FY 2007, NDEP PK-12 has increased the number of DoD facilities that directly engage local education authorities (LEAs) to: (1) build student interest in STEM fields and disciplines and in careers specific to DoD; (2) develop DoD-relevant science, engineering and mathematics skills; and (3) provide future talent to fulfill DoD\u2019s demand for highly skilled STEM professionals.  NDEP PK-12 has utilized 4,100 exceptional DoD STEM professionals to reach 500,000 students and 8,300 teachers in 30 states.  As one specific example, DoD SMEs contributed over 8,000 hours to lead FIRST Robotics Competition teams, with over 90 percent of team members reporting that the hands-on experience taught them about how science and technology can be used to solve real-world science and engineering problems.  The PK-12 program is terminated in FY 2014, though portions may transfer to the Department of Education."

SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of high-quality U.S. technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD\u2019s mission. \n\nNational Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program supports world-class researchers in scientific areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional future talent.  The NSSEFF provides a critical resource for connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise. NSSEFF Fellows\u2019 work spans all seven DoD S&T priorities and defines a broad set of emerging scientific research areas, critical to the development of future DoD technologies.  NSSEFF Fellows serve as speakers at DoD events, reviewers on panels for DoD science, and as collaborators with scientists and engineers at DoD\u2019s laboratories and other research facilities.  The NSSEFF program is realigned to PE 0601110D8Z Basic Research Initiatives in FY 2015.\n\nNDEP Pre-Kindergarten (PK)-12 engages, develops, and attracts STEM talent for future DoD military and civilian workforce needs via 68 local sites and nine national organizations.  NDEP PK-12 leverages the DoD\u2019s STEM expertise to connect students, teachers, schools, and public sector and industry partners with DoD subject matter experts (SMEs) primarily in those communities adjacent to DoD laboratories and bases where the talent pool resides.  Authentic STEM experiences for teachers and students include hands-on activities that are aligned with DoD\u2019s technical workforce requirements.  Since FY 2007, NDEP PK-12 has increased the number of DoD facilities that directly engage local education authorities (LEAs) to: (1) build student interest in STEM fields and disciplines and in careers specific to DoD; (2) develop DoD-relevant science, engineering and mathematics skills; and (3) provide future talent to fulfill DoD\u2019s demand for highly skilled STEM professionals.  NDEP PK-12 has utilized 4,100 exceptional DoD STEM professionals to reach 500,000 students and 8,300 teachers in 30 states.  As one specific example, DoD SMEs contributed over 8,000 hours to lead FIRST Robotics Competition teams, with over 90 percent of team members reporting that the hands-on experience taught them about how science and technology can be used to solve real-world science and engineering problems.  The PK-12 program is terminated in FY 2014, though portions may transfer to the Department of Education."

The disciplines are: Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering; Biosciences; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry; Civil Engineering; Cognitive, Neural, and Behavioral Sciences; Computer Science; Electrical Engineering; Geosciences; Industrial and Systems Engineering; Information Sciences; Materials Science and Engineering; Mathematics; Mechanical Engineering; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering; Nuclear Engineering; Oceanography; Operations Research; and Physics.  Upon completion of their degree, students fulfill a service commitment to DoD on a one-to-one payback per year of education funded.  In part, SMART's success is measured by participants that remain in the DoD workforce beyond their required service commitment: 84 percent who have completed their service commitment are still employed by DoD beyond their original service commitment.\n\nOversight of the SMART program falls under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&E)).  Two types of individuals participate in the program: retention scholars who are current DoD employees and recruitment scholars who are college students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs and represent new talent for the DoD.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in hands-on research and work experiences in DoD labs, thereby enhancing their educational experience and building a public service commitment to the Department\u2019s mission.\n\nSince FY 2005, ~1,455 students have participated in SMART at ~ 160 sponsoring facilities.  As of August 2013, ~900 SMART scholars have transitioned into the service commitment phase.  To date, these scholars have transitioned as civilian employees into the Air Force, Army, Navy, and other DoD components."
