            "val": "The Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) is the Department of the Navy's (DoN) only Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). CNA provides independent, objective, and expert analyses based on its unique access to sensitive data and hands-on exposure to fleet operations gained through its world-wide field program. CNA's research program is centrally funded by this program element and is primarily concentrated along one Marine Corps category and thirteen Navy categories of study called product areas. These product areas are structured to enhance CNA's focus of research and analysis upon the major present and future needs and issues of the Navy and the Marine Corps. Because of rapid advances in technology, changes in the fleet, the increasing complexity of weapon systems, and reductions in manpower, force structure, budgets, the current security environment, and Department of Defense (DoD) transformation, the Navy and Marine Corps have a greater need for analyses that are sophisticated, relevant, and timely. CNA conducts research and analysis at all security classification levels, to include Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Special Access Programs (SAP). CNA is highly qualified to meet that need."

Marine Corps Division analysts work at CNA headquarters and, through CNA's Field representative Program serve at commands worldwide, including:  Marine Forces Command, Marine Forces Pacific, Marine Special Operations Command, the three Marine Expeditionary Forces, Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron One (MAWTS-1), and in Iraq, providing on-site analysis to deployed Marine forces there. CNA also assigns analysts to support the Deputy Commandants and their staffs as well as other Marine Corps organizations such as the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab, Marine Corps Systems Command, and the Commander, Marine Forces Reserve.  The program areas are linked to the Marine Corps Advocacy (prepotency), which are: (1) Logistics and Infrastructure; (2) Manpower and Training; (3) Research, Development and Acquisition; (4) Operations and Plans; (5) Programs and Resources; (6) Aviation; (7) Combat Development and Integration; and (8) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.  Scientific Analyst support provides six scientific analysts for the following six focus areas: Deputy Commandant (DC), Plans, Policies and Operations; DC Aviation; DC Installation and Logistics; DC Programs and Resources; DC Manpower Reserve Affairs; and Director, Manpower Plans (MP) - Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA). The program continues analytical support for field exercises, Ad Hoc and Quick Response study requirements."

Analyses and solutions relating to support and sustainment in terms of equipment readiness, training, responsiveness and maintaining squadron readiness, development of facilities sustainment and service life programs save the Marine Corps valuable time and resources.  Manpower, force structure, aviation recruiting and retention, and valuations of recruiting, retaining and retiring Marines analyses provide viable personnel solutions in times of shrinking resources.  Intelligence capabilities assessments, analyses of threat assessments from known and unknown enemies, i.e. Al-Qaeda, Northern Africa and Iran, and Joint Irregular Warfare Analytic Baseline (JIWAB) development provide valuable information to assist Marine Corps Intelligence organizations in keeping the force educated and safe.  \n\n- Continued - CNA Initiated - The Marine Corps made available 3% of the annual Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) budgetary funding line (PE 0605154N) to cover the cost of projects initiated by CNA in order to maintain its competency and objectivity. The annual amount allocated to CNA Initiated is subject to adjustment of the PE, and shall not exceed 3% of the PE amount available on 1 April of each year. \n- Continued - Project Development - Efforts expended after a sponsor requested CNA to prepare a proposal for a specific task and continued until such time as the task wasapproved by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) or the effort is terminated, either through rejection of the project proposal or at the direction of the sponsor. \n- Continued - General Concept Development - Efforts by CNA analysts and managers that defined a problem, researched the feasibility of projects, and determined necessary resources for execution of CNA's mission.  General concept development can be further defined into two subdivisions, efforts related to CNA's mission in general and those efforts being made towards initiation of a specific task. \n- Continued - Scientific Analyst Program - CNA scientific analysts are assigned to senior USMC leaders in the Washington, DC area and (1) conducted short-term analyses in response to requests from the senior leader; (2) alerted the leader's staff to relevant analytical work CNA may be doing and provided information on current activities and problems involving the leader's area of responsibility to CNA; and (3) assisted in the definition of analytical problems so that they can be properly addressed in specific study efforts. \n- Continued - Quick Response Program -  Quick response projects are defined as efforts that have a need for an immediate start and that are of 90 days or less in duration. The specific study effort must fall within the scope and focus of the previously defined product areas. \n- Continued - Field Program - CNA provided on-scene, analytical support to operational commanders. CNA field representatives assigned to deploying carrier battle groups: Test, evaluation, and experimentation commands, aviation-focused commands, training commands, amphibious groups, the numbered fleets, and the component commands. The field representatives' expertise was primarily used to evaluate operational capabilities, determine the optimal use of resources, analyze exercises, operations, and experiments, and assisted in the development of current operations (CONOPs) and tactics. \n- Continued - Field Exercise Support - The Exercise Program consisted of carefully selected CNA analysts assigned to support various Navy, Marine Corps, and Joint Commanders as they conduct at-sea exercises essential to naval readiness. Specific aspects of exercise support analysis included CNA support during overall fleet exercise activities, detailed data gathering and observations during exercises, and CNA analysis of both synthetic and live training exercises."

This program provides the Marine Corps with independent and objective research and analysis of specific issues\/topics appropriately performed by a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  Marine Corps Division analysts work at CNA headquarters and, through CNA's Field representative Program serve at commands worldwide, including:  Marine Forces Command, Marine Forces Pacific, Marine Special Operations Command, the three Marine Expeditionary Forces, Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron One (MAWTS-1), and in Iraq, providing on-site analysis to deployed Marine forces there. CNA also assigns analysts to support the Deputy Commandants and their staffs as well as other Marine Corps organizations such as the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab, Marine Corps Systems Command, and the Commander, Marine Forces Reserve.  The program areas are linked to the Marine Corps Advocacy (prepotency), which are: (1) Logistics and Infrastructure; (2) Manpower and Training; (3) Research, Development and Acquisition; (4) Operations and Plans; (5) Programs and Resources; (6) Aviation; (7) Combat Development and Integration; and (8) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.  Scientific Analyst support provides six scientific analysts for the following six focus areas: Deputy Commandant (DC), Plans, Policies and Operations; DC Aviation; DC Installation and Logistics; DC Programs and Resources; DC Manpower Reserve Affairs; and Director, Manpower Plans (MP) - Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA). \n\nThe Marine Corps' portion of the CNA program is executed via the Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) Annual Plan which is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. The MCSS maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the Marine Corps.  The MCSS ensures there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the Marine Corps.  Additionally, the Operations Analysis Division of Combat Integration Division (CD&I, MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the Marine Corps and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter for research and analysis.  Other evaluation processes are as follows: \nA) Contract Status Meetings: The Marine Corps participates in contract status meetings. The Contracting Officer chairs monthly meetings with the Marine Corps, and members of the CNA Business Support Group to provide guidance regarding contract management to include reviewing the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) database requirements to emphasize the contractual requirement that all ongoing research be submitted to DTIC to ensure against duplication to reviewing CNA's cost effectiveness and efficiency.\nB) Marine Corps Three-Star Flag Officer Review: The Commanding General, CD&I, MCCDC and the Director, Operations Analysis Division (OAD) frequently to review the current research program and provide guidance to CNA regarding future research requirements. Meetings are essential to provide CNA to ensure that research conducted is of the greatest value to the Marine Corps. The meetings serve as a roadmap for future projects. The Marine Corps' research plan is consolidated with the DoN's Annual Plan that is submitted to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Integration of Capabilities and Resources (N8) for final review and acceptance."

The primary (and most effective) method of review for duplication is the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) review and approval of each and every project proposal submitted by CNA. This method is highly effective in providing the necessary oversight to ensure that duplication of effort does not occur. The Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the USMC. The MCSS ensures that there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the USMC. Additionally, the Studies and Analysis Division of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the USMC and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter and an annual plan for research and analysis. Other evaluation processes: \nA) DoN Contract Status Meetings: As part of the CNA oversight process, the Office of Naval Research Contracting Officer chairs a monthly meeting with the COTR, the USMC, and the CNA's Chief Financial Office to provide guidance regarding contract management. \nB) Two-Star Flag Officers and VCNO Corporate Board Meetings: DoN Two-Star and their equivalent civilian counterparts meet several times a year to review the current fiscal year's research and provide guidance to CNA regarding their future research for DoN. These high level meetings are essential to provide CNA with DoN's guidance to ensure that the research conducted is of the greatest value to DoN. The meetings also serve as the catalyst for the formation of the CNA Annual Plan, CNA's roadmap for research during the upcoming fiscal year. The CNA Annual Plan is then submitted to VCNO\/N8 for final review and acceptance. \nC) CNA Comprehensive Review: Prior to contract renewal, CNA, as an FFRDC, must be evaluated to ensure that the DoN wants to renew CNA's contract for an additional five year period. DoN completes an exhaustive review of sponsors' technical needs and mission requirements; DoN's consideration of other sources; CNA's efficiency and effectiveness; CNA's management and cost effectiveness; as well as the FFRDC establishment criteria and sponsorship agreement. The CNA Comprehensive Review is approved by ASN (RDA) and accepted by OSD (AT&L)."
