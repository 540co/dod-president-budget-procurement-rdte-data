Incorporates capability advancements in Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and expendable countermeasures to develop and deploy countermeasure responses resulting in increased platform survivability.  Resources will be applied to the following areas:  1. Studies and evaluations of current countermeasure and ASE capabilities and limitations, 2. Development and demonstration of advanced countermeasure, 3. Testing and evaluation of advanced countermeasures, 4. Development of system software for the testing and deployment of advanced countermeasure techniques, and 5. Development of and upgrades to modeling tools and specialized equipment required to conduct evaluation of advanced countermeasures."
