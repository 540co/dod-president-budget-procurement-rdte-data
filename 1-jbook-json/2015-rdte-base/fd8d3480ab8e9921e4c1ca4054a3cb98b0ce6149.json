The CNO's ASW initiative will coordinate the development of technologies which move beyond incremental or marginal improvements in ASW effectiveness.  The CNO's vision of \"fundamentally changing the way ASW is currently conducted to render the enemy submarine irrelevant against US and coalition forces\" necessitates a change in the calculus of how the US Navy conducts ASW.  Central to the CNO's ASW initiatives achieving the CNO's vision are several innovative approaches which include using the art-of-the-technologically-possible; minimizing force-on-force; reducing the ASW end-to-end time line; supporting rapid maneuver; developing off-board and distributed ASW detection systems; and finding innovative weapons solutions.  To achieve these key approaches, it is essential to develop new ASW technologies and conduct at-sea experiments to prove\/disprove technology concepts and collect corroborating data.  An OPNAV letter of direction limits the scope of this project, beginning in FY10, to the development\/test of CAS\/VDS and the continuation of studies in support of the ASW Initiative thereafter.  Starting in FY13, the CAS\/VDS effort has been transferred to the Littoral Combat Ship PE 0603581N, Project 3129 budget, as part of the ASW Mission Module."

The CNO's ASW initiative will coordinate the development of technologies which move beyond incremental or marginal improvements in ASW effectiveness.  The CNO's vision of \"fundamentally changing the way ASW is currently conducted to render the enemy submarine irrelevant against US and coalition forces\" necessitates a change in the calculus of how the US Navy conducts ASW.  Central to the CNO's ASW initiatives achieving the CNO's vision are several innovative approaches which include using the art-of-the-technologically-possible; minimizing force-on-force; reducing the ASW end-to-end time line; supporting rapid maneuver; developing off-board and distributed ASW detection systems; and finding innovative weapons solutions.  To achieve these key approaches, it is essential to develop new ASW technologies and conduct at-sea experiments to prove\/disprove technology concepts and collect corroborating data.  An OPNAV letter of direction limits the scope of this project, beginning in FY10, to the development\/test of CAS\/VDS and the continuation of studies in support of the ASW Initiative thereafter.  Starting in FY13, the CAS\/VDS effort has been transferred to the Littoral Combat Ship PE 0603581N, Project 3129 budget, as part of the ASW Mission Module.\nThe detection and identification of underwater mines based on structural acoustic features has been successfully demonstrated.  This structural acoustics (SA) approach offers significant increases in coverage rates together with higher probabilities of detection and lower false alarm rates against most of the threat mines the Navy is expected to encounter in the foreseeable future. Highly successful blind tests have been carried out demonstrating high performance detection and classification with low false alarm rates. This technology is now in transition to the fleet.  The work proposed here, is to develop and demonstrate a long range\/high coverage rate ASW systems concept based on the Low-Frequency Broadband (LFBB) technology using a fleet sonar AN\/SQQ-89 on surface combatants."

The Navy will develop and demonstrate a long range\/high coverage rate ASW systems concept based on the LFBB technology using a fleet sonar AN\/SQQ-89 on surface combatants.  Specifically, using a standard AN\/SQQ-53C as a source and the Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA) as a receiver.  In the Speed to Fleet effort, the Navy will build a special processor that will \"roll on\" the surface combatant and be able to be integrated into the existing AN\/SQQ-89 system.  The processor will run codes already developed in the ONR programs, but now adapted to the ASW problem.  Ultimately, the demonstration will involve testing and documenting the ability of the approach to distinguish and correctly identify low Doppler bottom, near bottom, submarines and false targets as a function of speed and range from target fields."
