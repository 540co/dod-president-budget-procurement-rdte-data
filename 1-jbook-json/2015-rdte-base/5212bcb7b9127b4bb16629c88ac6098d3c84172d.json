This funding supports the acquisition process including concept development, risk reduction, design, integration, test, and demonstration.  Space control systems include both offensive counterspace (OCS) and defensive counterspace (DCS) systems.  OCS systems include the means to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy an adversary's space systems, or the information they provide, which may be used for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.  DCS systems include both active and passive measures to protect U.S. and friendly space related capabilities (satellites, communications links, and supporting ground systems) from enemy attack or interference.  This includes development efforts to prevent adversarial ability to use U.S. space systems and services for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.   Counterspace Command and Control (C2) includes command and control and mission planning capabilities required for the fielding and employment of counterspace systems.  This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, because it is conducting demonstration, engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated counterspace and space control requirements."

Developed capabilities will be integrated into current and future command and control systems.  This program will leverage the Joint Execution and Tasking System for Space (JETSS) effort in the development of C2 for future space control and counterspace mission capabilities.  Requirements for this program are derived from AFSPC prioritized AF IMT 1067 IAW AFSPCI 63-104. The activity to modify and prepare JETSS technology\/capability for transition in the JMS program is planned to occur during Spiral 5."
