This data will be used in support of materiel sourcing and distribution and other Materiel Enterprise missions.  It enables Command visibility of business intelligence and resulting metrics for critical logistics components enabling enterprise-level analytics to be performed in support of the equipping mission within the Army's Force Generation (ARFORGEN) processes. LOGSA and its LIW suite of products and services provide the Army community with vital logistics data necessary for the planning, conducting and sustainment of war fighting capability worldwide. The LMI-DST directly supports Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) by linking available equipment to the Generated Force model. Specifically, LMI-DST synchronizes an Army authoritative Demand Signal for manning, equipping,services & infrastructure and authoritative resourcing (money) information, resulting in an accurate prediction of a ready and properly equipped force."

BENEFITS: As chartered by the Secretary of The Army, LIW will provide enterprise-accepted and trusted information for analysis, aggregation, and reuse in support of the Lead Materiel Integrator (LMI) mission. As an Army enterprise-level repository and retrieval system to facilitate accurate choices and rapid decision making. Specifically, LIW will provide all required data structured in a way that allows for querying and reporting; e.g., equipment authorizations, equipment on-hand, new procurement schedules, RESET production schedules and in-transit visibility from origin and distribution to final destination, in support of the information needs of the Army Materiel Command (AMC) and other command logistics managers. This includes data from all sources designated as authoritative, as well as system derived data and appropriate reference data. This data will be used in support of materiel sourcing and distribution and other Materiel Enterprise missions. LIW enables visibility of business intelligence and resulting metrics for critical logistics components enabling enterprise-level analytics to be performed in support of the equipping mission within the Army's ARFORGEN processes. LIW supports the tenants of Mission Command by logistically empowering the Commander to successfully integrate and synchronize logistics information with warfighter functions in time and space to maximize potential for mission success. ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES: LIW provides the data and custom business intelligence environment to enable Command-specific analysis and presentation of business intelligence displays to satisfy unique command management requirements.\nThe Common CBM Data Warehouse (CCBMDW) is requesting RDT&E funds to develop a web interface that will allow users from RDECOM, the LCMC's, and the PEO's\/PM to query, select, retrieve individual sensor files from the data base and designate a delivery mechanism (SFTP, HTTPS, Data service) in order that they can receive the selected files.  This is a new capability that will replace the current manual method where an analyst calls LOGSA and request a data extract from the CCBMDW be sent to their location via pre-arranged methods.  The new Web Interface will also serve as a platform to enable the user to extract individual data fields from the sensor files that are stored in the CCBMDW in the Army Bulk CBM Data (ABCD) format and download the individual data fields as opposed to the whole file or bundle of files."

The LMI DST integrates logistics domain data from the LIW with materiel demand requirements from the Readiness Enterprise to enable automated decision support for equippers throughout the Army.  In August 2011, a sole-source contract was awarded to Pro Model Corporation to leverage their COTS modeling and simulation capability, the ProModel Application Framework, to develop the Lead Materiel Integrator Decision Support Tool, which is a GOTS product.  Versions 1-3 were developed and released in six-month sprints under Pro Model.  In January, 2013, the effort was moved under LOGSA's Information and Technology Services Contract, under which the latest version (V4) was released in June 2013.  Requirements for additional major version releases are vetted and approved by a General Officer Steering Committee, comprised of representatives from ACOMs, ASCCs, and DRUs, and chaired by AMC HQ.  Base year funding supports new development requirements approved by the GOSC."
