A-RCI Phase I and II introduced Towed Array processing improvements, Phase III introduced Spherical\nArray processing improvements, and Phase IV provided High Frequency (HF) Array processing improvements for SSN 688I, SSGN, VIRGINIA, and SSN 21 Class Submarines. As part of CNO N972's plan to maintain acoustic superiority for in-service submarines, a joint cooperative effort with PEO IWS-5 was established to deliver annual Advanced Processing\nBuilds (APBs) to prevent obsolescence and deliver ongoing capability improvements. The capabilities in the APBs will be integrated as part of A-RCI certified system.\n\nSensor efforts provide increased operational capabilities for littoral operations, situational awareness, and reliability improvements."

The rapid proliferation of complex radar, communications and navigation equipment available to potential adversaries creates an increasingly dense and sophisticated electromagnetic environment.  Sustained and significant improvements to submarine EW systems are required to maintain tactical ship safety and operation effectiveness.   As such EW was raised to a submarine primary mission area in FY2012 by Commander Submarine Forces, and EW is listed as the number one modernization requirement by the Submarine Tactical Requirements Group (STRG).  OPNAV letter dated 17 June 12, SER N97\/12U144401 further codified this need by directing development of a digital Next Generation EW system as an evolution of the AN\/BLQ-10 EW program.  SSEP efforts in support of these needs include;  integration of technology developed and transitioned from the Advanced Submarine Support Equipment Program (ASSEP) into tactical EW systems; interface and capability integration with Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical System Modernization efforts; and, commencing in FY14, development of the Next Generation EW BLQ-10 system. \n\t\t\t\nRDTE Funding line supports the entire AN\/BLQ-10 EW procurement program. The FY15 increase in RDTE budget supports development of EW Next Generation Architecture. Average FY OPN and SCN hardware procurement yearly funds are $100M."

CSRR will leverage VIRGINIA Class Exterior Communications System (ECS) design, utilize VIRGINIA Class ECS Control and Management software, apply a systems approach to design and implementation of Joint Maritime Communication System, and maximize use of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products and emerging technologies.  The Submarine Tactical Communications System project (1411) provides submarines with communications systems designed to: (a) enhance data throughout the automation and integrated network management; (b) convert to ForceNet and tactical data networks; (c) provide submarine Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity; (d) be interoperable with other joint United States and combined allied military networks; and (e) improve reliability, maintainability, and availability. This is accomplished by providing the submarine with a properly integrated mix of fully interoperable Navy standard and COTS communication equipment covering a wide range of frequencies and modes.  The Common Submarine Radio Room (CSRR) integrates COTS and Government Off-The-Shelf components into a single radio room configuration for all classes of submarines.  CSRR leverages and continues the development of VIRGINIA Class ECS which includes Open Systems Architecture design.  The project utilizes land-based integration test facilities to integrate C4I program of record components into the open architecture prior to fleet implementation on all submarine platforms.  This project funds the development of a replacement Simulation\/Stimulation suite to support testing and training requirements.  The project includes system engineering efforts associated with demonstration of new technology which will allow submarines to connect to the global information grid and participate in strike groups, as well as joint operations.  The new technology will ensure the submarine's continued ability to participate in network-centric warfare and exploit its inherent stealth capabilities in support of the joint and combined fight to achieve total battlespace dominance. \t\t\t\t\t\t\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThis program is funded under ENGINEERING and MANUFACTURING DEVELOPMENT because it encompasses development and demonstration of new end-items prior to production approval decision.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFunding in FY15 is to continue CSRR Increment 1 Version 4 systems engineering development for LOS ANGELES, Ship Submersible Ballistic Nuclear (SSBN) and VIRGINIA class submarines and commence Increment 1 Version 4 systems engineering development for Ship Submersible Guided Missile Nuclear (SSGN) and SEAWOLF class submarines.  Continue development of platform specific builds of Control & Management software incorporating Increment 1 Version 4 capabilities.  Complete Increment 1 Version 3 Multi-Purpose Reconfigurable Training System (MRTS) software development for SSBN Operator.  Continue development of the MRTS software for Increment 1 Version 4 capabilities.\t\t\n\nAcquisition Decision Memorandum signed by Assistant Secretary of Navy for Research, Development & Acquisition dated 15 July 2008 approved consolidating Increments 1 and 2 to a single Increment 1 with multiple block upgrades (Versions)."
