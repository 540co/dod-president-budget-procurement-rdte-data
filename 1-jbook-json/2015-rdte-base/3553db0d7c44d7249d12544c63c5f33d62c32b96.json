As such, USASMDC\/ARSTRAT is responsible to develop warfighting concepts, conduct warfighting experiments to validate those concepts, identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership & Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions to realize those space related capabilities.  Army Regulation (AR) 10-87 Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and the Direct Reporting Units, dated 4 September 2007 and AR 5-22 The Army Force Modernization Proponent System dated 19 August 2009 designates USASMDC\/ARSTRAT as the Army Force Modernization proponent for Space and High Altitude Capabilities.\n\nProject 990 funds USASMDC\/ARSTRAT to integrate warfighting concepts and technologies, validate concepts, and identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop DOTMLPF solutions to realize those space and high altitude related capabilities. Provide engineering support to the Joint Friendly Force Tracking (J-FFT) Mission Management Center (MMC) through an associated test-bed for both operational and developmental injection and integration of real-time J-FFT information into the Common Operating Picture (COP) for Combatant Commanders, Joint Task Forces (JTFs), and Coalition Partners.  The MMC injects real-time J-FFT information into the Common Operating Picture for COCOMs, JTFs and Coalition partners.  USSTRATCOM, in accordance with CJCSI 3910.01 (reference V.4.) is designated one of three coordinating agencies for J-FFT within DoD.  CJCSI 3910.01 directs eight Force Modernization tasks to USSTRATCOM.
