The Department of the Navy (DoN) has participated in the development of the AGM-114R, which provides full Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV), FW (Harvest Hawk) and Rotary Wing Capabilities. The AGM-114R also increases lethality (Trajectory Shaping), increases Engagement Envelope (360 deg) and roll-tip off safety issues. The AGM-114R will maximize the Warfighter's operational flexibility by allowing them to effectively engage a variety of stationary and mobile targets, including advanced armor, bunkers, buildings, command and control vehicles, transporter\/erector launchers and patrol craft.   \n\nResearch, Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding will support aircraft airworthiness certification through a combination of missile software verifications, Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordinance (HERO) analysis and aircraft interface validations.  In addition, Development Test\/Operational Test (DT\/OT) flight tests using all-up rounds will be performed during backwards compatibility System Qualification Testing (SQT)."
