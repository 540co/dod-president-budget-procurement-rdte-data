Basic research lays the foundation for future developmental efforts by identifying fundamental principles governing various phenomena and appropriate pathways to exploit this knowledge.  The ILIR program serves as a catalyst for major technology breakthroughs by providing laboratory directors flexibility in implementing novel research ideas, by nurturing promising young scientists and engineers, and is used to attract and retain top doctoral degreed scientists and engineers.  The ILIR program also provides a source of competitive funds for peer reviewed efforts at Army laboratories to stimulate high quality, innovative research with significant opportunity for payoff to Army warfighting capability.  \n\nThis PE supports ILIR at the Army Materiel Command's (AMC) six Research, Development, and Engineering Centers (Project 91A); at the six U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Command Laboratories (Project 91C); the seven laboratories within the Corps Of Engineers' US Army Engineer Research and Development Centers (Project 91D); and at the Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) Technical Center (Project F16).\n\nWork in the PE provides a foundation for applied research initiatives at the Army laboratories and research, development and engineering centers.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the AMC, Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD,and the SMDC, Huntsville, AL."
