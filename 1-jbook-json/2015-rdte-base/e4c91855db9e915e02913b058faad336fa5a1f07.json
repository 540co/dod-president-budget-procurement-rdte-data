These efforts provide the Warfighter with highly accurate, timely cargo\/payload delivery and resupply in all terrain and weather conditions.  Precision delivery\/resupply reduces vulnerability of ground Soldiers, aircraft and crew. Precision aerial delivery supports remote warfare with activities such as placement of battlefield sensors, reduction of Soldier load and initial delivery of key expeditionary base camp assets.

Areas of emphasis include: enhanced nutrient composition to maximize cognitive and physical performance on the battlefield; cutting edge food stabilization and preservation techniques that increase the variety and quality of rations used by the Joint Services; novel ration packaging solutions to minimize degradation of combat rations during storage; field portable biosensors for food-borne pathogen detection and identification as well as predictive modeling tools to protect the Warfighter from food-borne illnesses. This project demonstrates combat feeding equipment with reduced logistics (in component parts, weight, volume, fuel and water) and labor requirements, while improving the quality of food service. The project, a Department of Defense (DoD) program for which the Army has Executive Agent responsibility, provides technology development for Joint Service Combat Feeding. The DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board provides oversight for this project. Demonstrated field feeding equipment transition to Product Manager (PM)-Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS).\n\nEfforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nWork in this project complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602787A (Medical Technology).\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n \nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA."

In addition, special focus is on understanding and demonstrating the impacts of physical and cognitive load on Soldier mission performance and quality of life by implementing strategies to reduce load and\/or optimize loads to reduce injuries. These efforts integrate geographically dispersed laboratory environments to conduct comprehensive assessments and report the technical viability of Soldier system solutions and conducts field demonstrations to obtain relevant feedback for user acceptance and performance validation.\n\nEfforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nWork in this project complements and is fully coordinated with PEs 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0622787A (Medical Technology), PE 0602716A (Human Factors Engineering Technology), PE 0622308A (Advanced Concepts and Simulation), PE 0633015A (Next Generation Training and Simulation Systems), PE 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology), PE 0602624A (Weapons and Munitions Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), and PE 0603008A (Electronic Warfare Advanced Technology).\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n \nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA."

Expeditionary Base Camp (EBC) systems (or remote command outposts) provide an operational capability for Small Combat Units (battalion and below) and Soldiers which are rapidly deployable\/re-locatable and require no Military Construction and limited materiel handing support. The need for this technologically enabled capability has arisen as a result of new tactics, techniques, and procedures used in austere, remote and challenging environments in which stability operations, counterinsurgency operations and peace keeping missions are conducted. The Army envisions continuing to conduct this full range of operations worldwide, particularly in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. This project integrates mature technologies to create mission specific lab demonstrators and evaluates the performance capabilities using metrics and methodologies developed under PE 0602786A\/Project VT4.\nEfforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is led, performed and\/or managed by the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA and fully coordinated with PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0602784A and 0603734A (Military Engineering) PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology)."
