The objective of the STTR is to provide a safe, secure, controllable and repeatable environment for the testing and training of Space Control mission systems and operators that is both realistic and relevant.  Additionally, this program supports the development of test range assets required to support developmental and operational test, exercises, training, and tactics development for Air Force and Joint-service space control systems\/units. Included are both the fixed node Space Range Operation Center (SROC) at Schriever AFB and a deployable capability to support complex Joint and AF exercises. A space range Family of Systems (FoS) called Big Top is being developed to accomplish the STTR mission. The Big Top objective is integration into a Distributed Mission Architecture, tying into both the Information Operations (IO) and Air ranges for increased realism and complexity. This technology will allow for the first-ever use of a realistic signal environment to increase the realism and efficiency of space control squadron training.  This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and modernize the Space Test and Training Range."
