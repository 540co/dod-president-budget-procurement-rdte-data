            "val": "These programs support readiness of the joint force by creating a Joint Training Environment to replicate the complex, and ever changing operational environment.   These investments directly support the new defense strategy and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force. The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:\n\n- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n- Joint Simulation System (JSS)\n- Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC)\n- U.S. Forces Korea Training & Exercise Support (USFK)\n- Air Force JNTC\n- Navy JNTC\n\nJNTC:  Investment in the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program will enable Service and Combatant Commands (CCMD)  to train as they operate.  This investment will develop a cloud-enabled joint training environment, building on previous development of Scenario Management Tools for planning and executing joint training.  In 2016, this investment will enable access at the point of need (Service and CCMD trainers) for planning and executing joint training.  This investment will increase the relevance and realism of training by providing training capabilities which replicate the contemporary and future operating environment.  This program also enables the Department of Defense (DOD) to be responsive to the warfighters\u2019 pace of changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices.\n\nJSS:  The Joint Simulation System (JSS) will decompose, harvest, and reuse DoD investment in joint simulations to develop cloud-enabled modular services (CEMS), reaching Initial Operating Capability in FY16.  JSS will enhance existing Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation (JCATS) and Joint Theater Level Simulation (JTLS) to meet CCMDs\u2019 training requirements.  JSS will provide design and development of web-based applications used as services in CEMS environment.\n\nJKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the DOD unique and authoritative source for online joint training.  JKDDC JKO is tasked to develop a Joint Individual Training Toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products and services.  Products and services are developed in response to OSD(P&R) CE2T2 Program Goals & Objectives guidance, CJCS High Interest Training Items, Joint Staff J7 training priorities, and JKDDC JKO Stakeholder (CCMDs, Services, and Combat Support Agencies) prioritized training requirements.  JKDDC JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education, and tailored common training standards to Service members for tasks that are jointly executed, resulting in trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JKO research and development will improve:  \n-  Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desk top modeling and simulation based training: These capabilities train and prepare tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to CCMD theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined\/Joint Task Force (C\/JTF) billets. Specifically, C\/JTF \u2018battle staffs\u2019 will be adequately trained, as individuals and the staffs collectively, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise.  \n-  JKO mobile \u201cpilot\u201d courseware training device development:  This facilitates the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms.  \n-  JKO Learning Management System (LCMS): JKO LCMS development is required to deliver JKO courses and track\/report students\u2019 completions more efficiently.  \n-  Develop the future virtual worlds learning environment.  It will provide training and learning to promote adaptability and agility in the workforce through an interactive, immersive virtual gaming environment.\n      \nUSFK:  The U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) Training & Exercise Support program is developing simulations capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations.  Interoperability with the Republic of Korea-developed Korean Simulation System is a critical and unique requirement of this USFK RDT&E program.  This solution will be capable of interoperating in a common battle space that realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences, tactical to strategic, in Korean theater exercises.  While supporting USFK\u2019s specific requirements, this solution will contain enhancements that will benefit other combatant commander training programs that use the aging Joint, Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) simulations and the emerging JLVC 2020 simulations.\n\nAir Force JNTC:  The Air Force JNTC funding is providing a focused upgrade to developing models for space based capabilities and integrated them into the JLVC environment.  The Air Force is also supporting development of cross domain solutions allowing for the linking of systems with differing security requirements, which significantly extend the breadth of the training audiences to additional joint and coalition participants.  \n\nNavy JNTC:  These funds enable Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate LVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems, developing cross-domain architectures for US and Coalition Forces as well as ensuring sister service modeling\/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a common unified standard."
