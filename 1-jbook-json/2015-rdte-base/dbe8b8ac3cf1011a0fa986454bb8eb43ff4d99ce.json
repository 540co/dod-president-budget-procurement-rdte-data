Acquisition strategies are developed using a segmented gate strategy to limit and control risks.  Many projects are executed via existing contracts maintained by other agencies; others are executed via Air Force TENCAP contracts established with vendors responding to annual Broad Agency Announcements.  The U.S. government organization sponsoring a project is responsible for assuming acquisition, deployment, logistics, and budgetary responsibilities for the developed capability after it has been successfully demonstrated by Air Force TENCAP.\n\nTENCAP projects typically use an incremental acquisition strategy. TENCAP utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach that allows program team to solve problems through a series of segments. Each increment has to be successful to pursue to the following segment which enables mitigation of cost and schedule risk.\n\nContracts funded in this program element will be awarded using competitive procedures to the maximum extent possible."
