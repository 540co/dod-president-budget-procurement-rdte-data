This program element (PE) encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for tactical electronic warfare (EW).  EW encompasses the development of tactical EW equipment and systems mounted in both ground and air vehicles.  The systems under this program provides the Army with the capability to degrade or deny hostile forces the effective use of their communications, countermortar\/counterbattery radars, surveillance radars, infrared\/optical battlefield surveillance systems and electronically fused munitions.  Existing Army EW systems must be replaced or upgraded to maintain their capability in the face of threats. Prophet Enhanced (PE) is the current system under the Prophet Ground acquisition program. Its primary mission is to provide 24-hour Situation Development and Information Superiority to the supported maneuver brigade to enable the most effective engagement of enemy forces. PE provides a modular, scalable, open architecture-based system solution optimized for ease of use in a variety of configurations (Stationary-Fixed, Mobile and Manpack).The Army Reprogramming Analysis Team (ARAT) Project will develop, test and equip an Army-wide infrastructure capable of rapidly reprogramming electronic combat software embedded in offensive and defensive weapon systems."

These efforts allow for rapid threat\nanalysis, simulation, mission software development, distribution and uploading of mission software changes directly to the supported Soldier in the field."
