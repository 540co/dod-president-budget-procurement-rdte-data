The mission  of the UH-1N utility helicopter is to provide command and control and combat assault support under day\/night and adverse weather conditions and special operations support; supporting arms coordination and aeromedical evacuation. Major modifications for both aircraft include 37 AH-1Ws converted to AH-1Zs, build 152 new AH-1Zs, remanufacture ten (10) H-1N helicopters and build 150 new UH-1Y models.  AH-1Z and UH-1Y models include a 4-bladed, composite rotor system with semi-automatic bladefold, performance-matched transmissions, T700 Engine Digital Electronic Control Units, 4-bladed tail rotors and drive systems, more effective stabilizers, upgraded landing gear, and common, fully integrated cockpits and avionics systems.  These upgrades will add 10,000 flight hours to AH-1Z\/UH-1Y airframes. The fully integrated cockpits reduce operator workload and improve situational awareness, thus increasing safety and reducing the rate of aircraft attrition.  They will provide considerable growth potential for future weapon systems and avionics, which will significantly increase mission effectiveness and survivability.  The cockpits will also include integration of onboard mission planning, communications, digital fire control, self-navigation, night navigation\/targeting, air-to-ground missile and air-launched intercept missile weapon systems management in nearly identical crew stations, which significantly reduces training requirements.  These upgrades maximize commonality between the two aircraft and provide needed improvements in crew and passenger survivability, payload, power available, endurance, range, airspeed, maneuverability and supportability.\n\nFollow-on improvements to sensors and weapons integration, avionics, and air vehicle components will address deficiencies, systems safety, obsolescence, reliability, supportability and cost growth issues. Improvements will include all associated System Configuration Set (SCS) updates as well as integration and testing related to the aircraft platforms."

SCS involves the integration of the entire set of airborne electronics connected via the 1553 data bus and includes much of the electronic hardware and software described in air vehicle, avionics, and sensors and weapons below.  This includes correction of hardware and software deficiencies as identified through test and\/or due to obsolescence issues.\n\nAir Vehicle and Engine improvements include analysis of structural data to formulate Damage Limits and Tolerances for structural components to reduce life cycle costs and maintenance workload; and redesign of structural components and drive system components to minimize excessive and premature wear, increase reliability, and improve existing design deficiencies.   Additional air vehicle upgrades include:  redesign of the aircraft power-generating components (generators, inverters, wiring) to support power requirements for existing and future systems (avionics, sensors, and weapons) and to reduce aircraft weight,  redesign of the Environmental Control System \/Thermal Redesign to support cooling of Technology Refresh Mission Computer and other avionics, and redesign to add an aerial refueling capability.\n\nAvionics improvements target digital inter-operability, integrated avionics, safety & survivability, and situational awareness for both the pilot and aircrew safety. This includes integrating Blue Force Tracking, Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P) Full Motion Video (FMV), Degraded Visual Environment (DVE), Helmet Mounted Display improvements, cockpit displays, precision and GPS non-precision landing capability, crash survivable flight incident recorder, collision avoidance, improved Embedded Global Positioning System (EGI), Inertial Navigation System (INS), targeting sensor systems and mission computer.  H-1 capability improvements include improved Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE),  digital operations & transfer of data, digital interoperability, digital video recording, video and data networking, and information integration with aviation combat elements and Marine Air Ground Task Force elements.  Mandated capability efforts include CNS\/ATM,  Required Navigation Performance\/Area Navigation (RNP\/RNAV), GPS Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM), Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B), development efforts required for Depot standup and incorporation of technology and information protection\/Information Assurance in critical avionics and sensor systems.  In addition, the goal is to reduce total ownership cost for H-1 aircraft and related support systems by improving reliability and maintainability of critical flight and avionics systems along with associated peculiar avionics support equipment and  incorporating fact-of-life obsolescence solutions. \n\nSensors and Weapons improvements include upgrades and reliability initiatives, hardware and infrared improvements for the Targeting Sight System and BRITE Star Sensors.  These enhancements will provide upgraded performance, improve overall design, producibility and maintainability.   In addition, several aircraft stores integration efforts are being performed.  The AN\/ALQ-231 (V) Intrepid Tiger II Electronic Warfare Pod will be integrated to provide a new Electronic Warfare capability to the UH-1Y.  The Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM) and AGM-114 Romeo Hellfire missiles will begin integration efforts starting in FY14.  These missiles will provide new interfaces to the aircraft that allow for better targeting capabilities with a new millimeter wave sensor (JAGM), provide enhanced lethality with greater fuze functionality and incorporate a new multi-effects warhead.  Continued improvements to aircraft armament systems and ordnance systems will continue with additional operational testing of Advanced Precision Kill Weapons (APKWS), and  M299 Launcher improvements.    \n\nThese improvements will provide considerable growth potential for future weapon systems, air vehicle improvements, software improvements, and avionics upgrades, which will significantly increase mission effectiveness & survivability, while potentially reducing life cycle costs.  The cockpits will also include integration of onboard mission planning, communications, digital fire control, self-navigation, night navigation\/targeting, precision guided munitions, and air-launched intercept missile weapon systems management in nearly identical crew stations, which significantly reduce training requirements.  These upgrades maximize commonality between all H-1 Type\/Model\/Series aircraft and provide needed improvements in crew and passenger reliability, survivability, payload, power available, endurance, range, airspeed, maneuverability and supportability."
