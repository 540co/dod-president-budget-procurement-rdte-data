The Navy must be able to conduct its national security mission in compliance with applicable environmental requirements in the U.S. and abroad without compromising\nperformance, safety, or health, while simultaneously minimizing the cost of compliance. This program develops and evaluates processes, hardware, systems, and operational procedures that will allow the Navy to operate in U.S., foreign, and international waters, air, space, and land areas while complying with environmental laws, regulations,\nExecutive Orders, policies and international agreements. The projects for this program element support the Navy's compliance with the (a) Clean Water Act, (b) Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, (c) International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73\/78), (d) DoD 4715.6 R1, Regulations on Vessels Owned or Operated by the\nDepartment of Defense, (e) OPNAVINST 5090.1C, Environmental and Natural Resources Program Manual, (f) 40 CFR Part 9 and Chapter VII (Uniform National Discharge Standards [UNDS] Phase I Standard), (g) Executive Order (EO) 13148, Greening the Government Through Leadership in Environmental Management, (h) Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990, (i) National Invasive Species Act of 1996, (j) 33 CFR 151 Subpart D-Ballast Water Management for Control of Nonindigenous Species in Waters of the United States, (k) Clean Air Act, (l) Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, (m) Executive Order (EO) 13423 Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management of 24 January, 2007. References (a) through (m) establish Level I environmental protection requirements for Navy shipboard systems, operations, and discharges in the areas of liquid wastes, hazardous materials, solid wastes, and other significant afloat environmental concerns. Project 0401 supports RDT&E efforts that enable Navy ships and submarines to comply with laws, regulations, and policies in six major areas: (1) Liquid Wastes, (2) UNDS Rulemaking, (3) Hazardous Materials and Pollution Prevention, (4) Hull Antifouling Paints, (5) Technical Authority, and (6) Ballast Water Exchange Improvements. Project 0817 supports RDT&E to develop and validate technologies to enable Navy facilities to comply with environmental laws, regulations, and policies in a cost-effective manner. Project 9204 supports RDT&E to develop planning and monitoring tools for minimizing Fleet contacts with and potential harassment (physiological and behavior) of marine animals including threatened and endangered species in response to Federal laws and regulations and public scrutiny."

No body of water is without environmental restrictions that impact the movements and operations of Navy vessels. Environmental requirements tend to be most restrictive in port and in coastal waters, where the Navy's increasing littoral presence places ships and submarines in discharge-restricted waters for longer periods of time. Growing international cooperation in addressing global environmental concerns is resulting in expanding areas of ocean considered environmentally susceptible, where special prohibitions on ship discharges and operations are imposed. Navy vessels must comply with applicable environmental legal requirements while maintaining continued access to all waters for operations, exercises, training, and port access. The large crews and limited on-board space of Navy ships and submarines severely constrain their ability to hold wastes for return to port for shore side disposal. \n\nThe Shipboard Waste Management RDT&E project evaluates and develops shipboard environmental equipment, systems, technologies, processes, and practices to comply with environmental laws, regulations, Executive Orders, international agreements, foreign-country requirements, and DoD and Navy policies. The project focuses on providing engineering criteria, design guidance, and performance specifications for selecting, procuring, installing, integrating, and operating environmental equipment and systems on Navy ships and submarines, and on defining and developing processes, procedures and logistics support requirements. Environmental equipment, systems, processes and practices must meet legal and environmental requirements and be reliable, maintainable and achievable at sea, and impose no or low manning burden. Environmental equipment and systems must meet Navy-unique shipboard requirements (performance, space, weight, shock, vibration, electromagnetic compatibility, manning, automation, etc.), incorporate integrated logistics support, minimize life-cycle cost, and include validated acquisition, design, installation, and operating documentation. Shipboard processes and practices must be feasible and must be compatible with ship and submarine operational, maintenance, manning, habitability, health, and safety requirements. It also addresses afloat environmental issues other than shipboard wastes, e.g., access to environmental data for planning Fleet operations and exercises.  \n\nThe Shipboard Environmental Protection Branch (SEA 05P5) is the designated Technical Warrant Holder for Environmental Systems & Materials Engineering, with responsibility and accountability for ensuring that ships and submarines are designed and upgraded, and can be operated, in compliance with existing and anticipated environmental requirements while minimizing total ownership cost and manning. This responsibility encompasses legacy platforms and new vessel designs, as well as Fleet operations exercises, and training."

                            "val": "Inherent to the realization of the vision outlined in Sea Power 21 are certain environmental consequences that will, to a lesser or greater degree, be an impact on the Navy's ability to fully achieve the strategy outlined in the Navy Capability Pillars (NCP) SEA SHIELD, SEA STRIKE, SEA BASING and FORCEnet and the supporting initiatives of SEA WARRIOR, SEA TRIAL and SEA ENTERPRISE. Readiness and training are primary considerations for determining whether any fighting force is at its peak proficiency. The ability to train our forces in a realistic environment is paramount. Today's reality requires training and operating within environmental constraints (national and international laws and agreements), and searching for alternatives to comply with and alleviate those constraints. Moreover, as we develop new systems and technologies in support of Sea Power 21, the Navy must anticipate potential environmental regulations which, while not currently an issue, could in the future adversely impact our ability to protect and sustain our forces at home and abroad.\n\nThis program identifies pervasive Navy shore side environmental requirements and develops and validates information, new processes, and technologies that address requirements that pose significant impact on Naval shore activities in complying with environmental laws, regulations, orders, and policies. The goal of the program is to maximize opportunities for significant cost savings while minimizing personnel liabilities, operational costs, and regulatory oversight and preserving or enhancing the ability of Naval shore activities to accomplish their required missions and functions in support of the Navy's transformational strategy.\n\nEEC-2 MAXIMIZE TRAINING AND TESTING RANGE REQUIREMENTS WITHIN ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS: This capability addresses environmental impacts and restrictions at Navy land and sea ranges, including munitions testing and manufacturing, to ensure Navy ranges are available to conduct required training and testing operations for the Fleet. Investments in EEC-2 provide validated knowledge, models, and processes to mitigate environmental impacts, restrictions, and costs at Navy training and test ranges to maximize the availability and utilization of the ranges. The results support operational readiness by providing the tools and technologies necessary for sustaining and managing Navy land and sea ranges related to unexploded ordnance (UXO) and munitions, encroachment, air quality, airborne noise, water quality, and wetlands. Capabilities gained include the ability to assess and determine the risks from underwater UXO, the evaluation and prioritization of ordnance contaminated sites for evaluation in environmental programs, and the implementation of range specific best management practices by evaluating and modeling available process, procedures, and technologies.\n\nEEC-3 PLATFORM MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR WITH MINIMAL ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT: This capability focuses on minimizing or eliminating environmental impact related to Navy and Marine Corps weapon system repair and maintenance operations. Investments in EEC-3 provide valid knowledge, models, processes, and technologies to minimize regulated emissions, discharges and hazardous material usage during the repair and maintenance of ships, submarines, and surface\/sub-surface vehicles and aircraft and air vehicles. The program supports Fleet operational readiness and Navy acquisition communities by investing in information to understand emerging environmental requirements and to develop innovative processes and technologies that result in savings while reducing the fleet environmental constraints related to platform maintenance. Capabilities and benefits gained include, but are not limited to, the reduction in the usage of heavy metals used in metal finishing (chromium and cadmium), reduced hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions, and the development of best management practices and tools to minimize the use of hazardous materials and the generation of hazardous wastes associated with maintaining and repairing ships, submarines and aircraft and unmanned vehicles. Results of program investments will be leveraged across weapon system and platform acquisition to ensure continued reduction in lifecycle costs and long-term environmental compliance burdens to the Fleet.\n\nEEC-4. SUPPORT SHORE READINESS WITHIN ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS: Naval shore establishment requires the capability to operate and maintain facilities and provide waterfront and airfield services to the fleet while complying with applicable environmental regulations and minimizing environmental impacts and costs. The program invests in knowledge and innovative processes and technologies that minimize infrastructure and operational costs, regulated emissions, while minimizing discharges and hazardous material usage from ship (waterfront) and aviation operations. Capabilities and benefits gained under EEC-4 include reduced costs associated with wastewater treatment, elimination\/reduction in the use of HAPs, ozone depleting substances (ODSs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and the associated reporting requirements, reduced hazardous waste and disposal costs, and improved storm water management.\n\nEEC-5. COST-EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS: The environmental compliance regulations require base managers to permit, monitor and report on many processes associated with weapon system and platform operations. Naval shore environmental managers require the capability to efficiently and cost effectively manage these compliance requirements. Under EEC-5, the program invests in improved data collection, methods, and models to assess environmental impacts and ecological risk assessments of Naval Operations on harbors, U.S. waterways, and surrounding communities.  Benefits include gaining standardized technical environmental management improvements\/techniques related to source control, assessment, and monitoring. EEC-5 also provides validated knowledge, models, processes and technologies to improve environmental monitoring and reporting, and to reduce the cost of compliance with regulations applicable to coastal contamination and contaminated sediments."

The project delivers a broad spectrum of products that require a variety of acquisition processes to implement. Equipment products for naval stations and other mission funded activities are often procured directly through the base operating budget. Equipment products for Shipyards and other Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF) activities costing over $250K are procured through their Capital Investment Program (CIP). For both types of activities, equipment products costing less than $250K, and process changes not requiring the purchase of new equipment such as consumable material or product substitutions, are funded through the activity's operating budgets. Occasionally there is a technology that must be implemented as a specialized facility. These are acquired through the Military Construction (MCON) Program. All these acquisition processes are pursued using a common strategy that satisfies the needs of all the critical stakeholders: 1) Fleet end user; 2) Funding sponsor for the Navy end user; 3) Other stakeholders with cognizance over the Navy process or operation being changed, 4) Cognizant environmental federal, state, and local regulators; and 5) The private or government organization that will produce the product."

Since Fleet operation and training areas coincide with known or probable habitats, migration routes, or breeding areas of marine mammals and other protected marine species, the possibility exists that such incidents are likely to continue in the future. The increasing public interest and pressure has resulted in escalating Fleet costs. For example, Fleet and SYSCOM development activities have been interrupted; modified, or altogether cancelled and environmental regulations have, among other things, required new ship construction shock trials to obtain Federal permits and conduct extensive environmental planning that can take several years to complete. The incorporation of mitigation measures in Fleet training operations to minimize the potential adverse effects on protected marine animals can significantly reduce the realism of these operations. In addition, the testing, evaluation, and deployment of new sonar detection and monitoring systems that use active acoustics are under intense public scrutiny for their potential adverse effects on whales and other marine mammals. Navy needs scientific evidence to substantiate its claims of limited or inconsequential adverse effects to marine life from operations.\n\nThis project primarily focuses on the development of planning, monitoring, and mitigating tools to aid the Fleet in minimizing contact with and the potential harassment of protected marine animals during operations, exercises, training, and undersea surveillance and weapons testing. These new capabilities will encompass historical and newly acquired data and analytical models that together can predict marine animal habitats (where they are likely to be), and their natural and expected behavior (diving patterns, prey localization, calling activity, etc.). This project consists of three major areas that will help ensure Navy compliance with the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and Endangered Species Act (ESA).\nThese areas are (1) Marine Ecology and Population Dynamics - Determine the likelihood of the presence of marine mammals or other protected species by developing habitat and ecological models. Refine marine animal survey techniques to optimize the accuracy of abundance estimates in small ocean regions of Navy interest.\n(2) Criteria, Thresholds, and Mitigation - Establish criteria and thresholds from which to measure potential impact on marine mammals and other marine species from Navy training operations. Determine the effectiveness and usefulness of various mitigation measures in relation to the potential impact of Navy operations on marine mammals; and (3) Mitigation Methodologies - Determine the observation, detection and classification measures required to develop effective monitoring and mitigation procedures for Fleet and SYSCOM use. Focus on improving marine animal monitoring capabilities over current methods by developing new technologies or improving existing technologies that improve monitoring and mitigation effectiveness, reduce cost, and minimize impacts on readiness activities."
