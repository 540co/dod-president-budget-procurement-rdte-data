This approach is required due to the immediate need for new demining technologies in the face of ongoing U.S. forces and host nation citizen casualties in mine-affected countries.  The program evaluates prototype equipment by acquiring it off-the-shelf from industry using competition to the extent possible, by leveraging ongoing countermine R&D efforts in other U.S. and foreign R&D activities, and by taking advantage of extensive in-house fabrication capabilities at the Army's Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Division (NVESD)."
