Project H7G researches and explores nanostructure materials properties and exploits the strength and durability of these materials to enable lighter weight, increased performance in Soldier weapons and protection applications.  Project H84, researches a variety of materials and designs, fabricates and evaluates performance of components for lighter weight Soldier and vehicle armors, armaments, and electronics.\n\nWork in this PE builds on the materials research transitioned from PE 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences), project H42 (Materials and Mechanics) and PE 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), project J12 (Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies).  This work complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology), PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology), and PE 0708045A (Manufacturing Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork is performed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD and Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."
