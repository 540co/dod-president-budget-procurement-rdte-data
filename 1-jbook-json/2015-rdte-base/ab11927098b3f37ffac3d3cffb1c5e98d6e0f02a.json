            "val": "The Firestarter program provides newly improved capabilities and technical transition opportunities for Cyber Defense and Information Assurance (IA) technologies and tools needed to defend Air Force Command, Control, Communications,Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) systems from Cyber-attacks, while ensuring recovery in the event of an attack. The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyberspace capabilities; computer and network systems security; damage assessment and recovery; cyber threat recognition, attribution, and mitigation; and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment. These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development, test and acquisition in the areas of: proactive defense, defensive counter cyberspace, cyberspace intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance & situational awareness, persistent network operations, as well as decision support, recovery, and digital forensics.  Current Air Force systems, such as the AFNET NIPRNet Gateways, SIPRNet Modernization program, and Host Based Security System leverage this technology to meet their information assurance and defensive cyberspace needs\/requirements. \n\nFirestarter utilizes cyber and IA technology investments by US Cyber Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force cyber and IA requirements. This program supports AF Space Commands Cyberspace strategic direction in support of Cyber Defense which provides capabilities to 24th AF, as AF component to Cyber Command (CYBERCOM)), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) cyber and IA requirements are being met. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber technology and defensive cyberspace weapons systems and capabilities into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems. . In addition, this effort will support implementation of DoD Enterprise-wide IA & CND (Computer Network Defense) Solutions Steering Group (ESSG) solutions.\n\nAF Computer Emergency Response Team (AFCERT) supports the AF Cyberspace Defense (ACD) weapon system is designed to prevent, detect, and respond to adversarial penetration into AF unclassified and classified networks.   It also provides forensic analysis if AF unclassified and classified networks are infiltrated by our adversaries.  AFCERT funding for this effort will focus on development of capability, capacity, and potential modifications to increase the utility of the ACD weapon system to the warfighter\n\nIntrusion Vulnerability Assessment supports the Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment \/ Hunter Team (CVA\/H) weapon system and develops new capabilities to provide Air Force Cyber Command(AFCYBER) and Combatant Commanders additional mobile precision in addition to currently fielded protection capabilities to identify, pursue, and mitigate cyberspace threats.  The CVA\/H weapon system performs defensive sorties world-wide via remote or on-site access.  CVA\/H executes vulnerability, compliance, defense and non-technical assessments, best practice reviews, penetration testing and Hunter missions on AF and DoD networks & systems.  Hunter operations characterize and then eliminate threats for the purpose of mission assurance.  The Hunter mission focuses on the capability to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess(F2T2EA) the advanced persistent threat (APT).  This effort funds development efforts to expand the capability of the current weapon system to meet scope and scale of the USCYBERCOM directed Cyber Protection Teams.\n  \n\n\nActivities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThese programs are in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The Firestarter program provides new\/improved capabilities and technical transition opportunities for Cyber Defense and Information Assurance (IA) technologies and tools needed to defend Air Force Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) systems from Cyber-attacks, while ensuring recovery in the event of an attack.  Also provides defensive Cyber Command and Control\/Situational Awareness (C2\/SA), which enables cyber commanders to monitor Air Force network status and execute courses of action to mitigate threats. The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyberspace capabilities; computer and network systems security; damage assessment and recovery; cyber threat recognition, attribution, and mitigation; and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment. These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development, test and acquisition in the areas of: proactive defense, defensive counter cyberspace, cyberspace intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance & situational awareness, persistent network operations, as well as decision support, recovery, and digital forensics.  Current Air Force systems, such as the Air Force Network Non-classified Internet Protocol Router (AFNET NIPRNet) Gateways, and Host Based Security System leverage this technology to meet their information assurance and defensive cyberspace needs\/requirements. \n\nThis program utilizes cyber and IA technology investments by US Cyber Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force cyber and IA requirements. This program supports AF Space Commands Cyberspace strategic direction in support of Cyber Defense which provides capabilities to 24th AF, as AF component to Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) cyber and IA requirements are being met. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber technology and defensive cyberspace weapons systems and capabilities into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems. Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because it addresses the development and transition of information security, protection, and defensive capabilities and technologies."
