The program will replace the current fleet of M109 Family of Vehicles (FoV) consisting of the M109A6 Paladin Self Propelled Howitzer and M992A2 Field Artillery Ammunition Supply Vehicle (FAASV). PIM is an Army Modernization Program that addresses a critical capability gap created by the Non-Line of Sight Cannon termination in June of 2009 as well as obsolescence and size\/weight and power (SWaP) issues in the M109 FoV current Fleet. The PIM system integrates current Bradley Fighting Vehicle suspension and drive train items, Future Combat Systems (FCS) developed Electric Gun Drive systems and current fleet (M109A6) fire control systems into a new chassis that provides better force protection, survivability and increases electrical power over the current fleet. PIM is a two vehicle system:  Self Propelled Howitzer (SPH) and Carrier Ammunition Tracked (CAT).  The SPH has all characteristics listed above.  The CAT utilizes all these same components and traits less those that relate directly to the cannon system. The PIM system replaces the current M109 FoV on a one for one basis, in the cannon fires battalions in the Armored Brigade Combat Team Formations and the Echelons above Brigade (EAB). The overall intent is to increase Soldier force protection, vehicle survivability, provide an appropriate amount of SWaP capacity to add future capabilities, reduce life cycle costs and extend the life of the M109 FoV through FY2050."

On 14 August 2009, a Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) Contract W56HZV-09-C-0550 was awarded to BAE Systems Inc. for the Prototype Development and Fabrication of 7 prototype vehicles (5 PIM Self Propelled Howitzer Systems (SPHS) and 2 PIM Carrier Ammunition Tracked (CAT) vehicles).  A Comprehensive Contract Modification (CCM) award to the RDT&E contract was accomplished on 6 Jan 2012.  This modification allows for the completion of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase and transfers the system responsibility for the program from the Government to BAE Systems Inc. The planned Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract is of a Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF) contract type for procurement of vehicles with a period of performance running from Nov 2013 through approximately Jun 2019.  The LRIP contract will provide for three LRIP years with the initial base year including 19 SPHs and 18 CATs and the remaining two option years with 18 sets and 30 sets, respectively (each set consisting of one each SPH and CAT) of PIM vehicles.  The Full Rate Production (FRP) contract is planned as a FPIF contract that converts to a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract after the second year of FRP.  The FRP contract provides for the remaining PIM vehicles to fulfill the requirement up to the Army Acquisition Objective of 580 sets."
