However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it urgent and critical to improve the cyber security of Department of Defense (DoD) systems to counter those threats and assure our missions.  The Cyber Applied Research program focuses on innovative and sustained research in both cyber security and computer network operations to develop new concepts to harden key network and computer components, design new resilient cyber infrastructures, increase the military\u2019s ability to fight and survive during cyber attacks, disrupt nation-state level attack planning and execution, measure the state of cyber security, and explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance. \n\nThis program builds upon existing basic and applied research results.  The program focuses on integrating computer network defense and computer network operations, addressing joint problems in cyber operations, and filling capability and technology gaps as identified in the 2012 Cyber Priority Steering Council Science and Technology Roadmap and assessments conducted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&E)).

Cyber Mission Control covers the ability to orchestrate cyber systems to achieve an overarching mission goal.  To perform dyanmic analysis of asset criticality, and course-of-action analysis alternatives, there is a critical need for tools that can map information technology assets to missions and use modeling and simulation, or other techniques.  Inherent in Cyber Mission Control is the ability to automatically derive and fuse information about the characteristics of information technology systems in a manner that allows us to describe, analyze, observe, and control the operation of information technology components.  A key goal of this research area is to have tools that enable commanders to assess and direct different information technology maneuvers in conjunction with mission actions.

The objective in the area of embedded and tactical systems is to develop tools and techniques that assure the secure operation of microprocessors within our weapons platforms and systems; enable security in real-time systems; and establish security in disadvantaged, intermittent, and low-bandwidth environments.  This research also seeks to expand and cultivate military-grade techniques for securing and operating with enterprise-style commodity mobile devices, such as smart phones, tablets, and their associated infrastructures.  With the constant evolution of these devices and their respective infrastructures it is of the utmost importance to provide a secure environment where these devices can be effectively utilized, monitored and tracked."
