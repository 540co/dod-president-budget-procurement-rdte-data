The National Cyber Range (NCR) program developed a network test bed that allows for research experimentation on diverse hardware and software topologies to produce qualitative and quantitative assessments of cyber security research and development programs through a safe, instrumented experimentation environment.  The range is designed to replicate complex, heterogeneous networks.  It has revolutionized cyber testing to enable efficient cyber experimentation and facilitate realistic testing of tools and techniques to enable high fidelity assessments of cyber tools and techniques and the rapid transition of research programs to operations.  This program is available for leverage or use by all Federal Government organizations.  The program has transitioned to the DoD's Test Resource Management Center (TRMC)."
