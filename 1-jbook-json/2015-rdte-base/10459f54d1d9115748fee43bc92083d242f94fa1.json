The LPD-17 Class configuration must continue to adapt to this evolutionary process as these ships are expected to be in service until almost 2050.  The LPD-17 design includes system configurations that reduce operating and support costs and facilitate operational performance improvements.  The RDT&E,N funding will be used for system engineering and integration efforts to resolve obsolescence issues facing the LPD-17 Class components, as well as develop further reductions in life cycle costs, and will integrate performance upgrades in a rapid, affordable manner.  These efforts will result in well-defined specifications and drawings in system integration design packages that provide technical baselines for follow-on ship procurements.  This program is funded under Engineering and Manufacturing Development because it encompasses engineering and manufacturing development of new end-items prior to production approval decision."
