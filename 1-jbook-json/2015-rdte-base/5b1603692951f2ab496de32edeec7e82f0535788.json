AEC is The Army's independent evaluator.  AEC develops the evaluation strategy, designs tests, and evaluates the test results to address a system's combat effectiveness, suitability, and survivability factors pertinent to the decision process, such as:  Critical Operational Issues and Criteria (COIC), system performance, soldier survivability, performance in countermeasures, system survivability, reliability, supportability, etc.  AEC has the lead in planning and execution of Army Live Fire Tests and Continuous Evaluations through its evaluation and test design responsibilities.  The evaluations produced by AEC are required by the Army Chief of Staff, the Army Acquisition Executive, other Army, Service, Joint, and agency senior leaders and the Department of Defense Director of Operational Test and Evaluation for acquisition decisions.  In addition, Army leadership has recognized the numerous benefits of an early involvement initiative.  Test management and safety verification is also supported by this program element.\n\nThis project funds the salaries of civilian employees conducting T&E early involvement, evaluation and test design missions and associated personnel support\/sustainment costs including: temporary duty, professional training, supplies, and equipment.

The Law emphasizes that the service acquisition executive must ensure acquisition personnel have appropriate training and expertise to formulate robust RAM growth programs.   The policies and Law are a result of a Defense Science Board report on Developmental Test and Evaluation (May 2008), showing that there has been a significant increase in the number of Department of Defense weapon system programs evaluated as not being operationally suitable.  The report shows that about two thirds of Army systems from 1997 to 2006 failed to meet their realiability requirements during operational testing - primarily due to lack of material readiness due to poor system reliability and maintenance (RAM).  Funding provided resources dedicated to developing critical tools, methodologies, policies, formal guidance, and educational materials required to implement new policies and improve weapon system reliability."

These DOD and DA policies became Public Law 111-23 (The Weapon System Reform Act of 2009 - signed 22 May 2009).  The Law emphasizes that the service acquisition executive must ensure acquisition personnel have appropriate training and expertise to formulate robust RAM growth programs.   The policies and Law are a result of a Defense Science Board report on Developmental Test and Evaluation (May 2008), showing that there has been a significant increase in the number of Department of Defense weapon system programs evaluated as not being operationally suitable.  The report shows that about two thirds of Army systems from 1997 to 2006 failed to meet their realiability requirements during operational testing - primarily due to lack of material readiness due to poor system reliability and maintenance (RAM).  Funding provides resources dedicated to developing critical tools, methodologies, policies, formal guidance, and educational materials required to implement new policies and improve weapon system reliability."

Assigned personnel provide continuous support to materiel and combat developers from the inception of their programs.  The early involvement of LNOs supports the sections of the ATEC Mission Essential Task List (METL) that apply to ongoing contingency operations.  ATEC performance continues to meet 120 day rapid equipping requirement set by the CSA. Liaison officers continue to enable ATEC to sustain rapid, flexible T&E support in the evaluation of Rapid Initiative Systems, Counter IED systems, and Urgent Material Releases.  Effort results in cost savings, cost avoidance and critical design efficiencies being identified early in a system's development, thereby avoiding more expensive product improvement programs later in a system's life cycle.  T&E efficiency gains continue to be realized through early identification of instrumentation, modeling and simulation tools, and other resources needed for testing, as well as making more efficient use of data from developmental testing and experiments."
