            "val": "The Battle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3) is the logistics Command and Control solution for U.S. land forces. BCS3 provides commanders the capability to execute end-to-end distribution and deployment management and brings better situational awareness, resulting in better decision-making capability to warfighters. It enables warfighters and commanders to target, access, scale and tailor critical logistics information in near-real time. BCS3 provides more effective means to gather and integrate asset and in-transit information to manage distribution and deployment missions. BCS3 combines distribution management to include commodity and convoy tracking, and deployment management into a logistics Common Operating Picture (COP) for one mission-focused visual display.  BCS3 has been adopted and integrated into Joint and strategic logistics C2 processes.  BCS3 is the only near-term end-to-end logistics COP solution for the Joint commander. BCS3 will maintain its core capabilities and continue to advance in development while integrating into the Joint command and control architecture. This continued development will enable decision superiority via advanced collaborative information sharing achieved through interoperability. BCS3 has immediate, high pay-off benefit to warfighters. BCS3 is a force multiplier, a precision tool for logistics planning and execution that provides warfighters with the necessary tools to succeed."
