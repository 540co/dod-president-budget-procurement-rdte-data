            "val": "The Mobile Integrated Remains Collection System (MIRCS) provides a mobile facility for the initial processing and storage of human remains on the battlefield. It is a self-contained International Standard Organization (ISO) compatible shelter with a receiving\/processing area, a refrigerated storage area for 16 remains, an administrative area, and storage compartments for operational supplies. It has an on-board power generator, running water, and wastewater storage. It has a screened overflow area to shield remains that are being temporarily stored until they can be processed by the Mortuary Affairs (MA) team. It includes all components necessary to deploy, move, and operate in support of the full spectrum of military and peacetime disaster support operations. The MIRCS transforms MA operations by providing a system that is responsive, deployable, agile, versatile, and sustainable. The MIRCS is transported on its own dedicated Heavy Expanded Mobile Tactical Truck (HEMTT) with a Load Handling System (LHS). The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for MIRCS is 174 systems.\n\nThe Human Remains Temperature Controlled Transfer Case (HRTC2) will provide means to safely transport remains from theater to Continental United States (CONUS) in a controlled temperature environment. The objective case will use an onboard refrigeration system to maintain internal temperatures. An improved Transfer case (ITC) with insulated walls, an internal temperature display, an on-board document storage compartment, an interface for a standard RFID tag and handles for lifting by up to eight personnel, will be procured as the initial increment under an evolutionary approach to acquire the objective capability as technology  matures."
