The program also provides for the preserving, storing and disposing of facilities and equipment that are either not required for current active production or are not needed by the Army.  Provisioning of Industrial Facilities (PIF) occurs at Aberdeen Test Center, MD; White Sands Missile Range, NM; Yuma Proving Grounds, AZ; Rock Island Arsenal, IL; Watervliet Arsenal, NY; and General Dynamics-Armaments and Technical Products (GD-ATP), Saco, ME.  The Layaway of Industrial Facilities (LIF) funding support necessary or unique equipment at arsenals."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY 2016 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $9.027 million support the PIF and LIF programs.  The PIF funding will support upgrade and replacement of technically or economically obsolete production test instrumentation to ensure that complete and accurate test data is collected and that safety and environmental hazards are minimized. Benefits of this effort include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army program managers. The PIF funding will also support the repair of government owned equipment used in the production of gun barrels for small caliber weapons such as the MK19 Grenade Launcher and the M2 Machine Gun and the M242 Bushmaster Chain Gun. PIF projects are essential in fulfilling current and projected  operations requirements. The upgrade and modernization of facilities and equipment at Rock Island Arsenal based on a five year plan is critical for the Army to meet both small arms and medium caliber weapon requirements supporting future peacetime requirements. Benefits of this effort include the ability to maintain lower unit costs for production items. The Layaway of Industrial Facilities efforts at all facilities preserve the Army's abilities to respond to increases in production capabilities while keeping active production costs down.  The effort allows the Army to excess equipment no longer needed.  Economies derived from this effort benefit the entire Army.  \n\nPIF funding directly supports production of small caliber weapons systems, large caliber weapons systems and combat service support  manufacturing  equipment at Rock Island Arsenal with modernization and upgrade requests supporting current and new manufacturing capabilities such as small arms spare parts and gages (e.g. 50-caliber M2 Machine Gun, MK19 40mm Machine Gun, M249 Light Machine Gun, M240 Series Machine Gun, M14 EBR, M4\/16 Rifle), larger manufacturing capabilities (Add-on Armor upgrades for HMMWV, MRAP, and Stryker series vehicles; towed artillery spares and gun carriages; HUMVEE Ambulance kits, and line of Communication Bridge components.  At Rock Island Arsenal (RIA) efforts are being made to support the Army's movement toward reducing the load placed upon the Warfighter by participating in ongoing initiatives to reduce the overall weight of major weapons systems through utilization of RIA's Titanium Investment Casting facility to cast major components of the weapons systems.  Efforts are also underway to implement new technologies at RIA such as Friction Stir Welding that will allow RIA the capability to not only support Department of the Army but also to support other Department of Defense requirements and leverage partnership programs in support of private industry to manufacture unique products with limited suppliers worldwide.  Significant advancements in the realm of composites have resulted in RIA's Composite Armor Center being capable of supporting the needs of the Warfighter in the ongoing battle to defeat rapidly evolving insurgent devices and the subsequent need for armor advancements needed to do so.  RIA's capability to utilize sophisticated software for reverse engineering coupled with rapid response manufacturing offers significant savings in time and money.  In an effort to constantly improve the efficiency at which RIA is able to operate, RIA is improving productivity through an increased use of robotics and automation systems, material handling equipment and materials storage and retrieval systems, and machining centers capable of 7-axis articulation to significantly reduce machining time requirements.  Rock Island Arsenal continues to maintain technologies such as a full service foundry, not available elsewhere throughout the Department of the Army, to support Department of the Army requirements and to complement the capabilities of local private industry corporations through partnership programs.  Advantages subsequent to maintaining and upgrading this unique capability will ensure no disruptions for critical spare or repair parts by offering this capability as an organic asset, resulting in sizeable cost savings for the Department of the Army.  Replacing older equipment and continually investing in new technologies will result in not only a more efficient and productive manufacturing facility but also a more profitable facility as the Department of Defense, Department of the Army, and private industry would be able to leverage the unique manufacturing capabilities available at Rock Island Arsenal.  \n\nAt Watervliet Arsenal (WVA), efforts will be made to replace aging or obsolete machining equipment to obtain new state-of-the-art equipment to produce medium to large caliber weapons.  The goal in replacing this equipment is to process cannon components to meet current and future production needs of cannon.  Replacing the equipment will keep WVA technologically current and provide the added ability and flexibility to address new cannon configurations and designs.  With replacement equipment new sources of service support and spare parts will be readily available.  This will ensure flexible response to the Army's changing needs.\n\n\"In accordance with section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses and providing military support to civil authorities\"."

At ATC, replaces and upgrades video cameras, video recorders, digital video tracking systems and telemetry systems used to assess fire control system performance; upgrades laboratory test equipment that simulate extremely harsh vibration environments that prime movers experience in the field used for reliability and durability tests and replaces aging, failing mobile environmental test chambers that simulate environmental conditions for vehicle components and ammunition.  At WSTC, provides badly needed upgrades to Directed Energy, High Power Electromagnetic Pulse and Lightning effects test simulators to provide a realistic threat environment.  At YTC, purchases pyroshock accelerometers, blast over pressure gages, infrared flash detectors and triggers and various types of displacement transducers used to assess weapons ballistic performance; and procures high speed digital cameras for capturing test events.  The majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life.  This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data is collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized.  Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers."
