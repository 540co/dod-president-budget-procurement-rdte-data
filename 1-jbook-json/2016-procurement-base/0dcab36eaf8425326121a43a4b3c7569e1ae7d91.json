            "val": "The MK48 Mod 7 Heavyweight Torpedo is the U.S. Navy's primary submarine launched Anti-Submarine Warefare (ASW) and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) weapon. Procurements will increase warshot inventory prior to Major Combat Operations. It provides the Submarine force with an effective weapon against threat submarines and surface combatants to assist in achieving Sea Control and neutralizing or destroying threats to high value vessels. \nTorpedoes are the only proven weapon system that provides USN control from seabed to sea surface.\n\n[P5 \/ G5001 - Hardware]: Funding under this cost code supports the award of two competitive contracts for the MK48 Mod 7 Torpedo Guidance and Control and After Body\/Tail Cone Sections from the prime contractors, production Test Equipment Upgrades, engineering change proposals and non-recurring engineering to resolve production issues including obsolescence. Nonrecurring Engineering (NRE) funds base contract year technology refresh due to obsolescence issues and non-deliverable hardware consumed in production acceptance testing. In FY 2016, NRE funds production of 6 Proof of Manufacturing (POM) units, POM unit government testing, first article testing, tooling, test equipment, procurement of technical data package updates and start-up costs for production contractors. Engineering Services and Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) pay for studies, plans, design changes and implementation of design changes at the contractor(s) level, primarily due to obsolescence that occurs during the contract performance. Also included in this cost code, is the cost of government installation and integration of MK48 Mod 7 Guidance and Control and After Body\/Tail Cone Torpedo Sections procured in prior years and is integrated with War Reserve MK48 Mod 4 MK107 Warhead components and Fuel Tanks into an AUR and is then loaded with the operational software and completes quality assurance check-out prior to issuing the MK48 Mod 7 Torpedo as Warshot or Exercise Torpedo. Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) cost funds are provided to address obsolescence issues in the Guidance and Control (G&C) and After Body\/Tail Cone sections during the production cycle. The contractors will be required to procure and deliver DMS material for these obsolete components. Other recurring costs fund prior year Fixed Price Incentive (FPI) CLINs to pay for the government's share of billing price increases along the contract's share line.\n\n[P5 \/ G5003 - Support and Ancillary Equipment]: Funding under this cost code provides procurement and maintenance of support and technology refresh of test equipment at Naval Undersea Warfare Centers (NUWC) Keyport and Newport and the contractor facility for assembly, testing and integration.\n\n[P5 \/ G5830 - Production Engineering]: Funding under this cost code provides for production tasks performed by NUWC NPT and KPT and includes review of contractor generated Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs), review and resolution of contractor failures and proposed corrective action, configuration management activities, contractor monitoring, risk analysis, technical problem resolution, software engineering, safety, integrated logistics support, environmental engineering, and information systems. Funding maintains production specification in accordance with production processes and provides subject matter experts to support root cause analysis of failed contractor hardware and monitor contractor defect and reduction processes to ensure deficiencies are effectively addressed. Funding is also provided for program office acquisition support.\n\n[P5 \/ G5840 - Quality Assurance]: Funding under this cost code provides for quality assurance (QA) tasks performed by NUWC Keyport and Newport including: QA reviews of the contractor and subcontractors data and documentation indicating conformity to product performance requirements and review of objective quality evidence.\n\n[P5 \/ G5860 - Acceptance T&E]: Funding under this cost code provides for integration and production acceptance testing of prime contractor hardware sections and Warheads into an MK48 Mod 7 AUR Torpedo."

            "val": "In FY15, the Navy plans to update and finalize MK48 Mod 7 Heavyweight Torpedo Technical Data Packages (TDP) for MK48 Mod 7 Torpedo Components and upgrade existing production Test Equipment.\n\nThe MK48 production restart will contain two separate competitive awards (Each with a base year and 4 option years) starting in FY16 for the prime contractors to deliver MK48 Mod 7 Torpedo sections. The contractual deliveries from the Guidance and Control and After Body\/Tail Cone sections will be integrated with war reserve Warheads and Fuel Tank sections by the Government Intermediate Maintenance Activity (IMA) at NUWC Keyport, WA to create eight (8) All Up Rounds (AUR). This effort will increase warshot torpedoes available in support of the pre-Major Combat Operations phase.  The Torpedo Guidance and Control Section contains the Guidance and Control Shell, Broadband Sonar Array Receiver (BSAR), Depth Sensor Assembly (DSA), Electromagnet Interference (EMI) filter, Guidance and Control Box (GCB), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Nose Array, Pre-Amplifier, Transmitter, Tuning Box, and Wirelink.  The second competitive contract will procure the Torpedo After Body\/Tail Cone Section, which will include the After Body shell, steering assembly, Tail Cone assembly, engine assembly coolant system, fuel delivery assembly, hydraulic system, alternator\/regulator, lube oil pump, and Type 2 cables.  NUWC Keyport, WA IMA will perform production acceptance on these MK48 Mod 7 torpedo sections.\n\nFY16 NRE funds the production of 6 POM units, POM unit government testing, first article testing, tooling and test equipment, procurement of technical data package updates, start-up costs and other one-time costs for two production contracts. Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) funds are provided to address obsolescence issues in the Guidance and Control (G&C) and After Body\/Tail Cone sections during the production cycle.
