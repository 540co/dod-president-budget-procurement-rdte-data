            "val": "COMBINED ARMS COMMAND AND CONTROL TRAINER UPGRADE SYSTEM (CACCTUS) upgrades Combined Arms Staff Trainer (CAST) at the 5 Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) locations to provide a more immersive training opportunity for Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) staff elements in the areas of fire support employment, coordination, and integration. The upgraded system will support Marine Expeditionary Battalion (MEB) level training and to effectively integrate current and emerging Communications Command Control Computers and Intelligence (C4I) systems. These funds will also support the procurement of system developmental hardware.\n\nCOMMAND and CONTROL TRAINING and EDUCATION CENTER of EXCELLENCE (C2 TECOE) supports the five (5) MAGTF Integrated Systems Training Centers (MISTCs).  The MISTCs, under the operational control of the C2 TECOE is the primary Command and Control (C2) training venue for the Marine Corps operating forces for both individual and collective C2 systems sustainment training. The yearly funding is for equipment refresh and procurement of new training systems. A portion of the C2 computer systems are replaced each year to provide current systems for classroom and combat operation training in battle staff training for commanders and unit personnel.\n\nDEPLOYABLE VIRTUAL TRAINING ENVIRONMENT (DVTE) is a laptop PC based simulation system capable of emulating organic and supporting Infantry Battalion weapons systems and training scenarios to facilitate Training and Readiness (T&R) based training, currently being fielded at the Battalion level. Its portable configuration allows Marines to train when they otherwise could not; aboard ship, at remote reserve locations and deployed. DVTE conducts multiple types of training such as language and culture training, platoon and squad level tactics, employment of supporting arms, and various Recognition of Combatants (ROC) packages. DVTE is part of a Commander's \"training toolkit\" contributing to the building block approach to standards based training focusing on achieving an improved level of combat readiness. Funding supports hardware refresh and integration\/interoperability capabilities with operational forces' systems.\n\nFORCE ON FORCE TRAINING SYSTEMS (FoFTS) provides realistic, non-live fire capabilities to perform force-on-force training and supports realistic, live fire force-on-target training. The program develops, fields and supports a suite of tactical engagement capabilities that enhance Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) training around the world and across the range of military operations. The program includes tactical training systems such as the Special Effects Small Arms Marking System (SESAMS) and advanced, instrumented, laser-based tactical engagement systems such as the Instrumented-Tactical Engagement Simulation System (I-TESS) that provide realistic weapons effects, position locating, and enhanced After Action Review (AAR) capability to support Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) events in the MAGTF Training Program curriculum. Funding supports procurement of company sets of I-TESS training systems required to meet Authorized Acquisition Objective (AAO).\n\nFAMILY OF COMBAT VEHICLE TRAINING SYSTEM (FCVTS) consists of the active duty Marine Corps' CCS and the USMC Reserves' Virtual Combat Convoy Trainer - Reconfigurable Vehicle Simulator (VCCT-RVS).  The CCS provides an immersive training environment in which Marines exercise combat skills including tactics, techniques and procedures for vehicle convoy operations in a variety of simulated road, terrain, weather, visibility and operational conditions.  Tactical scenarios include weapons usage, target engagement, driver evasive action, vehicle coordination command and control procedures, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) defeat, and calls for fire, close air support and medical evacuation.  Procurement funding supports technology refreshes to the system.\n\nINDOOR SIMULATED MARKSMANSHIP TRAINER (ISMT) is a three (3) dimensional simulation based trainer for indoor use, capable of instructing in basic and advanced marksmanship, shoot\/no-shoot judgment, combat marksmanship and weapons employment tactics. The ISMT is used for remedial, virtual instruction to augment live fire upon simulated targets with an indication of the rounds fired.  The ISMT systems are used both within the continental United States (CONUS) and Outside CONUS (OCONUS).  The system has five (5) firing positions and is capable of operating simulated weapons such as AT4, M2 .50 Cal, M9, M16A4, M16A2 Fully Sensored, M240G, M240B, M203, MK19, MP5, M249 SAW, M870 12 gauge shotgun, SMAW, M224 60mm Mortar, M252 81mm Mortar, M4A1, SRAW (Predator), Joint Services Combat Shotgun (JSCS, M67 Infantry Automatic Rifle (IAR), M32 Multi-shot Grenade Launcher, and the M72 Light Anti-Armor Weapon (LAW).\n\nRANGES AND TRAINING AREA MANAGEMENT (RTAM) [FORMERLY RANGE MODERNIZATION\/TRANSFORMATION (RM\/T)] Baseline and OCO program modernizes major USMC base and station live training ranges to provide enhanced after action review with ground truth feedback, realistic representation of opposing forces (OPFOR) and enhanced range and exercise command and control capabilities. Integrating live and simulated training technologies, the fielded capabilities enhance live-fire, force-on-target, and force-on-force training. Major system components of modernization include Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain (MOUT) facilities, inter-active targetry, battlefield effects simulators, individual and vehicle tracking systems, aviation tracking systems, Tactical Engagement Simulation Systems, simulated munitions, integrated simulation, and range control and exercise control information processing and situational awareness displays. Current combat Operations Freedom Sentinel (OFS) in support of OCO are being conducted in largely urban areas. Training is required to support the complexities of command and control, live-fire coordination in support of maneuver, and logistics operations in support of units at and above company level. Deploying Operational Units need access to instrumented, non live-fire and live-fire capable MOUT training facilities, urban sniper training capabilities, convoy operation\/reaction course capability, Urban Close Air Support (CAS) ranges, and IED\/EOD training capability in order to accomplish this training and bring the Marine Corps into the 21st century, to include a fully immersive infantry trainer (IIT). These capabilities give deploying units the opportunity to better meet training requirements before exercising as a Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) and deploying to the combat theaters. Additionally lessons learned from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) are driving the need for new training systems supporting a seamless training environment allowing crucial core capabilities to be available for all Marines at all sites at once.\n\nSUPPORTING ARMS VIRTUAL TRAINER (SAVT) will advance the training capability, operational readiness, and tactical proficiency of USMC Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACS), Forward Observers (FOs), and Forward Air Controllers (FACs).  The personnel will use training scenarios that require the placement of tactical ordnance on selected target using Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) procedures and observed fire procedures for Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS), artillery and mortar fire to perform destruction, neutralization, suppression, illumination\/coordinated illumination, interdiction and harassment fire missions.\n\nSQUAD IMMERSIVE TRAINING ENVIRONMENT (SITE) will provide II Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) an outdoor Infantry Immersion Trainer (IIT) that will consist of small unit training ranges with urban structures finished and decorated to replicate geo-specific locations paired with integrated direct fire training systems, virtual simulation screens and video instrumentation for after action review.  The outdoor training environments closely replicates current operational threats by stimulating all senses to stress small unit actions and the small unit leader's tactical, moral, and ethical decision making within the context of operational culture.  IIT provides the capability for small-unit rehearsal training and squad leader decision making for assessment and measurement.  The immersive training environment seeks to suspend disbelief by closely replicating the actual operating environment, including realistic battlefield friendly and enemy effects to the level of fidelity that the perceived difference between the actual operational environment and immersive training environment is nearly indistinguishable to the training audience.  This high-level of battlefield realism provides training exposure to operational complexities, mental and physical stressors, and tactical and ethical decision-making in a culturally accurate, threat accurate, and interactive environment.\n\nTRAINING SIMULATION SUPPORT (TSS) program encompasses the procurement of low density, minor (low cost) MAGTF ground training equipment, simulators and simulations. These devices such as medical training kits, climbing walls, weapons models and mockups, enhance basic occupational and combat skills across the wide spectrum of tactics, techniques, procedures and firearms and weapon proficiency.  TSS for the most part is for commercial\/service non-developmental training devices, used by Marine Corps Schools of Infantry, Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, Recruit Depots, operating forces, bases, stations and support combat readiness. Funding provides capability for the USMC to conduct critical OCO training and participate as a full-fledged member of several Joint programs."

The approximate $2.5M increase in funds from FY 16 to FY17 supports the procurement of IRSS at Townsend Bombing Range, McIntosh County, Georgia and additional ranges support. \n\nSUPPORTING ARMS VIRTUAL TRAINER (SAVT) $4.061M will provide the start of procurement funding to support the technical refresh to be accomplished over two years (2017 and 2018) at all sites including the test berth in Orlando.  The $4.1M increase from FY16 to FY17 supports the start of technical refresh.\n\nTRAINING SIMULATIONS SUPPORT (TSS) $.533M - encompasses the procurement of low density, minor (low cost) MAGTF ground training equipment, simulators and simulations. These devices such as medical training kits,bleeding simulation kits, weapons models and mockups, enhance basic occupational and combat skills across the wide spectrum of tactics, techniques, procedures and firearms and weapon proficiency.  Funding provides capability for the USMC to conduct critical OCO training and participate as a full-fledged member of several Joint programs.  FY17 will provide continued support for a determined combination of minor low cost ground training equipment, simulators and simulations.\n\nOCO: \nFY2015 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO): $2.000M\nRANGES AND TRAINING AREA MANAGEMENT (RTAM) [FORMERLY RANGE MODERNIZATION\/TRANSFORMATION (RM\/T)]: Supports recapitalization of live fire Mobile Operations Urban Terrain (MOUT) capability, Urban Close Air Support (CAS) Capability, and a live fire convoy course.  These training systems have been damaged or destroyed due to extremely heavy use required for pre-deployment training.  Due to these additional exercises, throughput has increased the amount of ammunition fired and shortened the life expectancy of the training systems.  These systems will continue to be used heavily for pre-deployment training.  Replacing targetry provides realistic targets that accurately support training scenarios and requirements for deploying units.\n\nFY2016 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO): N\/A\n\nFY2017 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO): N\/A"
