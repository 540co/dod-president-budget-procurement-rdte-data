        "Description": {
            "val": "This budget line funds two separate programs.  One program supports Float and the other program supports Rail.\n\nThe Float program funds hardware and material in support of Army Watercraft Systems.  The principle capabilities of Army Watercraft Systems are 1) movement\/maneuver and distribution of combat equipment and sustainment material; 2) access to degraded and\/or austere ports; 3) seaport operations, to include docking\/undocking, firefighting, towing and rescue; 4) ship to shore access to \"no port\" areas such as austere and remote, bare beaches; and 5) heavy lift in support of damaged seaport and\/or vessel repair and salvage.\n\nArmy Watercraft Systems are categorized under Landing Craft, Towing and Terminal Operations, Ship-to-Shore Enablers and Watercraft Operations Support.  Landing Craft consist of 8 Logistic Support Vessels (LSV), 34 Landing Craft Utility 2000 (LCU-2000), and 30 Landing Craft Mechanized 8 (LCM-8) MOD 1.  Towing and Terminal Operations consist of 6 Large Tug 800 (LT-800), 16 Small Tug 900 (ST-900), and 4 Barge Derrick Crane 115-ton (BD-115).  Ship-to-Shore Enablers consist of 3 Modular Causeway Systems (MCS) [each MCS includes 2 Roll-On\/Roll-Off Discharge Facilities (RRDF), 5 Modular Warping Tugs (MWT), 1 Causeway Ferry (CF), 1 Floating Causeway (FC)].  Landing Craft discharge combat equipment or troops to austere beaches, undeveloped coastlines and operate in a non-permissive environment.  Towing and Terminal Operations and Ship-to-Shore Enablers support ocean and port\/harbor towing\/salvage operations.  Both are critical in denied\/degraded ports, Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS) operations, and operations throughout the littorals.  Watercraft Operations Support includes 6 LCM-8 MOD 2.\n\nFirst fielded in 1988, the Logistics Support Vessel (LSV) is globally self-deployable, and provides worldwide and intra-theater movement and line haul of large quantities of combat vehicles, equipment, and sustainment cargo, to include containerized, break-bulk, and Roll-on Roll-off (RO\/RO) cargo, to improved and\/or degraded ports, bare and austere beaches, and inland water terminals.  With 10,500 square feet of cargo space and a payload capacity of 2,000 tons, the LSV can carry 24 combat loaded M1A1 Main Battle Tanks or the equivalent.  The vessel supports JLOTS, seaport opening and coastal\/inland waterway distribution, anti-access theater opening, and can deliver combat-configured elements or sustainment cargo during all phases of the campaign.\n\nFirst fielded in 1990, the Landing Craft Utility 2000 (LCU-2000) provides intra-theater movement of combat vehicles, equipment, and sustainment cargo, to include containerized, break-bulk, and RO\/RO cargo to improved and\/or degraded ports, bare and austere beaches, and inland water terminals.  The vessel is ideally suited for the discharge and back load of sea lift, the shallow draft, bow ramp, and associated systems providing capability for beaching and beach extraction.  The vessel supports JLOTS, seaport opening and coastal\/inland waterway distribution, anti-access theater opening, and can deliver combat-configured elements or sustainment during all phases of the campaign.\n\nFirst fielded in 1967, the Landing Craft Mechanized 8 (LCM-8) transports combat equipped personnel and equipment, and sustainment cargo, from ship to shore and\/or within coastal areas including inland waterways.  The vessel is also capable of providing medical evacuations, command and control (C2) afloat and light harbor salvage support.  The size of the vessel facilitates operation within restricted areas, access to shallow areas to include bare beaches, and extensively throughout inland waterways.\n\nFirst fielded in 1994, the Large Tug 800 (LT-800) performs transoceanic and coastal towing operations, docking and undocking of large ships, salvage and recovery operations for disabled or damaged watercraft at sea and along the coastal main supply routes, clearance of degraded, damaged, and denied access waterways and port facilities, and provides both ship to ship and ship to shore firefighting capability to include in support of ammunition upload\/download operations.\n\nFirst fielded in 1998, the Small Tug 900 (ST-900) provides movement of cargo barges and lighterage of various types within a harbor, port, or Logistics Over the Shore (LOTS) or JLOTS operations.  It also assists larger tugs with utility work such as docking\/undocking of ships of all sizes, movement of floating cranes, and line-handling duties.\n\nFirst fielded in 1999, the Barge Derrick, 115-ton (BD-115) provides heavy lift to load and discharge cargo that exceeds the lift capacity of ship's gear in theater-wide missions\/operations.  The BD-115 is capable of lifting the M1A1 main battle tank from the centerline of a non-self-sustaining ship, and is world-wide deployable via the LT-800.  The BD-115 also provides heavy clearance and salvage capabilities within degraded, damaged, and denied access waterways and port facilities.\n\nFirst fielded in 1996, the Modular Causeway System (MCS) provides floating platforms for the loading, discharge, and transport of combat vehicles, equipment, and sustainment cargo to and from improved or austere ports, inland water terminals, and during bare beach operations.  A modular and highly transportable system, the MCS consists of both powered and non-powered systems to include the Roll-on Roll-off Discharge Facility (RRDF), Causeway Ferry (CF), Floating Causeway (FC), and Warping Tug (WT), and serves as a key enabler for both LOTS and JLOTS operations.\n\nRescue Boats with outboard engines to meet Safety-of-Life at Sea (SOLAS) requirements for the Watercraft LSV, LCU-2000, LT-800 and MCS fleet, including cranes, cradles, and davit assemblies (support assemblies).\n\nFor the Rail program, railroad equipment consists of locomotives, rolling stock, railway passenger cars, track maintenance equipment, etc., used to support Army ammunition plants, Army Materiel Command (AMC) depots, Installation Management Command (IMCOM), Forces Command (FORSCOM) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) installations in peacetime, training and mobilization missions. This Railway Equipment is procured for the replacement of logistically unsupportable assets where current items are in some cases already unserviceable and in other cases, either unsafe or not cleared for use under the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). \n\nLocomotive procurement consists of commercial off-the-shelf GENSET switcher locomotives in direct support of the Army Rail Modernization Program. The program mandates systematic replacement of an aging fleet, that for the respective installations are becoming increasingly more costly to maintain. The GENSET Locomotives are industry proven, state of the art technology that will position the Army to meet current EPA air quality restrictions, and future fuel economy mandates.\n\nComments: In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestics emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

Program Management Support includes Program Management and System Engineering oversight required to manage the program and provide contractor oversight.  Salaries, Benefits, Travel, Personnel Training and other government costs are included for retaining a professional acquisition workforce."
