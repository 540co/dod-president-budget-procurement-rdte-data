Project descriptions are provided below for each of the P5 exhibit projects listed, and the single or multi-year cost phasing of each of the projects is addressed in the P5 exhibit.\n\nFY 2017 Project Descriptions\n\nNSS-ISB - Space Industrial Base Capabilities (FY 2017 and outyears): projects will fund mitigation efforts to rectify shortcomings in the space industrial and supply base. The objective is to ensure access to critical technologies and capabilities in the quality, quantity, and timeframes required to support U.S. Government space programs. Projects in this program are addressing cross-platform, multi-agency\/Service requirements. Funds will develop projects in response to risk mitigation determinations and prioritized critical requirements of stake holders in DoD and other agencies, as represented through the Department's Space Industrial Base Working Group.\n\nProjects Other (non NSS-ISB):\nAdvanced Microelectronics Trusted Foundry (FY 2017 new start):  This project supports the Department's efforts to maintain domestic trusted sources of advanced microelectronics production.  AT&L's strategy is focused on improving capability to evaluate and validate trust of microelectronics parts and advance standards to incentivize the commercial marketplace to recognize trust as a competitive design standard, and develop alternative approaches to the current manufacturing-driven means of trust to enable broader DoD access to commercial state of the art technology.\n\nNext Generation Jammer GaN MMIC and Wideband Circulator (FY2017- FY2019 and Prior Years): This project is an investment in production technology and capacity expansion for gallium nitride (GaN) monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) and wideband circulator technologies for Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) program requirements.  The objective is to establish\/expand one or more domestic sources for GaN integrated circuit components to ensure the availability of critical components required for the Next Generation Jammer and other electronic warfare systems. Additionally, this initiative will mitigate program risk by ensuring on-shore availability of critical components, maintain secure sources for these essential electronic components through oversight of sources and processes, and address process and quality improvements to drive down costs.\n\nFY 2016 Project Descriptions\n\nAdvanced Weapon Component\/Materials Production (FY 2016 \u2013 continuing): This line item includes the FY 2016 Congressional increase of $30 million. The purpose of this continuous effort is to use DPA Title III authorities to make investments in the domestic industrial base that maintain the timely availability of critical-need, technologically superior production capabilities that are independently available within the U.S. for both current and future weapon systems, as informed by the Department's key investment strategy documents including the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and the Long Range Research and Development Plan (LRRDP). These resources will focus on projects that span multiple agencies, weapons platforms, and Service needs, enabling the production of capacity for technologies and materials emerging from the technology base that the private sector is unable to respond to within DoD timelines. Technology focus areas include space, undersea, air dominance, strike, missile defense, and emerging technologies.  \n\nNSS ISB - Cadmium Zinc Telluride Substrates (Prior Years \u2013 FY 2016): The purpose of this potential project is to enhance the ability of the domestic industrial base to produce large format, space-qualified cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) substrates for use in government satellite systems.  Due to evolving National Security Space (NSS) threat requirements, several agencies responsible for missile early warning, missile defense, and other space requirements need to maintain a strong industrial base for mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) based infrared detector technology.  A key material for the MCT detector arrays is the lattice-matching substrate CZT on which the detector array is grown.  Existing domestically-produced CZT substrates do not meet the size and quality requirements necessary to produce large, space-quality infrared focal plane arrays. The focus of this effort will be on the expansion of CZT boule growth and large format, (211)-oriented substrate production; the stretch objective is the production of 9cm x 9.5cm substrates from 150mm diameter boules.  \n\nNSS ISB - Electron Beam Direct Write (FY 2016 new start): This project addresses a need for an advanced lithography tool for government integrated circuit developments. It will have benefits in vastly reduced mask costs, improved design turn-around times, improved yield & reliability, improved design security (trust), and increased die sizes. Production versions of this tool would be inserted in U.S. integrated circuit foundries fabricating parts for space and defense applications at a relatively low cost (versus commercial advanced lithography solutions in development) per system. The proposed project will accomplish the first such insertion. The project is to complete the development of a piece of lithography equipment that uses multiple electron beams (e-beams) to enable the direct transfer (\"writing\") of integrated circuit layer descriptions to a physical wafer being processed. Accomplishing this project brings a host of benefits when coupled with 1 D (1-dimensional or \"unidirectional\") layout techniques as part of a complementary ebeam write (CEBW) methodology. \n\nNSS ISB - Next Generation Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA) (FY 2016 new start):  This project addresses a need for a multiple-phase Next-Generation scalable Reaction Wheel (NGRW) project to provide a systematic comprehensive, low cost\/risk investment affording potential for high return on investment. The goal is to generate or revive a domestic competitor, or to expand the existing vendor's product line, with a focus on smaller wheels using advanced technologies. In addition, investigate encouraging a business partnership to maintain a second source in the U.S. Also, the project will investigate using another product controlled by a U.S. company. \n\nNSS ISB - Next-Generation Star Trackers System (Prior Years \u2013 FY 2016): This project will establish the development and production of an affordable and reliable modular, Next Generation Star Tracker System (NGSTS) that uses advanced domestically-produced Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) detectors with a capability that meets the specifications of the DPA Title III Advanced CMOS Capability Project.  This involves adherence to the Staring Technology for Enhanced Linear Line-of-site Angular Recognition (STELLAR) specification. A NGSTS with CMOS technology is needed to meet military and civil US Government (including National Security Space) and commercial market demands for the foreseeable future, and will reassert the viability and competitiveness of the domestic industrial base.\n\nNSS ISB - Photovoltaic Substrates Supply Chain Diversification (FY 2016 new start): The purpose of this effort is to improve national security by addressing a critical gap in the North American supply chain for defense-critical, high-purity germanium (Ge) metal used for space-qualified photovoltaics in a wide range of warfighting and surveillance assets. Those assets include ground-based infrared (IR) optics for night vision operations, airborne IR windows and optical systems, space-based IR optics, and high-efficiency, multi-junction (M-J) photovoltaics (solar cells) used on over 95% of all space satellite assets, both Government and commercial. The investment will ensure the long-term domestic supply of space-qualified Ge substrates by successfully diversifying into higher-margin products that will maintain profitability and allow the company to serve Ge wafer markets.\n\nNSS ISB - Radiation-Hardened Digital\/Analog Production & Qualification (FY 2016 new start): It is imperative that government organizations responsible for national security, e.g., intelligence acquisition, missile early warning, missile defense, and other space requirements maintain a strong industrial base to supply technology necessary to design, develop, and fabricate Trusted, radiation hardened, high reliability and DoD space qualified Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), Application Specific Standard Products (ASSP), such as very high speed data switches, and Multi-Core General Purpose Processors (MC-GPP) at the less than or equal to 45nm technology node to support onboard processing and other critical applications. The objective of this project is to enhance the Radiation Hardened By Design 45nm ASIC\/ASSP design flow, optimize selected circuit designs to reduce power and increase performance and complete the design, fabrication, test and qualification of certain critical devices to include the MC-GPP. In addition to achieving an estimated improvement in performance of > 25% for power and performance for some specific designs, the proposed effort will support life-time acquisition buys of these critical circuits for some identified systems with attendant reductions in system technical, cost and schedule risks. \n\nNSS ISB - Radiation-Hardened Transistors & Diodes (FY 2016 new start):  Many present and future DoD and intelligence systems have identified Rad Hard components as a critical base technology. There are very few remaining suppliers of Rad Hard space qualified components such as diodes, Metal Oxide on Silicon Field Effect Transistors (MOSFET), insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), Optocouplers and other Optical devices, Glassless diodes, JANKC diode dies, and more. These components are used almost universally to provide power and conditioned signals to Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) circuits.  Since this is an extremely niche market, a single company is the only manufacturer of components that designs and produces entirely with US persons in a US facility, and specializes in military, aerospace and space. The company also provides products to commercial space, to companies such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Space Systems Loral.  The reduction in demand for strategic radiation hardened electronics (RHE) (e.g., >1Mrad total ionization dose) over the past 15 years has resulted in a substantial decrease of the industrial base, which is down to two main suppliers, and only one supplier, which designs and manufactures their components in the USA today and has a proven process for Rad Hard by Design products.  \n\nNSS ISB - Trusted Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) (FY 2016 new start): The DoD and Intelligence Community have identified FPGAs as a critical enabling technology across a wide variety of present and future systems. Advanced, commercially available FPGAs do not meet the DoD requirements for Trusted systems as they are manufactured off-shore and are considered vulnerable to tampering and insertion of malicious software and\/or hardware. This program seeks to improve the security posture and reduce the risk associated with FPGA technology by addressing security concerns in the design, development, fabrication and supply lifecycle of FPGA devices. The objective of this program is to develop and demonstrate an approach to ensure the availability of advanced \"Trusted\" and space qualified reprogrammable FPGA technology to support DoD\/IC applications including satellite and strategic missile systems. Concerning this effort \"Trust\" is defined as assurance of the integrity and availability, of a product wherein that product will reliably operate as intentionally designed and not contain any malicious hardware and\/or software that will compromise the intended application; e.g., exfiltration of sensitive data, etc. \n\nProjects Other (non NSS-ISB):\n\nSecure Composite Shipping Containers Production Capacity (FY 2016 - FY 2019 new start): Developed under funding from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA), the Secure Hybrid Composite Container (SHCC) is an intermodal ISO shipping container providing advanced security features, while meeting all the operational, structural, and customs requirements of standard steel 20ft and 40ft shipping containers.  The security system is designed to confirm the integrity of the container and report breaches to the cognizant authorities. The container includes the capability to be tracked during its shipment and alert officials to track deviations and alarms. The ultimate goal of the container is to provide the level of security to law enforcement officials to ensure contraband products and malicious agents have not been inserted into the container for smuggling into the US. Investment under Title III to establish initial production capability for the secure hybrid composite container can help satisfy an estimated 3,000 container per year initial government need from the Department of Defense, Department of State, and the Intelligence Community agencies requiring secure shipping containers. A production line with an output of approximately 100 containers per year output is planned.\n\nFY2015 Project  Descriptions\n\nNSS ISB - Additive Manufacturing for Liquid Rocket Engines (Prior Years \u2013 FY 2015): Awarded in July 2014, this project aims to advance the domestic capability for precision manufacturing of components utilized by National Security Space (NSS) agencies to launch critical assets into Earth orbit. Advanced additive manufacturing equipment, now being deployed, provides up to a 600% volumetric increase in the powder bed compared to existing additive manufacturing equipment. This essential equipment provides the necessary build envelope and capabilities to produce larger critical components for liquid rocket engines (LREs). The industrial base for precision manufactured components for LREs is high cost and is facing component obsolescence challenges.  Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), an additive manufacturing technique, is estimated to provide a 30% to 80% reduction in critical component cost and schedule for upper stage precision manufactured components.  Under this effort the contractor will establish and ex-situ qualify the production of various RL10 and RS-68 nickel, aluminum, and copper LRE components.\n\nNSS ISB - Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Focal Plane Arrays (FPA) for Visible Sensors for Star Trackers (Prior Years \u2013 FY 2015): This project will expand and enhance the domestic industrial base's ability to produce visible - imagers manufactured using Advanced Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology.  Advanced CMOS imagers are designed to enable flexible visible imaging systems on-board satellite and other systems for DoD and other US Government needs.  Current domestic Star Tracker manufacturers are using older, more expensive, and less capable Charged Couple Device (CCD) sensor technology that has put domestic suppliers at a disadvantage with international competitors.  \n\nNSS ISB - Read-Out Integrated Circuit (ROIC) Foundry Improvement and Sustainability (Prior Years \u2013 FY 2015): This project will maintain minimal yet adequate production capabilities at domestic foundries to assure the necessary supply of strategic ROICs deemed useful for Government space programs.  This initiative is driven by low yields due to defect density, large die size and design complexity, and long periods of time between orders due to the small market for large format ROICs.  Essential systems include Ballistic Missile Defense, Space Tracking and Surveillance System and Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicles that rely on ROIC technology.\n\nNSS ISB - Space Qualified Solar Cell Germanium Substrate Supply Chain (Prior Years \u2013 FY 2015): The purpose of this project is to ensure that the Government and its National Security Space (NSS) suppliers can procure defense-critical, NSS-qualified germanium substrates in quantity from a viable, operationally superior US domestic germanium substrate manufacturer.  Objectives include increasing quality and yield, implementing internal refining and material recycling capability, expanding product family offering (from 4\" substrates to 6\" substrates) and reducing cost.  Germanium substrates are the basis for the solar cells used on all NSS satellites and are forecast to continue as such for the next 10-15 years.\n\nProjects Other (non NSS-ISB):\n\nActivated Carbon Capacity Expansion (Prior Years \u2013 FY 2015): The objective this project is to expand domestic production capacity of activated carbon, which is used by the DoD to protect against many Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) agents that could be used during acts of war or terrorism.  Copper-silver-zinc-molybdenum-trietheylenediamine (ASZM-TEDA) impregnated activated carbon is the only grade of carbon deemed acceptable by the DoD for collective and personal CBRN protection systems and devices. Currently, DoD relies on a single activated carbon manufacturing facility with one production line to support 70+ DoD systems that utilize ASZM-TEDA activated carbon. The company is not currently incentivized to expand capacity to meet DoD surge requirements. This DPA Title III project will expand domestic manufacturing capacity for activated carbon by partnering with a viable, world-class domestic manufacturer whose production processes will manufacture product to meet both DoD requirements and the needs of non-DoD user communities. \n\nAdvanced Drop-In Biofuel Production (Prior Years \u2013 FY 2015): This is an effort to establish and scale-up domestic Integrated Biofuel Production Enterprises using three domestic firms.  Phase 1 activities evaluated production technology, technical maturity, site selection, plant design, permitting, and detailed cost estimation for four projects.  In Phase 2 each of the three firms whose proposals were accepted will construct and commission a biofuel production plant capable of producing renewable, drop-in liquid transportation fuels leveraging existing infrastructure. The renewable fuel will be delivered to DoD fully blended with conventional petroleum and ready for immediate DoD operational use with no modification to distribution or aircraft\/ship systems.   \n\nModernization of Steel Plate Production (Prior Years \u2013 FY 2015): The purpose of this project is to enhance the domestic manufacturing capability to produce very wide (up to 190 inches) and heavy (over 55 tons) steel plate used in US Navy ship construction. Modernization of plate production processes will improve quality and yield, increase throughput, reduce production cost, and result in improved ship construction efficiency.  These improvements translate into less shipyard processing and rework time, and lower ship construction costs. This project will improve domestic manufacturing capability for Navy-grade alloy heavy steel plate by partnering with a viable, world-class domestic manufacturer whose production processes will supply product to meet both DoD requirements and the needs of commercial user communities.\n\nScale Up of Green Energetics (Prior Years \u2013 FY 2015):  This project will expand the domestic manufacturing capability for non-toxic (green) drop-in replacement for current primary energetic (explosive) materials that contain toxic compounds. The capabilities associated with existing primary energetic materials, which include lead azide (LA), lead styphnate (LS), and mercury (II) 5-nitrotetrazole (DXN-1), are essential for numerous ammunition, missile and aircraft applications. However, safer alternatives are needed due to the regulated toxins and heavy metals contained in these materials that present dangerous environmental, health and safety concerns. Executive Order 12856 calls for the replacement of toxic materials used by the Federal Government. Current domestic manufacturing capacity for alternative non-toxic primary energetic material is insufficient to meet DoD requirements, and several market barriers exist which inhibit private sector investments in capacity expansion. A public\/private partnership under the authorities of Title III of the Defense Production Act will spur industry to increase DBX-1 capacity, thereby enabling DoD to transition from toxic energetics to safer alternatives.\n\nThin Wall Castings for Military Applications (FY 2015):  This DPA Title III project will maintain, modernize and expand the US manufacturing capability for the production of complex, large, multi-core magnesium and aluminum sand casted rotorcraft parts by incentivizing the industrial base through a mix of government and contractor-shared investments. All US Military rotorcraft vehicles require complex, large, multi-core magnesium and aluminum sand casted components to remain operationally viable and combat ready. The US domestic supply base for the production of complex, large, multi-core magnesium and aluminum sand casted components is in need of modernization but does not have adequate profitability or economic incentive to undertake the necessary investments on its own. These investments will be designed and managed to recapitalize aging domestic foundries and to strengthen a diminishing supply base in order to meet DoD rotorcraft part requirements."
