            "val": "This budget line includes Anti-Personnel Landmine Alternatives (APLA), All Types.\n\nE91700 Spider is a hand emplaced, remotely controlled, anti-personnel munition system that was designed to replace the capability of the persistent anti-personnel landmines banned from use after December 2010 per US Landmine policy.  Spider, as a Man-in-the-Loop system, offers numerous capabilities for asymmetric warfare focusing on small unit force protection.  The system is made up of 4 subsystems:  Man-in-the-Loop (the human operator), Remote Control Station (RCS),the system command and control station, Repeater (a communication link to the munitions that provides extended range), and Munition Control Units (MCU)delivers anti-personnel effects.  The Spider is designed to mitigate the indiscriminate initiation of the lethal mechanism.  A Soldier\/Marine makes a conscious decision to engage a target with the lethal mechanism.  Spider's sensor capabilities and controlled munitions provide needed force protection and battlefield shaping.  Spider allows measured and graduated responses including sense only, non lethal, and lethal modes.  Spider also supports net-centric operations by feeding situational awareness information (location and status) into the Battle Command system.  The Spider system with its many desirable features makes it a versatile weapon system that has significant utility across the full spectrum of military operations and will support current and future operations.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.  Type Classification Standard and Full Materiel Release were achieved in July and September 2013 respectively.\n\nE91741 - The MCUs are munitions strategically placed to provide the barrier capability of an obstacle.  The baseline MCU employs up to six (6) replaceable Miniature Grenade Launchers (MGLs) or up to six (6) Munition Adaoter Modules (MAMs), and a replaceable Extended Range Tripline Sensor (ERTS) module with six (6) triplines.\n\nE91711 - The Miniature-Grenade Launcher (MGL) consists of a grenade assembly composed of a high explosive fragmenting warhead that provides lethal effects when launched from a Spider MCU.\n\nE91721 - The Extended Range Tripline Sensor (ERTS) module enables the remote deployment of six (6) triplines.  The ERTS provides a silent (from enemy perspective) intrusion detection capability alerting the RCS operator of the enemy presence in the munition field.  When deployed, the triplines travel 10 to 12 meters along an axis (depending on wind speed and direction) corresponding to the six launch azimuths of the grenades providing approximately 20 to 24 meters of ERTS tripline diameter coverage.  The ERTS do not have to be deployed or installed until the tactical scenario calls for their deployment."
