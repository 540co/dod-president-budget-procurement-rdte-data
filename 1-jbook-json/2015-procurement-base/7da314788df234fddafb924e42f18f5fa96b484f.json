The MQ-4C Triton UAS, which is an adjunct to the P-8A Multi-Mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA)\/P-3, is integral in recapitalizing the Navy's Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force.  The Triton capability will be based upon the Block 20 variant of the Global Hawk with specific capabilities developed for the maritime persistent Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission.  The MQ-4C air vehicle, mission control system, specialized sensors, and communications suite will play a significant role in the Sea Shield and FORCEnet pillars of Sea Power 21.  In its Sea Shield role, Triton on-station time and range enables unmatched awareness of the maritime battlespace by sustaining the common operational tactical picture (COTP) for Surface Warfare and the Overseas Contingency Operation.  The system will serve as a Fleet Response Plan enabler while acting as a trip wire for Intelligence Preparation of the Environment.\n\nMQ-4C Triton includes an endurance-class UAS that will operate from land-based sites around the world.  Sufficient unmanned aircraft at each operating location will provide persistent maritime ISR by being airborne 24 hours a day, 7 days a week out to ranges of 2,000 nautical miles.  Worldwide access will be achieved by providing coverage to nearly all the world's high-density sea-lanes, littorals and areas of national interest from its operating locations.  Because the MQ-4C Triton UAS and MMA\/P-3 have related complementary missions, it is intended that Triton will leverage the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Forces community to enhance manpower, training and maintenance efficiencies.\n\nMQ-4C Triton UAS sensors will provide detection, classification, tracking and identification of maritime targets.  Sensors to fulfill mission requirements include maritime radar, electro-optical\/infrared and Electronic Support Measures systems.  Additionally, Triton will have a communications relay capability linking dispersed forces in the theater of operation and serving as a node in the Navy's FORCEnet strategy.  The MQ-4C Triton UAS will support the Fleet Commander's common operational tactical picture COTP of the battlespace, day and night.  The UAS will cue other Navy assets for further situational investigation and\/or attack, and will also provide battle damage assessment of the area of interest.  Tactical-level data analysis will occur in real-time at shore-based Mission Control Systems via satellite communications.  Further intelligence exploitation can be conducted at shore-based sites or aboard Carrier Vessel Nuclear\/Landing Helicopter Dock ships.\n\nNote 1: Controls locked prior to updating the \"To Complete\" column for actual Cost and quantities.  In order to reflect the correct Program funding profile, the \"To Complete\" Total Obligation Authority should read $8,041.266 for total cost of $10,765.836 and \"To Complete\" for Gross\/Weapon System Cost should read: $8,160.658.  The \"To Complete\" Procurement Quantity should be 50 for a total Procurement quantity of 66."

Sufficient unmanned aircraft at each operating location will provide persistent maritime ISR by being airborne 24 hours a day, 7 days a week out to ranges of 2,000 nautical miles.  Worldwide access will be achieved by providing coverage to nearly all the world's high-density sea-lanes, littorals and areas of national interest from its operating locations.  Because the MQ-4C Triton UAS and MMA\/P-3 have related complementary missions, it is intended that Triton will leverage the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Forces community to enhance manpower, training and maintenance efficiencies.\n\nMQ-4C Triton UAS sensors will provide detection, classification, tracking and identification of maritime targets.  Sensors to fulfill mission requirements include maritime radar, electro-optical\/infrared and Electronic Support Measures systems.  Additionally, Triton will have a communications relay capability linking dispersed forces in the theater of operation and serving as a node in the Navy's FORCEnet strategy.  The MQ-4C Triton UAS will support the Fleet Commander's COTP of the battlespace, day and night.  The UAS will cue other Navy assets for further situational investigation and\/or attack, and will also provide battle damage assessment of the area of interest.  Tactical-level data analysis will occur in real-time at shore-based Mission Control Systems via satellite communications.  Further intelligence exploitation can be conducted at shore-based sites or aboard Carrier Vessel Nuclear\/Landing Helicopter Dock ships.\n\nNote 1: Controls locked prior to updating the \"To Complete\" column for quantities. The \"To Complete\" Procurement Quantity should be 50.  Total Procurement Quantity should be 66."
