The DOD Indian Incentive Program (IIP) is authorized by Section 504 of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (U.S.C 1544).  In 1989, Congress began providing annual funds through the DOD Appropriation Act for the DOD Indian Incentive Program.  The program motivates prime contractors to utilize Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises by providing a 5% rebate on subcontracted work performed by those companies that fall into the following categories:  Federally Recognized American Indian Organizations, Indian-Owned economics enterprises and small businesses owned by members of recognized tribes, Alaskan Natives or Native Hawaiians.  Through the generation of subcontracts to the above mentioned entities, the IIP fulfills its purpose as an economic multiplier for Native American communities."
