            "val": "This program procures, and integrates SCOPE Command High Frequency (HF) radio equipment, network infrastructure, and transmit\/receive antennas for 13 strategically located ground stations worldwide. The need for modern, robust, and dependable stations with beyond line of sight radio coverage has been identified to ensure HF radio communications is available in additional areas of interest to the United States. High Frequency Global Communications System (HFGCS) is a Command and Control (C2) National Security System (NSS) and is the only global high-power HF C2 network serving the Department of Defense (DoD). HFGCS is a cost-effective, networked solution providing interoperable voice and data communications for strategic and tactical forces, services, and government agencies. HFGCS provides near-global, beyond line-of-sight, C2 communications to aircrews, ground troops, naval operations, and control stations and is the primary C2 resource for Air Mobility Command (AMC) cargo and tanker aircraft. Additional customers include the White House Communications Agency (WHCA), the US Air Force Global HF System, Defense Communications System HF Entry, US Navy High Command Network, and other US government agencies. HFGCS supports war plan dissemination and daily operational requirements for WHCA, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), US Strategic Command, National Military Command Center's Emergency Action Message distribution, AMC Special Air Mission fleet communications, Air Combat Command, Air Intelligence Agency, Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), US Air Forces in Europe, Pacific Air Forces, and Combatant Commanders. HFGCS provides radio connectivity to other governmental organizations such as the Civil Air Patrol, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration, and the State Department. The HFGCS network supports the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) by providing secure, robust, physically diverse terrestrial and airborne transmission paths providing information services between fixed and deployed operating locations. Joint Chiefs of Staff letter, dated 22 January 1993, designated the Air Force as the executive agent for DoD high power fixed HF radio communications sites ashore and associated missions. Assistant Secretary of Defense letter, dated 29 March 1994, directed the Air Force to lead the effort to satisfy the services high frequency radio requirements through the use of the SCOPE Command contract. \"SCOPE\" is NOT an acronym. It is the name of a group of programs with similar underlying goals. HFGCS consists of the two major components: the radio\/network infrastructure (SCOPE Command) and the antennas assets (Antenna Program Support) which communicate with mobile assets (aircraft, Navy ships, Coast Guard ships, etc.)\n\nThe High Frequency Global Communications System (HFGCS) (FY14-FY15) program supports three main projects:\n\n1. SCOPE COMMAND HIGH FREQUENCY GLOBAL NEXT GENERATION CONSOLE (HFG NGC) Modification: FY15 continues the HFG NGC Modification by funding the installation of Increment 2, Security (Console Operator Access Restrictions\/Public Key Infrastructure (COAR\/PKI)) and funding the production of Increment 3, Software Tools (Built In Test (BIT) Enhancements\/Radio Replacement\/System Status). The Increment 2 (Security) production effort was funded in FY13 with completion expected in FY15. The Security increment consists of security enhancements for the HFGCS system to enable system administrators to apply operator restrictions; providing users access to the system to complete their own missions, while preventing users from interfering with other missions. In addition to COAR, the Security Increment also allows HFGCS to comply with Public Law mandate by integrating PKI into all information systems and previously developed architecture. PKI integration will allow the use of Common Access Cards in all ground equipment and web servers within the SCOPE Command subsystem, decreasing the risk of unauthorized access into the HFGCS system. The HFG NGC PKI software will be installed to all of the Any Console\/Any Station (ACAS) consoles.\n\nThe HFG NGC Increment 3, Software Tools mod will provide the operators\/administrators tools to view the operational state of all stations and sites by modifying software to allow for BIT history; provide system status; and allow replacement of the Automated Link Establishment (ALE) radio on faults. The new Automated Link Establishment\/Graphical User Interface (ALE\/GUI) will increase operator and system efficiency (For example, reducing the number of operator steps required to build circuits while better organizing the user interface elements, dramatically increasing operator proficiency.) The HFG NGC Increment 3 (Software Tools) production is planned to be completed in FY17. A separate contract effort for installation of Increment 3, Software Tools, is planned for FY17. The HFG NGC also funds for a share of weapon system infrastructure support to include preliminary system engineering, testing, and shipping requirements as well as advisory and assistance support and acquisition related travel for the program. \n\n2. HIGH FREQUENCY GLOBAL ANTENNA REPLACMENT (HFG Ant Repl): Majority of the system's antennas have been in operation for 25 to 40 years and have been subjected to degradation due to exposure to severe environmental conditions, salt water, and hurricane force winds. FY15 funds continue the replacement of critical antennas at multiple HFGCS sites; actual locations and antenna selections will be based on technical assessment of the antenna's condition and the operational requirements of the weapon system during execution. Potential replacements have been identified at Joint Base Andrews, West Coast, Guam, Sigonella, Diego Garcia, Elmendorf, Offutt, Yokota, and Hawaii. The replacement antennas not only improve network coverage and reliability, but also bring the antenna fields into compliance with mandated safety codes and to meet minimum antenna complement requirements set forth by lead command at AFSPC. The HFG Ant Repl effort also funds for a share of weapon system infrastructure support to include preliminary system engineering, testing, and shipping requirements as well as advisory and assistance support and acquisition related travel for the program office.\n\n3. HIGH FREQUENCY GLOBAL EMAIL REDUNDANCY (HFG EMR): No FY15 funds required for HF EMR. HF EMR provides for a true redundant HF Email delivery capability from either Network Control Station (NCS). This effort provides the necessary software and hardware changes needed to add HF Email for Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) and Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) at Grand Forks NCS; upgrades software and hardware (for compatibility\/sustainment) for the Andrews NCS; and provides program management for the projects. The existing HF Email platform software will be unsupportable in FY15. HF Email is a staple capability for many missions, providing high reliability and assured delivery of critical C2 data to mobile C2 platforms using standard email programs. This optimization reduces the equipment profile from 26 servers to two servers and enables HF email servers to maintain email delivery should a failure occur at the primary location (currently Joint Base Andrews). Without this capability, the weapon system will continue the single point of failure at Andrews NCS for HF Email. Installation of the HF Email architecture upgrade will be completed in early FY15. The HFG EMR effort also included costs for a share of weapon system infrastructure support to include preliminary system engineering, testing, and shipping requirements as well as advisory and assistance support and acquisition related travel for the program office.\n\nFunding for this effort is in program element 0303133F."
