            "val": "FY 2015 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $2.005 million supports the Active Army by providing the funding for stand-alone shotguns and enhanced capabilities for the designated marksmen found in each infantry fire team.  The funding also supports the AMU.  The AMU competes worldwide on a regular basis.  The man\/weapon interface at this competitive level is important.   Between competitions the AMU is firing constantly to hone their skills and maintain their competitive edge.  Weapons of all types are fired and the weapons exceed their stated effective life projections faster.  This requires an extremely high level of maintenance, therefore, the weapons must be coded out and replaced regularly.  Supports the Active Army.   \n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."
