            "val": "The U. S. Naval Academy's mission is to ensure the best educated and most qualified junior officers enter the naval service. The Academy must maintain the highest standards in academic disciplines and supporting infrastructure. Planned upgrades and replacements are vital in ensuring graduates are technologically prepared to serve in tomorrow's Fleet and Fleet Marine Force while supporting institutional accreditation and competitiveness with peer institutions.\n\n[P40A \/ A.  Universal Wireless Telecommunications System]: Provides upgrades of existing telecommunications system to enhance cellular and Wi-Fi coverage within the historic Bancroft Hall dormitory for midshipmen quality of life and personal safety benefits.  Existing mobile communications coverage within this 1.4 million square foot historic facility is inadequate to accommodate evolving midshipmen, staff and faculty needs.  The envisioned provider-neutral solution will include a distributed antenna enabling robust signal coverage for the benefit of all occupants.  FY 2013 follow-on extends cellular and Wi-FI coverage to academic buildings for enhancement of classroom and laboratory instruction as existing mobile communications coverage within these facilities is inadequate to accommodate evolving science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and cyber computing needs of midshipmen, faculty and staff.\n\n[P40A \/ B.  Primary Storage System Replacement]: Provides for IT hardware and software in support of the data storage simplification and redundancy for mission's execution and continuity.  The proposed replacement system will facilitate on-site back-up and recovery activities in maximizing enterprise system user availability.  Future periodic replacement will be required to maintain technological currency and meet increased storage demand.\n\n[P40A \/ D.  LAN Room Video Surveillance]: Provides for management and protection of the Academy's numerous distributed local area network equipment spaces.  The system will provide cameras for real-time and recorded playback of critical infrastructure locations to ensure a safe and secure enterprise computing environment.\n\n[P40A \/ F.  Backup System Replacement]: Provides for IT hardware and software to replace obsolete tape library.  The proposed replacement system will facilitate faster and more reliable backup of enterprise data using current technologies.\n\n[P40A \/ H.  NMR Spectrometer Replacement]: Replaces an existing Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data acquisition device acquired in FY 2004.  The device permits spectral analysis of a wide variety of chemical compounds in support of curriculum requirements.  The American Chemical Society guidelines specifically list an operational NMR spectrometer as a requirement for accreditation.\n\n[P40A \/ I.  Library Circulation System Replacement]: Provides upgrades to the existing library circulation, inventory and security system.  Provides more efficient use of staff time by permitting simultaneous processing of materials and automatically update system records without need for repeat data entry errors.  Replaces existing, obsolete, manual barcode system with industry-standard, distributed solution typically found in facilities of this type.\n\n[P40A \/ J.  Virtual Desktop Infrastructure]: Provides lifecycle replacement of outdated electronic classroom workstations and operating systems by standardizing content delivery through central hosting to reduce operating costs and information assurance risks.\n\n[P40A \/ K.  Advanced Computing Cluster Replacement]: Provides replacement of high-end computer cluster for midshipmen and faculty computational requirements in science and technology disciplines.  Applications supported include flow visualization, computer-aided design and computational fluid dynamics.  The server also provides central file back-up, software and communication services for numerous laboratories, classrooms and courses.  The computer will replace a device for which incremental upgrades will no longer be feasible due to intervening technological advancements.\n\n[P40A \/ N.  Bridge Simulator Upgrade]: Provides life-cycle upgrades to extend the useful life of two existing full-mission bridge simulator devices used for watchstanding training and qualification of midshipmen.  It is also used for demonstrations of ship handling and navigation learning points not otherwise possible to convey through existing underway laboratories (i.e. Yard Patrol Craft).\n\n[P40A \/ O.  Articulate Hub & Rotor Blade Assembly]: Provides for end-of-life replacement of wavemaker acquired in FY 1978.  The existing wavemaker is unable to produce the quality of waves required for academic instruction and research.  The replacement wavemaker will reduce the need for unplanned emergency repairs which jeopardize ongoing operations.\n\n[P40A \/ P.  Chromatography Replacement]: Provides physical apparatus for chemistry laboratory study of spectral series.  This capability will permit measurement and demonstration of chemical processes at the visible spectrum level critical to understanding of naval and other technologies.\n\n[P40A \/ Q.  Pelletron Accelerator Replacement]: Replaces an existing Pelletron Accelerator and associated support equipment acquired in FY 1988.  The device permits study and experimentation in the area of nuclear physics.\n\n[P40A \/ R.  Microfabrication Facility]: Provides capability to educate midshipmen in micro-fabrication technology through photolithography and with other techniques.  Equipment would be used to demonstrate metal deposition and surface micro-machining techniques, along with alignment and ultraviolet exposure of coated wafers for bulk silicon etching through wafer masking.  These capabilities are the foundation for semi-conductor, nana-system, and micro scale heat transfer topics in various engineering courses.  This will keep the academic curriculum current by providing an operational capability that allows midshipmen to conduct hands-on experiments in areas increasingly important to national defense.\n\n[P40A \/ S.  Voice Switch Upgrades]: Provides for IT hardware and software to achieve IPv6 capability for mission execution and continuity.  The proposed replacement system will meet the Navy's transition goal of maintaining technological currency.\n\n[P40A \/ T.  Mission System Host Platform]: Provides for replacement of IT hardware hosting information system applications meeting specific USNA requirements in academic, administrative, athletic, and professional areas.\n\n[P40A \/ U.  Coastal Engineering Tank Wavemaker Replacement]: Provides for end-of-life replacement of wavemaker acquired iin fiscal year 1978.  The existing wavemaker is unable to produce the quality of waves required for academic instruction and research.  The replacement wavemaker will reduce the need for unplanned emergency repairs which jeopardize ongoing operations.\n\n[P40A \/ V.  Auditorium Sound System Replacement]: Provides for lifecycle replacement of FY 2009 speaker cluster and sound system in heavily-used, multifunctional presentation and performance facility.  Delivers modern audio capabilites to meet diverse range of educational, professional, and athletic events hosted in the multi-purpose Alumni Hall facility.  The system provides capability of multi-directional sound propagation allowing audience members increased fidelity and comprehension of audio components.\n\n[P40A \/ W.  Microscale Thermal Transport Replacement]: Provides for replacement of physical apparatus for propulsion laboratory study of nano-technology based heat transfer and thermal sciences acquired FY 2010.   This capability permits measurement and demonstration of electromagnetic (thermal) processes at the nano-technology level critical to naval propulsion technology.\n\n[P40A \/ X.  Enterprise Network Upgrades]: Permits modular, phased upgrade, replacement, and modernization of the Academy's enterprise computing network to maintain currency with changing industry standards and user demands.  Provides for replacement of aging switches and routers used to direct data communication traffic across fiber optic cables to various places throughout the enterprise."
