            "val": "All of the funding in P-1 Line #43, U-2 Mods, was inadvertently loaded in P-1 Line #43, U-2 Mods.  If appropriated the the Air Force intends to execute the funding currently loaded in Line #43 on the U-2 Mod in this P-1 Line (#42).\n\nThe CIA established the Senior Year Program in 1955.  The program has evolved to include the airframes, engines, sensors, cameras, recorders, data links life support systems, test facilities and equipment.  The U-2S model airframes were constructed in the late 1980s, with the last aircraft rolling off the assembly line in 1989.  The U-2S provides global reconnaissance signals intelligence (SIGINT) and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) 24 hours a day, seven days a week in support of national and DoD worldwide missions.  The U-2 is currently deployed to forward operating locations (FOL) around the world.  \n\nIn 2012, the Air Force decided to retain the U-2 weapon system capability instead of retiring it.  Prior to 2012, the U-2 weapon system fell under the \"sunset clause\" IAW Title 10 U.S.C 2244a, Equipment Scheduled For Retirement Or Disposal: Limitation On Expenditures For Modifications, stating that modifications to any aircraft (i.e., a given tail number), weapon, or other item of equipment that the SECAF plans to retire or otherwise dispose of within five years after the date on which the modification would be completed, are prohibited.  Therefore, many required modifications to address diminishing manufacturing sources or vanishing vendor items were not accomplished.\n\nThe U-2 Program will continue to address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues to ensure continued operations.  Due to the age of the existing fleet, both diminishing manufacturing sources and vanishing vendor issues continue to drive modifications.  The Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) is an integral part of U-2 operations.  Therefore, the U-2 must evolve and upgrade to keep pace with the DCGS. \nFunding supports aircraft and payload modernization activities as described below.\n\nU-2 Aircraft Aircraft Update Block 20.1:  Funding supports aircraft modernization activities such as, but not limited to airframe modernization and sustainment, avionics tech refresh, navigation system upgrades, and engine modifications.   Aircraft modernization activities specifically address vanishing vendor items (VVI) or diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS), reduce operations and maintenance costs, mitigate any safety concerns, and increase capability to meet current and future threats. \n\nU-2 Payload Update Block 20.1:  Funding supports payload modernization and PMA type activities such as, but not limited to, Airborne SIGINT Payload (ASIP) swap kits, Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS) antenna procurement, Senior Year Electro-Optical Reconnaissance System (SYERS) spectral enhancement, electronic warfare system upgrades, Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) tech refresh, tactical data link, ASQ-230 wiring, and program office travel and administrative and advisory support.  Payload modernization activities specifically address VVI\/DMS, reduce operations and maintenance costs, increase operational reliability, and increase capability to meet current and future threats.\n\nThe current U-2 inventory includes 27 operational\/mission capable aircraft, and five (5) trainer aircraft.\n\nThis program has associated Research, Development, Test and Evaluation funding in PE 0305202F.\n\nNo FY2015 funding is requested.\n\nIn FY16, the AF may start divestiture."
