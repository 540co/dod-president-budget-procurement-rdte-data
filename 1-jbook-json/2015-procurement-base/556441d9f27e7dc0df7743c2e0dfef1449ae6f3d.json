Funds ensure alignment between Surface Learning Centers and Fleet Concentration Area training systems and fleet training requirements as dictated by Surface and Expeditionary Warfare Training Plan. Additionally, funds support ship on-board training curriculum for the purpose of maintaining perishable operator and maintenance skills.\n\n[P5 \/ TS004 Surface Training Device Mods]: TS004 Surface Training Device Mods]: TS004- SURFACE MINOR MODS\nModifications are required to meet safety standards, keep training systems compatible with equivalent changes made to fleet operational equipment, and to enhance training capabilities.\nThese modifications support the 300+ fielded Surface training systems."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "Program Growth \/ Justification for Increase from FY 14 to FY 15:\n\n1.1 Surface Minor Mods - Funds development and modernization of 10 systems and sustainment of 145 surface and expeditionary training systems in accordance with the results of CNO directed and OPNAV and Fleet sponsored studies from 2009 through 2013.  Specific studies of surface training systems include: Fleet Review Panel of Surface Force Readiness, Aegis Weapon System\/SPY Radar Readiness Task Force, LPD 17 Class Wholeness Task Force, MCM Readiness Task Force,  Navigation Wholeness  Study, OPNAV-sponsored Surface Engineering Training Wholeness Review,  Fleet Integrated Air and Missile Defense and Anti-Submarine Warfare Improvement Programs, Aegis Ashore, Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) and C5I training requirements documents, LCS Front End Analysis (FEA), DDG 1000 wholeness review,  LHD 8\/ LHA 6 Training Requirements Planning and Programming (TRPPM), CNSF manpower initiatives impact on readiness, and the Navy IG report on Computer Based Training (CBT).  The extensive inventory of training systems to support 16 classes of ships requires continual modernization and modification to ensure alignment with fleet systems while addressing technology obsolescence issues.  Increased funding is budgeted to modernize the following 10 systems:\n1. Anti-Submarine Tacitcal Air Controller (ASTAC) Simulation Upgrade\n2. Damage Control Wet Trainers Upgrades\/Refresh\n3. DDG 51 Machinery Control System Maintenance Trainer\n4. Multi-Mission Team Trainer Upgrades\/Lab Refresh\n5. Electrical Maintenance Training\n6. Air Conditionaing and Refrigeration (AC&R) Maintenance Training\n7. Deck System Equipment Training\n8. Marine Sanitation Devices\n9. LCAC Team Trainer Overhaul\/Upgrades \n10. Amphibious Boat Control Team Trainer\n\n1.6 Combined IAMD\/ASW Trainer (CIAT).  From the Aegis Weapon System\/SPY Radar Readiness Task Force, OPNAV-sponsored Fleet Integrated Air and Missile Defense and Anti-Submarine Warfare Improvement Programs, Aegis Ashore, Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) and C5I training requirements documents, one of the areas identified for long term investment was the requirement for a high fidelity integrated air and missile defense and anti-submarine warfare training capability.  Due to the cost prohibitive realities associated with development of ship high fidelity training systems, which currently meet only 60% of the CNO requirement for ship training systems to be commensurate with tactical system capability, this shore capability is being developed.  The CIAT will field in the Fleet Concentration Areas of San Diego, Yokosuka, Pearl Harbor, and Norfolk in support of program of record advanced warfare training.  This development effort begins in FY14 with the first trainer being developed for San Diego.  In FY15, the first trainer will be installed in San Diego and development and procurement will occur for the Yokosuka and Pearl Harbor trainers necessitating the $6.23M increase from FY14 to FY15.  Without the increased funding in FY15, installation and procurement of the trainers will be impacted resulting in delaying accurate and required training for integrated air and anti-submarine warfare weapon system operators.\n\n1.7 NTSP TTE\/TD Mods - Funds develop and modernize 16 surface and expeditionary training systems in multiple school houses in accordance with the results of CNO directed and OPNAV and Fleet sponsored studies, NTSP updates, and Technical Training Audits from 2009 through 2013.  One of the key items identified in the Fleet Review Panel of Surface Force Readiness, LPD 17 Class Wholeness Task Force, MCM Readiness Task Force,  Navigation Wholeness  Study, OPNAV-sponsored Surface Engineering Training Wholeness Review,  LCS Front End Analysis (FEA), DDG 1000 wholeness review,  and  LHD 8\/ LHA 6 Training Requirements Planning and Programming (TRPPM) analysis done by the Surface Warfare Enterprise was the outdated or lack of training equipment in the schoolhouses.  Based on this analysis the Program Growth of $16.2M  from FY 14 includes requirements identified in approximately 80  Navy Training System Plan updates and 35 Technical Training Course Audits.  This investment will  be for the procurement and installation of Training Equipment at Learning Centers to keep training courses in alignment with current configuration of equipment in the fleet.  Investment ensures Surface Warfare Training Continuums are capable of meeting training requirements directly supporting readiness for the following systems\/courses:\n1. Collection, Holding and Transfer (CHT)\n2. Controllable Pitch Propeller\n3. LPD 17 Class Smoke Ejection\n4. Damage Control\n5. Firefighting\n6. Fuel Oil Systems\n7. Anchoring, Mooring and Towing\n8. Amphibious Assault Vehicle Handling, Stowage and Support\n9. Handling and Stowing Boats and Small Craft\n10. Hull Outfitting Equipment\n11. Shipboard Crane Systems\n12. Underway Replenishment Systems\n13. CIN A-651-0064 Engineering Principles and Practices\n14. CIN A-651-0069 Controls, Governors, and Regulator Maintenance\n15. CIN A-651-0110 Senior Prop Engineering Course\n16. CIN A-4H-0157 Advanced Steam Course\n\n1.9 CSCS Modernization\/AEGIS capability Build (ACB) Training System.  The Aegis Weapon System\/SPY Radar Readiness Task Force, OPNAV-sponsored Fleet Integrated Air and Missile Defense and Anti-Submarine Warfare Improvement Programs, Aegis Ashore, Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) and C5I training requirements documents that there is training shortfall for procurement and installation of ACB TTE Simulation\/Stimulation at the ATRC Learning Site.  The current ATRC training systems utilize expensive and maintenance-intensive ruggedized shipboard equipment which is obsolete and unsupportable.  The $5.0M increase in FY15 (FY15 start) provides for hardware and software development and installation of trainers which leverage Combined IAMD\/ASW Trainer (CIAT) sim\/stim technology and equipment, thus reducing Total Ownership Cost (TOC).  Without this funding, existing training labs at ATRC will not be upgraded or maintained to provide accurate training and the required training lab for ACB Program of Record will not be developed.  Aegis operators and maintainers will not be trained on accurate systems which will directly impact fleet readiness."
