            "val": "The RT-240, Rough Terrain Container Handler (RTCH) moves, lifts, and stacks International Standard Organization (ISO) containers.  The RT-240 operates worldwide on multiple terrains, including sand, to lift and transfer ISO containers weighing up to 53,000 pounds.  The RT-240 has 4-wheel drive and is capable of fording 5 feet of salt water.  The RTCH is C-5 or C-17 air transportable and can be configured in minutes from loading mode to transportation mode.  Currently, the U.S. Army has over one million ISO containers in the Southwest Asia (SWA) Theater.  The RTCH is the critical element in handling all of these containers.  The RT-240 is equipped with an expandable 20 to 40 foot top handler capable of handling the new ISO family of 8X20 and 8X40 containers.  It is capable of stacking containers three high and can reach a container in a second row.  The RT-240 serves a vital need since it is necessary to stack containers in temporary storage areas, sort them by ultimate destination, and transfer the containers to appropriate modes of transport for onward movement.  A single trained RTCH operator can quickly and efficiently load or unload a convoy in minutes instead of hours.  This is important considering the RT-240 handles a large number of containers flowing through overseas ports, theater distribution centers, and forward support areas.  The RTCH is a Joint US Army, Navy, and Marine Corps acquisition program.  Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of the RTCH have included sales to the United Kingdom and Australia.  The RTCH system is a Critical Dual Use (CDU) system enabling and supporting Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations (i.e. Disaster Relief).  RTCH Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 873 systems."
