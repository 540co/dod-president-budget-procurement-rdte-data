Medical Treatment (MT) Vehicle: This platform will provide a protected surgical environment, with adequate lighting and accessible medical equipment. It will provide a capability for immediate medical care for one patient by a medical crew of four.\n3.  Medical Evacuation (ME) Vehicle: This platform will conduct ambulance type activities and provide casualty evacuation for up to four litter or six ambulatory patients, with a crew of three medical attendants.\n4.

The prime contractor awarded key subsystem and component level provider contracts early 2QFY2015. A formal start-of-work meeting took place 2QFY2015 and work commenced on the vehicle design. A Preliminary Design Review (PDR) occurred 15-18 June 2015. Approximately 30 artifacts were generated and delivered in support of PDR. Following successful completion of the PDR, the prime contractor commenced detailed design activities and began to order low risk hardware that have long lead times. The prime contractor operated in an Integrated Product Team (IPT) environment and used tools such as Earned Value Management and Technical Performance Measures to evaluate and report cost, schedule, and technical status."

The prime contractor will support team meetings and reviews and will report program progress through the use of Earned Value Management (EVM) and Technical Performance Measures (TPMs).  Based on successful completion of the PDR, activities have transitioned to detailed design of components and subsystems in FY2016. These detailed design efforts will be focused on integration of existing components into the AMPV chassis, which will be tailored to the five mission roles. Final prototype designs and related drawings will be completed early in FY2016. In addition, as nearly all of the subsystems that will be integrated into the prototype structures will be existing designs, most of the hardware at a component level is expected to be ordered in 2QFY2016. Integration of these components into subsystems will commence 3QFY2016 and will be mostly complete by 4QFY2016. Prototype final integration, assembly, and checkout will be initiated to allow full vehicle prototypes to begin to be delivered late 1QFY2017. In addition to prototype development and fabrication, the engineering work will be focused on the Critical Design Review (CDR), which will occur in 3QFY2016. All artifacts that support CDR will be developed and delivered to the government 60 days prior to the review. Approximately 50 artifacts are expected to be delivered in support of CDR. Government Furnished Material for the system prototypes, mainly consisting of Mission Equipment Packages and communication hardware, will be procured by 2QFY2016. Final builds for armor coupons and ballistic hull test articles will be completed to support live fire\/survivability testing in FY17."

The prime contractor will support the de-processing, functional testing, instrumentation, training, fielding and maintenance of the prototypes at government test sites. In addition, for each of the first 5 prototype vehicles, the prime contractor will conduct 1,500 miles of shakedown testing prior to beginning government run system level tests. Also related to the prototype vehicles, the prime contractor will deliver and manage System Support Packages (SSPs) that consist of the necessary spare parts required to facilitate government testing. From an engineering perspective, the prime contractor will make informed design changes to respond to hardware and software upgrades and CDD updates, as well as utilize knowledge gained from system level testing to update vehicle designs, as required. Any updates will be presented in an Interim Design Review (IDR), currently planned for early 2QFY2018. In addition, the Vehicle Tactical Integration Lab (VTIL) and the Computer Software Integration Lab (CSIL) will continue to be used to trouble-shoot any emerging issues and, if necessary, verify design updates. During FY2017, the final three software builds will be delivered. These builds are primarily expected to be clean-up builds that will resolve any problems uncovered during system level testing.  The prime contractor will perform significant work related to Logistics\/Product Support in FY2017. This will include an update to the Level of Repair Analysis (LORA), provisioning of repair parts, development of packaging information, training at test sites, and the validation of technical manual tasks in preparation for the Logistics Demonstration starting in 2QFY2018. Logistics related documentation to be completed by BAE in FY2017 includes the Logistics Demonstration Plan, System Demilitarization and Disposal Plan, Preservation and Storage of Unique Tooling, Core Logistics Assessment, Core Depot Assessment, Depot Source of Repair, and Analysis of Product Support Alternatives."
