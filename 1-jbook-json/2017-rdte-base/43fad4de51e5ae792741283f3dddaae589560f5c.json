The most significant increase effort includes: $2.550 million for the tri-annual license renewal of ArcSight. This aids in the safeguarding of MDA data by providing complete visibility into activity across the Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to include but not limited to: external threats such as malware and hackers; internal threats such as data breaches and fraud; risks from application flaws and configuration changes; and compliance pressures from failed audits. This software enables MDA to collect, analyze, and assess IT security, enterprise security and non-security events for rapid identification, prioritization and response."

            "val": "The BMDS Enabling Programs provide critical products and processes needed to combine element missile defense systems into a single, integrated and layered BMDS to provide new defensive capabilities and evaluate existing capabilities against the emerging threats. Specifically, the Enabling Programs:\n- Define BMDS architectures and functional requirements, conduct Analyses of Alternatives for the DoD, and provide engineering requirements, execution support, and pre- and post-mission analysis for BMD System tests\n- Provide validated models and simulations for BMD System assessment \n- Assess BMDS performance and deliver capabilities to the Warfighter\n- Provide multi-disciplinary security and intelligence support for BMDS acquisition, development, test, and deployment\n- Provide Information Management tools and products supporting the development of BMDS capabilities while safeguarding networks and critical program information\n- Evaluate quality, technical safeguards, and mission assurance effectiveness\n- Assess System ability to maintain integrity and superiority with advances in technology development \nThis Program Element includes support for discrimination improvement efforts, which aim to develop and field an integrated set of Element capabilities to improve BMDS effectiveness and resilience against the evolving threat.  The end result will be a BMDS architecture more capable of discriminating and destroying a re-entry vehicle with a higher degree of confidence, improving Warfighter shot doctrine and preserving inventory.  This effort encompasses Near-term, Mid-term, and Far-term discrimination improvements capability fielding.  The discrimination improvements require a coordinated effort between Systems Engineering, Ground-based Midcourse Defense (PE 0603882C), BMD Sensors (PE 0603884C), C2BMC (PE 0603896C), Aegis BMD (PE 0603892C) and Advanced C4ISR (PE 0603179C).\n\nMDA is conducting studies to determine optimal radar site locations for defense of the U.S. from Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs).  The locations would include a site for deployment of a long-range discrimination radar and a potential homeport for the Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX) on the East Coast of the United States.  The initial analysis will determine the operational areas where sensors could be placed to meet the sensor discrimination needs of the BMD system.  Once this analysis is complete MDA will begin development of site scoring criteria and, in the case of the SBX, assessments of transit time and time on station for candidate home port options.  MDA will then develop initial screening criteria for operations and maintenance.  This will be the basis for selection of at least three sites for more detailed examination, including environmental impact studies.  \n\nMD24 Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) defines required system-wide behavior, validates Element system designs, and verifies and assesses BMD System capability to defend the U.S. and its friends, allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attacks. SE&I develops technical roadmaps, knowledge points, and capability trades at the BMDS level to balance integration and capability improvement efforts. \n\nMT23 Enabling-Test provides BMDS test planning, execution and post-test assessment, and provides critical data for proving that missile defense works. \n\nMD28 Intelligence and Security integrates multiple technical intelligence disciplines, such as intelligence, counterintelligence, cyber security, RDA security, and threat engineering, to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to MDA and the BMDS and develop and implement strategies to mitigate those risks.\n\nMD30 Information Management Systems is a critical support element to MDA's RDT&E mission. This effort provides secure and affordable enterprise information capabilities in support of the Agency's global mission.  These IT functions consist of MDA secure communication networks, IT systems, special purpose processing nodes, operations and monitoring centers, and disaster recovery and continuity of operations requirements. These capabilities support the rapid deployment of the BMDS while complying with DoD initiatives of the Joint Information Environment (JIE) and the Unified Capabilities Framework to ensure MDA remains compatible with the DoD Information Network (DODIN).   \n\nMC30 Cyber Operations sustains MDA's DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program (DIACAP) and Controls Validation Testing (CVT) activities.  It also funds the MDA Security Operations Center (SOC), responsible for monitoring, managing, patching, and maintaining MDA network and core Information Technology (IT) services; issuing and tracking Technical Compliance Orders; and coordinating overarching Enterprise NetOps.   The MDA Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), funded in this project, monitors the classified and unclassified information technology MDA administrative IT networks and report vulnerabilities. The MDA CERT coordinates with U.S. Cyber Command to identify and implement network vulnerability updates and patches to comply with U.S. Cyber Command vulnerabilities identified for DoD networks.  The project also funds Information Assurance (IA) governance management and administrative management support, annual Agency-wide computer-based IA training and metrics reporting, implementation of Public Key Infrastructure and Enabling and Communications Security (COMSEC) related activities.\n\nMD31 Modeling and Simulation (M&S) develops system-level models, simulations, and environments as missile defense technologies continually advance and the threat changes, and evaluates performance of the Elements, Components, and overall BMD System in support of verification, validation and accreditation.  MDA's M&S program provides a cost effective means to assess and explore the performance space of the BMDS beyond what can be physically tested under current test range conditions and within the Agency's fiscal constraints. M&S conceptual simulation activities provide the capability to design and develop technologies to hedge against future missile threats.\n\nMC31 M&S Cyber Operations provides the network\/system certification and accreditation of M&S related information technology networks and systems necessary to comply with the Federal Information Security Management Act.  \n\nMD32 Quality, Safety, and Mission Assurance improves quality, safety, and mission assurance throughout the product life cycle of design, manufacturing, test and system operation, in order to achieve a safe and reliable BMD System.\n\nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to MDA functions and activities across the entire BMDS."

SE&I applies its technical expertise and tools across many disciplines and specialties to define, design, test and integrate the BMDS. SE&I develops technical roadmaps, knowledge points, and capability trades at the BMDS level to balance integration and capability improvement efforts. The SE&I workforce, including Industry and Contractor Support Services (CSS), also provides analysis, decision support and planning activities for real-world operations to the National Command Authority, Joint Staff, Military Services, Combatant Commanders, Operational Test Agencies, Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, Allies, and others. \n\nFundamental to the SE&I approach is development, coordination, and dissemination of fully vetted products at each stage of the engineering process. These products communicate key information such as: technical goals and objectives; design trades and resulting decisions to update system design and interface requirements; integration plans and schedules; test objectives that ensure the collection of data needed to anchor the system representative models and simulations and enable independent verification and validation; assessment of system performance based on ground and flight test results; and fielding plans. \n\nSE&I defines required system-wide behavior, validates Element system designs, and verifies and assesses system capabilities. The system engineering projects that accomplish these functions include:  Future Concepts and Planning; Requirements and Design; and System Level Verification and Assessment. Additional engineering efforts cross multiple stages of the system engineering process: Discrimination, BMDS Assessment, Engineering Analysis and Quick Response Team, Knowledge Centers, Risk Management, Anti-Tamper, Manufacturing and Producibility, and Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD). \n\nThe discrimination improvement effort will develop and field integrated Element capabilities to improve BMD System ability to identify lethal and non-lethal objects.  SE&I will perform BMDS performance analysis and requirements engineering activities to specify the BMDS requirements and interfaces to achieve the improved capability.  For Mid-term and Far-term SE&I will establish performance goals for the technology development phase; develop functional, performance, and interface requirements to address the Mid-term and Far-term threat sets.  SE&I will establish ground and flight test requirements for the Mid-term and Far-term phases, and generate threat data to support analysis and testing activities.\n\nThe SE&I Major Program Goals are: \n- Develop, design, test and integrate a layered BMDS that provides the required BMD performance \n- Provide system-level engineering support to the Elements, and lead collaborative cross-Element, cross-Component engineering\n- Lead the engineering required to achieve Enhanced Homeland Defense capability\n- Develop architectures and requirements to respond to the proliferation of short and medium range ballistic missiles\n- Provide a more effective missile defense capability for U.S. deployed forces, allies, and partners, and enhance homeland defense \n- Develop discrimination improvements for the Homeland and Regional Defense missions\n- As technical authority for IAMD, provide a consistent, disciplined systems engineering process using a multi-Service team to integrate Joint IAMD systems  \n- Provide technical direction to Element and Component developers and provide System-level forums to track, assess, and improve hardware and software reliability\n- Identify BMDS capabilities and limitations \n- Develop performance assessment requirements, verify BMDS performance through testing, and conduct assessments to form the basis for technical capability declarations in support of fielding decisions\n- Identify Critical Engagement Conditions and data required to develop the test campaigns to demonstrate BMDS performance \n- Define the test objectives necessary to anchor BMDS-level models and simulations, enable independent verification and validation\n- Identify System issues occurring in ground and flight tests and lead the effort to resolve them \n- Analyze architecture alternatives and new technologies to establish technical roadmaps for future capabilities\n- Ensure the BMDS is complementary to and interoperable with NATO and other theater systems \n- Provide detailed analysis to support MDA leadership and US policy decisions \n- Develop anti-tamper approaches to enable international fielding of the BMDS"

M&S provides the tools and framework required to prepare for and execute ground and flight tests, and perform post-test reconstructions.\n\nEngineering studies and analyses enable the allocation of test requirements to individual test events, design of test architectures, definition of target requirements, and generation of appropriate scenarios for ground and flight tests to collect data for model validation and system verification. With the support of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E), SE&I works with the Service Operational Test Agencies (OTA) to incorporate operational test requirements to ensure the incremental capability being transferred to the Warfighter will be operationally effective, suitable, and survivable. SE&I identifies and coordinates test objectives and ensures BMDS requirements are being met by the BMDS system under test. Systems Engineering plays a key role in BMDS test design and development by defining, allocating to test events, and tracking Critical Engagement Conditions (CECs) and Empirical Measurement Events (EMEs), as documented in the IMTP. The CECs and EMEs include Key Test Points (KTPs) allocated to test events to ensure the events will collect data to confirm proper system operation.  The data anchors system and element models and simulations, which will be used in all-digital simulations to characterize BMDS performance across the battle space, including areas where no live-fire-testing is performed. The digital M&S complement extensive flight tests and hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) ground tests, to directly support fielding decisions and BMDS deployed operations. \n\nSE&I ground test (GT) responsibilities include BMDS performance sensitivity analysis; scenario design, focused on the production of an optimized set of GT scenarios; risk reduction analysis to mitigate data collection risks supporting test objectives; GT architecture certification analysis supporting test readiness reviews; and analysis of event test results.  SE&I flight test (FT) responsibilities include planning and analysis of FT pre-mission digital and HWIL scenarios focused on exploring BMDS Flight Test performance boundaries related to the day of flight test scenario while surfacing performance risk; analytical support for flight test CONOPS development and range safety analysis; mission analysis support during FTs; conducting extensive post-mission analysis; and developing event analysis reporting products. These products support senior leaders' decisions on BMDS development and evolution and underpin BMDS capability declarations that provide new capabilities to the Warfighter. \n\nSE&I supports pre-mission predictions for system level flight tests using the test framework set up with HWIL and digital models of the BMDS configuration for each test. This provides confidence in readiness for flight test execution by predicting BMDS performance and exercising element interfaces. It also ensures the flight test will collect the required data to support system analysis and assessments and Element and System Post-Flight Reconstruction (SPFR) objectives. SPFRs use HWIL and M&S to replicate the day of flight for the BMDS configuration, including the environmental conditions and target dynamics observed in the test. They increase confidence in the System and element M&S by anchoring the results to the real world event, with emphasis on the performance parameters allocated to the M&S. \n\nReliability, Availability and Maintainability data collected through BMDS test events increases confidence in the predicted performance of the BMDS. SE&I documents abnormal system behavior observed during System tests and alerts MDA to issues with test article reliability. SE&I leads test failure review boards, identifies data collection shortfalls, and reallocates objectives to future test events as needed until all required model validation data is collected. The Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective Action System provides a framework to investigate test failures and anomalies and identify solutions that will ultimately improve BMDS performance and reliability. \n\nThe distinct capabilities of MDA`s M&S systems and products provide the BMDS, the Warfighter, and the OTA with an evaluation capability for individual components and for the overall M&S system-of-systems. MDA validates and accredits system-level models and simulations by anchoring them to real-world events to support accurate and comprehensive assessments of the BMDS. M&S development activities focus on the model and simulation frameworks, BMDS Element models, and core truth modeling (e.g., threat, phenomenology, lethality, and environment). Quality M&S systems and products contribute to the success of the missile defense program and help prove BMDS technologies work. \n\nMDA M&S System and product testing is based on the integrated, comprehensive, and phased test program outlined in MDA`s IMTP. Within the construct of the IMTP, Element-unique M&S systems, subsystems, and components are tested as part of their respective development and integration, a necessary precursor to conducting BMD System-level M&S testing (e.g., integrated ground test, performance\/technical assessment venues). Resources for the planning, design, execution and management of this testing are provided in accordance with the BMDS Test Policy, as listed in the most current version of the IMTP."

                            "val": "Major program goals for the Intelligence and Security team are: \n  -- Ensure the Intelligence Community (IC) understands and fulfills MDA's current and future prioritized intelligence requirements; advocate BMDS test support intelligence requirements; and maintain regular interactions with the IC. \n  -- Continue the federated approach of supporting MDA by leveraging available National and DoD Counterintelligence resources.  Ensure counterintelligence products and services are fully integrated into all RDT&E programs and activities to protect classified information and critical technologies and to support and protect MDA and BMDS personnel, facilities, information and activities. \n  -- Consistently and comprehensively define cybersecurity systems engineering requirements for Continental United States (CONUS) and non-CONUS based BMDS assets. Identify cybersecurity systems engineering and infrastructure intelligence requirements to focus IC collection, analysis and production to target MDA\/BMDS cyber vulnerabilities. Incorporate cybersecurity engineering requirements into the BMDS systems engineering process.\n-- Provide cross-Agency acquisition security oversight and support for the identification and protection of Critical Program Information (CPI), and evaluation and implementation of developing Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) requirements.  Provide physical security support for BMDS weapons\/sensor system deployments, including Foreign Military Sales.  Implement MDA's information security and declassification programs.  Strengthen Test and Operations Security (OPSEC) support across the Agency.\n\nThe Security and Intelligence Project captures five specific areas:  Intelligence; Counterintelligence; Cybersecurity Engineering; Research, Development, and Acquisition (RDA) Security; and Threat Systems Engineering. Collectively, these efforts provide critical information regarding threat ballistic missile system capabilities; protect personnel, activities, and technology from espionage and terrorism; and identify and mitigate BMDS system vulnerabilities. \n\n1) The Intelligence Requirements Program furnishes highly classified intelligence on foreign threat ballistic missile systems to the missile defense community. This program provides a clearing house for MDA's requirements to be presented to the IC for collection, analysis and production. The Intelligence Requirements Office registers MDA's requirements with the IC, which provides data to be disseminated and archived in the MDA Intelligence Knowledge Base.  The intelligence and threat changes are provided to the MDA System Engineer, who uses the information to reduce risk and improve BMDS performance against the evolving threat. This enables MDA Program Managers to achieve a sufficiently accurate understanding of the threat environment to respond to relevant capabilities of immediate importance, make informed decisions, and invest limited resources on countering the most significant aspects of potential adversary capabilities. Other aspects of Intelligence Requirements allow MDA to gain access to and leverage unique IC capabilities, many of which are highly classified and require expertise to exploit.\n\n2) The Counterintelligence (CI) Program undertakes defensive CI activities as part of an integrated DoD\/National effort to detect and neutralize foreign intelligence collection efforts, espionage and International terrorist activities directed against MDA personnel, information, facilities, and activities, or against U.S. National Security.\nPursuant to DoD Directive O-5240.02 (Counterintelligence) and other DoD CI policy issuances, the MDA CI Program:\n  -- Conducts CI investigations, including initial inquiries into reported or suspected clandestine relationships between MDA personnel and agents of a foreign power or relationships between MDA personnel and individuals associated with international terrorist organizations;\n  -- Conducts CI Collection Activities (CCA) to acquire information about the capabilities, intentions, and activities of foreign powers, organizations, or persons who engage in espionage, terrorism, sabotage, subversion, and clandestine intelligence activities against the United States, DoD and MDA. This includes establishing liaison relationships with U.S. and host-nation intelligence, CI and law enforcement organizations and debriefing MDA foreign travelers;\n  -- Conducts CI analysis and production by performing research and analysis to produce assessments, analytical reports, threat advisories and other products to keep MDA apprised of current or emerging foreign intelligence concerns and international terrorism threats to MDA personnel, information, facilities and activities worldwide;  \n  -- Performs defensive CI activities, including CI Awareness Training.  Provides specialized on-site support for MDA Special Access Programs (SAP), RDA programs, flight tests, and fielding\/deployment activities worldwide to protect CPI, critical BMDS components, and sensitive SAP technologies\/capabilities from foreign intelligence entity targeting, collection or compromise; and\n  -- Ensures MDA's Insider Threat program is compliant with the minimum standards established by Executive Order 13587 (White House Memorandum on National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs) and DoD Counterintelligence Policies.\n\n3) The Cybersecurity Engineering Program provides coherent cybersecurity systems engineering policy and guidance to BMDS system design and acquisition, enhancing BMDS resiliency against existing and emerging cyber threats.  It develops and coordinates near-term and long-term engineering changes to the BMDS that advance MDA's ability to counter cyber threats posed by our adversaries. To fulfill this role, the BMDS Cybersecurity Engineering program works with Intelligence Requirements and Counterintelligence to obtain a comprehensive picture of the overall cyber threat for impacts to the BMDS design; identifies mitigation strategies and maps them to established National Security Systems and DoD policies; and then influences the design by:\n  -- Identifying updates to the Core Standards and Requirements to implement Defense-in-Depth within planned development cycles (Builds); \n  -- Providing oversight, coordination and management of cybersecurity technical requirements development and policy-mandated responsibilities;   \n  -- Coordinating evaluation of cybersecurity capability during BMDS tests; and\n  -- Assessing the validated cyber threat intelligence for impact to the BMDS design. \nTo fulfill mission requirements, the program interfaces with relevant Cybersecurity Systems Engineering experts to assess requirements, documentation and cybersecurity system design and assessment criteria. \n\n4) RDA Security develops and implements policy for, and manages the MDA Information, Acquisition, System Protection, Declassification, Security Matrix, and Test and OPSEC programs to enable the acquisition, testing, development, and fielding of BMDS capabilities. RDA Security:\n  -- Manages the Agency-wide Information Security (INFOSEC) program, which includes: conducting annual INFOSEC reviews; executing the Security Manager program; providing INFOSEC training for marking, classifying, and protecting classified and controlled unclassified information; performing  security reviews for all Congressional, Government Accountability Office (GAO), budget, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and Public Release actions; supporting the development and coordination of Security Classification Guides (SCGs); and overseeing MDA's collateral classification management program;\n  -- Supports program offices by identifying CPI and critical components, analyzing risk, and recommending security measures to protect CPI and the BMDS supply chain;  \n  -- Manages the Industrial Security and Acquisition Security programs to develop Contract Security Classification Specifications (DD-254s) and security content for all applicable MDA contracts and research initiatives;\n  -- Provides planning support for BMDS development, test, and deployments by coordinating security requirements for BMDS assets internal to MDA and with the Combatant Commanders (CCMDs) and Services.  Develops and coordinates BMDS and site security infrastructure requirements and designs in accordance with DoD direction to protect critical BMDS assets; and\n -- Conducts the MDA Declassification Program in compliance with Executive Order 13526 (Classified National Security Information), which requires mandatory review of 25 year-old missile defense documents to ensure classified and sensitive unclassified information is not inadvertently released into the public domain.\n\n5) The Threat Systems Engineering effort defines adversary capabilities required for BMDS design and development, and maintains and updates the Agency-wide threat documentation to ensure the threat parameters used for BMD System performance predictions, analyses, design, verification, and assessment are correct and consistent. Threat Systems Engineering also provides, develops, coordinates, and baselines targets and countermeasures requirements to define target capabilities that support BMDS flight test objectives. Threat Systems Engineering:\n  -- Defines the BMDS threat space and supports threat space allocation to specific BMDS capability increments;\n  -- Guides missile requirements development, planning, and accreditation for BMDS ground tests and digital simulations;\n  -- Supports development of target system specifications and guides targets requirements development, planning, and certification for BMDS flight tests;  \n  -- Analyzes flight test target performance relative to threat intelligence assessments to support target system verification and certification;\n  -- Conducts verification and validation to ensure threat missile models meet specifications and are consistent with intelligence assessments at established cut-off dates; and  \n  -- Produces threat models and scenario data for BMDS development events and establishes threat consistency across the BMDS and Elements."

Information management systems are critical to the day-to-day functions of MDA personnel to communicate (classified and unclassified) with each other, Congress, senior DoD and other U.S. government agency personnel, CCMDs, NATO partners, and other industry partners. Communication among these organizations facilitates the MDA mission of developing and fielding an integrated BMDS to defend the United States, our deployed forces, allies, and friends against all ranges of enemy ballistic missiles in all phases of flight. \n\nMDA information management systems capabilities support rigorous missile defense testing and facilitate the development of technologies to guard against evolving missile threat. Communications are vital for missile defense to continue a viable homeland defense against rogue threats and to provide the integration required to defend deployed forces, allies, and friends against theater threats. The management systems consist of MDA secure communication networks, IT systems, data centers, operations and monitoring centers which are vital to support the strategic mission of the Agency and necessary to meet disaster recovery and continuity of operations requirements. This infrastructure is required to sustain access to the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), Non secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET), MDA classified and unclassified networks, classified and unclassified video teleconferencing services, test and business knowledge data centers, the Defense Research Engineering Network (DREN). These mission critical functions provide for the efficient operation and safeguarding of all agency information in locations supporting MDA around the world. \n\nThis project funds IT, mission critical functions, providing for the efficient operation and safeguarding of Agency information in compliance with DoD policies and in keeping with the President's declaration on 29 May 2009, \"cyber threat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation\". \n\nProject MD30 was realigned into the following seven inter-agency mission critical IT services and the associated plans to align with the Federal Information Technology Shared Services Strategy. \n\n1. End User Support \nCovers licensing and sustainment of desktops, laptops, and associated hardware and software, printing and copy services, file and directory services, user authentication, and help desk support for break-fix actions. \n2. Unified Communications\nSupports leased communications (classified and unclassified wide area networks, metropolitan area networks, and local area networks), telecommunications (local and long distance telephone services and secure and non-secure mobile and desktop telephony devices), management, engineering, systems integration, operations, maintenance, and technical support services. Unified Communications also includes sustainment of Video Teleconferencing (VTC) hardware\/software, and conference room scheduling, BlackBerrys and wireless services, instant messaging and collaboration, private branch exchange switches maintenance, unclassified desktop\/laptop integrated audio\/video collaboration services, secure Telepresence suites and secure mobile cell phones. \n3. Business Automation Services\nProvides, in accordance with the Clinger Cohen Act and Defense Business Systems Investment Management Process, for the licensing and sustainment of DoD business enterprise architecture approved applications. This function ensures that MDA business applications meet the interoperable defense business solutions requirements for federal accounting, financial management, and reporting requirements \n4. Portal and Data Services \nEnables knowledge and information sharing across MDA. This service includes operations and maintenance of the unclassified and classified MDA Knowledge Online portals and associated storage, and is also responsible for records management solutions, and privacy and civil liberties compliance and reporting. \n5. Network and Infrastructure Services \nIncludes operations and sustainment of MDA classified and unclassified networks and data centers. Ensures DoD compliant delivery, oversight and performance monitoring of IT systems that enable, secures IT systems access, server and storage capacity management, and communications security status. Also supports Disaster Recovery and Continuity of Operations rehearsals,  network hardware break\/fix and end-of-life replacement. \n6. Information Technology (IT) Planning and Solutions\nProvides IT project planning and management, life-cycle asset management, enterprise architecture planning and documentation, architecture change and configuration management, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and DoD IT compliance tracking and reporting."

This helps safeguard MDA data by giving complete visibility into activity across the IT infrastructure-including external threats such as malware and hackers, internal threats such as data breaches and fraud, risks from application flaws and configuration changes, and compliance pressures from failed audits.

The IT Roadmap specifically addresses the need to improve Cybersecurity.  It states that DoD networks are under constant attack from cybersecurity threats launched from various sources.  MDA must meet the National Command Authority Directives for rapid deployment of the BMDS while complying with the key principles of the Cybersecurity standards to ensure MDA remains a secure member of the DoD Information Network (DODIN).\n\nDoD Instruction 8500.01 \u201cCybersecurity\u201d issued in March 2014, requires continuous monitoring, data analysis, reporting and incident mitigation of DoD classified and unclassified, mission, test and administrative networks.  To comply with the Instruction, MDA must implement a multi-tiered cybersecurity risk management capability to protect critical BMD data and systems from rapidly evolving internal and external threats.    \n\nThe issuance of DoD Instruction 8510.01, \u201cRisk Management Framework (RMF) Information Technology\u201d in March 2014 requires additional resources to implement, manage, monitor and report as a result of a thirty five percent increase in controls (237 controls with 817 enhancements).   DoD 8510.01 also states that \u201cresources for implementing the RMF must be identified and allocated as part of the Defense planning, programming, budgeting, and execution process.\u201d  The Controls must be tested on all IT supporting research, development, test and evaluation and DoD-controlled IT operated by a contractor or other entity on behalf of DoD and reported.   \n\nThe Cyber Operations budget project in the Enabling Program Element is executed by the MDA Chief Information Officer who is the Agency Authorizing Official (AO) for MDA Administrative information technology systems.  The project provides funds to sustain the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and Controls Validation Testing (CVT) activities, analysis of validation results, risk assessments and reviews of proposed Program Manager\/Information Systems Security Officer (PM\/ISSO) Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) for the MDA mission, test and administrative systems.  It maintains the Certification and Accreditation (C&A) data repository, capturing the RMF documentation (artifacts, validation results, and Cybersecurity Risk Assessment results, and Authorizing Official (AO) accreditation decisions) and POA&M on all MDA information systems.  It support the monitoring and tracking of Cybersecurity mitigations detailed in IT security POA&Ms.  Activities include preparation of C&A documentation and accreditation recommendations to the MDA PM\/ISSO and AO.  Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) team actions ensure the availability, integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation of the MDA mission, test and administrative systems.  Activities in the Project are necessary to comply with FISMA. \n\nThis project funds the MDA Security Operations Center (SOC), responsible for monitoring, managing, patching, and maintaining MDA network and core IT services; issuing and tracking Technical Compliance Orders; and coordinating overarching Enterprise NetOps. The SOC provides the network security operations centers and supporting processes to protect and defend BMDS and the MDA Enterprise information and information systems.  \n\nThe MDA Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), funded in this project, monitors the classified and unclassified information technology MDA administrative IT networks and report vulnerabilities.  The MDA CERT coordinates with U.S. Cyber Command to identify and implement network vulnerability updates and patches to comply with U.S. Cyber Command vulnerabilities identified for DoD networks.\n\nThe project funds IA governance management and administrative management support, annual Agency-wide computer-based IA training and metrics reporting, implementation of Public Key Infrastructure and Enabling and COMSEC related activities."

MDA's M&S Program assists the development and acquisition of the BMDS by providing: M&S system and product planning, development, integration, and operation; threat model development, verification, and analysis; and integration and deployment of MDA's Distributed BMDS real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop (HWIL) and digital M&S simulation capabilities. \n\nMDA's M&S program is essential to ensuring missile defense capabilities are affordable and effective. MDA's M&S program provides a cost effective means to assess and explore the performance space of the BMDS beyond what can be physically tested under current test range conditions and within fiscal constraints. Through conceptual simulation activities, M&S provides the capability to design and develop technologies to hedge against future missile threats. These efforts require close coordination with the DoD, Joint Staff, Military Services, Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Operational Test Agencies (OTAs), MDA Program Elements, and the Intelligence Community. \n\nIn response to a Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) BMDS Assessment Report, M&S has developed and is executing Corrective Action Plans. Key tasks include:\n- Ensure that future M&S architectures are composable and flexible, and simplify the integration process to conserve resources and improve capabilities. \n- Ensure that future M&S architectures incorporate and require the use of consistent \u201ctruth\u201d representations (environmental factors, threat simulations, etc.).\n- Improve cross-organizational system engineering processes to optimize requirements generation and ensure the inclusion of all stakeholders.\n- Develop refined M&S accreditation criteria between MDA and the OTA. \n\nThe M&S objective is to evolve the various systems and products to incrementally improve the fidelity of MDA's M&S representations to match, as appropriate, the real world performance of the BMDS and meet Warfighter and Agency needs. In particular, MDA's M&S systems and products provide analysis and decision-making and planning capabilities for Real-World Operations in support of the National Command Authority, Joint Staff, Military Services, NATO, CCMDs, OTAs, Director of Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E), and Allies. Models and simulations are tailored to the specific needs of the Agency's test events and to match BMDS components in their various stages of development, ranging from low-to-medium fidelity analyses supporting concept definitions studies, to high-fidelity models used to support engineering level activities. \n\nMDA's M&S mission has relied on the use of two simulation frameworks to execute requirements to support various stakeholder applications such as Ground Tests, Flights Tests and digital performance assessments.  The Single Stimulation Framework (SSF) has supported all HWIL stakeholder applications, while the Digital Simulation Architecture (DSA) was used to support all Digital stakeholder applications.  MDA established requirements for the Objective Simulation Framework (OSF) to move towards a single simulation framework that support all MDA M&S stakeholder applications:  HWIL, digital, and hybrid configurations.  OSF will provide a composable simulation framework that promotes significant reuse of authoritative, community-validated truth models and is extensible to facilitate integration of new models as they evolve.  OSF threat scenarios and simulated BMDS operating environments will allow assessment of the BMDS capabilities to support various agency objectives and decisions.  In addition to supporting BMDS system assessments, OSF will support CCMDs by delivering a framework that provides the BMDS operational crews and command staffs with the capability to work together to exercise a spectrum of offensive and defensive operations, as well as a venue for the operational community to experiment with new Concepts of Operation and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures. \n\nThe Core Truth Modeling program provides consistent and common Phenomenology, Lethality, and Environment models, and threat capabilities for Agency M&S venues. Phenomenology models address missile hard body visible and infrared signatures, as well as the plume produced by the missile engines. Lethality models represent the impact of the BMDS missile kill vehicles (i.e. GBI, SM-3, THAAD) on reentry vehicles.  Lethality results include percentage of destruction and the direction and speed of debris fragments. Environment modeling provides a representation of natural and man-made endo and exo-atmospheric conditions (e.g., rain, wind, sea state) for simulations.\n\nThe Threat Modeling Center (TMC) uses all-source intelligence products to produce credible, high resolution threat models and simulation media to support analysis, development, test, and assessment of the defense of the U.S., deployed forces, and allies against ballistic missile attacks.  The threat models are used to produce accurate kinematic threat trajectories and signature data (radar cross-section (RCS), hardbody infrared (IR), and  plume IR) of ballistic missiles and air breathing threats to drive the M&S tools of the missile defense community, and  enable design, verification, and assessment of the BMDS and associated components' concepts and requirements. BMDS simulation events use common threat data to prove the performance of the BMDS. \n\nMDA's M&S capabilities, systems and products are in use throughout the BMDS and provide the Warfighter and OTAs the capability to evaluate both the BMDS and individual components. MDA validates and accredits system-level models and simulations by anchoring them to ground and flight test events to support accurate and comprehensive assessments of the BMDS. MDA bases M&S system and product testing on an integrated, comprehensive, and phased test program as outlined in MDA's IMTP. Within the construct of the IMTP, MDA Element-unique M&S systems, subsystems, and components are tested as part of their respective development and integration, a necessary precursor to conducting BMD System-level M&S testing (e.g., integrated ground test, performance\/technical assessment venues). Resources for the planning, design, execution and management of this testing are provided in accordance with the BMDS Test Policy, as listed in the most current version of the IMTP.\n\nMDA's M&S program also supports Allied\/Coalition Partner cooperative activities, real-world pre- and post-flight launch analyses, and the Israeli Cooperative Programs."
