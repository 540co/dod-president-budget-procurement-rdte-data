The program also funds development and acquisition of Operational Test Command's (OTC) major field instrumentation.  Requirements for instrumentation are identified through a long range survey of project managers, Research Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs), and Battle Laboratories developing future weapon systems and the test programs that support these systems.  Army testing facilities are also surveyed to determine major testing capability shortfalls."

Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP), was increased by $23.090 million to continue Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) based on modifications in FY 2016 for the Fly-out and Close-in Radars systems in preparation for replacement of equipment at Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Redstone Arsenal Center (RTC), White Sands Test Center (WSTC), and Yuma Test Center (YTC). Real Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA), also known as Integrated Live Virtual Constructive Test Environment (ILTE), was increased by $7.000 million to continue the development of hardware, software, interfaces, and new capabilities to ensure RTCA\/ILTE requirements for upcoming operational tests are satisfied.

These projects are technically demanding, state-of-the-art, unique instrumentation assets or suites to meet the technology shortfalls, and generally result from development programs managed by a professional project management team.  \n\nElectromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) Electromagnetic Radiation Effects (EMRE) Systems Modernization will upgrade equipment at the WSMR EMRE site where E3 testing is performed to evaluate survivability and vulnerability of military systems.  Project will upgrade and replace signal transmitters, refurbish an anechoic test chamber, replace data acquisition equipment and install a new turntable to support test items. Nuclear Effects Test Capabilities Modernization acquires and upgrades Special Test Equipment for nuclear facilities located at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR).  These acquisitions and upgrades include the Pulse Current Injection Simulator, Prompt Gamma Simulator, Gamma Range Facility, Linear Electron Accelerator (LINAC), Semi-Conductor Test Lab, Electromagnetic Pulse and the Solar Furnace. Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System (CRIIS) Objective Program provides precision location instrumentation which will significantly increase the T&E ranges' capability to meet the test instrumentation needs of the tri-service range users.  Test Network Modernization will upgrade existing test data networks to ensure infrastructures are capable of providing reliable and secure transport of data and communications for ATEC test activities.  Applied Environments Modernization program will upgrade antiquated Environmental labs for climatic and dynamic testing with new cascade refrigeration units, climatic chambers, vibration test systems, x-ray cameras, a real-time radiography system and full spectrum solar lights. Telemetry Systems Modernization program will upgrade\/replace mobile and fixed site telemetry equipment and telemetry data processing equipment thereby gaining spectrum efficiency at Redstone Test Center (RTC), Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) and Yuma Proving Ground (YPG).  Future Wireless Network program will procure and integrate wireless network technologies across ATEC test activities which will provide near real-time data collection support for Developmental Test and Operational Test events.  Robotics\/UAS Instrumentation Suite to develop and procure instrumentation for testing controlled and autonomous ground and aerial robotic systems.  System of Systems Cooperative Engagement Test Infrastructure (SCETI) for the development of systems to conduct systems level Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) testing for both aircraft and ground systems in a distributed environment."

Requirements for instrumentation are identified through a long range survey of project managers, Research Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs), and Battle Laboratories developing future weapon systems and the test programs that support these systems.\n\nProjects are designated as a major test program based on their visibility, assessed relative technical risk (medium-high), schedule risk, cost (greater than $1.5 Million per year or $7.5 Million for the total project) and applicability to other mission areas or services.  These projects are technically demanding, state-of-the-art, unique instrumentation assets or suites to meet the technology shortfalls, and generally result from development programs managed by a professional project management team.\n\nDirector Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) annual report to Congress identified shortfalls in the Army\u2019s abilities to create realistic operational environments.  The Integrated Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) Test Environment project will address multiple shortfalls identified by DOT&E.  ILTE will deliver a system of systems to provide ar Real-Time Casualty Assessment and instrumentation suite (RTCA) that delivers a high fidelity, realistic, real-time capability to measure hardware and personnel performance in modern combat environments.  ILTE will enable testing under tactical conditions for small and large-scale operations while integrating network operations and effects in support of the Army Equipment Modernization Plan.  ILTE also allows the U.S. Army to test all Current-to-Future, weapon systems in a realistic operational environment.  ILTE will transition Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) developed performance enhancements and technology upgrades to the operational test command, control, and communications, communications network, weapons system interfaces, vehicle and dismounted-troop kits and peripherals, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), encryption components, and integrates operational realistic digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools.  These tools will collect, store and analyze data from the digital battlefield.  Improvements will enable the ILTE system of systems to measure and record accrued damage, levels of exposure, effects of countermeasures, evasive action, and instrument threat vehicles.  This capability is required by the operational test community to integrate digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools into the Network Integration Evaluation (NIE), M1, M2, Stryker, and Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), AH-64E, Gray Eagle and other operational tests."

The acquisition of modern instrumentation radar systems will provide the Army critical testing data essential for the development of complex next generation technology and advanced system capabilities.  RRRP provides the test centers with improved radar resolution, sensitivity, accuracy, clutter suppression, and reliability.  The anticipated solution for the program requirements is a modular open architecture system consisting of four primary items: a long range radar (LRR), a medium range radar (MRR), a short range radar (SRR), and a radar operations console (ROC).  The resulting system will not only reduce operation and sustainment costs for the ranges, but improve data collection, thus enhancing development of Army systems being tested at these ranges. The current fleet of instrumentation radars located at ATC, RTC, WSTC, and YTC has become antiquated to the extent that they are not able to support the test needs of the test centers.\n\nFY 17 Base RDT&E dollars in the amount of $26.333 million funds the development, software engineering, and testing of replacement radars.\n\nPrior development effort was funded in APE 664759 984.
