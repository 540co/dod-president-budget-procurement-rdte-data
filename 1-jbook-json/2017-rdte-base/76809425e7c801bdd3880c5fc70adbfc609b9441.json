This legislation (Title 10 U.S. Code, Section 2350) authorizes funds to significantly improve U.S. and allied conventional defense capabilities by leveraging the best defense technologies, eliminating costly duplication of R&D efforts, accelerating the availability of defense systems, and promoting US and allied interoperability or commonality.  These funds will not be used for government civilian salaries, permanent construction, or spent overseas.  This program element funds the implementation of Air Force ICR&D agreements in (1) Basic Research (2) Applied Research (3) Advanced Technology Development (4) Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (5) System Development and Demonstration and (6) RDT&E Management Support.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Candidate projects are reviewed against USAF goals, DoD objectives, and warfighter needs prior to being approved.  An international agreement defining project objectives, responsibilities and costs is required prior to release of funds.  To obtain these funds and ensure service commitment, projects are selected from existing or new RDT&E programs funded in the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP).  Project offices must show matching funds and contributions from associated program elements and equitable allied funding.  As appropriate, funding responsibility for out-year requirements and follow-on efforts are transferred to the project office and associated program elements.
