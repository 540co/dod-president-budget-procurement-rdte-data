In turn, universities need to purchase the instrumentation and take delivery before any billings are generated. It frequently takes several months for delivery and billing to be completed.

Since the MURI program funds academic researchers, execution of the efforts typically ramps up during the summer academic break months. MURI projects make significant contributions to Navy and DoD objectives by; speeding up scientific programs by cross-fertilization of ideas, hastening the transition of basic research to practical applications, and training students in cross-disciplinary approaches to science and engineering research of importance to DoD. MURI is a five year program.\n\n\nThe increase in funding from FY 2015 to FY 2016 reflects the increased number of topics\/awards in FY 2016.  The FY 2017 reduction reflects fewer topics\/awards in coordination with OSD."

Example metrics include extending the life of Thermal\nBarrier Coatings for transition to the Enterprise and Platform Enablers Future Naval Capability program. It is projected that the life time of Thermal Barrier Coating on\nTurbine Blades can be doubled.
