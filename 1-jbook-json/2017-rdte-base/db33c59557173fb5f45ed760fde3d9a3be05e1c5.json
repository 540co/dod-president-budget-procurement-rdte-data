            "val": "This program element contains two active projects [project 673318, Product Data System Modernization (PDSM), and project 675042, Logistics Application Logistics Integration (LALI)].\n\nProject 673318: PDSM funds modifications to the Enhanced Technical Information System (ETIMS) Enterprise, which supports Air Force Technical Order management, storage and distribution critical to depot maintenance activities. ETIMS activities include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and program execution to include Nuclear Weapons Related Material (NWRM) technical data requirements.\nNote: In FY 2016, PE 0708611 Support Systems Development, Project 673318, Product Data Systems Modernization efforts transferred to PE 0708610F, Logistics Information Technology (Log IT), Project 675207 to align with the Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS) modification efforts funded within the Log IT PE.\n\nProject 675042: LALI includes funding for Logistics, Installations and Mission Support - Enterprise View (LIMS-EV) and F-35 User IT Data Exchange Service (UIDES).\n\nLogistic, Installations and Mission Support - Enterprise View (LIMS-EV) implements Business Intelligence(BI) and Decision Support(DS) solutions and includes transitioning to a common Information Technology(IT) hosting environment and development of mobile infrastructure.  The AF must transform its logistics business processes and transition away from using numerous stovepipe systems and process flows that execute the same analysis and decision support tasks.  Eliminating process redundancies across the logistics enterprise will enable the AF to execute more efficient, cost-effective and integrated logistics in the long term. Leveraging emerging technology to enhance existing capabilities and developing a mobile solution satisfies current and future needs of the enterprise. LIMS-EV funding supports Business Intelligence (BI) and decision support development capability used by senior leaders and war fighters to access integrated information from multiple logistics and operational source systems. LIMS-EV funding will extend current BI capabilities to provide configurable alerting, predictive\/what-if analysis, mobile applications and further integration of support equipment, vehicle, supply, commodities and components (engines, landing gears, fuel, etc.) to increase weapons systems availability and Total Asset Visibility (TAV) and migrates the LIMS-EV functionality from the retiring Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF) infrastructure to a an approved Joint Information Environment\/Common Computing Environment.\n\n\nFY2016 Plan \n\n1) LIMS-EV Vehicle View 5.2 - migrate the legacy data sources from the Online Vehicle Information Management System to Defense Property Accountability System (DPAS).   The applications, reports and capabilities will be modified\/migrated to using data sourced from DPAS. Included in the data migration is the ability to expose the DPAS data in Business Objects (BOBJ).   This release also includes the development new functionality; the Transaction Request Tool which includes the ability for fleet managers to update, load, and move assets, as well as complete resale requests.  \n\n2) LIMS-EV Equipment View 4.6 - Implement the remaining metrics not included in release 4.4 (less the Command Equipment Management Office (CEMO) metrics) \u2013 primarily associated with the new Redistribution and Mass Additive functionality.  This release also corrects discrepancy reports from Release 4.0 (Redistribution and Mass Additive functionality) Metrics include:  \n-- Provides the ability to report CEMO, 404 Supply Chain Management Office (SCMS), and Fill Rate Metrics\n-- Applies data from Mal-Positioned Assets, Repair Execution, Retention Additives & Disposals and Replacement Additives actions as well as user-entered input to calculate \/ present the defined metrics\n\n3) LIMS-EV Repair Network View (RNV) 4.0 - provides leadership view of Repair Network Integration (RNI) Metrics.  This release will provide a permanent Capability and Capacity (CAP2) Information Technology (IT) Tool and simulation capability to assist Repair Network managers in making resource allocation decisions.  Some examples include: \n-- Support equipment prices for each equipment asset  pulled from Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) \n-- Quality Deficiency Report (QDR) data pulled from each node from Joint Deficiency Reporting System (JDRS)  \n-- Depot level production \n-- Contract data reporting National Stock Numbers (NSNs) repaired at contractors from Contracting Information Database System (CIDS\/J018) or CAV-AF\n\n4) LIMS-EV Enterprise Mobile Viewer - focused on supporting the use of mobile device technology, with the first phase focusing on integrating four LIMS-EV Vehicle View widgets.   The release also enhances some of the existing capability, such as modifying the Prioritization Buy capability to support Item Manager functionality.\n\n5) LIMS-EV Weapons System Enterprise Review (WSER) - automate the AF Chief of Staff briefing (CSAF) (9 charts per WSER weapon system) that is delivered quarterly by Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Commander (AFLCMC\/CC) to Air Force Materiel Command Commander (AFMC\/CC), Major Commands (MAJCOMs), and other key stakeholders.   WSER content includes Performance Execution (availability, engines, and aircraft delivery quality); Modernization Overall (cost, schedule, performance, and funding); Product Support (Logistics Health Assessment (LHA) and Leading Health Indicator (LHI) (engines)); Predictive Health (safety, service life, mission effectiveness, and weapon system sustainment (WSS) risk); and Operating Cost\n\n\nFY 2017 Plan\n\n1) LIMS-EV Engine Health Management and Data Repository Center (EHM-DRC) - migrate an EHM-DRC to GCSS-AF infrastructure and leverage GCSS-AF Enterprise Data Warehouse for data storage and interfaces as well as decision support capabilities to expose and analyze expanded engine health data to improve the reliability and performance.\n\n2) LIMS-EV Repair Network View (RNV) 5.0 - address deficiencies in the RNV capability.  Updates include correcting an existing reference table, creating additional repair nodes, adding a frequency column to the \u201cdata source\u201d area of view, mapping to different reference tables, and correcting issues with the Extract, Transform, and Load procedures.  \n\n3) LIMS-EV Supply Chain Management View 7.0 - provide enhanced reports, queries, and views.  Specifics includes reporting\/ability to distinguish United States Air Force (USAF) backorders, production number (PDN) Search in Edit box , Ability to add Incremental\/auto fill PDN Drop Down In Default Analysis or Create PDN Analysis Report, NSN Entry Conversion, adds \"PMS\" to Default \"Role\" Selector & Select Single or Multiple, repairs the \"ADD\" Function - Manual Ability To Input The Repair Data For An Item That is Contract Repair or public\/private partnership (PPP), and allows user to  identify mission capable (MICAP) requisitions likely to have hours that should be stopped or backed out are identified throughout the month using the automated report identified in this requirements document.\n\n4) LIMS-EV Support Equipment Enterprise View - provide real time fleet summary of support equipment (SE) assets (ex. fully mission capable, partially mission capable, not mission capable).  Emulates the same metrics that are used for LIMS-EV Fleet Asset Status and Weapon System View.  SE community will be able to track status and location of SE assets by mission designator (MD), mission designator series (MDS), and Equipment ID.  Capability also Enables a priority buy capability \u2013similar to LIMS-EV Vehicle View - better calculations for predicting asset service cliffs.  \n\n5) LIMS-EV Cost of Logistics (COL) 2.0 - address change request and deficiency reports in the COL Capability, integrate variance tool, and update the existing dashboard.  Updates include providing the user the ability to export reports from the view (instead of having to export from BOBJ), Corrects the existing issue with the export feature, fixes the tool tips, modifies the \u201cData Source\u201d area on the screen to include a \u201cfrequency column\u201d, renames some views, corrects the \u201cBase\u201d filter.\n\n6) LIMS-EV Vehicle View 6.0 - enable Vehicle Support Chain Operations Squadron (VSCOS) Installation Support Centralization (ISC) Initiative.  ISC is a CSAF directed action to centralize management of the Air Forces' vehicle fleet at Air Force Element (AFELM) VSCOS.  The ISC initiative centralizes 55 processes from the MAJCOM\u2019s to one central source within VSCOS.  Some of the enhancements include; Alerts and Event Management (AEM) Integration, enables same look and feel for verification\/validation  that exists in latest LIMS-EV capabilities, applies hover overs on fields across the application, enables query tracking, enhances Item Manager functions, and provides a Depot Maintenance planning model.  \n\n7) LIMS-EV Enterprise Propulsion Business Intelligence (BI) Tool - provide engine managers with the ability to  forecast engine and component removals, identify business process gaps, consolidate existing applications\/tools, and provide metrics and analysis for existing or new engines based on Thrust, Weight, Fuel, Cost, etc.  Migrate manual products generated by the actuary's office.\n\nF-35 UIDES provides for Air Force development of a F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) - User IT Data Exchange Service that supports current and future Information Exchange Requirement (IER) data transfer capability from the F-35 ALIS into data reports and configurable tables to receive, store and integrate F-35 operations, maintenance, training and financial data within existing Air Force enterprise views to support the growing fleet of AF F-35 aircraft.  Funding supports modification of an enhanced data sharing capability (ability to consume increased volume and variety of ALIS IER data) to support depot data configuration and integration requirements.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program\/project planning and execution and future program\/project planning.\n\nNote: In FY 2016, PE 0708611 Support Systems Development, Project Number 675042, Logistics Application Logistics Integration (LALI), the F-35 User Identification Data Exchange System (UIDES) effort was transferred to PE 0604800F, F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, in order to align the activity under the F-35 RDT&E Program Element.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
