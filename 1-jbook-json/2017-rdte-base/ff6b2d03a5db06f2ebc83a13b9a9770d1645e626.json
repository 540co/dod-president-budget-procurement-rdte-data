The Electronics Technology program element supports the continued advancement of these technologies through the development of performance driven advanced capabilities, exceeding that available through commercial sources, in electronic, optoelectronic and MEMS devices, semiconductor device design and fabrication techniques, and new materials and material structures for device applications.  A particular focus for this work is the exploitation of chip-scale heterogeneous integration technologies that permit the optimization of device and integrated module performance.\n\nThe phenomenal progress in current electronics and computer chips will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology in the early 21st century, a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue.  The program element will therefore explore alternatives to silicon-based electronics in the areas of new electronic devices.  The program element will also explore new architectures to use devices of all types, new software to program the systems, and new methods to fabricate the chips.  Approaches include nanotechnology, nanoelectronics, molecular electronics, spin-based electronics, quantum-computing, new circuit architectures optimizing these new devices, and new computer and electronic systems architectures.  Projects will investigate the feasibility, design, and development of powerful information technology devices and systems using approaches for electronic device designs that extend beyond traditional Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) scaling, including non-silicon-based materials technologies to achieve low cost, reliable, fast and secure computing, communication, and storage systems.  This investigation is aimed at developing new capabilities from promising directions in the design of information processing components using both inorganic and organic substrates, designs of components and systems leveraging quantum effects and chaos, and innovative approaches to computing designs incorporating these components for such applications as low cost seamless pervasive computing, ultra-fast computing, and sensing and actuation devices.  \n\nThis project has five major thrusts: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research."

The Adaptive Radio Frequency Technology (ART) program will provide the warfighter with a new, fully adaptive radio platform capable of sensing the electromagnetic and waveform environment in which it operates, making decisions on how to best communicate in that environment, and rapidly adapting its hardware to meet ever-changing requirements, while simultaneously significantly reducing the SWaP of such radio nodes.  ART technology will also provide each warfighter, as well as small-scale unmanned platforms, with compact and efficient signal identification capabilities for next-generation cognitive communications, and sensing and electronic warfare applications.  ART technology will also enable rapid radio platform deployment for new waveforms and changing operational requirements.  The project will remove the separate design tasks needed for each unique Radio Frequency (RF) system, which will dramatically reduce the procurement and sustainment cost of military systems.  ART aggregates the Feedback Linearized Microwave Amplifiers program, the Analog Spectral Processing program, and Chip Scale Spectrum Analyzers (CSSA) program, and initiates new thrusts in Cognitive Low-energy Signal Analysis and Sensing Integrated Circuits (CLASIC), and Radio-Frequency Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (RF-FPGA)."

In parallel, Integrated Circuits (IC) designers for RF circuits have leveraged the different material properties of compound semiconductor (CS) technologies such as indium phosphide (InP), gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon-germanium (SiGe) to enable devices that operate at frequencies and powers difficult or impossible to achieve in Silicon.  Historically, a designer would have to decide between the high density of Si circuits or the high performance of CS materials.  Prior DARPA efforts have demonstrated the ability to achieve near-ideal \"mix-and-match\" capability for DoD circuit designers with limited demonstrations of the heterogeneous integration of silicon and InP technologies that far exceeded what can be accomplished with one technology alone.  Specifically, the Compound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon (COSMOS) program enabled transistors of InP to be freely mixed with silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to obtain the benefits of both technologies (very high speed and very high circuit complexity\/density, respectively).  The Diverse & Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) effort will take this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (for example, GaN, InP, GaAs, antimonide based Compound Semiconductors), microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures.  This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true \"systems on a chip\" (SoCs) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions while enabling higher performance such as power, bandwidth or dynamic range in our electronic systems for electronic warfare, communications and radar.  \n\nIn the Applied Research part of this program, high performance RF\/optoelectronic\/mixed-signal systems-on-a-chip (SoC) for specific DoD transition applications will be developed as a demonstration of the DAHI technology.  To provide maximum benefit to the DoD, these processes will be transferred to a manufacturing flow and made available (with appropriate computer aided design support) to a wide variety of DoD laboratory, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), academic and industrial designers.  Manufacturing yield and reliability of the DAHI technologies will be characterized and enhanced.  This program has advanced technology development efforts funded in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15."

In parallel, IC designers for RF circuits have leveraged the different material properties of compound semiconductor (CS) technologies such as gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon-germanium (SiGe) to enable devices that operate at frequencies and powers difficult or impossible to achieve in silicon.  When integrated together the heterogeneous integration of these technologies has been demonstrated to far exceed what can be accomplished with any one technology alone. The process of integrating CS technologies on silicon currently requires that the silicon transistor dimension, or process node, be fixed which requires designs to be remade for various combinations of technology and process node, a costly and time consuming effort. This program will investigate the potential for a truly process-agnostic integration technology that is inclusive of any current or future circuit fabrication technology with a standardized interconnect topology. Such a technology platform will enable the design of individual circuit intellectual property (IP) blocks, such as low-noise amplifiers or analog-to-digital converters (ADC), with a goal of re-using them across applications and resulting in time and cost savings.  Re-use will allow the DoD to spread the upfront design cost of these blocks over several designs instead of leveling the burden on a single program.  Furthermore, the IP can be designed in the fabrication process best suited for the performance goals and evolve more quickly than larger, more expensive single-chip (monolithic) systems-on-a-chip.  Through standardization of the interface, CHIPS will enable the DoD to leverage the advancements driven by the global semiconductor market rather than relying on a single on-shore foundry provider or on proprietary circuit designs owned by a few traditional prime performers.\n\nIn the Applied Research part of this program, focus will be placed on the rapid development and insertion of microsystems utilizing the CHIPS technology.  For example, the development of an ADC combining a SiGe circuit integrated with 14 nanometer Silicon CMOS will be explored.

Frequency control is the enabling technology for RADAR, satellite and terrestrial communications, and positioning and navigation technology, among many other core DoD capabilities.  By comparison, frequency control at optical frequencies is relatively immature, comparable to the state-of-the-art of microwave control in the 1930's.  The first practical demonstration of optical frequency synthesis, utilizing a self-referenced optical comb, was performed in 1999 and, since that time, the precision and accuracy of optical measurements has improved by four orders of magnitude, including the demonstration of atomic clocks utilizing optical-frequency atomic transitions that far outperform existing technology based on microwave transitions.  To date, however, optical frequency control has been constrained to laboratory experiments due to the large size, relative fragility, and high cost of optical comb-based synthesizers.  Recent developments in self-referenced optical frequency combs in microscale resonators enable the development of a fully-integrated chip-scale optical frequency synthesizer.  Ubiquitous low-cost robust optical frequency synthesis is expected to create a similar disruptive capability in optical technology as microwave frequency synthesis did in the 1940's, enabling high-bandwidth coherent optical communications, coherent synthesized-aperture LiDAR, portable high-accuracy atomic clocks, high-resolution standoff gas\/toxin detection, and intrusion detection, among other foreseen applications.\n\nThe Direct On-chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) program will integrate a diverse range of photonic and electronic components to create a microscale, high-accuracy optical frequency synthesizer, in a compact, robust package, suitable for deployment in a wide variety of mission-critical DoD applications.  Significant challenges in the program include the integration of heterogeneous devices and materials that are incompatible with conventional high-volume manufacturing of integrated circuits, optimizing efficient on-chip pump lasers and high-bandwidth detectors, and developing high-precision microwave control electronics with low power consumption.

The Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) program fills this gap through the use of commercial-of-the-shelf components that can undergo technology refresh far more frequently in response to a continually changing threat environment.  ACT will develop adaptive and standardized digital-at-every-element arrays that can replace static analog beamformers with cost effective digital array systems capable of a yearly technology refresh.

Below 30 GHz, the proliferation and availability of inexpensive high-power commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance.  The numerous tactical advantages offered by operating at higher frequencies, most notably the wide bandwidths available, is driving both commercial and DoD solid-state and vacuum electronic amplifiers into the millimeter wave (mm-wave) spectrum above 30 GHz.  Control of the mm-wave spectrum necessitates advanced and increasingly more sophisticated electronic components and systems.  The performance of these systems strongly depends on the available amplifier power which impacts how much power the system can radiate.\n\nThe High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) program seeks to strengthen our dominance of the EM spectrum and create overmatch capability by developing a new class of wideband, high-power vacuum electronic amplifiers.  The size, weight, and power (SWaP) will be consistent with reusable airborne and mobile platforms enabling an increased offset range and the ability to engage multiple targets at the speed of light.  Realization of wideband, high power vacuum electronic amplifier technology will require significant advancements in cathodes with high current-density and long lifetime, beam-wave interaction circuits with wide bandwidth and high power handling capability, wideband and low-loss vacuum windows, and compact magnetic structures for electron beam transport.  The HAVOC amplifier will provide leap-ahead capabilities to air, ground, and ship-based communications, sensing, and electronic warfare systems.  Opportunities for transfer of the HAVOC technology to the Services will be identified during the execution of the early phases of the program.  The technology transfer efforts will follow a spiral development process to mitigate risk and provide the opportunity to incorporate new technological developments as they occur.

With the increased prevalence of intentional GPS jamming, spoofing, and other GPS-denial threats, GPS access is increasingly unavailable in contested theaters and alternative sources of PNT are required.  In particular, guided munitions navigation is the most immediate and among the most demanding of GPS-denial challenges, due to the necessity of operating in highly contested theaters and the stringent requirements for minimization of cost, size, weight, and power consumption (CSWaP). The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program will develop low-CSWaP inertial sensor technology for GPS-free munitions navigation.  PRIGM comprises two focus areas: 1) Development of a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU) that transitions state-of-the-art MEMS to DoD platforms by 2020; and 2) Research and development of Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) to achieve gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation requirements with the objective of complete autonomy in 2030.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform (complete IMU) that enables Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  PRIGM will exploit recent advances in heterogeneous integration of photonics and CMOS and advanced MEMS technology to realize novel inertial sensors for application in extreme dynamic environments and beyond navigation-grade performance.\n\nFuture warfighting scenarios will take place in a GPS-denied world.  High-dynamics navigation applications, such as smart munitions, require low-CSWaP inertial sensors demonstrating high bandwidth, high precision, and high shock tolerance. Conventional MEMS inertial sensors rely on capacitive sensing to measure position, which suffer from perturbations due to asymmetry, temperature sensitivity, parasitic capacitances, and squeeze film damping of gas in narrow gaps.  Various methods have been proposed to overcome challenges with capacitive readout.  One solution is optical sensing, which has demonstrated high sensitivity, low noise position sensing and potential to reject external vibrations.  Recent advances in heterogeneous integration, on-chip optical waveguides, and quantum-assisted sensing and readout of MEMS\/NEMS have resulted in new capabilities to enable candidate technologies for PRIGM.  The candidate technologies include optically interrogated MEMS gyroscopes and accelerometers, waveguide optical gyroscopes, and rate-integrating MEMS gyroscopes.

State-of-the-art sensors use active electronics to monitor the environment for the external trigger.  The power consumed by these electronic circuits limits the sensor lifetime to durations of weeks to months.  The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will extend the lifetime of remotely deployed sensors from months to years.  N-ZERO will develop the underlying technologies and demonstrate the capability to continuously and passively monitor the environment and wake-up an electronic circuit upon detection of a specific signature or trigger. Thereafter, sensor lifetime will be limited only by processing and communications of confirmed events.\n\nThe N-ZERO program will replace the power consuming electronic circuits used for processing and detection of information in current systems with passive or extremely low power devices.  The N-ZERO program will develop RF communications and physical sensor systems that collect, process, and detect the presence of useful information, while rejecting spurious signals and noise, using the energy in the collected information to perform these functions.  This will eliminate or significantly reduce the standby power consumption from the battery.

These sensors are also manufactured at the wafer scale, and they are becoming widely available due to the low cost relative to existing infrared (IR) imaging technologies.  No similar technology exists in the tactically and strategically important short-wave and mid-wave IR (SWIR\/MWIR) bands.

These sensors will provide increased standoff distances to smaller Tier I and II class unmanned aerial vehicle platforms, low cost missiles, hand held weapon sights\/handheld surveillance systems, helmet-mounted systems, and ground vehicle-mounted threat warning systems.\n\nThe MWIR detector technologies developed under WIRED will provide, for the first time, MWIR FPAs that do not require heavy, expensive cryogenic coolers.  The SWIR detector technologies will provide, for the first time, diffraction limited imaging with compact optics.

Although the basic technology already exists, optical systems have been limited by their size, weight, and cost. A traditional optical telescope, for instance, requires expensive precision lenses and mirrors, large empty volumes for gathering and focusing light, and heavy mechanical steering components. Mechanical steering's limited speed and precision also impedes the use of optical systems in certain defense applications, although LIDAR is more suitable for detailed imaging relative to RADAR.\n\nThe Modular Optical Aperture Building Blocks (MOABB) program seeks to greatly reduce the size and weight of optical systems while increasing steering rates. Specifically, MOABB aims to construct millimeter scale optical unit cells that can be coherently arrayed onto a flat surface to form a much larger, higher power device. These building blocks would replace the precision lenses, mirrors, and mechanical components from a conventional optical system. MOABB would also develop scalable optical phased arrays, borrowing from RADAR the technology required to steer electromagnetic waves, such as light and radio, without mechanical components. These advances would allow for a 100-fold reduction in size and weight and a 1,000-fold increase in steering rate. For applications such as LIDAR, laser communications and laser illumination, MOABB provides a compelling opportunity to replace empty space and bulk components with a planar, integrated system."

The vision of the program is to offer the warfighter a small and versatile camera that would be affordable for individual soldiers and provide multiple band imagery with fusion capability to take full advantage of different wavelength-band phenomenology in a compact single unit.  In the future, the availability of the PIXNET camera would enable a peer-to-peer networked system for image sharing within a squad, thereby providing a better common operating picture of the battlefield and significantly enhancing the warfighter's situational understanding.  The program aims to develop a low size, weight and power (SWaP), low cost, soldier-portable multiband infrared camera that will provide real-time single and multiple band imagery using a combination of a thermal and reflected spectral band.    The use of fused imagery in the PIXNET design will allow the soldier to detect camouflaged targets and distinguish targets from decoys.  The PIXNET camera will eliminate limitations posed by current camera systems, allowing for the detection, recognition and identification of targets from a single camera in daylight or no-light conditions.\n\nThe PIXNET program will focus on a significant reduction in SWaP and cost of infrared sensor components to enable the deployment of this technology to a wide range of participants in the theater.  The emphasis on a small form factor will enable new opportunities such as surveillance with small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), multi-band rifle sights, vehicle-mounted systems, as well as helmet-mounted and handheld surveillance systems.  The phenomenology of utilizing the unique characteristics of different infrared wavelengths for target detection will be exploited.  The combination of a smart phone and PIXNET camera at the soldier level will enable more effective tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) over the current capability.  The PIXNET program takes advantage of the computing capability of smart phones to process and fuse multicolor images and send them as videos or still images to the warfighter's helmet-mounted display via a wireless or wired connection."

The program will develop and establish an initial set of materials and components along with integration and manufacturing capabilities to undergird a fundamentally new class of electronics and mechanical structures defined by their performance and transience.  These transient electronics and structural systems ideally should perform in a manner comparable to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems, but with limited device persistence that can be programmed, adjusted in real-time, triggered, and\/or be sensitive to the deployment environment.  Applications include sensors for conventional indoor\/outdoor environments (buildings, transportation, and materiel), environmental monitoring over large areas, simplified diagnosis, treatment, and health monitoring in the field and airborne delivery vehicles with vanishing properties.  VAPR will explore transience characteristics of electronic devices and structural materials as well as build out an initial capability to make transient electronics and transient structural materials a deployable technology for the DoD and Nation.  The technological capability developed through VAPR will be demonstrated through two final test vehicles.  The transient electronics test vehicle will be a vanishing sensor with RF link.  The sensor with RF link will serve as an application vehicle showing the manufacturability of the research and process developed in the VAPR program being performed in PE 0601101E, Project TRS-01.  The sensor with RF link is meant to be functional on its own, but also a leading indicator of the types of circuits possible under the VAPR program.  The transient structural materials demonstration will be a vanishing air delivery vehicle capable of precise, gentle drops of small payloads (~3 lbs.).  This demonstration will be functional on its own and will also be a leading indicator of the types of complex vanishing mechanical structures enabled by VAPR materials and technologies.  The resulting prototype designs will establish a fundamental capability to gently, precisely, and without debris deliver mission-critical payloads and are expected to broadly apply to various concepts of operation (CONOPS) relevant to national security."

By employing an ultra-stable optical clock, the DISARMER program will allow for mixer-less digitization and thereby improve the dynamic range 100x over the state of the art.  Such a wide bandwidth, high fidelity receiver will have applications in electronic warfare and signals intelligence systems while dramatically reducing the cost, size and weight of these systems.\n\nThe DISARMER program will develop a low jitter mode-locked laser to be used as the sampling source.

Both classes of sensors are currently unsuitable for small platform or dismount soldier applications. Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors have limited performance but excellent CSWaP, while atomic sensors are capable of excellent performance but are limited to laboratory experiments due to complexity and high CSWaP.  Micro-PNT advanced both technology approaches by improving the performance of MEMS inertial sensors and by miniaturizing atomic devices.  Ultimately, low-CSWaP inertial sensors and clocks will enable ubiquitous guidance and navigation on all platforms, including guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (micro-UAVs), and mounted and dismounted soldiers.\n\nThe successful realization of Micro-PNT depends on development of new microfabrication processes and novel material systems for fundamentally different sensing modalities, as well as understanding the error sources at the microscale and the scaling relationships for size reduction of sensors based on atomic physics techniques.  The Micro-PNT program included research into novel techniques for fabrication and integration of three-dimensional MEMS devices as well as theoretical and experimental studies of new architectures and geometries for MEMS inertial sensing.  Atomic physics research included the development of new architectures for atomic inertial sensing and investigation of miniature enabling technologies, whose conventional counterparts are currently large, power hungry, and temperature sensitive, limiting high performance sensors to laboratory demonstrations.

This technology enabled large voltage swing circuits for military applications that the current state-of-the-art silicon transistor technology cannot support.  The objective of the NEXT program was to develop a revolutionary, wide band gap, nitride transistor technology that simultaneously provides extremely high-speed and high-voltage swing [Johnson Figure of Merit (JFoM) larger than 5 Terahertz (THz)-V] in a process consistent with large scale integration of enhancement\/depletion (E\/D) mode logic circuits of 1,000 or more transistors.  In addition, this fabrication process was reproducible, high-yield, high-uniformity, and highly reliable.  The accomplishment of this goal was validated through the demonstration of specific program Process Control Monitor (PCM) Test Circuits such as 5, 51 and 501-stage ring oscillators in each program phase.  The impact of this next-generation nitride electronic technology is the speed, linearity, and power efficiency improvement of RF and mixed-signal electronic circuits used in military communications, electronic warfare and sensing."

The MPD program focused on development of fast, small, reliable, high-carrier-density, micro-plasma switches capable of operating in extreme conditions, such as high-radiation and high-temperature environments.  Specific focus was given to methods that provide efficient generation of ions that can perform robust signal processing of radio frequency (RF) through light electromagnetic energy over a range of gas pressures.  Applications for such devices are far reaching, including the construction of complete high-frequency plasma-based circuits, and microsystems with superior resistance to radiation and extreme temperature environments.  Two and multi-terminal devices consisting of various architectures were developed and optimized under the scope of this program.  MPDs were developed in various circuits and substrates to demonstrate the efficacy of different approaches.  MPD-based microsystems were demonstrated in DoD applications where electronic systems must survive in extreme environments.\n\nThe MPD applied research program focused on transferring the fundamental scientific advances funded by PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 to produce complex circuit designs that may be integrated with commercial electronic devices.  The MPD program resulted in the design and modeling tools, as well as the fabrication capabilities necessary to commercially manufacture high-performance microscale-plasma-device-based electronic systems for advanced DoD applications."
