            "val": "MDA utilizes a disciplined system engineering process to develop and integrate the BMDS into an effective, layered defense against ballistic missiles of all ranges during all phases of flight. This process consists of the following steps: Plan, Define, Design, Build, Test and Verify, Assess, and Deliver BMDS Capability, followed by transfer of selected capabilities. The BMDS Test Program Element (PE) is responsible for testing that provides critical data to: determine validity of models and simulations used to verify and assess BMDS capabilities; validate that Elements and Components are properly designed, built, and integrated; and to provide confidence that the BMDS will perform as designed, and support system performance assessment for incremental capability delivery decisions. Results from the Test and Verify step provide feedback into the Plan, Define, and Design steps to identify areas for system improvements. Key to the systems engineering process is Modeling and Simulation (M&S), which reflects the integrated operational system's performance. Confidence in M&S is based on a comprehensive Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A) process. The BMDS Test Program, as documented in the IMTP, has a primary emphasis of increasing confidence in M&S, as well as providing the BMDS Operational Test Agency (OTA) Team with data to verify and assess BMDS capabilities and Critical Operational Issues. Lastly, as models are validated and accredited, MDA and the BMDS OTA Team will utilize these models to assess BMDS capabilities through a campaign of ground testing.\n\nBMDS Test Program Functions include:\n\n-Develop and implement MDA test policy, standards, tools, products, and processes to enable effective tests while balancing MDA and element programmatic needs\n-Develop an IMTP that compiles all MDA test objectives, test schedules, and funding  requirements from the year of execution through the Future Years Defense Program time period and beyond (through FY 2024).\n-Provide, maintain, and develop common test resources and infrastructure required to execute tests in the MDA Test Program by leveraging element laboratories, ranges, executing agents, and functional expertise, as applicable\n-Act as the single point of contact in MDA for all external ranges and common test resources \n-Collect, archive, and distribute all MDA test data\/information\n-Certify that test personnel are trained and equipped to conduct safe and effective tests \n-Provide test personnel and support services to plan and execute tests\n-Represent MDA as the single test authority to the test and evaluation community, international cooperative program representatives, and other organization representatives on test matters\n\nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management efforts providing integrated and efficient support to MDA functions and activities across the entire BMDS."

The MDA Test Program plans and executes BMDS test events and develops the necessary test policy, test plans, and test infrastructure to conduct an effective test program. The goals of this budget project are to sustain and improve a robust testing program and to enhance M&S efforts to provide, in conjunction with flight and ground testing, confidence to the Combatant Commanders that the missile defense system works. \n\nActivities are grouped into five major areas: 1) Program Planning and Operations; 2) Flight Test; 3) Ground Test; 4) Test Resources; and 5) Engineering Test Analysis."

Test directs a team of various internal staff (government and scientific, engineering and technical assistance support), executing agents (including DoD agencies, Service Organizations, Laboratories and Program Offices, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), and other MDA programs to execute the various diverse efforts within the BMDS test program through competition. When a specific effort\/activity being conducted, acquired, or maintained requires the use of an executing agent, respective headquarter regulations are used to conform the acquisition strategy. \n\nThe MDA Integrated Master Test Plan stablishes and documents the test requirements for the BMDS with the specific focus on collecting the data needed for the Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A) of the BMDS Models and Simulations.  This paradigm uses critical factor analysis to drive test design, planning, and execution for accrediting M&S, which is used to validate and assess system performance. With this test approach, MDA will establish confidence that the M&S used to evaluate the BMDS represent real world behavior, thereby enabling simulation-based performance assessment to verify system functionality."

It maintains the Certification and Accreditation (C&A) data repository, capturing the DIACAP documentation (artifacts, validation results, and Information Assurance Risk Assessment results, and Designated Approving Authority (DAA) accreditation decisions) and POA&M on all MDA information systems. This project supports the monitoring and tracking of Cybersecurity mitigations detailed in Information Technology security POA&Ms. Activities include preparation of C&A documentation and accreditation recommendations to the MDA Senior Information Assurance Officer\/Certification Authority (CA) and DAA. Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) team actions ensure the availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality and non-repudiation of the MDA mission, test and administrative systems.
