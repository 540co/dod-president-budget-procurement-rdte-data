Focus areas are sensor components, sub-components and software algorithms to improve detection of mines, explosive threats and directed energy; novel methods to defeat mines and explosive threats; and signature management technologies to reduce the reconnaissance capabilities of enemy forces.  The technologies being investigated are  for both mounted and dismounted applications. Project H24 advances state of the art Countermine technologies to accurately detect threats with a high probability, reduce false alarms, and enable an increased operational tempo. Project H35 evaluates and develops advanced sensor protection, signature management and deception techniques for masking friendly force capabilities and intentions.  \n\nWork in this PE is related to and fully coordinated with PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602622A (Chemical, Smoke and Equipment Defeating Technology), PE 0602624A (Weapons and Munitions Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), and PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technology). \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM)\/Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC)\/Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, VA."
