            "val": "The Common Hardware Systems (CHS) program acquires and sustains highly flexible, state-of-the-art, cost effective, common, and simplified non-developmental C5ISR solutions that improve interoperability and connectivity on the battlefield while garnering efficient competition to integrate the latest commercial technology onto the Army tactical network. CHS provides technical support, common standardized testing and system design \/ configuration management across Army tactical programs to ensure interoperability and integration of hardware throughout the development of capabilities, to facilitate and simplify the selection of common hardware solutions across the operational battlefield and to create efficiencies through streamlined common hardware configurations across the Common Operating Environments (COE)s. \n \nCommon Software (CS) is the suite of systems through which the Army develops, integrates and tests common software products and\/or components used for communication between Army Mission Command Systems and Joint and coalition Command and Control (C2) applications.  The CS project provides state-of-the-art software technologies and functionality that is used by numerous Mission Command (MC) and joint systems to eliminate the need for service independent development and duplication of effort.  The CS project also manages and performs technology demonstrations of emerging technologies for future use by Army C2 systems.  The CS program is a cornerstone in the Army's COE modernization efforts.\n \nThis program element also includes the Central Technical Support Facility (CTSF) which is the Army's single strategic facility responsible for executing Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) system of system verification\/validation checkout, testing, and configuration management for the Army's LandWarNet Baseline. \n \nThe Technical Management Division (TMD) effectively manages the System-of-Systems engineering, Enterprise and Integration efforts for the continuing evolution of the network within the Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communication and Tactical (PEO C3T) portfolio of technology across the capability enhancement packages to deliver efficient and effective cross-domain technical solutions.  \n \nThe Mounted Computing Environment (MCE) is one of the six computing environments formalized by the AAE under the Common Operating Environment (COE) via the AAE Directive to Program Executive Offices dated 20 December 2011. MCE standardizes end-user environments and enables streamlined deployment of new warfighting applications. The Joint Battle Command - Platform (JBC-P) is the foundational element and core software platform of the MCE. Future development of the MCE will leverage JBC-P hardware and software to consolidate and integrate multiple warfighting systems in the Platform (Mounted) environment and will speed delivery of new Mission Command applications to the warfighter while improving the effectiveness and value of current systems.\n  \nThe Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE), one of the computing environments under the Common Operating Environment (COE), provides a common foundation (Common Infrastructure \/ Common Services) for Warfighter Capabilities. The CPCE establishes a Common Core Software Baseline and Hardware Configuration upon which future Warfighter capabilities can be built. The CPCE targets Command and Control (C2) capability development at tactical echelons that span from the company to all Army Service Component Commands (ASCC). The CPCE will be the most critical computing environment developed to support the command posts and combat operations. \n \nTactical Digital Media (TDM) is comprised of photo, video and audio recording and editing equipment that will be assembled and issued as variant kits tailored to unit mission requirements. TDM kits address modernization gaps associated with all operational Combat Camera (COMCAM), Public Affairs (PA), and Military Information Support Operations (MISO) units. TDM provides essential imagery, multimedia products, and live interview capabilities that directly contribute to successful execution of a Commander's strategic engagement and communications strategy across the full range of military operations. \n \nTactical Network Operations (NetOps) and Management (TNOM) is the program which will develop and integrate the Tactical NetOps software capabilities in support of NetOps Convergence, Army Objectives and emerging Cyber Center of Excellence (CCOE) requirements. The end state program is designed to synchronize LandWarNet NetOps efforts in an integrated and interoperable framework, spanning all echelons of command and supporting the full range of military operations for Army, Joint, and Coalition Forces in order to ensure converged NetOps. The initial mission is convergence of DoD Information Network (DoDIN) functions into a single integrated set of Tactical NetOps and Management software. This integrated solution provides NetOps capability to manage Tactical Networks from the Soldier to the Theater network entry point and supports the implementation of the Integrated Tactical NetOps (ITNO) Increment 1 Capability Production Document (CPD). TNOM will deliver a standardized visualization capability (integrating both Upper and Lower Tactical Internet NetOps) in order to reduce complexity and inform the military decision making processes. TNOM will also provide enhanced capability to detect, respond, and restore from cyber incidents.\n \nTactical Enhancement supports testing requirements for capabilities procured and fielded under the Signal Modernization Program. Signal Modernization will modernize legacy terrestrial communications links and increase capacity of the Expeditionary Signal Battalions. It will also provide transport convergence for Warfighter Information Network- Tactical (WIN-T) Increment 1 units, bringing Top Secret Intel, Medical, and Sustainment capabilities from their legacy stovepipe transport systems on to the WIN-T network.\n\nProject EQ8, Mobile\/Handheld Computing Environment supports the Nett Warrior (NW) Program (named in honor of Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Robert C. Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program.  The program leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations.  The NW system provides leaders electronic real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; a collaborative planning tool; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader.  \n\nAs the ARMY's tactical network continues to evolve from a loose federation of stove-piped systems to a single, intergrated, service-oriented and standards-based environment, Unit Task Reorganization (UTR) development capabilites must also evolve in the same manner. Today,  UTR is a complex, manually intensive, and time-consuming process. This is due, in part, to the large increase in network-enabled nodes within the tactical network. In addition, tools employed by the G\/S-6 staff to conduct UTR are desgined, developed,and fielded by various program and product managers, each with discrete requirements, developmental schedules, and funding lines. This impredes the G\/S-6 Staff's ability to conduct UTR in an integrated manner. To enhance UTR, we will address five fundamental challenes to improve UTR. Efficients data sharing is a fundamental charactersitic of mondern-day integrated systems. The ability to read, modify, and exchange data in a uniform and efficient manner is essential to achieve an integrated UTR System."

This project provides a coherent migration strategy for acquisition of warfighting systems through the use of technology insertion. \n\nCHS also conducts common environmental testing of hardware items thereby reducing the testing requirements for individual Project Managers. An Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity firm fixed priced, full and open competition contract was awarded to General Dynamics in May 2003, for ruggedization and production. In August 2011, CHS awarded, on a best value basis, the follow-on CHS-4 contract via full and open competition.  CHS-5 is to be awarded in FY18 to provide flexibility for Tactical Programs of Record (PoR)s to meet hardware and associated services requirements through full and open competition and to provide an agile solution to support COE, network integration activities, capability set development, and transport needs."

All software development efforts will be competed among Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) certified developers.\n\nIn accordance with the approved Net-enabled Mission Command Initial Capabilities Document (NeMC ICD), software capability will be developed in 3-year increments in support of Common Operating Environment (COE) Guidance designed to facilitate messaging, mediation and addressing for Army, Joint and Coalition Partners in synchronization with the maturity of the Common Operating Environment (COE) and Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) architecture baselines. The product development funded under this R-Form is an integral part of the Mission Command systems, and a core communication component of the virtualized infrastructure and will be accomplished in part under a Project Manager, Mission Command (PM MC) General Services Administration (GSA) engineering services contract approach which will consist of multiple prime contractors competitively bidding on a single development solicitation. This strategy is designed to optimize opportunities for improved interoperability among the systems, to capture the benefits of competition, and to ensure the rapid integration of new capabilities into warfighter systems. This strategy is also designed to reduce the physical footprint, the logistics support requirements, and to increase operational efficiency by integration of additional system interoperability services which reduce duplication of effort and cost; and allows for development of communication standards across the DoD community."

The CTSF provides validated test data to the Department of the Army and Joint agencies to accredit interoperability certifications.  The distributed test environment of the CTSF is accomplished through the Federation of Net-centric Sites (FaNS) construct.  This FaNS construct addresses distributed integration development and testing using the core infrastructure of the CTSF to harness AMC, Army, and Joint expertise\/resources.  Through these federated resources, the CTSF executes interoperability development and certification testing of the Warfighter mission areas, to include Network Evaluation spinouts, as they digitize and become part of the Army's LandWarNet."

The resulting operating environment will allow twenty-six (26) products\/systems to leverage the CPCE's Common Core Software Baseline and Hardware Configuration, simplifying future development efforts and enhancing interoperability and data sharing.  The CPCE enables Command and Control (C2) capability development at tactical echelons that span from the company to all Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) and thus, is the most employed and critical computing environment developed to support the command posts and combat operations.\n\nOperationally, Army formations encounter a variety of complex environments where boundaries between tactical and strategic levels of war have merged.  This requires a computing environment capability that will simplify operations, enhance the Common Operational Picture (COP), provide integrated applications and data, enhance communications in disconnected, intermittent, and limited bandwidth (DIL) environments, and automate software updates. Additional CPCE goals include: Multi-Echelon reach (ASCC thru Battalion), Cross Cutting Capabilities (CCCs), C2 on the Move (C2OTM), Strategic and Tactical Operational and intelligence data sharing, Unified Data on a Common Map, and Sharing Data to Other Computing Environments (Mobile Handheld, Mounted, Sensors, etc.).\n \nAcquisition Goals of the CPCE include: Acquisition Agility, Open Architectures, Reduced Life Cycle Costs, and a Cyber-Hardened Foundation for applications and services."

Development of the MCE continues to leverage JBC-P hardware and software to consolidate and integrate multiple warfighting systems in the Platform (mounted) environment. This integrated MCE, with its open standards, enhanced interoperability, and simplified end-user interface will speed delivery of new Mission Command applications to the warfighter while improving the effectiveness and value of current systems.  Requirements for the MCE are established in the AAE Directive Memo, the JBC-P Capability Development Document (CDD), and in the Mounted Computing Environment Information System Initial Capabilities Document (MCE IS ICD) (DRAFT).  \n\nFY 2017 funding provides the means to continue to manage and develop MCE, which has a larger horizontal scope than the foundational element (JBC-P), as it aids in achieving CE and COE goals."

These test events will meet all mandatory testing requirements with full ATEC oversight. This Acquisition Strategy will integrate proven Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) capabilities into existing WIN-T nodes to expand and enhance network capacity and user access. The TROPO and TRILOS capabilities will be acquired as ACAT III programs to replace legacy equipment in the field while utilizing DoDI 5000.02 standard acquisition approaches, starting with Milestone C Determination for TRILOS (2QFY17) and TROPO (4QFY18)."

TDM provides essential imagery, multimedia products, and live interview capabilities that directly contribute to successful execution of a Commander's strategic engagement and communications strategy across the full range of military operations. TDM also provides specific imagery, video, and multimedia support to commanders through the National Command Authority (NCA) level to assist with operational planning, decision-making, combat adversary misinformation\/disinformation, alter perceptions regarding coalition efforts, and provide accurate and timely information to national and international audiences. Proposed TDM equipment is entirely commercial off the shelf (COTS) which is currently in use by military organizations and commercial industry.\n\nFY17 Base funding in the amount of $2.467 million will be used to procure and evaluate representative candidate COTS camera and video equipment for effectiveness, suitability, and reliability under combat conditions to support material solutions for procurement. FY17 efforts will also include planned full rate production decision, material release, and award of a production contract or task order to support future procurements."

The end state program is designed to synchronize LandWarNet NetOps efforts in an integrated and interoperable framework, spanning all echelons of command and supporting the full range of military operations for Army, Joint, and Coalition Forces in order to ensure converged NetOps. The initial mission is convergence of DoD Information Network (DoDIN) functions into a single integrated set of Tactical NetOps and Management software. This integrated solution provides NetOps capability to manage Tactical Networks from the Soldier to the Theater network entry point and supports the implementation of the Integrated Tactical NetOps (ITNO) Increment 1 Capability Production Document (CPD). TNOM will deliver a standardized visualization capability (integrating both Upper and Lower Tactical Internet NetOps) in order to reduce complexity and inform the military decision making processes. TNOM will also provide enhanced capability to detect, respond, and restore from cyber incidents.\n\nFY17 funding initiates the Engineering Design and Development of Network Operations software in support of the ITNO Increment 1 CPD, enhancing Network Visualization and Monitoring of the tactical network, standardizing data definition and storage to support Common Operational Picture, and simplify planning and configuration process for multiple network devices and radio. FY17 funding supports Test and Evaluation planning and updates to the Test and Evaluation Master Plan."

The ITNO CPD approval is expected in FY16. This effort picks up where individual programs have left off with Network Operations (NetOps) development, and integrates the various tools. The program also develops new tools in order to enhance the functionality while simplifying the user experience as a cohesive suite for the Signal and Cyber staff from Battalion through Corps. The program will utilize an Incrementally Deployed Software Intensive Program model (in accordance with Department of Defense Instruction 5000.02, Defense Acquisition Program Model 3) to rapidly develop and deliver capability to fielded units within existing network infrastructure. TNOM will enter at Milestone B, scheduled in early FY17. The program office conducted a Pre-Materiel Development Decision brief to Program Executive Office Command Control Communications Tactical in December 2015 and a Request for Information to Industry (RFI) in January 2016. The Program is on track for a Materiel Development Decision in 3rd Quarter 2016 to initiate the program with a Draft Request for Proposal release planned immediately thereafter. The Request for Proposal will be released upon CPD approval. TNOM will conduct a Milestone B decision in early FY17 immediately followed by a contract award. The program will develop and deliver capability in successive software builds, conduct developmental and operational tests, followed by Limited Fielding Decisions until full capability outlined in the ITNO CPD is delivered. The ITNO CPD outlines requirements for both new capability and integration of existing NetOps capabilities that will simplify Soldier interaction with the Network and provide enhanced ability to plan, configure, manage, monitor, control and secure\/defend the tactical internet infrastructure. TNOM will integrate capabilities previously developed by WIN-T and the Joint Enterprise Network Manager (JENM), while aligning NetOps tools with the Common Operating Environment."

Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program, leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations. The NW system provides leaders electronic real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; a collaborative planning tool; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader. The NW system also provides the same integrated mission command capability to the tactical vehicle-mounted leaders so that when dismounted, the leader still maintains the common operating picture (COP) and has continuous situational awareness. This capability provides unparalleled situational awareness and enhanced communications to the dismounted leader allowing for faster, more accurate decisions and reduced fratricide in the tactical fight.  Includes integration and interface of products on Soldiers.\n\nThe continued development and integration of the NW program also integrates applications from other programs aimed at considerably reducing the weight and bulk of the dismounted Soldier's load by using a single End User Device. The NW program harnesses Soldiers' experience in combat operations and employs combat veterans for Soldier feedback enhancing human factors design and fightability of the system. This project funds the following: 1) Incorporation of additional new hardware applications and capabilities into Nett Warrior, 2) Yearly developmental and operational tests of the NW with continually advancing commercial smart device technology inserted, 3) Software development for planned updates, 4) Integration of new End User Devices with the existing and re-competed Army Tactical Radios, including vehicle power integration, 5) Government led integration and system engineering and program management, and 6) Conduct NW Operational Test and Evaluation with Mechanized and Infantry units in FY16\/17.\n\nNote:  FY16 and prior funding for Nett Warrior resided in 0604827A (Soldier Systems - Warrior Dem\/Val) Project S75 (Ground Soldier Ensemble)."

The NW is focused on Team Leader and higher echelons and provides an integrated secure information-centric Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) mobile application-based computation platform with data collection, enhanced SA, mission planning, and navigational aid functions overlaid on geo-referenced maps and high resolution imagery throughout a brigade.  The NW enables real-time ground tactical-level knowledge sharing and command and control (C2), directly impacting combat effectiveness and decision-making.  The NW also improves lower echelon intelligence production and analysis capabilities which are central to efficient and effective counter-insurgency warfare.  NW program completed LRIP\/MS C in 2012 followed by two LRIP decisions in 2013-14 in preparation for IOT&E under DOT&E oversight in 4QFY14-1QFY15.  This IOT&E event lead to an additional NW Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision in 2015 and a Full Rate Production Decision is planned for mid FY17.  From this decision NW will complete annual production and fielding events based on yearly development, integration and testing of emerging advanced smart devices to lower cost, weigh and power.  To capitalize on commercial industry\u2019s investment in advanced smart device technology as well as innovation and changes within Army, NW requires annual RDT&E funding for integration and evaluation.  Through this process and at low cost, the Army is able to integrate and evaluate for combat utility the hundreds of millions spent in product development by the major commercial device manufactures."
