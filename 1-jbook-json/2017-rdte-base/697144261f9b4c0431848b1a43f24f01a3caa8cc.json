Associated ground systems include RIVET JOINT Mission Trainers (RJMT, a.k.a. mission crew simulators), Ground Data Processing Systems (GDPS), Distributed Mission Shelters (DMS), Mission Crew Training Systems (MCTS), Airborne Capabilities Extension System (ACES), and the Operational Flight Trainers (OFT, a.k.a. flight deck simulators).  Extensive utilization of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) based solutions allows rapid fielding of needed capabilities through upgrades and supports Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS)\/Vanishing Vendor Items (VVI) logistics mitigation efforts.  The results of these efforts provide for preliminary assessments of technical feasibility, operability, or military utility as well as specific engineering implementations for integration into the various systems baseline configurations.  \n\nThese activities are managed by the Air Force through the 645th Aeronautical System Group (645 AESG).  The 645 AESG (a.k.a. BIG SAFARI Systems Program Office or SPO) manages engineering, ground and support systems modifications, integration, flight testing, product assurance, acceptance testing, logistics, and training activities.  \n\nAircraft, sensor systems, and associated ground support system engineering planned for FY 2017 budget includes developmental planning, execution and support for the RC-135V\/W RIVET JOINT Baselines 12 and 13, the RC-135U COMBAT SENT Baselines 5 and 6, and the RC-135S COBRA BALL Baseline 5 and 6 configurations.  The world-wide challenge of keeping pace against technologically agile targets used by both nation and non-nation-state adversaries and the rapid evolution of COTS technologies demands a responsive and adaptive acquisition strategy for fielding incremental spiral upgrades and baseline capabilities that are logistically supportable at all locations.  The BIG SAFARI SPO uses an incremental baseline strategy to mitigate risk, find affordable solutions and field needed capabilities on the aircraft and associated ground support and training systems.  Obsolescence and DMS\/VVI logistical concerns are addressed with each baseline upgrade strategy and assessed annually as part of the fleet sustainment responsibilities.  \n\nRIVET JOINT Baseline 12 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, increased digital signal exploitation, increased digital signal recorder bandwidth, enhanced spatial processing\/exploitation, enhanced weather radar, digitally enhanced electronic flight instrument system (EFIS), continued Communications, Navigation and Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) and Required Navigational Performance (RNP) compliant cockpit avionics enhancements, Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF-DCGS) interoperability, operator work station 3-D map projection, enhanced operator reporting management tools, modernized communications security (COMSEC) protocols, and a new steerable beam antenna.  RIVET JOINT Baseline 13 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, providing a continuous recording capability, Super Wideband Compressive Receiver (SWCR) and Nyquist Folding Receiver (NYFR), global air traffic management (GATM) avionics upgrades such as new autopilot, automated data system-broadcast (ADS-B) and Mode 5 identify friendly or foe (IFF) systems, and family of beyond-line-of-sight terminals (FAB-T) advanced extremely high frequency (AEHF) communications suite. \n\nCOMBAT SENT Baseline 5 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, active ranging and theater networked geo-location (TNG) capability, Proforma search and classification tools, cooling duct and lighting improvements, CORVUS related precision electronic intelligence (ELINT) SWCR enhancements, RJ Baseline 13 communications intelligence (COMINT), upgraded computer architecture, primary sensor measurement system (PRISMS), wideband global satellite (WGS) communications enhanced integration, development of an airborne tracking system, communications upgrade to include Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS-J), and continued Communications, Navigation and Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) and Required Navigational Performance (RNP) compliant cockpit avionics enhancements.  COMBAT SENT Baseline 6 developmental enhancements consist of, but are not limited to, steerable beams for the COMINT sub-system, improved SWCR capability and specific emitter ID\/SET ELINT sub-system, PRISMS merge with manual precision collections, millimeter wave and low band capabilities with PRISMS, digitizing antennas, direction finding of High Frequency signals and expanded streaming audio services and 360 degree aircraft tracking system.\n\nCOBRA BALL Baseline 5 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, RJ Baseline 11 COMINT, Medium-Wave Infra-Red Acquisition (MIRA) sensor\/processor upgrade, measurements and signature intelligence (MASINT) Collection System (MCS) optical upgrade, WGS communications enhanced integration, communications upgrades to include MIDS-J and an intercom system (FORCE), U-Band antenna, continued CNS\/ATM and RNP compliant cockpit avionics enhancements, and foreign instrumentation intelligence (FISINT) system refresh.  COBRA BALL Baseline 6 developmental enhancements consist of, but are not limited to, high gain S-Band antenna, large format Sapphire windows, RJ Baseline 13 COMINT capability, FISINT analog to digital receiver, and Brave version of the digital cockpit avionics systems to continue CNS\/ATM and RNP compliance initiatives.          \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fielding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
