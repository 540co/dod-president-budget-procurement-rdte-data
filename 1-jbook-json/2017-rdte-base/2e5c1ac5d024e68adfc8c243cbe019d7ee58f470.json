The objectives directly support policy and planning guidance from the Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.\n\nThe portfolio advances DTRA\u2019s Countering WMD (CWMD) mission by balancing the following imperatives: invest in DTRA\u2019s applied research capabilities and increase the CWMD technology base to maximize future pay-off; capitalize on opportunities to deliver innovative, cost-effective solutions to technical challenges that must be resolved prior to system-specific technology investigations and development; and ensure applied research efforts are directly aligned to mission-specific capability requirements of DTRA, the Military Departments, Combatant Commanders, other DoD and federal agencies, and international partners."

This effort also provides management and support of the Threat Reduction Advisory Committee.  The committee is a senior-level Federal Advisory Committee, which provides independent expert advice on CWMD to the Secretary of Defense through the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, and the Assistant Secretary of Defense4 for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Defense Matters.  This effort also funds the Next Generation Nuclear Professionals (NextGen) activities.  This is an outreach effort that encourages collaboration between those currently in the nuclear field and those who are considering entering that field. The effort consists of conferences, working groups, a debate series, publications, international outreach, an online presence, and a Nuclear Scholars effort.\n\nThe increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment in advanced analytics and modeling and simulation.

In accordance with Department of Defense Directive S-2060.04, DTRA serves as the US Government lead for post-detonation National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) research and development (R&D). As the central NTNF R&D coordinator, DTRA works in consultation with interagency partners to develop and improve ground-based capabilities supporting exploitation and attribution missions.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the realignment of nuclear threat detection activities into Project RD-Detection Technologies.  The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 reflects increased investment in nuclear device characterization for forensics and nuclear forensic materials exploitation for attribution."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of WMD threat materials, an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and the physical and nonphysical support networks enabling both. It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes and selecting technologies for integration into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities. This effort includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, sub-scale test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation Countering WMD (CWMD) capabilities. The project places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials. Technologies with the potential for weapon and capability integration are transitioned to the advanced technology development effort under this project. On a limited basis, technology test data is shared with coalition partners.\n\nThe decrease from FY2015 to FY2016 is due to reduced investment in next generation CWMD technologies to balance other priorities.

Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is designated by the Department of Defense (DoD) as the center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) survivability assessments. The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD\u2019s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. The radiation hardened nano-electronics effort develops and demonstrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD space and strategic system requirements.  Experimental Capabilities activities provide the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and EMP test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment. This effort leverages research from and coordinates with the National Nuclear Security Administration (United States) and the Atomic Weapons Establishment (United Kingdom) to develop enabling technologies for improved nuclear weapon effects experimentation capabilities.  Nuclear Technology Analysis Support provides detailed planning related to policy, strategy, objectives, and programmatic integration. This project also supports international collaboration, user groups, and case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group. The Human Survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects.  \n\nThe increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the realignment of system vulnerabilities and assessment activities from Project RL-Nuclear & Radiological Effects to Project RI.  The increase from FY 2016 to FY 2017 is due to the net effect of increased investment in system vulnerability and assessment and nuclear weapons effects experimentation and decreased investment in radiation hardening nano-electronics."

The test bed offers test instrumentation (data acquisition systems and optics), scientific analysis and predictions, test article construction, test article\/test bed remediation, tunnel mining, architectural and engineering design, systems engineering and integration, and test data management. The facility leverages fifty years of expertise in investigating weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferant nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD. Subject matter experts design full and sub-scale testing strategies focusing on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels. This capability does not exist anywhere else within the Department of Defense (DoD) and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Counter WMD.  \n\nThe increase from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to increased investment in test and technology support and the national test bed.
