            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE provides the unique, fundamental programmatic instrument by which basic research on the natural environment is transformed into technological developments that provide new or enhanced warfare capabilities for the Battlespace Environment (BSE).  The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and applying environmental factors affecting naval material and operations in the BSE.  This program provides for BSE technological developments that contribute to meeting top joint warfare capabilities established by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with primary emphasis on Joint Littoral Warfare and Joint Strike Warfare. \n\nThis PE fully supports the Director of Defense Research and Engineering's Science and Technology Strategy and is coordinated with other DoD Components through the Defense Science and Technology Reliance process.  Work in this program is related to and fully coordinated with efforts in accordance with the on-going Reliance joint planning process.  There is close coordination with the US Air Force and US Army under the Reliance program in the BSE categories of Lower Atmosphere, Ocean Environments, Space & Upper Atmosphere, and Terrestrial Environments.  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, the investment will contribute toward achieving each of the \"key transformational capabilities\" required by Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing.  Moreover, environmental information, environmental models, and environmental tactical decision aids that emerge from this investment will form one of the essential components of FORCEnet (which is the architecture for a highly adaptive, human-centric, comprehensive maritime system that operates from seabed to space).  The Navy program includes efforts that focus on, or have attributes that enhance, the affordability of warfighting systems.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This project contains the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) (Title II, subtitle E, of Public Law 104-201) and efforts aimed\nat understanding and predicting the impacts of underwater sound on marine mammals.\n\nMajor efforts of this project are devoted to: gaining real-time knowledge of the BSE, determining the natural environment needs of regional warfare, providing the on-scene commander with the capability to exploit the environment to tactical advantage and, developing atmospheric research related to detection of sea-skimming missiles and strike warfare. This project provides natural environment applied research for all fleet operations and for current or emerging systems. Major developments are routinely transitioned to the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center and to the Naval Oceanographic Office where they are used to provide timely information about the natural environment for all fleet operations.\n\nJoint Littoral Warfare efforts address issues in undersea, surface, and air battlespace. Efforts include ocean and atmospheric analysis and prediction for real-time description of the operational environment, shallow water acoustics, multiple-influence sensors for undersea surveillance and weapon systems, and influences of the natural environment on MCM and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) systems. Joint Strike Warfare efforts address issues in air battlespace dominance. Efforts include influences of the natural environment on air operations, electromagnetic (EM)\/electro-optic (EO) systems used in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, bomb damage assessment, and detection of missile weapon systems. They also include improvements in tactical information management about the BSE."

This activity studies underwater acoustic propagation, scattering from ocean boundaries, and ambient noise issues that impact the development and employment of acoustic systems. The Littoral Zone (LZ) has been the ocean environment of greatest interest. Aspects of this environment, that greatly impact underwater acoustic systems, are the shallow water included in the Littoral Zone, the consequent closeness and physical significance of the ocean bottom, and the complexities inherent to rapid changes of the ocean structure. The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and exploiting ocean acoustic factors to gain advantage over potential adversaries using undersea acoustic systems. Results of this activity support acoustic sensor and system development, performance prediction, and tactical decision aids.\n\nFunding decrease from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is due to the completion of efforts associated with acoustic performance predictions."

This is achieved through the development of predictive models of the water mass structure, waves, currents, and air-sea interactions and developing measurement\/observation technology. Other applications utilize knowledge of the interaction of the water column hydrodynamics and the acoustics to predict the undersea transmission characteristics and sources of uncertainty in these statistics. Utilizing knowledge of the ocean surface physics, the physical oceanography program seeks to exploit the combination of remotely sensed data, in-situ data, and adaptively sampled data to optimize predictions of ocean currents and water column structure. These predictions, custom databases, adaptive sampling schemes and data programs serve ASW, Naval Special Warfare (NSW), Sea-Basing, and mine warfare needs."

Bids were evaluated, and the winning shipyard will be announced before the end of FY15.  Deliverables will support environmental compliance requirements regarding ballast water treatment, marine sanitation, engine exhaust, incinerator exhaust, air conditioning refrigerants, and oily-water separation.  Additional deliverables will overcome obsolescence of diesel engine and electrical system components, and enhanced the ship safety with piping replacements in the ship's firemain and ballast water systems."
