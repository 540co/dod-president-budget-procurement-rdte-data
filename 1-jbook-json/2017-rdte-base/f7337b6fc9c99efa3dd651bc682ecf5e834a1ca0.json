UxS platforms for initial CCS transition include CBARS, Triton (MQ-4), and Fire Scout (MQ-8).  Efforts will include exploring opportunities for other UxS platforms from across all domains to benefit from CCS invested developments.\n \nIncrement II will maintain and update, as necessary, the core VM baseline and add common MM\/MP capabilities hosted on legacy platform hardware.  \n\nIncrement III aligns Common Control software and hardware for the Naval UxS control segment.\n\nCCS is a ship\/shore\/airborne\/expeditionary based common control segment that provides VM and MM\/MP capabilities for Naval Group 2 through 5 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and other domain UxS's. The CCS will provide open software architecture, based on the OSD Unmanned Control Segment (UCS) architecture, that is agile and scalable to evolving Service requirements and is supportive of safety\/airworthiness certification and cybersecurity certification and accreditation. \n\nThe CCS PU funds two Speed-to-the-Fleet capability initiatives in FY17: 1) Full Motion Video (FMV) for Geo-intelligence Unified Naval Streaming System (GUNSS) and 2) Moving Target Indicator (MTI) for Broad Area Maritime Surveillance - Demonstrator (BAMS-D).\n\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

In alignment with the newly established Office of the Chief of Naval Operations Directorate for Unmanned Warfare Systems (OPNAV N99), the CCS acquisition approach is to provide increasing UxS capability through incremental development for UxS platforms as follows: \n\nIncrement I will provide unmanned vehicle control functionality for launch & recovery, maneuvering & stationing, situational awareness, and health & performance status with a common Vehicle Management (VM) capability using legacy platform Mission Management\/Mission Planning (MM\/MP) capabilities hosted on legacy platform hardware.  UxS platforms for initial CCS transition include CBARS, Triton (MQ-4), and Fire Scout (MQ-8).  Efforts will include exploring opportunities for other UxS platforms from across all domains to benefit from CCS invested developments.\n \nIncrement II will maintain and update, as necessary, the core VM baseline and add common MM\/MP capabilities hosted on legacy platform hardware.  \n\nIncrement III aligns Common Control software and hardware for the Naval UxS control segment.\n\nCCS is a ship\/shore\/airborne\/expeditionary based common control segment that provides VM and MM\/MP capabilities for Naval Group 2 through 5 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and other domain UxS's. The CCS will provide open software architecture, based on the OSD Unmanned Control Segment (UCS) architecture, that is agile and scalable to evolving Service requirements and is supportive of safety\/airworthiness certification and cybersecurity certification and accreditation. \n\nThe CCS PU funds two Speed-to-the-Fleet capability initiatives in FY17: 1) Full Motion Video (FMV) for Geo-intelligence Unified Naval Streaming System (GUNSS) and 2) Moving Target Indicator (MTI) for Broad Area Maritime Surveillance - Demonstrator (BAMS-D).\n\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

In coordination with the ADM the program will define, develop and deliver a common control system to operate respective naval Unmanned Systems (UxSs). This will include a common framework, a common user interface, and common components that will be integrated and tested with unique components on emerging or legacy platforms. The CCS acquisition approach is to provide increasing UxS capability through incremental development for UxS platform as follows: Increment I will provide common Vehicle Management capability with Carrier Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS), Triton, and Fire Scout as the initial transition platforms;  Increment II will maintain and update as necessary the core VM baseline and adds Mission Management\/Mission Planning capability;  Increment III aligns Common Control software and hardware for the Naval UxS control segment. CCS was being developed initially for the UCLASS Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program and will be provided to the CBARS air vehicle prime as Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE) and also for transition into Triton and Firescout. CCS will leverage existing government-owned products as well as employ competitive procurement vehicles to support CBARS and will transition Triton, Firescout, and other Naval UxS across multiple domains."
