            "val": "This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its objective is to develop material, biological and energy technologies that make possible a wide range of new military capabilities.\n\nThe major goal of the Materials Processing Technology project is to develop novel materials, materials processing techniques, mathematical models and fabrication strategies for advanced materials, devices and components that will lower the cost, increase the performance, and\/or enable new missions for military platforms and systems.  Included in this project are efforts across a wide range of materials including structural materials and devices, functional materials and devices, energetic materials and devices, low distortion optical lenses, and materials that enable new propulsion concepts for land, sea, and space vehicles.\n\nThe Biologically Based Materials and Devices project acknowledges the growing and pervasive influence of the biological sciences on the development of new DoD capabilities.  This influence extends throughout the development of new materials, devices, and processes and relies on the integration of biological breakthroughs with those in engineering and the physical sciences.  Contained in this project are thrusts in the application of biomimetic materials and devices for Defense, the use of biology's unique fabrication capabilities to produce structures that cannot be made any other way, the application of materials in biological applications, and the development of manufacturing tools that use biological components and processes for materials synthesis.  This project also includes major efforts aimed at integrating biological and digital sensing methodologies and maintaining human combat performance despite the extraordinary stressors of combat.  Finally, this thrust will develop new cognitive therapeutics, investigate the role of complexity in biological systems, and explore neuroscience technologies."

As a result of recent advances in manufacturing techniques (3D printing, manufacture on demand, etc.) and the push towards programmable hardware in embedded systems, the development cycle from design to production of both hardware and software is severely bottlenecked at the design phase.  Further research within this thrust, will create methods to translate natural inputs into software code and mechanical design.  This process will complete underspecified designs when possible and initiate an iterative dialog with a human to specify details as needed and actively suggest changes to designers when the intended design cannot operate within the required specifications."

One goal of this research is the ability to design, develop, and demonstrate materials with combinations of properties that are normally orthogonal (e.g., damage tolerance and biocompatibility).  This capability will ultimately lead to enhanced lethality, survivability, and performance in future DoD platforms.  This thrust will also include the exploration and development of dynamic models of complex systems across scale and develop new methodologies for understanding, architecting, and engineering complex systems.  These computational tools will link material properties to physics across multiple length scales (from molecule to part) and provide the ability to model and exploit complexity, such as hierarchy and strongly correlated effects, in structural and functional materials.  Development efforts under this thrust include reactive structures that can serve as both structure and explosive for lightweight munitions, novel materials and surfaces that are designed to adapt structural or functional properties to environmental and\/or tactical threat conditions, and new thin film material deposition processes to improve the performance of surface dominated properties (friction, wear, and membrane permeability).  In addition, this thrust will also explore new cost effective processes for ensuring DoD accessibility to future advanced materials.  Examples of DoD applications that will benefit from these material developments include lower weight and higher performance aircraft, turbines with enhanced efficiency, erosion-resistant rotor blades, and high-temperature materials for operation in hypersonic environments."

The ability to create entirely new optical materials and surfaces creates the potential for new or significantly improved military optical applications, such as solar concentrators, portable designators, highly efficient fiber optics, and imaging systems.  The program also seeks to extend GRIN manufacturing technologies to glass, ceramic, and other inorganic materials in order to allow for small, lightweight, customized optical elements for mid-wave and long-wave infrared (MWIR and LWIR) applications.  A key component of the program is to develop new design tools that enable optics designers to incorporate dynamic material properties, fabrication methods, and manufacturing tolerances.  The integration of new materials, design tools, and manufacturing processes will enable previously unattainable 3-D optical designs to be manufactured.

This thrust will develop new high-throughput technologies for monitoring the function of cellular machinery at the molecular level and the response(s) of that machinery to physical, chemical, or biological threats.  While conventional approaches typically require decades of research, new high-throughput approaches will permit rapid assessment of the impact of known or unknown threats on identified biomolecules and cell function.  Successful research in this thrust will both reduce the time required to understand the mechanism of action for new pharmaceutical compounds and enhance response capabilities for emerging and engineered threats."

With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments, and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value molecules.  \n\nResearch thrusts will focus on the development and demonstration of open technology platforms to prove out capabilities for rapid (months vs. years) design and construction of new bio-production systems.  The result will be an integrated, modular infrastructure across the areas of design, fabrication, debugging, analysis, optimization, and validation -- spanning the entire development life-cycle and enabling the ability to rapidly assess and improve designs.  Key to success will be tight coupling of computational design, fabrication of systems, debugging using multiple characterization data types, analysis, and further development such that iterative design and experimentation will be accurate, efficient and controlled.  Demonstration platforms will be challenged to build a variety of DoD-relevant, novel molecules with complex functionalities, such as synthesis of advanced, functional chemicals, materials precursors, and polymers (e.g., those tolerant of harsh environments).

Warfighters experience a wide variety of operational stressors, both mental and physical, that degrade critical cognitive functions such as memory, learning, and decision making.  These stressors also degrade the warfighter's ability to multitask, leading to decreased ability to respond quickly and effectively.  Currently, the long-term impact of these stressors on the brain is unknown, both at the molecular and behavioral level.  This thrust area investigated modern neuroscientific techniques to develop quantitative models of this impact and explored mechanisms to protect, maintain, complement, or restore physical and cognitive functioning during and after exposure to operational stressors.  In addition, new approaches for using physiological and neural signals to make human-machine systems more time efficient and less workload intense were identified."
