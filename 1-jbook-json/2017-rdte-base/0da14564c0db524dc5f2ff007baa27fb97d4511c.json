Links geographically distributed high-fidelity combat and combat support training devices including Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems.  Develops, demonstrates and inserts multi-level security capability.  This capability allows the warfighters at home station to exercise and train at the operational and strategic levels of war as well as conduct networked unit-level training."

The Training Simulation Service (TSS) acquisition strategy was used to meet a portion of these requirements.  In the TSS approach, the contractor owns and provides the simulator equipment, maintains simulator concurrency with weapon systems, and has incentives to keep the equipment up to date with simulator and network technologies. Currently fielded and projected Air Force-owned Flight and Mission Training Systems without DMO\/LVC capability will be modified using Full Combat Mission Training (FCMT) funds to ensure compatibility with the DMO-LVC environment."
