Experiments and projects inform the Army future concepts and assess high-risk conceptual assumptions in order to focus required capabilities and represent the user's requirements in the future Army.  Army experiments use the combined resources of Army battle laboratories, operational units, research labs, materiel developers, industry and academia to collaborate in the development, refinements, and assessment of future force concepts - to inform capability developments and validate concepts for current and future force.  Due to significant reduction in funding, beginning in FY 2015, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding will on Simulated Experiments (SIMEX) to integrate and assess Army Concepts, Force Designs phases, with Army level issues across the breadth of a campaign that highlights validation and integration of Force 2025 outcomes.\n\nEnables TRADOC Capability Development and Integration Directorates (CDID)\/TRADOC Capability Managers (TCM) Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) development to support Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) for acquisition milestone decisions.  The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA(ALT) organizational community of PEOs\/PMs supplemented manpower shortfalls to TRADOC for many years. This was necessary to ensure work affecting their materiel development programs, specifically the mandated JCIDS process necessary for Milestone acquisition AROC\/JROC decisions, was executed in a timely manner.  During POM 14-18, the EE PEG funded a strategy for ASA(ALT) to drawdown support as TRADOC received funding in a phased approach, to maintain this workforce.  The strategy has been implemented in 25% increments beginning in FY14 with TRADOC being 100% responsible in FY17.  Funding ensures TRADOC acts independently as the voice of the warfighter, the user, in complement with the materiel developer in providing total capability management including integration of all doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF)consideration for warfighting functional areas.  Provides for TRADOC serves as the lead for Accelerated Capability Development (ACD) to address current critical operational needs enabling development and deployment\/employment of accelerated capabilities (both materiel and non-materiel) to the current force.  Early Synthetic Prototyping enables wargaming, experimentation capability that engages soldiers across the Army through early-fidelity game environments to gain their insights and recommendations in the development of future doctrine, organization, and materiel solutions.  Serve as TRADOC central coordinating organization for Headquarters Department of the Army (HDA) staff support requirements related to accelerated capabilities developments.  Integrate accelerated capabilities development activities between proponent force modernization domains to include Joint\/Service coordination.  Provides Army Warfighter Assessments (AWA), which will allow TRADOC to physically integrate, assess and evaluate the network, capability sets and other adaptive capabilities to accelerate the systems acquisition process of providing DOTMLPF recommendations to the Army. Provides support to the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFC) that are used by the Army to frame learning and collaboration."

Experiments and projects inform the Army future concepts and assess high-risk conceptual assumptions in order to focus required capabilities and represent the user's requirements in the future Army.  Army experiments use the combined resources of Army battle laboratories, operational units, research labs, materiel developers, industry and academia to collaborate in the development, refinements, and assessment of future force concepts - to inform capability developments and validate concepts for current and future force.  Due to significant reduction in funding, beginning in FY 2015, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding will on Simulated Experiments (SIMEX) to integrate and assess Army Concepts, Force Designs phases, with Army level issues across the breadth of a campaign that highlights validation and integration of Force 2025 outcomes.\n\nEnables TRADOC Capability Development and Integration Directorates (CDID)\/TRADOC Capability Managers (TCM) Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) development to support Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) for acquisition milestone decisions.  The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA(ALT) organizational community of PEOs\/PMs supplemented manpower shortfalls to TRADOC for many years. This was necessary to ensure work affecting their materiel development programs, specifically the mandated JCIDS process necessary for Milestone acquisition AROC\/JROC decisions, was executed in a timely manner.  During POM 14-18, the EE PEG funded a strategy for ASA(ALT) to drawdown support as TRADOC received funding in a phased approach, to maintain this workforce.  The strategy has been implemented in 25% increments beginning in FY14 with TRADOC being 100% responsible in FY17.  Funding ensures TRADOC acts independently as the voice of the warfighter, the user, in complement with the materiel developer in providing total capability management including integration of all doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF)consideration for warfighting functional areas.  Provides for TRADOC serves as the lead for Accelerated Capability Development (ACD) to address current critical operational needs enabling development and deployment\/employment of accelerated capabilities (both materiel and non-materiel) to the current force.  Early Synthetic Prototyping enables wargaming, experimentation capability that engages soldiers across the Army through early-fidelity game environments to gain their insights and recommendations in the development of future doctrine, organization, and materiel solutions.  Serve as TRADOC central coordinating organization for Headquarters Department of the Army (HDA) staff support requirements related to accelerated capabilities developments.  Integrate accelerated capabilities development activities between proponent force modernization domains to include Joint\/Service coordination.  Provides Army Warfighter Assessments (AWA), which will allow TRADOC to physically integrate, assess and evaluate the network, capability sets and other adaptive capabilities to accelerate the systems acquisition process of providing DOTMLPF recommendations to the Army. Provides support to the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFC) that are used by the Army to frame learning and collaboration."
