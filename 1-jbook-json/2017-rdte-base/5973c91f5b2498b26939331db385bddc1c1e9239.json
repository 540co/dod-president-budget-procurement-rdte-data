The keys to a secure space environment are situational awareness to detect and characterize potential threats, a proliferation of assets to provide robustness against attack, ready access to space, and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit assets.  Ready access to space requires the delivery of capabilities, replenishment of supplies into orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities.  Developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space.\n\nSystems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terrestrial users.  Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness; enabling concepts include novel power\/propulsion\/propellants, unique manufacturing or assembly processes; and precision control of multi-payload systems."

A critically important technology gap is integration into a flight demonstration able to deliver aircraft-like operability.  The program will validate key technologies on the ground, and then fabricate an X-Plane to demonstrate: 1) 10 flights in 10 days,  2) up to Mach 10+ flight, and 3) design capable of a 10X lower cost space access for cargos from 3,000-5,000 lbs to low earth orbit.  A key goal is validating the critical technologies for a wide range of next generation high speed aircraft enabling new military capabilities including worldwide reconnaissance, global transport, small responsive space access aircraft and affordable spacelift.

A large number of national security and commercial space systems operate at geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) altitudes; furthermore, many end-of-life or failed spacecraft drift without control through portions of the GEO belt, creating a growing hazard to operational spacecraft.  Technologies for servicing of spacecraft with the expectation that such servicing would involve a mix of highly autonomous and remotely (i.e., ground-based) tele-operated robotic systems have been previously pursued.  The Phoenix program will build upon these legacy technologies, tackling the more complex GEO environment and expanding beyond pure traditional servicing functions.  The program will examine utilization of a new commercial ride-along system to GEO called Payload Orbital Delivery (POD) system, supporting hardware delivery for upgrading, repairing, assembling, and reconfiguring satellites.  In addition, the program will include a LEO flight experiment focused on satlets, modular building blocks for space systems, as a path of risk reduction for modular assembly on orbit.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and the commercial spacecraft servicing providers."

This capability enables ground-based detection of un-cued objects in deep space for purposes such as asteroid detection and space defense missions.  The initial program is transitioning to Air Force Space Command.\n\nThe SST Australia effort will provide a further operational demonstration of the SST at the Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt near Exmouth, Western Australia.  Such a location presents a more operationally relevant demonstration, with a richer and more interesting population of SSA targets in geosynchronous orbit.  A demonstration in New Mexico will validate telescope performance comparable to the requirement in Australia.  In addition, the demonstration will generate data for analysis and fusion efforts, which will be used to further refine and evaluate data processing techniques, such as those developed under the data fusion effort.  This program will address technical challenges which may arise from an Australian site, including adaptations to a different telescope environment, and the logistical and communications challenges presented by a site significantly more remote than the current SST location."

This enables rapid delivery of spacecraft in response to evolving situations, such as a humanitarian crisis or unexpected conflict, and is accomplished by developing rapid mission planning tools which streamline existing range processes, and automated flight safety systems which reduce reliance on expensive and fragile range infrastructure.  These tools enable the program's third goal: to escape the limitations of fixed launch sites by achieving a greater flexibility in the direction and location of launch.  Challenges include, but are not limited to: development of a high-energy, low cost monopropellant, development of alternatives to current range processes, and achieving a cost per flight of one million dollars, including range support costs, to deploy satellites on the order of one hundred pounds.

The program will demonstrate the technologies needed to assemble a large (>5m) and near-diffraction limited optical aperture from modular components that are launched as separate payloads.  The program will include a scalable zero-g demonstration of a functional optical system that maintains the precision and large-scale physical stability required, and utilizes at least one segmented optical surface.  This program will address technical challenges of precision mechanical assembly from modular components, multiple object rendezvous and coupling in space, and active surface measurement, compensation and control.  Modular construction in space is intrinsically more challenging than ground-based assembly in that there is not necessarily any measurement and support infrastructure and equipment available, such as interferometer test towers.  Therefore, the modular pieces and system design must include self-contained measurement and alignment capabilities to be employed after or during assembly.  The OASIS program will demonstrate the feasibility of assembling complex and highly precise structures in space which, in assembled form, are larger than the capacity of any existing or planned space launch vehicle.  This capability could enable a number of surveillance and communications instruments in orbit that are not possible today or in the near future under the current paradigm.

Current space surveillance sensors cannot detect, track, or determine the future location and threat potential of small advanced technology spacecraft in deep space orbits, where a majority of DoD spacecraft are located.  Additionally, servicing missions to geosynchronous earth (GEO) orbits will require exquisite situational awareness, from ultra-high-accuracy debris tracking for mission assurance at GEO orbits to high resolution imaging of GEO spacecraft for service mission planning.\n\nSDA will investigate revolutionary technologies in two areas: 1) advanced space surveillance sensors to better detect, track, and characterize space objects, with an emphasis on deep space objects, and 2) space surveillance data collection, data archival, and data processing\/fusion to provide automated data synergy.  The resulting increase in space domain awareness will enhance overall space safety of flight, and allow space operators to make informed, timely decisions.  The SDA program will leverage data fusion and advanced algorithms developed under the Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) program, as well as seek to exploit new ground-breaking technologies across the electromagnetic spectrum and utilize already existing sensor technology in nontraditional or exotic ways, to bring advanced capabilities to the space domain.  SDA will demonstrate new approaches to collection of data utilizing a variety of collection modalities, ranging from fusion of observations from non-traditional sources, such as amateur astronomers, to evaluation of sparse aperture imaging techniques."
