            "val": "Project 093. The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7, tracked weapon system. These precision strike weapon systems are organic\/assigned to Field Artillery Brigades (FABs). The MLRS launcher provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  In FY16 a third battalion of MLRS launchers will be added to United States Forces Korea (USFK).  Army Prepositioned Stock requirements have increased to eight M270A1s in FY16. The launcher is complemented by the MLRS Family of Munitions (MFOM) to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM), capable of engaging targets up to a range of 300 kilometers.  The MLRS product improvement program provides funding for research, development, test, and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armament, and system hardware and software technologies, including Common Operating Environment (COE) and Network Integrated Evaluation (NIE), obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements, and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements. The MLRS product improvement program maintains compliance with intra-army interoperability and digital communications via joint variable message format.\n\nProject DX8. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system that fully supports more deployable, affordable and lethal, Brigade Combat Teams (BCT), Fires Brigades, Modular Forces, and Joint Expeditionary Forces.  The HIMARS launcher is a C-130 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing all rockets and missiles in the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM) engaging targets with precision out to ranges of 300 kilometers. The HIMARS satisfies the Army's digitization requirements by interfacing with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) fire support command and control system. The HIMARS product improvement program provides funding for research, development test, and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armor, armament, life cycle enhancements, system hardware and software technologies, including Common Operating Environment (COE) and Network Integrated Evaluation (NIE), obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The HIMARS product improvement program maintains compliance with Intra-Army Interoperability and Digital Communications.  Army prepositioned stock requirement has increased to twenty-four HIMARS in FY16.  The HIMARS was deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with great success by both US Army and Marine Corps units.\n\nProject DZ8. LRPF is being developed as a non-cluster munition to provide Joint Force Command with a 24\/7 all weather long-range fires capability without placing aircraft and crews at risk.  FY2017 funding for Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) has been realigned to a new OSD-directed PE 0607134A, Project ES1."

Development efforts underway include EC2 and efforts supporting interoperability certifications, information assurance compliance, IAC, and mitigating obsolescence of the Fire Control System through the FCS-U effort.  The IAC effort enhances the level of crew protection. A contract was awarded following a competitive bid process (full and open competition) to ensure best value for the government.   Seven prototype cabs have been delivered and integrated onto the launchers; testing was completed in FY15.  The FCS-U is driven by the need to mitigate obsolete electronic components that are being sustained through life of type purchases. These purchased components will be exhausted, thus requiring an update to the design.  This update to the design will preserve current and future capability of firing the complete set of MLRS family of munitions per the Operational Requirements Document (ORD). The FCS-U development effort began in FY13, utilizing the Industrial Engineering Services (IES) contract that was previously sole source awarded."

The HIMARS launcher is a C-130 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing all rockets and missiles in the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) and Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Family of Munitions (AFOM) engaging targets with precision out to ranges of 300 kilometers.  The HIMARS satisfies the Army's digitization requirements by interfacing with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) fire support command and control system.  The HIMARS product improvement program provides funding for research, development, test and integration efforts necessary for incorporation of advanced automotive, armor, armament, life cycle enhancements, system hardware and software technologies, including Common Operating Environment (COE) and Network Integrated Evaluation (NIE), obsolescence mitigation, reliability improvements, and decreasing the logistics footprint.  This effort includes performing technical assessments, concept studies, and risk reduction efforts for incorporation of future requirements.  The HIMARS product improvement program maintains compliance with Intra-Army Interoperability and Digital Communications. Army prepositioned stock requirements has increased to twenty-four HIMARS in FY16. The HIMARS was deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) with great success by both U.S. Army and Marine Corps units."

The mission of the LRPF System will be to attack\/neutralize\/suppress\/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires.  The LRPF will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations.  Targets include counterfire, air defense, command and control, and other high payoff targets at all depths of the tactical battlefield. LRPF requirements include 300km range; specified lethality against the designated target set, a Missile Launch Pod Container (MLPC) that holds a minimum of two missiles; and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)).  The Army has completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), in accordance with Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) approved Material Development Decision (MDD) on 6 November 2013.  The AoA was completed on 30 April 2015 and a letter of sufficiency issued by OSD in August 2015.\n\nThe Army initially funded the development of the LRPF under PE 0603778A, Proj DZ8.  The LRPF program currently has a Milestone (MS) A Decision scheduled for 1QFY16.  Funding was requested in FY2016 to conduct competitive sub-system risk reduction activities under DoD Section 845 Other Transaction Authority (OTA), to mature the rocket motor and warhead technology to support the award of Technology Maturation\/Risk Reduction (TM\/RR) system demonstration contracts in FY17.  LRPF will be developed using competitive prototyping, carrying two or more contractors through the TM\/RR Phase.  LRPF is scheduled for a MS B in FY2020 and MS C in FY2024."

An AoA supporting a MS A decision is being conducted by U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center-White Sands Missile Range (TRAC-WSMR), with the final report to be completed in March 2015.  The Milestone Decision Authority will hold a MS A decision review in 1QFY16.  The Acquisition Strategy is for competitive prototyping for TM\/RR at both the sub-system and system demonstration levels.  After a MS A decision directing a new start LRPF system, the program office will initiate TM\/RR activities with awards in 3QFY16 for critical sub-system prototyping under the DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Section 845 (NDAA 1994) Other Transaction Authority. The program will also conduct a full and open competition in FY2016 of a 24-month TM\/RR competitive prototyping and flight demonstration phase to be awarded to two contractors in 2QFY2017.  Flight demonstrations and PDRs in FY18 will lead to a limited competition for the EMD contract and competitive down select at MS B."
