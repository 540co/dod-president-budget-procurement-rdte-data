            "val": "This Program Element (PE) supports application of knowledge gained through basic research to refine drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, medical practices\/procedures, and other preventive measures essential to the protection and sustainment of Warfighter health. Research is conducted in five principal areas: Combat Casualty Care; Military Operational Medicine; Military Relevant Infectious Diseases Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine; and Systems Biology\/Network Sciences. Research is funded in six projects.  \n\nProject 869 refines knowledge and technologies on screening tools and preventive measures for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injuries, physiological monitors, and interventions to protect Warfighter's from injuries resulting from operational stress, and exposure to hazardous environments and materials.  Also conducts research on medically valid testing devices (i.e. the test mannequins that are true to the human form and physiologically and anatomically accurate) and predictive models used for the refinement of Warfighter protective equipment. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. Starting in FY17 the FH2 funding and research will be consolidated into this project. Additionally, starting in FY17 the toxic substances research efforts will move from project VB4 to project 869.\n\nProject 870 designs and refines drugs, vaccines, medical diagnostic assays\/tests devices, other preventive measures for protection and treatment against naturally occurring infectious diseases and wound infections of military importance, as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.  \n\nProject 874 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics (products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and diagnostics for field trauma care systems, resuscitation, and life support, and post-evacuation restorative and rehabilitative care. Focus is identifying more effective critical care technologies and protocols to treat severe bleeding, traumatic brain injury, burns and other combat related traumatic injuries, and treatments for ocular (eye) injury and visual system dysfunction.  Additional focus areas are laboratory and animal studies of regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, and bone tissue for the care and treatment of combat trauma casualties. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. In FY15 and 16 this project funds both Combat Casualty Care and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine efforts. In FY17 the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine efforts will be funded in project ET4.\n\nProject ET4, which is a restructure of efforts funded elsewhere in this Program Element, starts in FY17 and the funding for the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine Research Program moves from project 874 to project ET4. Project ET4 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics, medical devices, treatments and diagnostics for post-evacuation restorative, regenerative and rehabilitative care, as well as systems for use by field medics and surgeons for ocular trauma. Research focus is on identifying more effective technologies and protocols to treat ocular injury and visual system dysfunction, as well as laboratory and animal studies for regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, vascular and bone tissues for the care and treatment of battle-injured casualties. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. \n\nProject FH2 conducts applied research focused on sustainment of a healthy Warfighters throughout the entire deployment life cycle. Starting in FY17 the FH2 funding and research will be consolidated into project 869.\n\nProject VB4 includes applied research in systems biology to provide a highly effective mechanism to integrate biological tests and computer simulations in clinical trials and in animal studies. The PTSD and Coagulopathy exemplars have demonstrated the power of an iterative systems biology approach and are moving projects related to objective diagnostics and improved and personalized therapeutic strategies. Development of the SysBioCube (a data analysis, management and integration system) has provided an ability for complex collaborative efforts to share, process and evaluate data using innovative technologies. These concerted refinement efforts using systems biology are showing reduction of time and funding for solutions to intractable problems of critical military importance. Starting in FY17 the toxic substances efforts will move from project VB4 to project 869. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nAll medical applied research is conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA requires thorough testing in animals (preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon transition to 6.3 Advanced Technology Development). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and laboratory test refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves testing in animal models. The EPA also requires thorough testing of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for use.\n\nProgram refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses (DoD) biomedical research and refinement community, as well as their associated enabling research areas.\n\nWork funded in this project PE is fully coordinated with efforts undertaken in PE 0603002A and the Defense Health Program.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD and its overseas laboratories; Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM), Fort Detrick, MD; Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA; the Army Dental Trauma Research Detachment and the Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR), Joint Base San Antonio, TX; Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), Fort Rucker, AL; and the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD."

Effective preventive countermeasures (protective\/therapeutic drugs and vaccines and insect repellents and traps) protect the Force from disease and sustain operations by avoiding the need for evacuations from the theater of operations. Diseases of military importance are malaria, bacterial diarrhea, and viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever and hantavirus). In addition to countermeasures, this project funds refinement of improved diagnostic tools to facilitate early identification of infectious disease threats in an operational environment, informing Commanders of the need to institute preventive actions and improve medical care. Major goals are to integrate genomics (DNA-based) and proteomics (protein-based) as well as other new biotechnologies into the refinement of new concepts for new vaccine, drug, and diagnostics candidates.\n\nResearch conducted in this project focuses on the following four areas:\n\n(1) Prevention\/Treatment of Parasitic (organisms living in or on another organisms) Diseases\n(2) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)\n(3) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)\n(4) Diagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control\n \nFor the refinement of drugs and biological products, studies in the laboratory and in animal models provide a proof-of-concept for these candidate products, including safety, toxicity (degree to which a substance can damage an organism), and effectiveness, and are necessary to provide evidence to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to justify approval for a product to enter into future human subject testing. Additional non-clinical studies are often needed in applied research even after candidate products enter into human testing during advanced technology development, usually at the direction of the FDA, to assess potential safety issues. Drug and vaccine refinement bears high technical risk. Of those candidates identified as promising in initial screens, the vast majority are eliminated after additional safety, toxicity, and\/or effectiveness testing. Similarly, vaccine candidates have a high failure rate, because animal testing may not be a good predictor of human response, and therefore candidate technologies\/products are often eliminated after going into human trials. Because of this high failure rate, a continuing effort to identify other potential candidates to sustain a working pipeline of countermeasures is critical for replacing those products that fail in testing.  \n\nWork is managed by the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.   \n\nPromising medical countermeasures identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, project 810.\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.   \n \nWork in this project is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories; the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID), Fort Detrick, MD; and the NMRC, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories."

This is follow-on research that extends and applies findings from over a decade of research on Gulf War Illnesses and other chronic multi-symptom illnesses that have suspected nerve and behavioral alterations caused by environmental contaminants and deployment stressors. Key databases include the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow us to evaluate interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.\n\nForce Health Protection applied research is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services working on Army projects.\n\nResearch conducted in this project focuses on the following three areas:\n(1) Millennium Cohort Research\n(2) Biomarkers of Exposure and Environmental Biomonitoring\n(3) Physiological Response and Blast and Blunt Trauma Models of Thoracic (Chest) and Pulmonary (Lung) Injuries\n \nPromising efforts identified in this project are further matured under Program Element 0603002A, Project FH4.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.    \n \nWork in this project is performed by the United States Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, CA; and the United States Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA. \n\nEfforts in this project support the Soldier Portfolio and the principal area of Combat Casualty Care."

Conduct applied research to identify and characterize (the substance itself and how it causes harm) toxic substances, e.g. toxic industrial chemicals. The molecular and physiological markers of intoxication are then applied to support diagnostic tools development of medical countermeasures. Current studies are addressing exposures to industrial chemicals, toxicogenomics (study of what genes are involved with responding to a toxic substance and those genes associated with susceptibility to the toxic substance) of metals, health surveillance with assessment of micro-biome, metabolomics of heat injury, and modeling toxicity pathways. The task funding for the toxic substances research effort moves to project 869 in FY17."
