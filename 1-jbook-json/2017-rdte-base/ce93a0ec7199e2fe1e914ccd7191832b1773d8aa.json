            "val": "This program funds design, development and test of primary target acquisition and counterfire radars to automatically detect, locate and classify hostile indirect fire weapons (mortars, artillery, and rockets).  The program directly supports the prioritization, tracking and locating of targets, and dissemination of that information for simultaneous attack of multiple threats.  It provides the Warfighter with continuous and responsive counterfire target acquisition systems for all types and phases of military operations. Project L86, Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR), version AN\/TPQ-50 provides 360 degrees of azimuth coverage from ranges of 500 meters to 10 kilometers. The AN\/TPQ-50 radars are currently fielded to multiple Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations to include operational support to Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) and Operation Freedom Sentinel (OFS).  Project L88, AN\/TPQ-53 is a highly mobile radar system that will leverage the latest in technology design to accelerate technology infusion and increase range while improving False Alarm Rate, reducing obsolescence and increasing reliability.  The AN\/TPQ-53 provides a system with increased range and accuracy throughout a 90 degree search sector (stare mode) as well as 360 degree coverage (rotating) for locating mortar, artillery and rocket firing positions.\n\nThe Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 funds of $9.235 million will support ongoing AN\/TPQ-53 test efforts and Army interoperability certifications (AICs), AN\/TPQ-50 and AN\/TPQ-53 development and testing of pre-planned product improvement (P3I) efforts for electronic protection and new and emerging threats, and the performance of technical assessments, concept studies, risk reduction and required documentation.\n\nThe FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $1.063 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances."

It mitigates close combat radar coverage gaps by providing a 90 degree search sector (stare mode) as well as 360 degree coverage (rotating) and will ultimately replace the current AN\/TPQ-36 and AN\/TPQ-37 Firefinder Radars.  The AN\/TPQ-53 system interoperates with battle command systems (BCSs) to provide the maneuver commander increased counterfire radar flexibility.  The AN\/TPQ-53 is deployed as part of the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system of systems.  It provides data to the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) node for the sense and warn force protection capability.  The AN\/TPQ-53 will be fielded to multiple Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations to include support to Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR).\n\nThe Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 funds of $6.048 million will support ongoing test efforts, Army interoperability certifications (AICs), development and testing of pre-planned product improvements (P3I) for electronic protection and new and emerging threats, and the performance of technical assessments, concept studies, risk reduction and required documentation.\n\nThe FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $1.063 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances."

In 2006, the Government awarded a contract following full and open competition for the design of the AN\/TPQ-53 radar and the purchase of four non-recurring engineering (NRE) radars.  Twelve additional quick reaction capability (QRC) radars were purchased under the same contract in response to an urgent directed procurement in July 2008.  The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved the acquisition of up to 20 more QRC radars.  Twenty systems were procured through two separate contract actions in 2010 and 2011.  A competitive production contract for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) systems was awarded in 2012 and options for additional systems were awarded in 2013, 2014, and 2015.  Production and delivery of all QRC\/Initial Production (IP) systems are complete, and production of LRIP systems is ongoing.  A Full Rate Production (FRP) decision was obtained in December 2015.  An FRP contract to fill the remainder of the Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) will be awarded no later than September 2016.  Additionally, all initial production systems will be retrofitted to the FRP configuration.  The FRP system deliveries will continue through fiscal year (FY) 2021.  The system will eventually replace all of the AN\/TPQ-36 and AN\/TPQ-37 systems in the fleet.\n\nThe Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 funds of $6.048 million will support ongoing test efforts, Army interoperability certifications (AICs), development and testing of pre-planned product improvements (P3I) for electronic protection and new and emerging threats, and the performance of technical assessments, concept studies, risk reduction and required documentation."
