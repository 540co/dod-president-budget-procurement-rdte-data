            "val": "The Avenger Air Defense System is a lightweight, highly mobile surface-to-air missile and gun weapon system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).  The system employs a canopied turret consisting of a gunner position, two gyro-stabilized missile launcher pods containing four STINGER missiles each, a Forward Looking Infrared Receiver (FLIR), a Laser Range Finder (LRF), an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, and a very high rate of fire .50 caliber machine gun.  The gun system is used against ground targets and to cover the Stinger missile dead-zone.  Avenger is capable of day, night and adverse weather operations; can be transported by UH-60L Blackhawk helicopter or C-130 aircraft; is air-droppable and can shoot on the move.  The Avenger system is operated by a two-man crew to counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs), cruise missiles, attack helicopters, and high performance fixed wing\/rotary wing aircraft. The system can also be operated by remote control from a protected position up to 50 meters away from the fire unit. The system fills the line-of-sight rear component of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) system.\nThese funds are provided to modify the Avenger to ensure viability and sustainability through the end of the useful life. Avenger is planned to remain in the force through the Fiscal Year (FY) 31. Avenger fills a capability gap which will be permanently filled by the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) which will be fully fielded in FY31. The Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC) will undergo software and hardware upgrades that will enable the system to handle increased targeting capability realized with the latest version of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) early warning system and ensures the system meets the latest Information Assurance (IA) requirements, upgraded analog to digital vehicle internal communication (VIC) system and Mode 5 cooperative target identification functions."

This capability will be permanently filled by the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) which will be fully fielded in FY31. The Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC) will undergo software and hardware upgrades that will enable the system to handle increased targeting capability realized with the latest version of the Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) early warning system and ensures the system meets the latest Information Assurance (IA) requirements, upgraded analog to digital vehicle internal communication (VIC) system, and Mode 5 cooperative target identification functions."
