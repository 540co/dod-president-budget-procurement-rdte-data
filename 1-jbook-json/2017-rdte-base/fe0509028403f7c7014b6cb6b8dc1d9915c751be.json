This integrated MCE, with its open standards, enhanced interoperability, and simplified end-user interface will speed delivery of new Mission Command applications to the warfighter while improving the effectiveness and value of current systems.  \n\nFY2017 funding provides the means to continue to develop capabilities, product applications, and security enhancements to counter the emerging cyber threat, with a focus on the integration of MCE infrastructure developments and the interoperability of the JBC-P software with other CEs."
