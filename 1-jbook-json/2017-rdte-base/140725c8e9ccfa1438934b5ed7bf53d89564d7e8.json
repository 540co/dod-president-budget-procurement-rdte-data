This PE is managed by PMS 320, the Electric Ships Office, located organizationally within PEO SHIPS, with responsibility for developing Naval Power and Energy Systems that focus on energy efficiency, providing power to mission systems, and platform integration of those components and systems.  The mission of PMS 320 is to develop and provide smaller, simpler, more affordable and more capable electric power systems for all Navy platforms and focus Navy and industry investments.\n\nThis PE is the bridge between Science and Technology (S&T) and ship platform and mission systems acquisition programs by identifying prospective applications for S&T research, advanced development, and performing additional product development and qualification when necessary to meet platform or mission system requirements.  This PE also includes cybersecurity Boundary Defense Capability (BDC) development.  BDC funds will be utilized for engineering tasks necessary to implement a cyber security boundary defense capability for the Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (H,M&E) control systems on surface ships.  The H,M&E systems to be protected will include Machinery Control Systems, Electrical Power Systems, Damage Control and Firefighting, Auxiliary Machinery and Fluid Systems, Engines and Power Transmission Systems,  Gas Turbine Systems, Video Systems, as well as other H,M&E systems.  The intent of the total boundary defense capability will be to allow the ship to better protect, detect, respond, and recover from a cyber attack on the H,M&E enclave on surface ships.  \n\nIn October 2009, SECNAV outlined a set of specific objectives supporting U.S. Navy energy reform including several aimed at significantly reducing Fleet fuel consumption and improving our energy security posture. PMS 320 supports the DON Energy Goals by employing an integrated approach to develop and transition more affordable technologies that satisfy increasing shipboard power demands and high operational tempo while improving energy efficiency, reducing fuel consumption, and reducing Total Ownership Cost."

This project supports optimized integration of mission systems, appropriate component and system controls, integration of components and systems into future and current ships, and providing power and energy system solution alternatives to new and existing platforms. \n\nProject developments are aligned with the Navy's 30 year shipbuilding plan via the Naval Power and Energy Systems Technology Development Roadmap, which outlines the way ahead for future developments and provides a basis for coordinated planning and investment by the Navy and private industry.  \n\nThis project develops and transitions products that increase energy efficiency (and thereby create fewer greenhouse gas emissions and reduce dependence upon foreign petroleum sources), provide additional power to mission systems, integrates those components and systems into ship platforms, and defining cybersecurity capabilities that will be implemented on current in-service Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&E) systems as well as future systems.\n\nDON Energy Initiatives - Energy Storage Module (ESM) and Advanced Power Generation Module (APGM):  This project supports the DON Energy Initiative designed to reduce ship energy consumption and increase mission effectiveness through longer time on station. The ESM will provide stable backup power to enable DDG51 Class single genertor operations (and significant fuel savings) when operational situations permit. The APGM includes back fit and forward fit developments including the AG9160RF, Twin Spool, and Gas Turbine (GT) efficiency upgrades. The AG9160RF Gas Turbine Generator (GTG) is an upgrade to the DDG1000 auxiliary gas turbine and will provide increased power to meet DDG51 Flight III requirements for advanced sensors and future weapons with reduction in life cycle costs through increased fuel efficiency over legacy gas turbine generator sets. Twin Spool GTGs will adapt an aero derivative fuel efficient gas turbine to improve fuel efficiency 12-15% over current single shaft gas turbines, reduce total ownership costs, and increase time on station. GT upgrades will provide operational readiness and fuel efficiency improvements to existing gas turbine engines for both backfit and new construction ships.\n\nMission Power:  Designs, develops, tests and integrates shipboard power systems to incorporate advanced sensors, Directed Energy and other advanced weapons. Design and testing includes Modeling and Simulation, as well as land based testing, to reduce risk and demonstrate readiness for shipboard use. Air Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) Power Conversion Module (PCM) provides power conversion from ship's 4160 VAC distribution systems to 1000 VDC to support AMDR Radar.\n\nCybersecurity Boundary Defense Capability (BDC):  Develops an approach to implement a cybersecurity boundary defense capability for HM&E control systems on surface ships.  HM&E systems to be protected will include Machinery Control Systems, Electrical Power Systems, Damage Control and Firefighting, Auxiliary Machinery and Fluid systems, Engines and Power Transmission Systems, Gas Turbine Systems, Video Systems as well as other HM&E systems.  Design and technical data packages for software and hardware solutions will be developed.  The intent of the total boundary defense capability will be to allow the ship to better protect, detect, respond, and recover from potential cyber attacks on the HM&E enclave on surface ships."
