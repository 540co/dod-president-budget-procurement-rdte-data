As per the ADM dated 20 January 2014, JTN and JTNC became separate entities. FY 2015 and out, Army PE 0605031 contains only the JTN RDT&E funding.  For FY2017 and out, the continuing JTN efforts are funded in Army PE 0605031A (JTN), Navy PE 0605030N (shared), and Air Force PE 0605030F (shared).  As part of the joint program budget strategy, each Military Department (MILDEP) budgets for approximately one-third of the total program RDT&E funds for JENM joint efforts. Prior to the year of execution, funding is consolidated in the Army PE (0605031A) and software sustainment funds are realigned from RDT&E to O&M,A PE (4326750A) to support the joint program acquisition strategy.\n\nIn FY 2017 and out Waveform funding will now be on the Army PE 0605031A, Project Code EX6.

FY 2013 and FY 2014 Joint Tactical Network Center (JTNC) funding was provided by the JTN Program via PE 0604280N and PE 0605030A, respectively.  In accordance with the ADM dated 20 Jan 2014, JTN and JTNC became separate entities and PE 0605031A (Project Code EF5) was created for JTN.  \n\nThe 2014 ADM also directed that the waveform development and sustainment responsibilities transition to the Services in 4QFY2015. On 25 June 2015, Product Manager (PdM) Waveforms transitioned to Program Manager (PM) Tactical Radios.\n  \nPdM Waveforms was previously funded under JTN Army Program Element (APE) 0605031A (Project Code EF5).
