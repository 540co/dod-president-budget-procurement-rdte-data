            "val": "This program element consists of a highly competitive three-phase award system that provides qualified small business concerns with the opportunity to propose high quality innovative ideas that meet specific research and development needs of USSOCOM.  Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) is a result of the Small Business Development Act of 1992.  It was enacted by Congress in Public Law 97-219, reenacted by Public Law 99-443, and reauthorized by the SBIR Program Reauthorization Act of 2012.  Starting in FY 1994, the SBIR program was refocused toward dual use and defense reinvestment efforts.  Phase I projects evaluate the scientific technical merit and feasibility of an idea.  Phase II projects expand the results of, and further pursue, the developments of Phase I.  Phase III is for commercialization of the results of Phase II and requires the use of private or non-SBIR federal funding.  USSOCOM participates annually in the DOD Request for Proposal process.  USSOCOM then awards its proposed SBIR projects.  FY 2014 is the first year USSOCOM is participating in the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program.  The STTR goal is similar to the SBIR program, but the STTR program has the additional goal to expand public\/private sector partnerships between small business and nonprofit U.S. research institutions."
