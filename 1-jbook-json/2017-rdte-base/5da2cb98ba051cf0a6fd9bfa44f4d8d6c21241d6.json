Includes development, demonstration and delivery of test assets, special test equipment, capabilities and systems required to test, validate, and verify performance of integrated space control systems. Provides a safe, secure, controllable and repeatable environment for the testing and training of Space Control mission systems and operators that is both realistic and relevant.  Additionally, this program develops test range assets for both the fixed node Space Range Operation Center (SROC) at Schriever AFB and a deployable capability to support complex Joint and AF exercises. The virtual range as part of the Family of Systems (FoS), called Big Top, is being developed to accomplish the STTR mission. Big Top integrates to a Distributed Mission Architecture, tying into both the Information Operations (IO) and Air ranges for increased realism and complexity required to prepare space operators for real-world threats. This technology will allow for the first-ever use of a realistic signal environment to increase the realism and efficiency of space control squadron training.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."
