This program provides for development of rapid battle repair procedures, tools development to speed the return of aircraft to a full mission status, and development of new equipment for aerial recovery of damaged aircraft. Included in this project are: diagnostics\/prognostic monitoring systems, Aviation Ground Power Unit (AGPU) redesign and incorporation of AGPU modularity capabilities, Aviation Light Utility Mobile Maintenance Cart (ALUMMC), Aviation Unit Maintenance Shop Set (AVUM SS), Unit Maintenance Aerial Recovery Kit (UMARK) and development support for tools needed to provide maintenance support to modernized\/future force aircraft.  There is no funding for this project in FY 2015 and beyond.\n\nPE 0603801A Project B47, Future Vertical Lift (FVL) is an initiative, not yet an acquisition program, to develop a family of vertical lift aircraft for the United States Armed Forces. FVL was established in 2009 by the Secretary of Defense to focus all Department of Defense (DoD) vertical lift capabilities and technology development, as well as retaining long-term engineering capabilities. In October 2011, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued the FVL Strategic Plan to outline a joint approach for the next generation vertical lift aircraft for all military services. The Strategic Plan provided a foundation for replacing the current fleet with advanced capability by shaping the development of vertical lift aircraft for the next 25 to 40 years.  The development and fielding of FVL will significantly improve vertical lift capabilities providing critical aviation support to the Joint warfighting community.  Increases in range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and reduced logistical footprint can only be achieved through the FVL approach of developing a new aircraft design.  FVL will integrate advancements in technologies and design configurations balanced with appropriate trades to ensure affordability. \n\nFY 2017 funding provides for Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis and provides for Systems Engineering and Program Management (SEPM).  FY 2018 continues to fund AoA efforts and provides funding for SEPM.  FY 2019 supports Milestone A, Request for Proposal (RFP) development, RFP release, and SEPM.  FY 2020 funds Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB), and continues to provide funding for SEPM.  FY 2021 provides for air vehicle contract award and provides funding for SEPM."
