            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare. This PE also directly supports Expeditionary Force 21 (EF 21), which  is now the Marine Corps' capstone concept that establishes  the vision and goals for USMC S&T over the next 10 years and provides a plan for guiding the design and development of the future force.  One third of the Marine Corps operating forces will be forward  deployed.  These forces will be task-organized into a greater variety of formations, capable of operating from a more diverse array of ships dispersed over wider areas, in order to meet the Combatant Commanders' security cooperation and partner engagement requirements.  In the event of crises, those forces will be able to composite these distributed formations into larger, cohesive naval formations.  This presents both challenges and opportunities for USMC S&T. Expeditionary Force 21 will inform future decisions regarding how the Marine Corps will adjust organizational structure to exploit the value of regionally focused forces.  A fixed geographic orientation will facilitate Marine Commanders and their staffs with more frequent interactions with theater- and component-level organizations, establishing professional bonds and a shared sense of the area's challenges and opportunities.  Expeditionary Force 21 provides the basis for future Navy and Marine Corps capability development to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.  The vision for Expeditionary Force 21 is to provide guidance for how the Marine Corps will be postured, organized, trained, and equipped to fulfill the responsibilities and missions required around the world.  Through Expeditionary Force 21, the Marine Corps intends to operate from the sea and provide the right sized force in the right place, at the right time.\n\nThis PE is organized into nine activities which are represented as seven Expeditionary Warfighting Capability Areas, as well as Future Concepts, Technology Assessment and Roadmapping, and the Littoral Combat\/Power Projection (LC\/PP) FNC.  The primary objective of this PE is to develop and demonstrate the technologies needed to meet the Marine Corps unique responsibility of training and equipping the Marine Air\/Ground Task Force (MAGTF) for Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  In the post-September 11 world, irregular warfare (IW) has emerged as the dominant form of warfare confronting the United States, its allies and its partners; accordingly, this PE has been structured to account for distributed, long-duration operations, including unconventional warfare, counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and stabilization and reconstruction operations.  IW emphasizes the use of indirect, non-conventional methods and means to subvert, attrite, and exhaust an adversary, or render irrelevant, rather than defeat him through direct conventional military confrontation.   IW is now institutionalized in Marine Corps planning, investment, and capability development.  This PE provides the knowledge base to support Advanced Technology Development (6.3) and is the technology base for future expeditionary warfare capabilities.  This PE supports the Expeditionary Force Development System of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) and responds directly to the Marine Corps Science and Technology (S&T) process as well as supporting related Littoral and Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare capabilities developed by the Navy's Mission Capability Program.  The Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly.  The FNC program explores and demonstrates technologies that enable Sea Strike, Sea Shield, Sea Basing, FORCEnet and Force Health Protection pillars, Space, Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and the Enterprise and Platform Enablers.  The FNC program comprises Enabling Capabilities (ECs) which develop and deliver quantifiable products (i.e., prototype systems, knowledge products, and technology improvements) in response to validated requirements for insertion into acquisition programs of record after meeting agreed upon exit criteria within five years. The core 6.2 program also supports Discovery and Invention (D&I) and Innovation and Transformation (I&T).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve key transformational capabilities required by the Sea Power 21 Pillars, as well as enable Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM), Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  The Marine Corps Service Campaign Plan (MCSCP, guided by the Commandant's Planning Guidance, is the lens through which USMC S&T priorities are acted upon to guide the future development of the Total Force.\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the DoN Science and Technology (S&T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&T Gaps that are generated by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders.  The funding is aligned with the Naval challenges associated with projecting power despite anti-access and area denial, specifically the Sea Shield, Power and Energy, FORCEnet, and the Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare warfighting capability gaps. The funding profile reflects the alignment of the FNC program investments into Enabling Capabilities (ECs); ECs respond to priority Naval warfighting capability gaps.  Funding for each EC is aligned to a 6.2 or 6.3 Budget Activity (BA) as appropriate.\n\nThe FY2015 to FY2016 decrease in the Littoral Combat\/Power Projection activity is due to a FY2016 Congressional reduction.  Accordingly, the Future Naval Capabilities within the activity will be re-phased and amended appropriately to accommodate the delta. The FY2016 to FY2017 increase in the FNC Activity is due to the FY2016 Congressional reduction and will realign the activity to its original programming levels in FY2017."

Emphasis on survivability technologies includes defeat of small arms, IEDs, mine blast, and RPGs.  Efforts also continue in the development of modeling and simulation tools that integrate many different physics based modeling systems with rigorous operational analysis simulations to accurately define a system's performance characteristics. These tools will aid in defining the trade space for emerging technologies and assist in providing the program manager insight and guidance into pursuing future technologies. Finally, this technology thrust area also seeks to develop technologies to enhance combat vehicle crewman effectiveness and situational awareness through the incorporation of advanced autonomous vehicle functions.\n\n\nThe FY2016 to FY2017 increase in funding is due to a FY2016 Congressional reduction (-$1.293M).

FORCEnet is the operational construct and architectural framework for naval warfare in the information age that integrates warriors, networks, command and control, and weapons into a networked, distributed, combat force that is scalable across all levels of conflict from the seabed to space, and from sea to land. The Marine Corps instantiation of FORCEnet is Marine Air Ground Task Force Command and Control (MAGTF C2), with technologies to exchange data and information with, and among, distributed tactical forces. Activities in this program area provide technologies for secure, robust, self-forming, mobile communications networks and distributed computing to support information dissemination to all echelons; and sensors, software and data processing to support formation of an appropriate common picture.  Marine Corps specific efforts include power management, low detectability, size and weight constraints, and interoperability within the joint environment."
