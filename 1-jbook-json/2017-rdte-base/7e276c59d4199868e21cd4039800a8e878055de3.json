JTAC control training requirements exceed the ability of live-fly aircraft to meet, and JTC TRS is the only capability projected to enable JTACs to achieve and maintain minimum required training for both qualification and proficiency in accordance with the U.S and Partner Nation Memorandum of Agreement for JTAC certification and qualification. \n\nThe JTC TRS Project provides research and development to facilitate interoperability with joint and sister Service air-ground simulation using industry standards.   Future JTC TRS development will provide the capability to network aircrew full mission trainers and training centers in a live-virtual-constructive network. This development effort will also integrate ASOCs with the Joint Theater Air Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS) trainer for Joint Fires integration.  The Personnel Recovery (PR) capability is envisioned to be a \"plug and play\" module for the host JTC TRS. The PR capability will provide Guardian Angel personnel with an immersive LVC environment to plan, train, and rehearse their employment, rescue\/recovery, and combat trauma care skills.  The simulator will supplement live field training and live-fly sorties to provide realistic introductory, proficiency, currency, and upgrade training in a simulated battlefield, disaster, or humanitarian relief environment.\n\nb. JTAGSS is a continuation of the ASOC simulation trainer initially funded in 2009 and complements the JTC TRS trainer by providing a total air-ground constructive simulation environment for integrated networked training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop JTAC\/CCT and ASOC\/Special Operations Forces (SOF) Command and Control (C2) battle staff skills.  JTAGSS will provide the ASOC, SOF, and TACP (Tactical Air Control Party) with the vertical and horizontal C2 communications and coordination training and mission rehearsal required for mission effectiveness.   There are insufficient exercises and live training events available to meet mandated readiness requirements.  The system will include a secure network connection, a constructive simulation environment generator with sharable databases, computer work stations that have synthetic reflex agent applications for each ASOC\/SOF crew position to execute the air tasking order.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts for systems, fielded or approved, for production, that have been fully validated through formal Operation Utility Evaluation (OUE) and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Pre-priced production options will also include replacement or modification, as required, of current fielded active duty immersive JTAC training systems (Air National Guard (ANG) Advanced JTAC Training System (AAJTS)) to the JTC TRS software and EME baseline.  The contract structure will allow for maintaining concurrency, implementing system improvements\/technical refresh, and other modifications as required.  The JTC TRS acquisition strategy is to enter the acquisition process pre-Milestone C and obtain a decision to procure up to five Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) at contract award.  An Operational Utility Evaluation (OUE) will be conducted in place of Operational Test and Evaluation.  Following successful OUE, a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision will be sought to authorize procurement of the remaining total planned production quantity.  Development will be required for engineering changes related to Air Traffic Control (ATC) and TACP-Close Air Support System.\n\n\nb. The acquisition strategy for the JTAGSS trainer will be to field advance technology demonstration units to continue to perform proof of concept and technology validation of mission simulations for all ASOC crew positions including detailed communications planning, asset deconfliction, integration of joint fires, and other critical mission areas required for integrated TACP\/ASOC C2 mission success.  At the completion of the technology validation, a contract will be competitively awarded to complete JTAGSS development, deployment and integration. Current software is Government or Commercial Off-the-Shelf technologies (GOTS\/COTS) allowing almost any training technology development company to compete, which lowers technical risk, schedule risk, and cost."
