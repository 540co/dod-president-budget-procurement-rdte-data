            "val": "The Advanced Combat System Technology line is to evolve the technical and business practices for programs to change to an open architecture construct. The program was constructed to mature both technical and business model integration for C5I systems programs of record in an open architecture environment. The priority was incorporating the principles of modular design and design disclosure, reusable application software, interoperability and secure information exchange, lifecycle affordability and encouraging competition and collaboration.\n\nProject Unit 0324: Funding is to maintain and update an information exchange environment to improve transparency of design disclosure and information exchange on past and current investments to support the principle of cross-program reuse, and to provide the tools and leadership for assisting programs through the transition to Naval Open Architecture (OA).  The other elements of the OA transformation effort are being realized as management efficiencies within programs.  Those elements include ensuring that all naval systems, families of systems, and programs move to modular OA in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.1 dated 12 May 2003 which mandates that all DoD programs utilize open systems architectures to rapidly field affordable and interoperable systems.  By direction of the Navy Service Acquisition Executive (SAE), PEO IWS was assigned overall responsibility and authority to direct the Navy's OA effort until that duty transferred to DASN (RDTE) in 2011. The Core OA funding line has remained with PEO IWS.  That policy established a need to coordinate acquisition strategies, develop guidance and tools, and develop analysis of alternatives to determine OA software reuse practices within and across the Navy Communities of Interest (COI - Surface, Subsurface, Air, Space, C4I, USMC, and ONR).  This project facilitates a strategic shift in the acquisition business process to facilitate cooperative competition in cross-domain\/COI business relationships.  This improves innovation and economies of scale throughout the Navy and Marine Corps.  This leadership effort has identified the business case and potential return on investment for moving the Navy towards an open systems approach, supported the development of open systems technologies, and integrated best business and technical practices for open systems development within Naval acquisition.  Naval OA ensures Navy-wide system architectures become extensible and scalable in function, capacity, and workload to meet Joint warfighting requirements.  This also includes the identification and development of common software components, functions, reuse methodologies, and extensible product lines.  In summary, this funding supports the management of a reuse repository and reuse information exchange portal, and the evolving business, systems engineering, and cultural changes required across all Naval programs as they migrate to function in a Joint, net-centric warfare environment.\n\nProject Unit 0385:  The Rapid Prototype Development project is new in FY17 and addresses the advancement and transition of combat systems technology. It supports the goals and objectives of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Navigation Plan, Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) Planning Guidance, and the Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower. This project also supports the Secretary of the Navy's (SECNAV) Innovation Vision and the Implementation Directive for Better Buying Power 3.0. These efforts will reinvigorate and increase the use of prototyping and experimentation to rapidly field new warfighting capabilities, concepts and technologies, and engineering solutions.\n\nThe Rapid Prototype Development project  With an emphasis on \"Field Early\" or \"Fail Fast\" methodologies, the project is intended to expedite the development, exploration and fielding of combat system innovations in six warfighting domains: surface warfare, air warfare, undersea warfare, expeditionary warfare, information dominance and special operations warfare. Prototype development efforts will be used to develop\/refine Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) and operational requirements; evaluate the operational utility and technical feasibility of technology\/engineering innovations; support limited fielding of prototypes (if required); and mitigate cost, schedule and performance risks associated with follow-on acquisition programs.\n\nProject Unit 0399:  The Unmanned Rapid Prototype Development project is new in FY17 and was created to implement the Secretary of the Navy's (SECNAV) reorganization of the department to emphasize unmanned warfare systems and addresses the advancement and transition of naval warfare systems technology.  This project funds Navy's prioritized portfolio of unmanned system (UxS) rapid development technology initiatives based on Navy warfighting needs and capability gaps.  This project supports the goals and objectives of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Navigation Plan and the Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower.  Additionally, this project supports the Secretary of the Navy's (SECNAV) Innovation Vision and the Implementation Directive for Better Buying Power 3.0.  The project will increase the use of rapid prototyping and demonstration to quickly introduce technologically advanced UxS capabilities to the Fleet and provide warfighters with direct opportunities to explore and refine operational concepts.  \n\nThe Unmanned Rapid Prototype Development project enables a strategic focus on the prioritization of UxS requirements and concepts, development of innovative UxS technologies, and the concurrent development of warfighting capabilities.  With emphasis on \"Field Early\" or \"Fail Fast\" methodologies, the project will expedite the development, exploration and Fleet introduction of UxS technologies in the warfare areas of Surface, Air, Anti-Submarine, and Expeditionary Warfare,  Information Dominance and Special Operations Warfare.  The project will provide the Navy and Marine Corps with technical and operational utility assessments of technology\/engineering innovations; ability to refine operational requirements and concepts of operation; support limited fielding of prototypes (as required); and mitigate cost, schedule and performance risk associated with follow-on acquisition programs."

The Rapid Prototype Development project supports the goals and objectives of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Navigation Plan and Design for Maintaining Maritime Superiority, Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) Planning Guidance, and the Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower, and is fundamental to the DON's efforts to improve our acquisition outcomes. This project is aligned with, and in direct response to, calls for increased prototyping and experimentation in USD(AT&L)'s Better Buying Power 3.0, Secretary of the Navy's (SECNAV) Task Force Innovation direction, and the CNO direction to Achieve High Velocity Learning at Every Level. These efforts will reinvigorate and increase the use of prototyping and experimentation to rapidly field new warfighting capabilities, concepts and technologies, and engineering solutions faster than the typical budget cycle time. \n\nThe Rapid Prototype Development project funds a strategic focus on rapid prototyping and experimentation of innovative combat system technologies and engineering innovations to explore Fleet-proposed capability concepts and needs, as well as foster advancements in naval warfighting capabilities. With an emphasis on \"Field Early\" or \"Fail Fast\" methodologies, the project is intended to expedite the development, exploration and fielding of technology and engineering prototypes to provide advanced warfighting capabilities, new technologies and engineering innovations across all Naval warfighting domains. Prototype development efforts will be used to inform\/refine Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) and operational requirements; evaluate the operational utility and technical feasibility of technology\/engineering innovations; support limited fielding of prototypes; and mitigate cost, schedule and performance risks associated with follow-on acquisition programs.\n\nBy fully leveraging the scientific and engineering expertise and technical infrastructure within the Naval Research and Development Establishment (NR&DE), and in collaboration with, and support of, the Fleet Forces Command, Naval Warfighting Development Centers, Naval Warfare Development Command, and the Marine Corps Combat Development and Integration Command, this project will produce sensor, weapon system, and command, control, and communications prototypes to address naval warfighting challenges and\/or to pursue future naval warfighting concepts. Additionally, new and emerging technologies and engineering innovations that offer the potential to reduce cost, increase readiness, or improve the overall efficiency or effectiveness of naval forces will be explored. A key distinction is that the process and battle rhythm is designed for optimal responsiveness to Fleet needs. \n\nThe DON will work with Congress in accordance with an agreed-to framework of governance and oversight that will ensure the effective and efficient use of this funding for its intended purpose."

Pre-set, yearly, or even quarterly proposal\/review cycles are not sufficiently responsive to the dynamic nature of cutting-edge technological breakthroughs, engineering innovations, new operational concepts, and\/or emerging threats.  The DON has developed a responsive and agile Department wide approach for Rapid Prototyping, Experimentation, and Demonstration (RPED). The approach: \n-\timproves alignment across Fleet and Marine Corps forces, Requirements, Budgeting, and Research & Development organizations to prioritize initiatives and streamline management and execution of rapid prototyping and experimentation, \n-\tallows the DON to \"learn fast\" through prototyping - completing projects as rapidly as possible to improve follow-on system acquisition decisions before incurring significant costs, \n-\treplaces the current Speed-to-Fleet process, \n-\tand unleashes the intrinsic ingenuity of the Navy's Science and Technology (S&T) community, the NR&DE, and our talented Sailors and Marines.\n\nIn response to Fleet needs, the RPED approach will identify and select prototyping initiatives based on direct and continuous Fleet engagements.  Integrated teams consisting of scientists and engineers from across the NR&DE are promptly deployed to interact with Fleet Commands, the Navy Warfare Development Command, and Warfighting Development Centers. The entire project initiation cycle will be completed in less than twelve weeks. The RPED approach considers maturing S&T technologies and engineering innovations produced through  Future Naval Capabilities , Innovative Naval Prototypes , Naval Innovative Science and Engineering (NISE) Section 219, Emerging Capabilities and Prototypes, and commercial technologies as potential prototypes. Direct and continuous interactions between our scientists and engineers and the operators they support will drive innovation and, more importantly, align technical ideas with operational needs at the earliest stages in prototype development and experimentation.\n\nPrototypes are used to refine operational concepts and requirements through experimentation campaigns making maximum use of tools, ranges, and test facilities readily available within our NR&DE and Fleet experimentation venues. Prototypes will be demonstrated to the operational forces in less than 24 months. Deliverables include actual integrated hardware\/software prototype system(s) and experimentation events, CONOPS, requirements analysis, test report(s), and technical data package(s) to support experimentation events, limited fielding decisions, and to inform leadership decisions on the development of an acquisition program."

This project is aligned with, and in direct response to, calls for increased prototyping and experimentation in USD(AT&L)'s Better Buying Power 3.0, Secretary of the Navy's (SECNAV) Task Force Innovation direction, and the CNO direction to Achieve High Velocity Learning at Every Level. These efforts will reinvigorate and increase the use of unmanned prototyping and experimentation to rapidly field new warfighting capabilities, concepts and technologies, and engineering solutions faster than the typical budget cycle time. \n\nThe Unmanned Rapid Prototype Development project funds a strategic focus on prioritization of UxS rapid prototyping and experimentation of innovative combat system technologies and engineering innovations to explore Fleet-proposed capability concepts and needs, as well as foster advancements in naval warfighting capabilities. With an emphasis on \"Field Early\" or \"Fail Fast\" methodologies, the project is intended to expedite the development, exploration and fielding of technology and engineering prototypes to provide advanced warfighting capabilities, new technologies and engineering innovations across all Naval warfighting domains. Prototype development efforts will be used to inform\/refine Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) and operational requirements; evaluate the operational utility and technical feasibility of technology\/engineering innovations; support limited fielding of prototypes; and mitigate cost, schedule and performance risks associated with follow-on acquisition programs.\n\nBy fully leveraging the scientific and engineering expertise and technical infrastructure within the Naval Research and Development Establishment (NR&DE), and in collaboration with, and support of, the Fleet Forces Command, Naval Warfighting Development Centers, Naval Warfare Development Command, and the Marine Corps Combat Development and Integration Command, this project will produce UxS sensors, weapon systems, and command, control, and communications prototypes to address naval warfighting challenges and\/or to pursue future naval warfighting concepts. Additionally, new and emerging UxS technologies and engineering innovations that offer the potential to reduce cost, increase readiness, or improve the overall efficiency or effectiveness of naval forces will be explored. A key distinction is that the process and battle rhythm is designed for optimal responsiveness to Fleet needs. \n\nThe CNO and DON will work with Congress in accordance with an agreed-to framework of governance and oversight that will ensure the effective and efficient use of this funding for its intended purpose."

Deliverables include actual integrated hardware\/software prototype systems, Concept of Operations (CONOPS), requirements, test reports, technical data, and associated doctrine, organization, training, leadership and education, and personnel aspects necessary to support decision making.  These decisions include the transition of technologies to acquisition, further refinement of the technology, or termination and reinvestment of remaining funds to other technologies that add military value. In addition, these efforts will enable the NR&DE to assess and support INP and other emerging technologies for efficient transition to acquisition through prototyping and experimentation.
