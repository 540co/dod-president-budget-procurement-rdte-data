                            "val": "The Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) is a satellite ground terminal network comprised of two communication nodes (Schriever AFB & Vandenberg AFB) and 15 antenna systems. The antennas are distributed around the globe at seven locations -- Vandenberg Tracking Station (VTS), Diego Garcia Station (DGS), Guam Tracking Station (GTS), Hawaii Tracking Station (HTS), New Hampshire Tracking Station (NHS), Thule Tracking Station (TTS) and Telemetry and Commanding Station (TCS) at RAF Oakhanger, England -- to ensure global coverage for 140 satellites in various orbits. The AFSCN conducts an average of 450 satellite contacts per day supporting Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Missile Warning, Communications, Weather, Launch Vehicle Support, and Research and Development (R&D) in support of Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operations. While most of the 450 satellite contacts\/day are routine command and control activities, the AFSCN is also used for satellite emergencies (e.g. tumbling satellite) because its high power antennas are often the only earthbound assets that can contact a non-responsive satellite to re-establish command & control. During FY14 and FY15 the AFSCN supported 28 space vehicle emergencies resulting in the preservation of $8.5B worth of satellites. In addition to routine and emergency satellite operations C2, the AFSCN provides support to launch vehicle and early orbit operations, ensuring worldwide antennas receive telemetry as the rocket travels through the atmosphere and transmit commands to a newly orbiting satellite to initiate early orbit checkout. Finally, the AFSCN provides Factory Compatibility Testing (FCT) to ensure satellites and rockets can communicate via the AFSCN before the satellite is launched. These funds are used to develop next-generation tools to improve the AFSCN and ensure the capability is available to support DoD, Intelligence, and civil users.\n\nREMOTE TRACKING STATION (RTS) BLOCK CHANGE (RBC)- SATELLITE ANOMALY RECOVERY AND SUPPORT UPGRADE; ENHANCED HIGH-POWER AMPLIFIER (EHPA): The Air Force will complete development testing of the Enhanced High Power Amplifier (EHPA) first article. The AFSCN is in jeopardy of losing the emergency high power satellite contact capability due to obsolete parts used in the legacy AFSCN system. The EHPA program will develop a new high power amplifier that resolves the obsolescence issue well into the 2020s. FY16 funds support the transition and operational turnover of the first EHPA.\n\nUNIFIED S-BAND (USB) UPLINK: The Air Force is adjusting the AFSCN for spectrum-sharing with industry and demonstrating the ability to migrate away from the current L-Band uplink \/ S-Band downlink spectrum to the Unified S-Band (USB) spectrum. RDT&E funds support a first article integration of USB into the AFSCN baseline to begin supporting factory compatibility testing. FY 2016 funding provides S-Band uplink transmitter to enable commanding of satellites using USB frequency in addition to L-Band frequency. USB capability is currently only being implemented on the RBC transportable to allow factory compatibility testing prior to launch of dual band satellites (per revised AFSPC requirement). RBC transportable is made up of 3 portable components: a Core equipment van, an HPA van, and an antenna van. \n\nELECTRONIC SCHEDULING AND DISSEMINATION (ESD 3.0): ESD 3.0 is a significant upgrade to the currently fielded version 2.7.  The upgrade will allow satellite operators to request contact time with their satellites via the shared AFSCN antennas, automatically deconflict overlapping requests, create a schedule, and publish the schedule in real-time to all users. The Air Force completed the first ESD 3.0 operational confidence test 3Q FY15. Deficiencies from that event are expected to be resolved in FY16. Initial Developmental Testing (DT) is scheduled for 4Q FY16. Operational Testing (OT) and PEO Certification is anticipated in 3Q FY17. Turnover to operations is expected by 4Q FY17. \n\nAFSCN ENHANCEMENT AND DEFICIENCY RESOLUTION: Provides test, cyber security, requirements management, and system architecture support to the AFSCN.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  BA 7 includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
