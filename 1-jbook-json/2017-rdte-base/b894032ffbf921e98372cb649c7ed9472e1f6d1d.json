JLTV is a joint program between the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps, of which the U.S. Army has the lead.  The JLTV goal is a FoV capable of performing multiple mission roles and designed to provide protected, sustained, networked mobility for personnel and payloads across the full range of military operations.  JLTV objectives include increased protection and performance over the current fleet; minimizing ownership costs by maximizing commonality, fuel efficiency, reliability, and maintaining effective competition throughout the life cycle.  Commonality of components, maintenance procedures, training, etc., between vehicles is expected to be inherent in FoV solutions across mission variants to minimize total ownership cost.  Unique service requirements have been minimized. \n\nMajor FY 2017 budget activities include the continued monitoring of contractor performance, completion of provisioning, and the continuation of Live Fire Test for the Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) program to include:  Full Up System Level (FUSL), Automatic Fire Extinguishing System (AFES), Corrosion, Ballistics, and Logistics Demonstration testing.  \n\nThe FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $13.689 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances."

The U.S. Army is the JLTV service lead. \n\nThe JLTV Program entered the Production and Deployment Phase with the Acquisition Decision Memorandum authorization on 25 August 2015.  With Milestone C approval the LRIP fixed price contract was awarded to Oshkosh Defense LLC on 25 August 2015.  This contract consists of a three year LRIP period with options for five additional years of FRP deliveries.  JPO JLTV requested separately priced firm fixed price (FFP) option(s) for the purchase of the Technical Data Package (TDP) with appropriate data rights to allow for possible future competition for production vehicles as well as spares.  On 8 September 2015, a Stop Work Order was issued to Oshkosh after a protest was filed to the Government Accountability Office (GAO).  On 15 December 2015, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) dismissed the protest due to Lockheed Martin's notice that they intended to file a Post-Award Bid Protest with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (COFC).  The Stop Work Order was officially canceled and Oshkosh has resumed work.  On 17 December 2015, Lockheed Martin officially filed a complaint with the COFC and an injunction decision is pending.  JPO JLTV is currently evaluating potential injunction impacts.\n\nThe program now begins the LRIP phase where it will strive to produce production vehicles for extensive Test and Evaluation activities to support a FRP Decision.  A ramp up of JLTV quantities will continue thru FY19 to support fielding's to Army and USMC units once the FRP decision is achieved and allow the program to smoothly transition into FRP.\n\nThe JLTV program will continually monitor emerging technologies and capabilities through its partnerships with Army and Marine Corps science and technology organizations as well as through industry market research and partnerships.  At this time Follow-on Increments for technology insertion is undefined, the JLTV program will look for opportunities to implement increased capabilities throughout the system's Life Cycle."
