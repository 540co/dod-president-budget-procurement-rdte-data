            "val": "The F-15 is the most versatile fighter in the world today.  The F-15C\/D continues to provide air superiority with an undefeated and unmatched aerial combat record.  The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems, such as advanced imaging and targeting systems, to meet the requirement for all-weather, deep penetration, and night\/under-the-weather, air-to-surface attack.  Configured with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), the F-15E deploys worldwide with minimal tanker support and arrives combat-ready.  A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad, upgrades to the F-15 (avionics, armament, airframe, and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability, and supportability). Projected to remain in service past 2035, avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability.  This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors), forestalling obsolescence, exploiting proven technological advances, and leveraging new technology.  Major avionics upgrades center around radar modernization (both hardware and software upgrades) and the exploitation of enhanced capability via precision timing, data delivery and processing technology, precision registration systems, cockpit Head Up Display (HUD), instrumentation digitization and modernization, central computer processing power increases, digital mission event recording systems and an infrared (IR) based fire control system.  Funds are also used, as required, to resolve Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. The proliferation of fourth generation enemy aircraft and sophisticated \"double-digit\" anti-aircraft missile systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability.  A fully integrated electronic warfare suite holds the promise of providing survivability as well as expanded electronic attack capability. Nearly all improvements are linked to an aircraft operational flight program update schedule that works to integrate new capabilities with the airframe.  These updates are a responsive way to increase the offensive and defensive capability and survivability of the F-15.  Incorporation of corresponding spiral and\/or phased technology\/equipment improvements that include support equipment, mission planning systems, and training device upgrades will improve performance, supportability, and aircrew training.\n\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This AESA radar has the ability to provide electronic attack and protection capabilities.  \n\nThe ADCP II will develop a common mission computer for the F-15C\/D and F-15E.  The current mission computers of both platforms have reached their limits of speed, memory and throughput.  Additionally, digital systems have changed the security requirements of both platforms and the older mission computers cannot be upgraded to meet these new requirements.  A common mission computer is expected to reduce overall development costs as well as long term maintenance costs.  The program will also develop a new F-15C\/D cockpit display to replace an obsolete one.\n\nEPAWSS will replace the obsolete Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS), which will help the aircraft survive in high threat environments.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The development of F-15 EP will maximize Key System Attributes (KSA) and EP techniques for F-15E Radar Modernization Program (RMP) in Suite 8E; ensure remaining KSAs and EP techniques for F-15E RMP are included in Suite 9; ensure legacy EP for F-15C APG-63(v)3, commensurate with the APG-63(v)1 radar legacy EP capability, is included in Suite 9; and maximize additional advanced EP for F-15C APG-63(v)3 in Suite 9.\"  \n\nFor the F-15 to maintain operational effectiveness, the program must continuously provide the platforms with improved capabilities.  To accomplish this there is an on-going need to develop software upgrades and to flight test new capabilities and systems.   The OFP funding line allows the Air Force to release software upgrades approximately every 3 years.  At any one time the program has three OFP upgrades in work: one in requirements definition\/pricing, one in code writing and test, and one in flight test and release preparation.  The Flight Test funding line allows the Air Force to fund the on-going test effort.  \n\nInfrared Search and Track (IRST) system will provide air to air detection, tracking and ranging capability for F-15C\/D in a radar-denied environment.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

IRST will provide the F-15Cs with the capability to counter Low Observerable technology outside the RF spectrum, and will provide capability in an RF jamming environment. The IRST complements other onboard sensors by scanning a large volume of air space, fills gaps left by other sensors, and is unaffected by electronic attack, target emissions, beam aspect, or target radar cross section (RCS). This capability complements the radar to enhance survivability and lethality against air-to-air threats, provides a passive infrared sensor system that searches for and detects infrared energy, and provides the aircraft mission computer track file data on infrared targets."
