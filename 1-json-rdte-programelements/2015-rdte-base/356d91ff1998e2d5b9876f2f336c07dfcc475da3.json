Paragon is a classified Navy tactical signals intelligence frequency extension capability that will be integrated into Ship's Signal Exploitation Equipment (SSEE) Inc E and F programs. This capability provides simultaneous detection, collection, processing, Electronic Warfare and display of communication intelligence data from hostile, high threat and adversary platforms in select frequency ranges that are not prosecuted or encountered today. Graywing is an electronic sensing and attack capability that shares the Paragon topside exploitation assets and will be integrated into SSEE Inc E and F systems. \n\nIntegrated Communications and Data System (ICADS) AN\/URC-148(V) is a Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) directed mission critical system which provides limited back-up, mobile communications capability for large deck naval platforms. The system provides a reliable, limited solution for re-establishing command and control for high value unit, subordinate units, and controlling fleet entities. ICADS is comprised of several mature systems. Specific program details held at a higher classification. \n\nFY15 funding for Ship's Signal Exploitation Equipment (SSEE) Increment (Inc) F will continue pre-planned product improvements (P3I), expand the SOI processing capability, enhance SSEE Inc F remote capabilities and integrate Medusa HW into the SSEE Inc F scan chassis. \n\nFY15 funding for SSEE Inc G will be used to complete acquisition activities, contract development, and continue to integrate and improve upon all aspects of the \"BMD EXCOM ASW CNO CEB IO Countermeasure Red Flash\/Medusa\" in support of a MS B in FY 16. Expand upon the SSEE Inc F capability of exploiting signals throughout the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum, in addition to focusing new technologies towards new and previously unexplored\/unexploited cyber capabilities as we integrate into the Electronic Warfare (EW) Battle Management Network \n\nFY15 funding for SSEE Modifications will complete phase 2 hardware and software development to provide capabilities to the Fleet in support of \"BMD EXCOM ASW CEB IO Countermeasure Red Flash\" including automation of key system operation and maintenance procedures; additional SOIs in support of Fleet needs; and enhance system capabilities for Graywing and Paragon in order to meet FRP performance thresholds.\nSpeed to Fleet efforts within SSEE Mods uses hardware provided in conjunction with Graywing development to deliver a self-contained, transportable system to provide shore based capabilities. In addition to providing an independent shore based capability the Speed to Fleet design provides an alternative Graywing receive and transmit subsystem design for risk reduction to Program of Record (POR). The transportable Speed to Fleet Graywing also provides an accessible platform to rapidly demonstrate new or improved Information Operations (IO) capabilities by providing a relatively low cost land-based field test article. Furthermore, the hardware developed under this project could be adapted as a roll-on\/roll-off ship configuration to supplement the POR installations, if needed by the Fleet. Graywing is a sub system of the SSEE Modification Program to expand the capability of the Ship Signal Exploitation Equipment (SSEE). \n\nThe Speed to Fleet efforts will deliver a new firmware spiral that increases the capability of Medusa to respond to a wider range of threat systems, and to improve aspects of its capabilities. It will also deliver a laboratory test system that will be used to validate future firmware changes. Medusa is a sub system of the SSEE POR."

The Shore based Graywing unit developed will provide a rapidly deployable capability for the protection of land based resources. Multiple copies of the first article can be replicated depending on operational needs. These systems could also be used as a carry on capability to supplement the Graywing ship installations via the SSEE Mods ACAT III program or to those ships that are not SSEE capable. The Medusa upgrade adds additional capabilities via software to address a different class of radars which are proliferating, allowing backfit into existing systems via a new software load."
