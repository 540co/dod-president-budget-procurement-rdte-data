            "val": "The objective of this Program Element (PE), under Project 3094, is to provide capabilities to shorten command and control (C2) decision processes for detection-to-engagement across multiple platforms, including those with low-bandwidth communications or intermittent connectivity. The Undersea Warfare Decision Support System (USW-DSS) decision support tool uses a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) encompassing existing communication links, networks, and contact pictures comprised of sensor data from air, surface, submarine, theater, and surveillance platforms to connect sensors and weapons. The capabilities delivered by USW-DSS are critical not only for the Sea Combat Commander (SCC) but also for the Theater USW Commander (TUSWC) and Anti Submarine Warfare Commander (ASWC) to fulfill the requirement for an integrated capability to plan, conduct, and coordinate USW operations across multiple ASW platforms. USW-DSS will provide common and improved visualization, integrated USW platform sensor data sharing, reduced data entry, improved sensor performance predictions, data fusion, and reduced redundancy across USW Tactical Decision Aids (TDA). The program will provide a greater understanding of the undersea battle space by allowing the entire force (carrier\/expeditionary strike group, theater, or other) to have a common and thorough understanding of the battle space with characterized uncertainties.\n\nUSW-DSS Build 2 will be hosted on the Integrated Shipboard Network System (ISNS) as one of the first Early Adopters, leveraging initial SOA Reference Implementation. USW-DSS will then be hosted on the Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES) architecture, which will be fully SOA enabled. Build 2 Release 3 (B2R3), in response to Fleet requests, will provide improved and additional functionality and increased stability\/reliability."
