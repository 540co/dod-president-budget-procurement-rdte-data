It supports products successfully developed in the Systems Integration portion of the Systems Development and Demonstration phases through completion of the Milestone C Decision Review.  Commercially-off-the-shelf (COTS) medical products are also tested and evaluated for military use, when available.  This PE primarily includes pivotal (conclusive) human clinical trials necessary for licensure by the Food and Drug Administration. \n\n(PROJ 812) project funds military relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures.  These funds provide for engineering and manufacturing development of candidate vaccines and drugs to permit large-scale field testing.   Development focused on military unique needs effecting manning, mobilization, and deployment.   Products from this project will normally transition to DoD Health Programs or OPA Funds.\n\n(PROJ 832) this project funds the engineering and manufacturing development of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation.  Mature commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) medical products are also evaluated for military use.  Consideration will also be given to reduce the medical sustainment footprint through smaller weight and cube volume, or equipment independence from supporting materiel.  Products from this project will normally transition to OPA Funds. \n\n(PROJ 849) funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for military relevant infectious diseases.  These products fall between four major areas: vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits\/devices, and insect control measures to limit exposure and disease transmission.  FDA approval is a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members for human use.    Products from this project will normally transition to DoD Health Programs or OPA funds. \n\n(PROJ VS8) program receives products that transition from VS7 and funds effort to complete research and development for the MEDEVAC Mission Essential Packages (MEPs) to support 256 Medical Evacuation legacy helicopters. The force design will increase the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operation needs.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThis program is managed by U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) and U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) of the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command."

These products fall within four major areas: vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits\/devices, and determining if insects are infected with pathogenic organisms capable of infecting service members' insect control\/preventive medicine measures to limit exposure and disease transmission.  It funds research that supports conclusive human clinical trials for large-scale human effectiveness (capacity to produce a desired size of an effect under ideal or optimal conditions) testing, expanded human safety clinical trials, long-term animal studies, and related manufacturing tests.  This work, which is jointly performed by military laboratories, civilian contracted pharmaceutical firms and foreign research partners, is directed toward the prevention of disease, early diagnosis, and speeding recovery once diagnosed.  Medical products approved for human use must successfully complete a series of clinical trials that are required and regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  FDA approval is a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members for human use.  Development priority is based upon four major factors: (1) the extent of the disease within the Combatant Commands' theater of operations, (2) the clinical severity of the disease, (3) the technical maturity of the proposed solution, and (4) the affordability of the solution (development, production, and sustainment).  Malaria, dysentery, hepatitis , and Dengue diseases (a severe debilitating disease transmitted by mosquitoes), which are found in Africa Command, Central Command, European Command, Southern Command, and Pacific Command areas are at the top of the infectious diseases requirements list."

Original models of Army Black Hawk MEDEVAC helicopters continue to play a major role in maintaining high US troop survival rates in Iraq and Afghanistan by evacuating wounded troops in less than one-hour.  In 2009, a VCSA-approved force design update increased the number of air frames in the force from 12 to 15 aircraft for 37 MEDEVAC companies to better meet operational needs.  In 2010, the Army Medical Department (AMEDD) accepted life-cycle management of the MEDEVAC MEP from PEO Aviation.  In order to achieve required operational capability and enhance commonality across the MEDEVAC fleet, the MEDEVAC MEP program upgrades and retrofits the 256 MEDEVAC legacy helicopters to achieve the medical capability provided by the HH-60M, which is factory built for the MEDEVAC mission."
