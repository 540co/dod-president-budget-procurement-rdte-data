            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan, approved by the S&T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThe Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research Program addresses technology needs associated with Naval platforms for new capabilities in EO\/IR Sensors, Surveillance, Electronic Warfare, Navigation, Solid State Electronics, Vacuum Electronics Power Amplifiers, and Nanoelectronics. The program supports development of technologies to enable capabilities in Missile Defense, Directed Energy, Platform Protection, Time Critical Strike, and Information Distribution. This program directly supports the Department of Defense Joint Warfighter Plan and the Defense Technology Area Plans. Activities and efforts within this Program have attributes that focus on enhancing the affordability of warfighting systems. The program also provides for technology efforts to maintain proactive connectivity and collaboration between Department of the Navy (DON) Science and Technology (S&T) and Joint, Navy, and Marine Corps commands worldwide.  \n\nAlso included in this PE is the Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signatures against Integrated Sensors (NEMESIS) Innovative Naval Prototype (INP).  NEMESIS technology addresses the need to generate the appearance of a realistic naval force to multiple adversarial surveillance and targeting sensors simultaneously. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

An important subclass are the very high frequency (VHF), ultra-high frequency (UHF), microwave (MW), and millimeter wave (MMW) power amplifiers for Navy all-weather radar, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic attack, communications, and smart weapon systems.  Another subclass are the analog and high speed, mixed signal components that connect the electromagnetic signal environment into and out of digitally realized, specific function systems.  These improved components are based on both silicon (Si) and compound semiconductors (especially the wide bandgap materials and narrow bandgap materials), low and high temperature superconductors, novel nanometer scale structures and materials.  Components addressed by this activity emphasize the MMW and submillimeter wave (SMMW) regions with an increasing emphasis on devices capable of operating in the range from 50 gigahertz (GHz) to 10 terahertz (THz).  The functionality of the technology developed cannot be obtained through Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, linearity, operational and instantaneous bandwidth, weight, and size.  Effort will involve understanding the properties of engineered semiconductors as they apply to quantum information science and technology. \n\nThis activity also includes Anti-Tamper development of innovative techniques and technologies to deter the reverse engineering and exploitation of our military's critical technology and critical program information in order to impede technology transfer and alteration of system capability and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems. The current specific objectives are:\n\na) Solid State Transistors and Devices: Develop solid state transistors and devices for high frequency analog and digital operation.\n\nb) High Efficiency, Highly Linear Amplifiers: Develop high efficiency, highly linear amplifiers for microwave, millimeter-wave, low-noise, and power applications.\n\nc) Superconducting Electronics: Develop components for RF systems utilizing superconducting and other technologies which are designed to deliver software defined, wide band, many simultaneous signal functionality over a wide range of frequencies, in increasingly field-ready packaging and demonstrate the ability of these components to be combined into chains to deliver superior functionality in conventional system contexts, including, but not limited to, SATCOM, Electronic Warfare (EW), signal intelligence (SIGINT), and communications.\n\nd) Control, Reception, Transmission, and Processing of Signals: Develop electronics and photonics technology that provides for the control, reception, transmission and processing of signals.\n\ne) Novel Nanometer Scale Logic\/Memory Devices and Related Circuits and Architectures: Develop novel nanometer scale (feature size at or below 10nm) logic\/memory devices and related circuits and architectures to deliver ultra-low power, light weight and high performance computational capability for autonomous vehicles and individual warfighters.\n\nf) Anti-Tamper: Develope innovative techniques and technologies to deter the reverse engineering and exploitation of our military's critical technology and critical program information in order to impede technology transfer and alteration of system capability and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems. \n\nFunding increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the progression of Anti-Tamper Technology research from Basic to Applied Research.  \n\nFunding decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is the due to the completion of current packaging efforts and the reprioritizing of the additional work need to be pursued.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."
