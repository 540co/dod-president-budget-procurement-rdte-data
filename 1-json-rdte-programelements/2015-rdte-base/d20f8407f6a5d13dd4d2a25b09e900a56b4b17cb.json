Successful resolution of documented discrepancies and qualification will result in a system approved for use and would provide a way ahead to resolve a nuclear security deviation documented by the operating MAJCOM commander.\n\nRefined, researched, and tested technology for automated entry control systems; continued to test, develop, and integrate equipment to improve security and access to facilities. Program office management and test site capability enabled prior year RDT&E investments that:\n- Completed initial evaluation of Vindicator alarm display evaluation with updated operating system and information assurance configuration (46TS report 13-213); maintains viable alarm display system that can be accredited. To be delivered for New Boston AFS installation project and retrofit for aging AF security systems.\n- Completed Advantor alarm display evaluation with updated components and information assurance configuration (46TS report 13-145); maintains viable alarm display system that can be accredited. To be delivered for Fairchild AFB installation project and retrofit for aging AF security systems.\n\nContinued to manage sensor and assessment product developments and tests with the following results. Program office management and test site capability enabled prior year RDT&E investments that:\n- VTW-400 Fence Sensor Deficiency Resolution and Evaluation (09 Nov 12); enabled depot procurement and retrofit of components in the nuclear security environment at three locations ? completed in Sep 13.\n- VICADS evaluation for video storage integrated with Vindicator alarm display (46TS report 13-010); procured with installation in-process for Protection Level 1 security systems at Beale AFB, Cape Cod AFS and a USAFE protection Level 3 system to enable security operators highly reliable pre and post alarm video details for each perimeter alarm.   \n- Fiber Defender (FD-525) Fence Sensor Cold Weather Evaluation (46TS 13-022); verified sensor performance through CTWS evaluation in the range of extreme winter conditions that nuclear security capable base security systems endure at AFGSC locations in the northern plains\n- Defensor-100 Fence Sensor Cold Weather Evaluation (46TS 13-023); verified sensor performance to relieve risk of one commercial source for perimeter fence sensors at nuclear security capable bases within AFGSC\n- Mid-Range Perimeter Surveillance Radar (STS-1400) Evaluation (46TS 13-224); applied AF developed test procedures to validate wide area detection sensor performance at a Missile Defense Agency operational location.\n- Pelco (ES40) Camera engineering analysis to qualify successor product and field evaluation (46TS 13-182); provided immediate relief for five installation delivery orders that had the same obsolescence problem.\n- Bosch (VG5) Camera Evaluation (46TS 13-112); provided immediate relief to remedy an issue with available camera that was no longer manufactured in accord with Trade Agreement Act.\n\nContinued to manage, develop, evaluate, and test Delay\/Denial products:\n- Transitioned development work for consolidation of expeditionary and fixed base alarm display system to consolidate security operator workload into test and evaluation phase. Conducted contractor and initial Government evaluation; following FY14 evaluation and qualification the capability will be deployed at three AFCENT locations to relieve manpower burdens.\n\nContinued to prepare operational systems improvement plans; develop technology roadmap, update system architecture. PEO Battle Management and HAF\/A7S developed plans to increase capacity of evaluating COTS products applicable for IBDSS projects. Plans matured through acquisition strategy development for IBDSS fielding contracts to leverage industry resources. Rapid Improvement Event (RIE) conducted in 4QFY13 to streamline process and reduce risks that COTS product qualification introduce to deployment of IBDSS capabilities."
