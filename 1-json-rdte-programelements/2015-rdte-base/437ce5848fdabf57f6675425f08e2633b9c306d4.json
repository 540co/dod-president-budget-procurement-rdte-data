These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work\/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.\n\n\u2022  Infrastructure.  This program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment for research and education program enhancements to highly sophisticated research instruments, such as lasers and spectrometers.\n\n\u2022  Technical assistance.
