            "val": "Intelligence Advanced Development (IAD) develops and demonstrates technology required to support warfighter needs for timely all source intelligence information. IAD supports global awareness, consistent battlespace knowledge, precision information, and the execution of time critical missions. IAD projects provide better on-time information to the warfighter using new and existing data sources, streamlining data analysis, reducing footprint required, and extending life of sensors in place and enhancing performance.  The Air Force Research Lab, Rome Research Site, Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division (AFRL\/RIE), develops prototype applications for evaluation in a realistic operating environment.  The programs are oriented toward specific shortfalls and deficiencies as documented by the Major Commands (MAJCOMS), unified commands, and intelligence organizations in their mission and functional area plans. This PE expedites technology transition from the laboratory to operational users via rapid prototyping, focusing on technology insertion correcting AF intelligence deficiencies at the tactical and operational levels. This PE bridges the technology transition from Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) and Integrated Technology Thrust Programs (ITTPs) to current\/new systems, and also supports associated Defense Technology Objectives (DTOs). IAD may also reallocate existing resources to support out-of-cycle new\/updated warfighter requirements. \n\nRequirements for this PE are identified and prioritized by the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA). Development of new\/improved capabilities to meet these requirements is managed by AFRL\/RIE. Prototype products, usually in the form of software, are provided to the users for operational environment evaluation. \n\nThis Program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Prototypes will be developed in an open systems architecture environment allowing for the greatest efficiency in terms of integrating or interfacing with other systems.  There are Air Force, DoD, and Coalition requirements to correlate various sources of intelligence information [Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) and Measurement and Signature Intelligence - (MASINT)] within seconds\/minutes vs. hours\/days with current manual and semi-automated methods.  The project includes development of data correlation and predictive intelligence algorithms as well as target analysis and prioritization, air order of battle update, and tactical analysis techniques.  This computerized approach will speed up the correlation of data from diverse sources of intelligence information, including COMINT, ELINT, IMINT and MASINT, providing faster situational awareness and threat assessment, and replacing manual systems with automated capabilities.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning."

IAC tools and algorithms provide NASIC and the 453rd EWS with the ability to produce accurate, predictive, relevant, and timely intelligence that supports client processes, operational planning, and mission execution.  IAC develops new and upgraded analysis, modeling and simulation tools focused on intelligence production supporting AF operational and developmental all source analysis functions. \n\nEach of the development projects within the IAC program portfolio transition technologies to the operational communities through the incremental release of upgraded versions over a period of years as development projects progress towards the final configuration.
