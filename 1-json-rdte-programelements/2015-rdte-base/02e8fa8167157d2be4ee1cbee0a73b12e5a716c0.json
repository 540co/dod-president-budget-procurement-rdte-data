            "val": "Our military forces require resilient, reliable networks and computer systems to conduct effective operations.  However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it urgent and critical to improve the cyber security of Department of Defense (DoD) networks to counter those threats and assure our missions.  This program focuses on innovative and sustained advanced development in both cyber security and computer network operations to mature new concepts to harden key network and computer components to include: designing new resilient cyber infrastructures; increasing the military\u2019s ability to fight and survive during cyber attacks; disrupting nation-state level attack planning and execution; measuring the state of cyber security for the U.S. government; increasing our understanding of cyber as a war-fighting domain; and providing modeling and simulation of cyberspace operations to explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance. \n\nThe Cyber Advanced Technology Development program element is budgeted in the advanced technology development budget activity because it focuses on the maturation of successful applied research results, and their development, into demonstrable advanced cyber security capabilities.  The Cyber Advanced Technology Development program will build on the results of matured applied research from the Cyber Applied Research (0602668D8Z), and other programs, to develop technology demonstrations for potential transition into capabilities that support the full spectrum of computer network operations.  These approaches will include moving from cyber defense to cyber resilience by changing the defensive terrain of our existing digital infrastructure, identifying ways to raise the risk and lower the value of an attack from an advanced persistent cyber threat, and focusing on mission assurance metrics. \n\nThis program focuses on integrating computer network defense (CND) and computer network operations (CNO), in addressing the advanced persistent threat (APT), filling DoD technology gaps as identified in the Cyber Science & Technology Priority Steering Council Roadmap, as determined by assessments conducted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&E))."

This program focuses on integrating computer network defense and computer network operations, addressing joint problems in cyber operations, and filling capability and technology gaps as determined by assessments in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research & Engineering.  Progress and results are reviewed by the Cyber S&T Community of Interest.\n\nEfforts of the program will develop improved and demonstrable capabilities through the DoD science and technology (S&T) organizations within and across the following technical areas:\n\nINFORMATION ASSURANCE AND COMPUTER NETWORK DEFENSE (IA\/CND):\nDevelop technologies to harden DoD network components; evolve from network defense to mission assurance; and enable systems to operate through cyber attacks in degraded and contested environments.\n\nCOMPUTER NETWORK OPERATIONS (CNO):\nDisrupt adversary attack planning and execution; explore game-changing ideas over the full spectrum of CNO and new concepts in cyber warfare; increase collaboration between disparate research communities within CNO; and address identified gaps in DoD CNO S&T to prepare for cyber conflict against advanced persistent threats.\n\nBeginning in FY 2013, the program will expanded research in cyber command and control to provide warfighters and commanders new situational awareness, course of action analysis, cyber operational agility and cyber mission control.  This research will include protection of tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.  The six new technical thrust areas include:\n\nFOUNDATIONS OF TRUST\nRESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE\nAGILE OPERATIONS\nASSURING EFFECTIVE MISSIONS\nCYBER MODELING, SIMULATION, AND EXPERIMENTATION (MSE) \nEMBEDDED, MOBILE, AND TACTICAL ENVIRONMENTS (EMT)"

Cyber Mission Control covers the ability to orchestrate cyber systems to achieve an overarching mission goal.  There is a critical need for tools that can map information technology assets to missions and use modeling and simulation, or other techniques, to perform dynamic analysis of asset criticality and course-of-action alternatives.  Inherent in Cyber Mission Control is the ability to automatically derive and fuse information about the characteristics of information technology systems in a manner that allows us to describe, analyze, observe, and control the operation of information technology components.  A key goal of this research area is to have tools that enable commanders to assess and direct different information technology maneuvers in conjunction with mission actions.
