The ADL Initiative is a DoD program responsible for research and development of distributed and networked learning technologies, to include: online courseware, training games, virtual worlds, and mobile technology.  ADL developed the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM, the de facto industry and internationally accepted standard for e-learning interoperability.  It is mandated for all Department of Defense (DoD) agencies through DoD Instruction 1322.26.  The ADL initiative, working with ADL Partnership Co-Labs and the NATO community, has reduced costs and increased interoperability and sharing of distributed learning content, enabling discovery, retrieval, and reuse.  Online course completions in DoD increased to 20.4 million in FY12, and will likely increase in the future. The ADL Initiative enables the migration of distributed learning content to multiple hardware platforms and software applications using the SCORM standard.  The ADL Initiative is working in collaboration with the Services, other government agencies, industry, and our international partners to develop the next generation learning architecture that will be platform agnostic and enable the use of new software applications, including mentoring, social media and experiential learning. The research project for the future is Project Aristotle.  The first phase is to develop a Personal Assistant for Learning (PAL), a ubiquitous, 24\/7 advanced concept research effort that will provide an untethered, tailored training and learning capability that will adapt to fit the learner\u2019s specific strengths and weaknesses, learning style, and level of proficiency. As we look to the future, the PAL will become more sophisticated, intelligent and comprehensive."

Promote the sharing of data among DoD, other Federal Agencies and state and local education departments throughout the U.S., by making educational resources discoverable and retrievable and also through the open source initiative.  \n5.  Prototype an Intelligent Tutor with the intent to determine the utilization of this technology across DoD and as a step toward the more comprehensive PAL. Metrics include, but are not limited to; Scalability, Generalizability, and Affordability."
