DJC2 will ensure that Joint Force Commanders (JFC) are equipped, as well as trained and organized, to carry out their C2 responsibilities.  DJC2 provides GCCs and JFCs a mission critical, integrated family of systems with which to plan, control, coordinate, execute, and assess operations.  It is designed to deploy rapidly, set up within hours, and quickly provide necessary C2 mission and collaboration functionality across the full spectrum of JTF operations.  The DJC2 has also been deployed in support of Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA\/DR) efforts.  The capability is intended for all levels of conflict and will be reconfigurable to meet specific GCC and JTF mission requirements.  This capability is interoperable with higher and adjacent echelons of command (to include coalition allies) as well as with supporting elements to include joint forces."
