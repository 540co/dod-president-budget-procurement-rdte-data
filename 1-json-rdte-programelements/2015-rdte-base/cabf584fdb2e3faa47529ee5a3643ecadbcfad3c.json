The JTN program will modify this waveform, making it compatible and certifiable with DoD security requirements while enabling porting to tactical radio sets. MUOS is currently being ported by 7 vendors on 7 different platforms."

FY 2015 PE 0605030A represents only the JTNC funding. FY16-19 0605030A represents both the Joint Tactical Networks and JTNC funding. \nIn accordance with the Joint Tactical Networking Center Acquisition Decision Memorandum and Charter dated 20 January 2014, the JTNC Program will remain under a joint budget strategy in the three MILDEPs in new PEs (Army PE 0605030A, Navy PE 0605030N, and Air Force PE 0605030F). As part of the joint program budget strategy, each MILDEP budgets for approximately one-third of the total program RDT&E funds.
