The primary activity through which this is accomplished is the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force?s Unified Engagement (UE) wargame series. UE is a two-year cycle of planning, execution, analysis and reporting of activities that include workshops, seminars, capstone event, senior leader seminar, and Building Partnership Capacity events. The capstone event includes over 400 Joint, other Agency, and coalition partners supported by cutting edge technology creating the Wargame Information Environment (WIE).  The WIE includes a fully deployable suite of information technology as well as Modeling & Simulation tools supported by multiple servers and workstations.  The WIE evolves with each UE game cycle to reflect technological advancement and game objective requirements. The WIE employs numerous models to provide rigor to analysis of collected data to directly assist planners and adjudicators prior to, during and after game execution.  The WIE offers a state of the art system for document management, office collaboration and chat that is fully integrated into the suite of tools.  The newest addition to the WIE is a web-based tool to show force locations and processing force movement requests.  The WIE provides collaboration tools and information throughout the wargame and associated events.

The modeling, simulation, and analysis applications allow UE participants, adjudicators, and control team members to effectively and efficiently create UE Reports informing concept development and supporting the CSAF?s Title 10 responsibilities to organize, train and equipment. The current version of the WIE is 3.0 and 3.5 is to be released in early 2015 in support of UE 16. Risks are low in the research, development, and test of the WIE because of the iterative nature in the design and development of the system."
