The SBIR\/STTR Program funds over one billion dollars annually in mission oriented research and development projects via small technology companies. The purpose of the program is to stimulate technological innovation, increase private sector commercialization of Federal R&D, increase small business participation in Federally funded R&D, foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation, and foster cooperative research & technology transfer between small business and research institutions. The SBIR\/STTR Program is codified in 15 USC 638. The SBIR\/STTR Program competitively funds scientific and technical innovation to specifically address the needs of participating DoD components.\n\n(U) DoD components participating in the SBIR Program include the: Army, Navy, Air Force, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), Joint Science & Technology Office for Chemical & Biological Defense (CBD), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), the Defense Health Program (DHP) and the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) through the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research & Engineering.
