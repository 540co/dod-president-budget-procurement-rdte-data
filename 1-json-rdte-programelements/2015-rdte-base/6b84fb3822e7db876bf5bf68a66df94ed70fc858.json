This project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. Additionally this project matures integrated condition based maintenance technologies that reduce the operation and sustainment costs of vehicle electronics and electrical power devices. Technical challenges include: increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure data networks, interoperability of intra-vehicle systems, and advanced user interfaces. Overcoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test\/evaluation. \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Ground Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC), Warren, MI."

This effort will also test and evaluate standards and components for suitability of integration into vehicle platforms. This effort also supplements the design of electronic architectures to support the efficient integration of electronic components into vehicle systems through the use of open standards. Additionally, this effort matures and expands the VICTORY effort to interface with the Modular APS Architecture.
