            "val": "The Surface Ship Torpedo Defense (SSTD) program provides a detect-to-engage layered torpedo defense capability.  It is comprised of four major efforts, the AN\/SLQ-25 (NIXIE) system, Torpedo Warning System (TWS), the Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT) and Acoustic Device Countermeasure (ADC MK2 Mod4).  There are two development programs, the CAT program develops a canisterized Anti-Torpedo Torpedo (ATT) as an ACAT II program.  The TWS develops the required torpedo detection, classification and localization (TDCL) ship systems as an ACAT III program.  The AN\/SLQ-25X solicitation was cancelled due to a more cost effective technical solution of interfacing the TWS to NIXIE system.\n\nThe program will develop and field six Surface Ship Torpedo Defense prototype (TWS\/CAT) Engineering Design Model (EDM) systems on CVNs. Each prototype consists of one TWS and eight CATs. The six systems were accelerated due to the lack of hard-kill torpedo defense on HVUs which has been exacerbated by recent real-world events and evolving threats. The systems provide a hard-kill torpedo defense capability in advance of the IOC as part of the program of record. The program delivered one hybrid prototype system in FY13 on USS GHW BUSH.   The next prototype is expected to deliver in FY14; This system will be delivered in a roll-on\/roll-off (RO-RO) configuration and installed on USS Roosevelt.  The program will build and deliver one additional RO-RO and one EDM in FY15 and 2 EDMs in FY16.\n\nThe program will focus on first providing torpedo defense capability to High Value Units (HVU). The Initial Operational Capability (IOC) system will be installed on one CVN and one Combat Logistics Force (CLF) ship (both HVUs) with IOC in FY19."

Applied Research Lab (ARL) will complete the EDM-2 design and hold a Critical Design Review (CDR) in FY15. ARL will fabricate test articles and 40 total EDM-2 CATS in support of the prototype fielding.  Integration testing began in FY13 and will continue through delivery of the prototype CATs.  A complete Technical Data Package (TDP) will be prepared.   Program will enter Milestone C decision in late FY16 and a competitive fixed price contract will be awarded to build low rate initial production (LRIP) units.  These units will support operational testing beginning in FY18 with an FY19 IOC.\n\nTWS Program:  In FY09 and FY10, a towed sensor system specification was developed and 2 sea tests were conducted on Navy destroyers that demonstrated the ability of three different passive sonar ranging techniques and demonstrated the benefit of new torpedo detection sonar waveforms.  Data from these tests is being applied to the HVU application, and the sensor specification is being modified to meet the increased capability required for HVU ships.  Development and production of the new sensors is being conducted by 3Phoenix.  A complete sensor set was delivered in 2nd QTR FY12 to support an at sea test in the 3rd QTR FY12.  At the same time, a ready-stowage rack, and fire control systems are being developed by Pacific Engineering Incorporated (PEI) and In-Depth Engineering, respectively.  All of these components were brought together for integration in FY13.  This integration will support fabrication and fielding of the prototype systems.  This testing will inform a Milestone C decision in late FY16.  A contract will be awarded for TWS LRIP systems to support Operational Testing beginning in FY18, with an FY19 IOC."
