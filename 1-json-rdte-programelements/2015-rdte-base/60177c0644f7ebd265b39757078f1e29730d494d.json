            "val": "To support the Air Force worldwide flying mission, this program element funds research, development and management of new air traffic control communications, surveillance, positioning, and precision approach and landing systems.  When applicable, this includes joint efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  ATCALS funding focuses on three main efforts as follows: \n\nDeployable Instrument Landing System (D-ILS).  D-ILS is a deployable Category I (200ft decision height\/2400ft runway visual range) ILS with remote monitoring and maintenance capabilities.  D-ILS will provide precision approach capability in adverse weather conditions for contingency operations and humanitarian or disaster relief operations.  D-ILS will replace the current Air Force mobile Precision Approach Radar (PAR) system used to support operations at deployed locations which were procured in the 1970s, are manpower intensive, and logistically unsupportable.  On average, only 18% (three of 17 systems) of the mobile PAR systems are operational on a daily basis.  D-ILS will support increased operations in the area of responsibility, allow phase out of the currently obsolete legacy systems and provide interoperability with the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF).  The D-ILS Capability Development Document (CDD) was approved by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) on 16 Sep 08.  No development funds are requested in FY15.  \n\nAs discussed under D-ILS accomplishments\/plans in Section C, the D-ILS development contract was terminated on 6 Nov 13.  Using an updated Systems Requirements Document and lessons learned from the terminated effort, a restructured program is now planned and evaluation of responses to an industry request for information is on-going.  At least one production ready deployable system is available for evaluation.  Related OPAF funds are in program element (PE) 0305114F (Weapon System Code 833010).\n\nDeployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON).  D-RAPCON will replace the 40 year old AN\/MPN-14K and AN\/TPN-19 Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and Operations Shelter (OPS) subsystems with state of the art digital systems.  Modification and overhaul of the existing systems has proven to be ineffective due to diminishing manufacturing sources.  The D-RAPCON will be used to provide both a terminal and enroute surveillance capability.  The D-RAPCON will also be used with the D-ILS and a fixed or mobile control tower to provide a complete air traffic control capability.  The D-RAPCON will support tactical military and worldwide humanitarian operations and also provide a capability to support domestic disaster relief.  The primary surveillance radar coverage (non-cooperative targets) is out to 60 nautical miles (nm) and the secondary surveillance radar coverage (cooperative targets) is out to 120 nm.  The D-RAPCON CDD was approved by the AFROC on 8 Feb 11.  FY15 funds continue engineering, manufacturing and development (EMD) efforts which include the contractor testing of the preproduction system and the start of developmental testing.  Related OPAF funds are in the PE 0305114F Weapon System Code 833010.  \n\nNext Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  This is an interagency effort designed to enable the transition from a ground infrastructure dominated Air Traffic Management capability for the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) to a capability that leverages advances in Performance Based Navigation (PBN), non-radar based surveillance services, and transition from solid-state analogue voice communications to networked digital voice and data exchange.  Per Deputy Secretary of Defense direction (28 Dec 07 Memo), the Air Force is the DoD lead Service for NextGen implementation and architecture development.  NextGen will be built on key elements from existing programs and technologies and on new systems under development.  As these technologies and architectures mature, ground system upgrades will be coordinated and fielded concurrently with aircraft avionics capabilities that are acquired and integrated into Air Force aircraft (manned and unmanned).  These efforts will also run in close parallel with the Communication, Navigation and Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) program in PE 0305099F.  FY15 efforts continue proof of concept demonstrations and analysis leading to Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA).  The concept demonstration will explore development of a transportable\/scalable sensor agnostic configuration to provide GBSAA Pilot-in-the-loop display services using fixed or deployable radar system inputs.  FY15 funding also continues development\/test of new Instrument Procedures Development System (IPDS) software (joint effort with FAA and Services), NextGen Lead Service Office tasks which include preparation of NextGen Concept of Operations and Implementation Plans, PBN and ADS-B Benefits\/Business Cases, a DoD Integrated Work Plan, RPA GBSAA Engagement Plan, and a DoD NextGen Enterprise Architecture Strategic Roadmap.  Other NextGen efforts include upgrade of surveillance radar and automation systems with new capabilities such as Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe, and evaluation of NAS Networked Digital Voice Switch and Next Generation Ground Communications (NEXCOMM) radios in USAF air traffic control facilities and RPA pilot control stations.  In total, these efforts will support the seamless integration of RPAs into the National Airspace System and the airspaces of other nations, improve the display of aircraft position to air traffic controllers, determine future requirements for digital communications with manned and unmanned aircraft, and enhance flight safety.   \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "To support the Air Force worldwide flying mission, this program element funds research, development and management of new air traffic control communications, surveillance, positioning, and precision approach and landing systems.  When applicable, this includes joint efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  ATCALS funding focuses on three main efforts as follows: \n\nDeployable Instrument Landing System (D-ILS).  D-ILS is a deployable Category I (200ft decision height\/2400ft runway visual range) ILS with remote monitoring and maintenance capabilities.  D-ILS will provide precision approach capability in adverse weather conditions for contingency operations and humanitarian or disaster relief operations.  D-ILS will replace the current Air Force mobile Precision Approach Radar (PAR) system used to support operations at deployed locations which were procured in the 1970s, are manpower intensive, and logistically unsupportable.  On average, only 18% (three of 17 systems) of the mobile PAR systems are operational on a daily basis.  D-ILS will support increased operations in the area of responsibility, allow phase out of the currently obsolete legacy systems and provide interoperability with the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF).  The D-ILS Capability Development Document (CDD) was approved by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) on 16 Sep 08.  No development funds are requested in FY15.  \n\nAs discussed under D-ILS accomplishments\/plans in Section C, the D-ILS development contract was terminated on 6 Nov 13.  Using an updated Systems Requirements Document and lessons learned from the terminated effort, a restructured program is now planned and evaluation of responses to an industry request for information is on-going.  At least one production ready deployable system is available for evaluation.  Related OPAF funds are in program element (PE) 0305114F (Weapon System Code 833010).\n\nDeployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON).  D-RAPCON will replace the 40 year old AN\/MPN-14K and AN\/TPN-19 Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and Operations Shelter (OPS) subsystems with state of the art digital systems.  Modification and overhaul of the existing systems has proven to be ineffective due to diminishing manufacturing sources.  The D-RAPCON will be used to provide both a terminal and enroute surveillance capability.  The D-RAPCON will also be used with the D-ILS and a fixed or mobile control tower to provide a complete air traffic control capability.  The D-RAPCON will support tactical military and worldwide humanitarian operations and also provide a capability to support domestic disaster relief.  The primary surveillance radar coverage (non-cooperative targets) is out to 60 nautical miles (nm) and the secondary surveillance radar coverage (cooperative targets) is out to 120 nm.  The D-RAPCON CDD was approved by the AFROC on 8 Feb 11.  FY15 funds continue engineering, manufacturing and development (EMD) efforts which include the contractor testing of the preproduction system and the start of developmental testing.  Related OPAF funds are in the PE 0305114F Weapon System Code 833010.  \n\nNext Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  This is an interagency effort designed to enable the transition from a ground infrastructure dominated Air Traffic Management capability for the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) to a capability that leverages advances in Performance Based Navigation (PBN), non-radar based surveillance services, and transition from solid-state analogue voice communications to networked digital voice and data exchange.  Per Deputy Secretary of Defense direction (28 Dec 07 Memo), the Air Force is the DoD lead Service for NextGen implementation and architecture development.  NextGen will be built on key elements from existing programs and technologies and on new systems under development.  As these technologies and architectures mature, ground system upgrades will be coordinated and fielded concurrently with aircraft avionics capabilities that are acquired and integrated into Air Force aircraft (manned and unmanned).  These efforts will also run in close parallel with the Communication, Navigation and Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) program in PE 0305099F.  FY15 efforts continue proof of concept demonstrations and analysis leading to Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA).  The concept demonstration will explore development of a transportable\/scalable sensor agnostic configuration to provide GBSAA Pilot-in-the-loop display services using fixed or deployable radar system inputs.  FY15 funding also continues development\/test of new Instrument Procedures Development System (IPDS) software (joint effort with FAA and Services), NextGen Lead Service Office tasks which include preparation of NextGen Concept of Operations and Implementation Plans, PBN and ADS-B Benefits\/Business Cases, a DoD Integrated Work Plan, RPA GBSAA Engagement Plan, and a DoD NextGen Enterprise Architecture Strategic Roadmap.  Other NextGen efforts include upgrade of surveillance radar and automation systems with new capabilities such as Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe, and evaluation of NAS Networked Digital Voice Switch and Next Generation Ground Communications (NEXCOMM) radios in USAF air traffic control facilities and RPA pilot control stations.  In total, these efforts will support the seamless integration of RPAs into the National Airspace System and the airspaces of other nations, improve the display of aircraft position to air traffic controllers, determine future requirements for digital communications with manned and unmanned aircraft, and enhance flight safety.   \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
