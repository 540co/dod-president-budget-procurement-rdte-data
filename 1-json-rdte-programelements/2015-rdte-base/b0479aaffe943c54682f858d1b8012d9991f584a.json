The efforts included Common Display work, development of top-level requirements, and participation in the SARP workshops - leading the development of SAA concepts, definitions and requirements. The display work included Display Usability Tests conducted with UAS operators in Huntsville, AL and at Ft Huachuca, AZ to refine the Alert & Traffic Display subsystem. In addition to the usability tests, a Common Display Quick Study utilizing 15 Army participants \u2013 including manned pilots, unmanned operators and air traffic control personnel - was conducted with a focus on intruder prioritization schemes for a common display. Army's top level GBSAA requirements and a high-level description of its approval process were submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to provide a framework for a written agreement between DoD\/Army and the FAA on full integrated GBSAA operations, starting with Ft Hood, TX. Army GBSAA is considered a \u201cpathfinder\u201d for SAA system certification by the FAA. Army GBSAA Block 0 system requirements are base-lined and the development of software certification is underway with integration testing scheduled to begin in July 2014. Cherry Point MCAS began flying segregated transit GBSAA operations under a Certificate of Authorization (COA) in June 2013.  Cherry Point\u2019s COA approval provides a path for the Services to follow for self-certification and safety risk management."
