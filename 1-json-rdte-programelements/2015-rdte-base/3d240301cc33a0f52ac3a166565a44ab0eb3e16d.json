It addresses the gap that exists between when a technology is first demonstrated and when it can be successfully acquired as an operational capability.  TTP bridges that gap by funding promising system and subsystem concepts for technology integration and demonstration to continue beyond the laboratory.  It allows acquisition program managers (the developers and providers) and warfighters (the end users) to integrate, prototype, and demonstrate candidate technologies and assess them in an operational environment.  As a result, the warfighters can assess the capability first-hand and accurately fund the follow-on acquisition program during the next budgeting cycle.  TTP includes research and development funds for the following transition activities: prototyping of promising, high-priority concepts and technologies in an operational environment to lower acquisition risk by raising the technology readiness level; performing pre-acquisition systems engineering to facilitate transition from a demonstration program into acquisition programs of record; assessing interface requirements of candidate concepts, technologies, and demonstration projects to better understand true engineering costs resulting from insertion of new technologies into the Air Force architecture; and capturing data through information technology tools and databases to help formulate strategies and gather proposals for development that have the potential to perform Department of Defense (DoD) missions.  The program provides funding to mature adaptive turbine engine technologies for next generation propulsion systems.  The program will leverage adaptive turbine engine science and technology demonstrations to develop a multi-platform common adaptive engine built around a commercially derived core.
