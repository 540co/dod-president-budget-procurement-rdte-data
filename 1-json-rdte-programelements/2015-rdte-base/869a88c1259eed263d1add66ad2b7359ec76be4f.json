Expeditionary Base Camp (EBC) systems provide an operational capability for Small Combat Units (battalion and below) and Soldiers in varying environments which are rapidly deployable and re-locatable and require no Military Construction and limited materiel handing support. This project integrates mature technologies to create mission specific lab demonstrators and evaluates the performance capabilities using metrics and methodologies developed under PE 0602786A\/Project VT4.\n\nEfforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Director, Defense Research and Engineering Strategic Plan, the Army Modernization Strategy, and the Army Science and Technology Master Plan.\n\nWork in this project is led, performed and\/or managed by the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA and fully coordinated with PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0602784A and 0603734A (Military Engineering), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development) and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology)."
