            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE funds applied research efforts in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking, and neutralization.  Technologies being developed within this PE are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking, and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  Related efforts are aimed at leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship, and air ASW assets. Research focused on understanding the impacts on marine mammals of manmade underwater sound is also conducted in the Program Element.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

                                        "val": "ASW Distributed Search focuses on the development of technologies for the non-covert tactical search for undersea targets ranging from hours to weeks, using automated sensor systems deployed around operating areas, including along key transit routes to protect naval\/maritime forces, around temporarily fixed sea base regions and naval force operating areas, or around fixed defensive regions and areas of interest, such as key US\/Allied ports. \"Non-covert\" implies availability of airborne assets for sensor deployment (although other means may also be used), and the ability to employ active sonar along with passive and non-acoustic methods. \"Search\" is conducted in concentrated areas, typically exploiting cues received from surveillance systems. The submarine target must be detected beyond its weapons release range. The objective is to develop rapidly deployable systems employing automated detection and classification capabilities for use in both shallow and deep water operating environments. Distributed Search supports the ASW protected passage Maritime Shield operational constructs. Related efforts include the development of distributed systems employing optimization as well as active acoustic sensing and processing techniques, navy-unique transduction and underwater networking technology. Efforts also include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing persistent detection concepts and components. These efforts provide an extended reach of organic platform-based systems through the use of new sensor concepts, improved materials for advanced sensors, optimized deployment, employment, and automated operation of distributed sensor fields. The cornerstone of Distributed Search is the development of rapidly deployable, long-endurance active sensors with automated processing suitable for use in a wide variety of operational environments. \n\nFunding increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to realignments required to re-prioritize S&T investments resulting in an increase in ASW Initiatives."
