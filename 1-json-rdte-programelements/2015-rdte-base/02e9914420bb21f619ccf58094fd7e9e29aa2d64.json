            "val": "This program provides for P-3C aircraft systems development and test in subsurface and surface surveillance, search, detection, localization, classification, attack and communications in support of Sea Shield\/Sea Power 21.  The P-3C Sensor Integration project integrates advanced and future Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) sensors, weapons systems, and supporting technology into legacy P-3C systems and phased capabilities upgrades.  The program also advances Air Acoustic Rapid Cots Insertion (ARCI) efforts by replacing legacy MIL-SPEC UYS-1 with increasingly open, Commercial Off The Shelf-based architecture.   Also, P-3 Sensor Integration will expand software and hardware technology of P-3 systems to integrate additional sensor and processing capabilities, environmental prediction tools, tactical decision aides, color capabilities and communications to improve aircrew tactical proficiency and battlespace awareness.  Sensor Integration is a continuous effort to integrate and test newly evolving ASW and ASuW technologies such as Improved Extended Echo Ranging and Multistatic Acoustic Coherent family of Multi-Static active systems, ARCI, Non-acoustic ASW sensors and systems, and future Technical Refresh insertions for obsolescence and processing improvements.  The Over the Horizon (OTH) Wideband system will provide the  P-3C ASuW Improvement Program aircraft the capability to conduct OTH Satellite communications which will allow the on-station aircraft to transmit real-time sensitive acoustic intelligence data which will maximize enemy detections, tracking and engagement opportunities.  \n\nFatigue Life Management Program is required to manage P-3\/EP-3 inventory fatigue life and includes ongoing structural analysis, analyzing emergent structural issues, conducting engineering studies, assessing Fleet impact, and applying new technologies such as Non-Destructive Inspection techniques.\n\nThis program is funded under SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION because it includes those projects that have passed Milestone B approval and are conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirement prior to full-rate production decision."
