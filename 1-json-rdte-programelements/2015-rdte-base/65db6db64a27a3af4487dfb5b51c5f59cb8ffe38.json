Directs, integrates and synchronizes advances in USAF capability to combat Weapons of Mass Destruction. Focal point for USAF arms control policy, implementation and compliance with international treaties and agreements, diplomatic clearances and airspace\/aircraft sovereignty issues. Defines and defends the USAF role in ballistic missile defense. Represents USAF in international, interagency, DoD, Joint, inter-Service, COCOM and MAJCOM forums and implementation groups on matters involving national security policy and strategy.\n\nOpen Skies Sensors - The OC-135B aircraft supports the implementation of the United States Government (USG) Open Skies Treaty. The Open Skies Treaty allows signatories to conduct observation flights over each other's territory using fixed-wing, unarmed observation aircraft. Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras. Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states,\" The United States shall begin budgeting no later than Fiscal Year 2014 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors. (U)\" Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, frequently unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured.  In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock."

This program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15).  The Open Skies Treaty allows signatories to conduct observation flights over each other's territory using fixed-wing, unarmed observation aircraft. The aircraft can use optical cameras, video cameras, sideways-looking synthetic aperture radar, and infrared line scanning devices.  There are 34 participating states to the Open Skies Treaty.  The Air Force is required to allow over flight of USAF bases per multilateral request; to acquire, operate, and maintain the aircraft and equipment utilized during over flights of partner countries; to provide required sensor media and initial media processing; and to provide airfield servicing, logistics, and maintenance for foreign over flights of the US.\n\nOpen Skies Sensors - Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras.  Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states,\" The United States shall begin budgeting no later than Fiscal Year 2014 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors. (U)\" Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, frequently unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured.  In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock. Furthermore, the ultimate imagery product customer desires digital format products. This camera replacement program will replace the wet film cameras with modern, digital cameras. Modern, digital cameras will be more reliable, maintainable and cost effective. The customer will be able to more readily use the imagery products. Equipment service life will be extended significantly.\n\nTest articles will be procured for the purpose of developental testing and to support Treaty certification of the sensors."
