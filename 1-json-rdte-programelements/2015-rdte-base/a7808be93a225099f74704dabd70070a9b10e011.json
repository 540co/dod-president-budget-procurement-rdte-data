The LVSR Modification line funds numerous modifications and initiatives that are required to address operational priorities, engineering change proposals, safety concerns, support equipment inefficiencies, tool malfunctions, product quality deficiencies, and other issues that effect vehicle reliability, availability, maintainability and readiness. A proactive and focused approach ensures proper vehicle sustainment and life cycle management and it allows the flexibility to develop and implement improvements as needed to respond to the evolving needs of the Marine Corps. Reduction of funding from FY14 to FY15 is due to the decreased number of ECPs and safety mods required."

                            "val": "The M1A1 Mod Kit effort includes improvements in all areas of the M1A1 main battle tank and the Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB).  The M1A1 tank provides armor protected firepower to the USMC ground combat element.  Efforts under the mod line pertaining to the M1A1 include improvements in lethality systems to increase armament accuracy, increase the crew's situational awareness through sensor enhancements and intra-vehicular data sharing, providing for off-board targeting improvement, and environmental testing of components.  The AVLB provides the Marine Corps only armor-protected assault gap crossing capability.  Continued funding is required to address obsolescence, address operational deficiencies to adapt the tank and AVLB to a changing operational environment and support user-defined product improvements. These improvements directly address Marine Corps Lessons Learned, after action reports, and will ensure maximum survivability, sustainability, and readiness.\n\nRoute Reconnaissance and Clearance (R2C) is an incremental development project to enhance the capabilities of the R2C systems, a family of systems fielded in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) via the Urgent Needs Statement (UNS) process.  This research and development effort will integrate future vehicles, robots, and associated equipment to provide standoff detection, marking, and neutralization of Explosive Hazards such as mines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).  Enhancements for R2C will provide capabilities not found in the current inventory to defeat explosive hazards and will protect Marines and equipment while conducting route and area clearance operations.  The integration of the next generation of armored security and support vehicles, Vehicle Mounted Mine Detectors (VMMDs), specialized robots, and a new suite of detection, marking, and neutralization systems will enable maneuver commanders to make timely and informed decisions in avoiding or neutralizing explosive hazards that impede their missions.  Multiple detection and marking capabilities will detect a broader spectrum of explosive hazards and achieve higher overall effectiveness rates, while standoff and remote-controlled detection, marking, and neutralization capabilities will enhance force protection and system survivability. Operational speeds and rates will increase, which will better support the maneuver force operational tempo.  This program does not have funding beyond FY2014.\n\nThe Engineer Mods and Tool Kits line funds modifications and initiatives which are required to address operational priorities, engineering change proposals, safety concerns, support equipment inefficiencies, product quality deficiencies and other issues that affect vehicle reliability, availability and readiness.  This proactive and focused approach ensures proper vehicle sustainment and life cycle management in response to evolving needs of the Marine Corps fleet.  Operational needs to provide personnel survivability on engineer equipment is essential to current and future operations.  Research and development funding develops and integrates new lighter, compact armor technology and supports ballistic testing for applications to existing and future acquisitions.    \n\nCorrosion Prevention and Control (CPAC): The useful life of Marine Corps assets will be extended through a comprehensive CPAC RDT&E program aimed at identifying and certifying new corrosion control products, materials, processes and procedures for legacy and new acquisition.\n\nThe Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Family of Vehicles (FoV) provides tactical mobility for Warfighters with multi-mission vehicles designed to support urgent operational needs and protect personnel from the effects of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), underbody mines, and small arms fire threats.  Five vehicle categories (CATs) have been tested, procured, fielded and sustained: Category I - Urban combat operations, ambulance.  Category II - Multi-mission ops-convoy lead, troop transport, ambulance, utility vehicle.  Category III - Mine\/IED clearance ops, explosive ordnance disposal.  MRAP All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) - Combat operations (ops) in rural, mountainous, urban terrain.  Other Protected Vehicles- Specialty mission or unique configuration. Provides the same threshold ballistic, mine and IED protection as other MRAP vehicles.  Includes the MRAP Recovery Vehicle (MRV) variant.\n\nThe Low Metallic Signature Mine Detector (LMS MD) will provide a light-weight, man portable, handheld detection capability that is capable of detecting traditional, low metallic, non-metallic mines, and explosive devices.  The LMS MD capability enables mobility of dismounted forces by significantly increasing their ability to locate, mark, avoid, and\/or reduce mine and IED threats.  It will enable better categorization and identification of explosive hazards as it will be capable of detecting and discriminating between symmetric mines and asymmetric explosive devices, to include metallic, low metallic and zero metallic mines, IEDs, and Unexploded Ordinance (UXO) throughout a MAGTF Area of Operations (AO).  The replacement detection capability to the interim VMR2 Minehound and AN\/PSS-14 Mine Detector Program of Record, the LMS MD will be fielded throughout the Combat Engineer and EOD communities to provide dismounted maneuver and mobility support to a MAGTF in an expeditionary environment.  This program does not have funding beyond FY2014.\n\nEngineer Squad Robot (ESR) provides the Ground Combat Element with a lightweight back packable robot to support the maneuver commander with organic route and obstacle reconnaissance, urban scouting and breaching capabilities, explosive detection, interrogation and reduction in support of dismounted tactical maneuver across the spectrum of conflict. The Robot will be part of the T\/E of Combat Engineer Squads in both active and reserve Combat Engineer Battalions (CEB), Marine Wing support Squadrons (MWSS) and additional systems are allocated for supporting establishments.  This program does not have funding beyond FY2014.\n\nThe FY14 to FY15 decrease reflects the adjustment of Marine Corps fiscal priorities which includes the termination of funding for the Route Reconnaissance and Clearance (R2C), Low Metallic Signature Mine Detector (LMSMD), and Engineer Squad Robot programs."

The USMC will research, develop, and evaluate programs to improve the survivability and lethality of the USMC tank.  These efforts include the Abrams integrated Display and Targeting System, threat detection and warning, situational awareness, survivability, and ownership cost reduction work. M1A1 Mods will exercise options on existing contracts of varying types to conduct research and analysis associated with the development of modifications and corrosion prevention to the M1A1 Tank and supporting platforms.  \t\n(U) Route Reconnaissance and Clearance (R2C):  Starting in FY10, the Marine Corps began to procure a fleet of standardized Route Reconnaissance and Clearance systems based upon the successful route clearance teams operating in Iraq using Capabilities Production Documents for current systems and leveraging contracts already in place.  Concurrently, supports a research and development effort to integrate future vehicles with enhanced mobility and survivability, a suite of improved detection and marking capabilities, and robots with greater detection, marking, and neutralization capabilities. As a result of adjustments to Marine Corps fiscal priorities the R2C program has been terminated. This program does not have funding beyond FY14. \n\n(U) Engineer Mods and Tool Kits:  This is a roll-up line of various engineering efforts, modifications and other related items less than $5 Million each.  This program provides for significant improvements to a various pieces of engineering equipment by enhancing their capabilities and improving readiness.  \n\n(U) Corrosion Prevention and Control (CPAC) Program: The Program will execute the RDT&E Program through direct allocation of funding to the Naval Surface Warfare Center - Carderock Division Corrosion Research and Engineering Branch for comprehensive program aimed at identifying and certifying new corrosion control products, materials, processes and procedures for legacy and new acquisition.\n\n(U) Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP):  The Program will execute RDT&E funds in support of Cougar Egress and Seat Survivability testing.  Funds will also support research and development efforts associated with Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) for survivability and mobility upgrades. \n\n(U) The Low Metallic Signature Mine Detector will develop, integrate, test, evaluate and procure a new hand-held mine detector system to replace the current AN\/PSS-14 Mine Detector Program of Record. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) technology has improved significantly since the development of the AN\/PSS-14, allowing greater efficiency, target discrimination, miniaturization, longer operating time and command & control. The Low Metallic Signature Mine Detector will be effective against low and non metallic devices, capable of identifying man-made objects, weigh less than 7 lbs, capable of start-up and calibration in less than 60 seconds, and be integrated with existing C2 systems. As a result of adjustments to Marine Corps fiscal priorities the LMS-MD program has been terminated for FY15 thru FYDP.\n\n(U) The Engineer Squad Robot(ESR)\/CRS-I provides Marines and Soldiers a dismounted standoff capability for scouting and explosive hazard detection.  USMC ESR will formally merge with the Joint USMC\/Army Common Robotic System (Individual) (CRS-I) starting in FY16.  By combining efforts, there will be an improvement in meeting \"Better Buying\" initiatives as the Approved  Acquisition Objective (AAO) will increase from a USMC AAO of 274 to a Joint AAO of 3,734.  Prior to FY16, the ESR will conduct a Joint AoA for the multi-mission Unmanned Ground System (UGS) and a WSTA to assist in determining the best alternative for the ESR\/CRS-I program.  After completion of the WSTA and AoA, the acquisition approach for the Joint ESR\/CRS-I will be determined.  AoA approval is scheduled for 4th Qtr FY14. As a result of adjustments to Marine Corps fiscal priorities the ESR program has been terminated for FY15 thru FYDP."

                            "val": "The Marine Corps Tactical Motor Transport Modification project manages procurement and life cycle sustainment for more than 40,000 principle end items divided among four fleets:  Light Fleet, Medium Fleet, Heavy Fleet, and Special Fleet.  A sustained effort is maintained in the Marine Corps for development and testing in support of fleet Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) initiatives, vehicle quality deficiency resolutions, safety initiatives, environmental\/state transportation mandated vehicle changes, and system component refresh modifications efforts.  Since transportation asset operational availability declines at a steady rate over time, SLEP, fleet overhauls, and enhanced depot level modifications are essential in maintaining a viable transportation capability in the Marine Corps Operating Forces. \t\n\nThe Improved Recovery Vehicle (IRV) project includes improvements in all areas of the M88A2 Improved Recovery Vehicle. Continued funding is required to address obsolescence and support pre-planned product improvements.  In addition, will implement lessons learned and develop safety related Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to correct hazards noted during the standard day to day operation of the M88A2 Improved Recovery Vehicle.\n\nThe HMMWV Sustainment Modification Initiative (SMI) program will restore selected variants of the remaining armored HMMWV fleet to 2004 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) performance parameters.  This will be accomplished via a modification through kitting approach.  The improvements will focus on restoring the vehicles to safe operating parameters over the expeditionary mission profile, restoring reliability, payload, and mobility to ORD thresholds.  The FY15 funding increase reflects the commencement of vendor drive-off testing operational assessment.  \n\t \nThe Material Handling Equipment (MHE) line is a roll-up line that provides for the replacement and Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) of Marine Corps MHE including forklifts, cranes, and container handlers.  Funds will be used to explore techniques and technology to help survivability of the various platforms while also working to help sustain reliability and performance of the equipment.\n\nThe Family of Construction Equipment (FCE) line is a roll-up line that provides for the replacement and Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) of Marine Corps construction equipment.  Funds will be used for Ballistic and Add on Armor (AoA) application tests and integration into the Engineer Family of Systems construction equipment.    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nP-19 Replacement (P-19R) will replace the aging A\/S32P-19A Crash Fire Rescue fleet in support of expeditionary airfield operations and the supporting establishment.  The vehicle will be outfitted with advanced fire suppression equipment and provide rescue and aircraft fire fighting capabilities to permanent and expeditionary airfields throughout the Marine Corps.  The P-19 Replacement may also be employed to fight structure fires in support of base camps and as firefighting support to other elements of the MAGTF, such as ammunition supply points, Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricant (POL) distribution points, or hazardous material storage facilities. The increase in funding from FY14 to FY15 is due to an additional testing requirement to support Full Rate Production (FRP) of the P-19R.\n\nMTVR Trailer and Family of Tactical Trailers programs will explore options for \"lightening the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF)\" weight and cube attributes of our light and medium trailer fleet.  Seeking technologies and other current and emerging options that can be employed to achieve optimum lift capability while constrained to the desired weight and cube.  Transportation and expeditionary goals will be considered in the research and development phase for the trailer fleet. The MTVR Trailer program is a USMC initiative to replace the current M105\/MK149\/M353 Trailers with a trailer capable of augmenting the MTVR's increased mobility without degrading its operational capabilities. This program will develop and field a trailer which will have greater mobility characteristics while increasing the payload up to 12,000 lbs. The FY14 to FY15 decrease is due to completion of developmental testing and movement of program to Full Rate Production (FRP).    \n\nFamily of Material Handling Equipment will explore ways to armor or design survivability for various pieces of equipment in the Material Handling Family."

Improvements include Engineering Change Proposals addressing safety, reliability, and technology upgrades.\n\nThe HMMWV Sustainment Modification Initiative (SMI) program will take a five-phased approach. The first phase will include trade studies and preliminary design; the second phase will focus on final design and the building of component upgrade kits; the third phase will include performance and RAM testing of production representative kitted vehicles against the requirements in the 2004 HMMWV ORD; the fourth phase will complete development of the technical specification; and the fifth phase will award the production contract.  The vehicle improvements will be accomplished by enhancing the HMMWVs at industry facilities, government depots, or a partnering combination of the two, via a modification through kitting approach.  Open competition for providing the kits and installing\/integrating them into existing platforms is a key goal. \n\nThe P-19 Replacement will leverage COTS and\/or NDI components in an effort to minimize costs, test requirements, and reduce development time. P-19R will supplant the aging A\/S32P-19A fleet in support of expeditionary airfield operations and the supporting establishment. The vehicle will be outfitted with advanced fire suppression equipment and provide rescue and aircraft fire fighting capabilities to permanent and expeditionary airfields throughout the Marine Corps. The P-19 Replacement may also be employed to fight structure fires in support of base camps and as firefighting support to other elements of the MAGTF, such as ammunition supply points, Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL) distribution points, or hazardous material storage facilities.\n\nMotor Transport Modification funding will focus on streamlined acquisitions of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf\/Non-Developmental Items (COTS\/NDI) that can be identified, integrated, and tested in a short amount of time.  Successful modifications and tests are intended for follow-on procurement and incorporation into existing system component upgrades, SLEPs, or rapid COTS\/NDI fielding for the Fleet Marine Forces (FMF).\n\nThe Family of Material Handling Equipment acquisition strategy will use RDT&E funding to explore current and new armor options that can be used to achieve optimum crew survivability performance. \n\nThe Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) Trailer program's original acquisition strategy consisted of procuring three variants of trailers that would have greater mobility characteristics, while maximizing the commonality of parts, across the three trailer platform.  FY05 RDTE funds were used to procure six prototypes trailers (two of each variants) developed by Choctaw Manufacturing Developing Contractors (CMDC). Prior to a fielding decision, the original MTVR Trailer program was halted due to concerns the trailers did not meet the CMC goal to lighten the MAGTF.  As a result, the MTVR Trailer program was restructured for re-design of the cargo trailer and to delay procurement of the Water and General Purpose trailers.  On 29 November 2012, a CD&I letter directed that the trailer requirement would now be constructed as a modular trailer capable of hauling the water SIXCON and all expeditionary power units, to include the 100Kw generator.  The new modular design would replace the MK149, M353, and M105 trailer and would be designated as the MTVR Modular Trailer, MK593.\n\nThe Family of Construction Equipment acquisition strategy will use RDT&E funding to explore current and new armor options that can be used to achieve optimum crew survivability performance.  \n\nThe Family of Tactical Trailer (FTT) acquisition strategy will use RDT&E funding to explore current and new technological options that can be used to achieve optimum lift within the desired weight and cube constraints in support of the \"Lightening the MAGTF\" initiative. Transportation and expeditionary goals will be considered in the research and development phase for the light and medium\/heavy trailer fleet."

The E2CU program will provide tactical Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and superior reliability for all MAGTF units in all operational concepts.  E2CU will replace all legacy ECUs starting in 2015 in the following sizes: 9000 BTU\/Hr; 18,000 BTU\/Hr; 36,000 BTU\/Hr; and 60,000 BTU\/Hr.  These higher reliability and higher efficiency sets will use EPA-approved refrigerants, will be more energy efficient, be more mobile, easier to repair, and quieter than their predecessors.  A significant average fuel efficiency improvement over the current ECU family has been demonstrated.  With environmental control systems consuming 50-70% of tactical electric power in theater, this savings will be a significant contribution to reducing the USMC fuel demand, and lightening the MAGTF.  The Warfighter benefit includes a decreased logistics footprint, less reliance on petroleum-derived fuels, increased local energy security, and reduced tanker losses (fewer on the road).  The operational imperative to reduce fuel usage will consequently reduce refueling operations and exposing Marines to hazardous fuel convoy operations.  The funding decrease from FY14 and FY15 reflects the requirements and resource realignment of all commodity areas and budget adjustments made by the Marine Corps Combat Development Command.\n\nMobile Power Equipment:\nThe Family of Mobile Electric Power Equipment consists of skid and trailer mounted tactical generators ranging from 1 to 200 kilowatts, Mobile Electric Power Distribution Systems, Load Banks, and Electrician's Tool Kits.  This equipment is procured and fielded to provide electricity on the battlefield. Combat, combat support, and combat service support units all require tactical power to operate weapons systems, Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) systems, medical and messing facilities, environmental control equipment, and water purification systems.  With over 10,000 generators and using diesel engines in the Operating Forces, improving their fuel efficiency and reliability will be a significant contribution to reducing the USMC fuel demand, and lightening the MAGTF.  The Warfighter benefit includes a decreased logistics footprint, less reliance on petroleum-derived fuels, increased local energy security, and reduced tanker losses (fewer on the road).  The operational imperative to reduce fuel usage will consequently reduce refueling operations and exposing Marines to hazardous fuel convoy operations. \n\nFour discrete efforts will be pursued as follows:   \n(1) Hybrid Generator: Funding to integrate new AMMPS 10kW Generator and energy storage devices onto a Light Tactical Trailer.  Will provide capability to deliver 10kW steady state, supply up to 13kW peak demand for several hours using stored energy, provide 3kW silent operations for several hours (battery only).  Will transition into production of a unit that can be integrated with the AMMPS generator.   \n(2) Next Generation Power Distribution:  Intelligent power management devices that can integrate with existing MEPDIS-R Power Distribution Boxes and AMMPS generators.  Provides capability for safe, efficient centralized power distribution from a single source to multiple loads, Automatic phase balancing of loads, power monitoring and data collection\/dissemination for remote system monitoring.  \n(3) Next-Generation Floodlight System (FLS): Funding to integrate new 10kW AMMPS Generator and a new light tower (floodlight system) onto a Light Tactical Trailer.  Provides tactical lighting and exportable 3-phase electrical power.  Will transition into production of a unit that can be integrated with the AMMPS generator.  \n(4)  1kW Diesel Generator:  Integration and product qualification testing of new 1kW diesel generator for USMC-unique applications.  Generator procurement will be by customers on a DoD contract.  \nThe increase in funding from FY14 and FY15 reflects the requirements and resource realignment of all commodity areas and budget adjustments made by the Marine Corps Combat Development Command.  In addition, funding supports the current program strategy for Mobile Hybrid Electric Power System (MEHPS)developmental efforts in concert with SECDEF\/CMC energy initiatives.\n\nAdvanced Power Sources\nThese R&D efforts will focus on achieving the Marine Corps goal of lightening the MAGTF and the individual Marine combat load though reduced battery weight and logistical fuel resupply needs. The Mobile Electric Hybrid Power System - Lightweight (MEHPS-L) and Medium Hybrid Expeditionary Energy Systems (MHEES) will focus on hybrid power systems capable of improved fuel efficiency and silent operations in the 0.5-5kW power range. These systems will be smaller, lighter and more efficient systems. The conformal\/CFX battery effort will focus on testing and integrating next generation batteries. The Shipboard Battery Management System will focus on developing, testing, and integrating a shipboard battery maintenance structure which will allow the Marine Corps to transport and maintain lithium batteries throughout the fleet in a safe and expeditionary manner. The Squad Electric Power Program will focus on further weight reduction of the Squad Electric Power System and increasing survivability and durability of the system. The On Board Vehicle Power (OBVP) will focus on flexibility and efficiency of research and development to save fuel at idle conditions and improve vehicle energy efficiency on MTVR platforms.  The Advanced Battery Charger will allow complete charging of different types of military and commercial batteries used for communications, electronics, and weapon systems.  The funding decrease from FY14 and FY15 reflects the requirements and resource realignment of all commodity areas and budget adjustments made by the Marine Corps Combat Development Command."

Full and open competition.  Three contractors to develop and deliver prototypes in two size models.  Government testing to validate performance.  Single contractor to produce both models using multi-year ID\/IQ production contract.  Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), followed by LRIP testing, then Full Rate Production (FRP) to procure using PMC funds on annual Delivery Orders.  ECUs are organically supported by Marines.\n\nInitial focus on development of Hybrid Generator Systems using AMMPS generators beginning in FY13, and Power Distribution, followed by New Floodlight Set development in FY14.  For each effort, strategies are very similar: Full and open competition.  Three contractors to develop and deliver prototypes in two size models.  Government testing to validate performance.  Single contractor to produce both models using multi-year ID\/IQ production contract.  LRIP, followed by LRIP testing, then Full Rate Production to procure using PMC funds on annual Delivery Orders .  All equipment is organically supported by Marines.  The 1kW Generator effort will be to integrate and test these generators in USMC unique applications.  Generators will be procured by others on a DoD contract.\n\nThe acquisition strategy for the Renewable Energy Program is to focus on improvements for the next generation Solar Portable Alternative Communications Energy System (SPACES), Ground Renewable Expeditionary Energy System (GREENS)\/Medium Hybrid Expeditionary Energy Systems (MHEES), and Mobile Electric Hybrid Power System Lightweight (MEHPS- L).  These R&D efforts will focus on achieving the Marine Corps goal of lighting the MAGTF and the individual Marine combat load through reduced battery weight and logistical fuel resupply needs.  In particular the development will focus on making these systems smaller, lighter and more efficient.  In addition this development effort will also focus on development needed to transition the Office of Naval Research (ONR), Reliable S (SAP - Service Accessible Point) Update Protocol (RSUP), Future Naval Capability (FNC) effort.\n\nThe acquisition strategy for the Battery Management and Sustainment System (BMASS) is to focus on the development of the next generation portable Marine Corps charger and a Portable Lithium Battery Maintainer.  These R&D efforts will focus on developing a capability which allow the Marine Corps the ability to support battery needs in all locations and environments of operation (land, sea and air).  In particular the development will focus on making the next generation of the Suitcase Portable Charger (called the Advanced Battery Charger) smaller, lighter, more efficient and high power.  It will also focus on development of a capability which allows the Marine Corps to transport and maintain lithium batteries throughout the fleet in a safe and expeditionary manor.\n\nThe acquisition strategy for the Squad Electric Power Program is to focus on the transition of the ONR Squad Electric Power FNC effort.  This R&D effort will focus on achieving the Marine Corps goal of lighting the individual Marines combat load though reduced battery weight and increase interoperability of Marine Corps gear.  In particular the effort will focus on further weight reduction of the Squad Electric Power System and increasing survivability and durability of the system.\n\nThe acquisition strategy for the On Board Vehicle Power Program is to focus on the continued adaptation and development of technologies transitioned from the Office of Naval Research Future Naval Capability.  Primary focus will be on adaptation for different vehicle platform models (M1151, M1165) as well as updates to system configuration due to Armor requirement changes.  Further, changes in deployment methodology with command guidance to focus on flexibility and efficiency will drive research and development to save fuel at idle conditions and improve energy export efficiency."
