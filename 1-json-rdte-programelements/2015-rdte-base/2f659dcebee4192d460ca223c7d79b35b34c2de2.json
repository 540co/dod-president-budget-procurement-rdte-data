This activity is focused on non-traditional defense contractors with the intention of helping lower the expense of new defense-related technology development through cost-sharing with industry and provided DoD benefit from private-sector technology investments and innovations. Actively marketed DoD-developed technologies to U.S. companies and establish Patent License Agreements to commercialize these technologies for both civilian and military application."
