Programs in this project address the Department's identified medical gaps in taking care of the warfighter such as blast-induced traumatic brain injury.  Efforts will draw upon the information, computational modeling and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels.  This project will establish a fundamental understanding of brain function, short-term memory and the mechanism(s) of injury induced by exposure to blast.  Basic research that aims at new methods and medical devices includes the ability to perform in-theater, continuous analysis of a warfighter's health as a preventative measure to mitigate widespread disease and development of biomaterials that allow long-term interfaces with neural tissue, electronics that provide sound attenuation, and processes to remove harmful bacteria and their toxins in blood to prevent sepsis."

Key advances expected from this research include determining the nature and means through which the brain utilizes sensory inputs to plan and execute behavioral outputs, and discovering the mechanisms and dynamics underlying neural computation and reorganization.  These advances will enable restoration of sensorimotor function through the use of devices programmed to bridge gaps in the injured brain.  Further, modeling of the brain will progress to an unprecedented level with this novel approach.  A key aspect of this effort will be to develop non-destructive neuronal imaging and control techniques that are capable of rapid analysis and interpretation of brain tissue alterations at the cellular scale.  Additional research under this effort will generate new methodologies to understand the structural and functional relationships between individual neurons through direct, high-resolution, optical imaging of neuron populations of interest as well as the entire brain."

ADEPT will develop and exploit synthetic biology for the in vivo creation of nucleic acid circuits that continuously and autonomously sense and respond to changes in physiologic state and for novel methods to target delivery, enhance immunogenicity, or control activity of vaccines, potentially eliminating the time to manufacture a vaccine ex vivo.  ADEPT advancements to control cellular machinery include research to optimize orthogonality and modularity of genetic control elements; identify methods to increase sensitivity and specificity; and demonstrate methods to control cellular machinery in response to changes in physiological status.  ADEPT will develop methodologies for measuring health-specific biomarkers from a collected biospecimen to enable diagnostics at the point-of-need or resource limited clinical facilities (point-of-care), in-garrison or deployed.  Additionally, ADEPT will develop techniques that will enable the rapid establishment of transient immunity through stimulation of the production of components of the immune system to impart effective but temporary protection.  This transient immunity would bridge the time gap between the delivery of a vaccine and the development of a long term protective immune response.

The goal of this program was to develop a portable device capable of controlling relevant components in the blood volume on clinically relevant time scales.  Reaching this goal required significant advances in sensing in complex biologic fluids, complex fluid manipulation, separation of components from these fluids, and mathematical descriptions capable of providing predictive control over the closed loop process.  The envisioned device would save the lives of thousands of military patients each year by effectively treating sepsis and associated complications.  Additionally, the device may be effective as a medical countermeasure against various chemical and biological (chem-bio) threat agents, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and toxins.\n\nInitial basic research developed the component technologies that will ultimately make up the integrated device.  Included in this effort was the development of non-fouling continuous sensors for complex biological fluids; design of high-flow microfluidic structures that do not require the use of anticoagulation; development of intrinsic separation technologies that do not require pathogen specific molecular labels or binding chemistries; and predictive modeling and control (mathematical formalism) with sufficient fidelity to enable agile adaptive closed-loop therapy.
