These plans are intended to meet the written acquisition planning requirements and guidance. All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process. Rapid Cyber Acquisition will consider existing contracting vehicles, including but not limited to: Network Centric Solutions (NETCENTS), NETCENTS 2, Information Technology Enterprise Solutions-2 (ITES-2), Government-Wide Acquisition Contract vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV)), General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedules, National Security Agency vehicles and Cyber Warfare Systems Branch Class Justification and Approval document. Multiple award contractual vehicles, such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration's SEWP IV, provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to Rapid Cyber Acquisition. These multiple-award vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act and only require that Rapid Cyber Acquisition provide a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies."
