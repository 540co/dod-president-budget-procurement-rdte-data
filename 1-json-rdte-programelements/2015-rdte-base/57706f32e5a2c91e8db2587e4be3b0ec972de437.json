Continue to develop mitigation strategies for Army forces to operate effectively in contested space, missile defense and cyber environments.  Developing effective Integrated Missile Defense concepts for Army support to the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) being implemented within each regional COCOM.  Based on the successful evaluation of Air\/Event Information Sharing Services into NORTHCOM J6 decision support systems, we will support the transition of the application to a Joint Capabilities Technical Demonstration (JCTD).  Will support TRADOC proponents with their responsibilities relative to doctrine, organization, training, material, leader development and education, personnel, and facilities plus related matters to continue leveraging space, missile defense, and high altitude proponent input to Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, Science and Technology, Concept Development, Capability Development for Rapid Transition, and Capability Gap Analysis Army  We will sustain our core prototyping platforms, as outlined above.  BC3 will be upgraded to more realistically address information flows related to Close Air Support.  Continue fabrication and test of components to develop a test-bed for enhanced thermal management technologies supporting missiles\/TOCS\/shelters and other systems utilizing mobile thermal management in realistic operating environments. Selected components will be integrated with battlefield applications to support demonstrations of projected efficiencies with identified enhanced thermal management technologies."
