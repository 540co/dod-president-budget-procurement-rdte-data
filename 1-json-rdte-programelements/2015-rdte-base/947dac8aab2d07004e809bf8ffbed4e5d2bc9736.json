The MNVR narrows the data capability gap at the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) company level and provides the capability to build a data extension to the lowest echelons, and then enables the extension of services from the Forward Operating Base (FOB) to the platform. MNVR provides a dynamic, scalable, On-the-Move (OTM) network architecture, connecting the Soldier to the Mission Command (MC) Network and enhances capability to exchange voice and data simultaneously and faster than current systems. The advanced network waveforms provide rapid distribution of data and imagery with increased information assurance protection and automatic routing across complex terrain.

This approach takes advantage of competitively priced, mature and producible technology that meets technical specifications.\n\nDecision Point 1 \u2013 4QFY13: An ADM was signed on 20 September 2013 by the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE), approving a Materiel Development Decision (MDD).  The ADM designated MNVR as an ACAT 1D Special Interest Program under the continued oversight of the DAE, approved Army to award Industry contract, and authorized the purchase of up to 232 modified NDI radios for Test & Evaluation, Platform Integration and Certification purposes in order to inform a MS C decision in 2QFY15.\n\nDecision Point 2 - 2QFY15: Program will provide all regulatory and statutory documentation in preparation for a Milestone C (MS C) decision, at which time program will move forward into Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and procure 45-107 radios in support of IOT&E, complete all testing and certifications, and complete platform integration.\n\nDecision Point 3 \u2013 2QFY16: After Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) is successfully completed, the program will move forward to the Full Rate Production decision to garner approval to field.  DO 3 would then procure approximately 852 radio systems in support of fielding to CS 17-18."
