Other efforts have focused on providing engineering and technical support which include the study of densified propellant, Saber battery replacement, Saber battery storage container and the test launch stand for the Saber system (far-target location accuracy improvements).  The traversing unit upgrades\/improvements, battlefield networking communications capability and a laser designation capability have been postponed due to prioritization of Saber battery upgrade\/replacement efforts."

The program rebaselined multiple times, each one adding considerable cost and schedule growth to the original baseline.  The Program Office, with concurrence from the MDA, elected to allow the SMAW II effort to expire and explore alternate methods for satisfying the FOTS requirement.  A new effort has begun and is described below.\n\nThe solution to the FOTS requirement is the SMAW Mod 2 system.  The mission of the SMAW Mod 2 is to provide short-range assault fires in support of infantry forces attacking fortified position and urban structures under all field and environmental conditions.  This includes employment under Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) IV Level Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) conditions.  The SMAW Mod 2 consists of a new SMAW launcher that will be physically and functionally compatible with all current SMAW ammunition variants.  Additionally, work is being performed to develop new propellant technologies for an enhanced rocket motor.\n\nDuring FY13, the development and integration of the SMAW Mod 2 system was completed and ready for Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E).  During FY14, IOT&E is planned to be performed on the launcher prior to the development and release of the Full Rate Production Request For Proposal.  Additionally, development of the Densified Propellant will begin.  In FY15, Full Rate Production of the SMAW Mod 2 launcher will begin and work will continue on the Densified Propellant."
