Networked LVC components form the integrated DMO battlespace by linking geographically distributed high fidelity combat and combat support training devices, including Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems. RDT&E for Project 655012, FCMT, efforts are focused on development, demonstration, and transitioning of critical functions associated with the DMO\/LVC network and linked simulators.  Project 655354, F-16 Block 40\/50 Mission Training Centers (MTC), efforts are focused on development and demonstration of the F-16 Block 40\/50 MTC.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

The Training Simulation Service (TSS) acquisition strategy was used to meet a portion of these requirements.  In the TSS approach, the contractor owns and provides the simulator equipment, maintains simulator concurrency with weapon systems, and has incentives to keep the equipment up to date with simulator and network technologies. Currently fielded and projected Air Force-owned Flight and Mission Training Systems without DMO\/LVC capability will be modified using Full Combat Mission Training (FCMT) funds to ensure compatibility with the DMO-LVC environment."
