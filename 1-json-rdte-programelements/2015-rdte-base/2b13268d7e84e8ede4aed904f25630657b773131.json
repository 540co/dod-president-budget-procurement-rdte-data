Discrimination Sensor Technology develops solutions to improve identifying, acquiring, tracking and discriminating incoming threats, specifically addressing shortfalls in the Prioritized Capabilities List.  Areas of concentration include advanced detectors, infrared sensors, focal planes and algorithms for passive and active ground, sea, air and space systems. Sensor technology enhances the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) capability to develop precision tracks for engagement significantly quicker than current radar and discriminate increasing numbers of objects by an order of magnitude.  \n\nThis technology has the potential to significantly enhance\/enable the following capabilities while decreasing the cost of the BMDS:\n\n- Precision track of multiple objects to exceed engage-on-remote requirements\n- Discriminating lethal objects from countermeasures\n- End-to-end correlation of sensor track and discrimination data\n- Timely and accurate kill assessment\n- Enhanced probability of kill\n- Future discriminating weapon and space sensors\n\nDiscrimination Sensor Technology contributions to the Prioritized Capabilities List include: Persistent Surveillance - improve birth-to-death tracking, identification and targeting."

This program evaluates and researches emerging technology that enables game changing discrimination improvements for incorporation into next generation interceptors and space systems. MDA is pursuing a cost-effective incremental upgrade philosophy that demonstrates airborne precision tracking, improved track performance, simple scene discrimination and then complex scene discrimination.   These advanced sensors improve the probability of engagement success for stressing threats, expand the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) battle space and increase the ability to negate larger raid sizes. A precise, timely track is required for an interceptor to engage a threat object. In addition, improved object sighting message data is required to discriminate threat objects.\n\nIn FY 2015, Discrimination Sensor Technology demonstrates an airborne precision track capability equivalent to an Army\/Navy Transportable radar (AN\/TPY-2) with the potential to augment Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) radar.  The test construct incrementally buys down risk by testing our evolving sensor technology from the ground and then from UAVs and uses repeatable Resident Space Objects (RSOs) before participating in BMDS tests.  Discrimination Sensor Technology uses much of the existing BMDS architecture to develop 3-dimensional (3-D) tracks of the ballistic missile sent via Link-16 to Aegis ships.  FY 2015 funds final integration and test of the launch of a SM-3 guided missile based on these remote IR tracking sensors.  \n\nIn parallel, MDA will develop advanced sensors that increase track precision by 150% relative to AN\/TPY-2.  Initially the MTS-B sensors will be replaced by MTS-Cs using an advanced sensor.  Discrimination Sensor test data anchors discrimination models and simulations and informs future interceptor and space sensor decisions."
