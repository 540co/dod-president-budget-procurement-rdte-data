Each radar system consists of a separate 74-meter tethered aerostat, mobile mooring station, radar and communications payload, processing station, and associated ground support equipment. The systems are designed to work together, but can operate independently. The JLENS Orbit is transportable by road, rail, sea and air.\n\nJLENS uses advanced sensor and networking technologies to provide persistent, 360-degree, wide-area surveillance and precision tracking of Land Attack Cruise Missiles and other types of Air Breathing Threats. This information is distributed via joint service networks and provides fire control quality data to Surface to Air missile systems such as Army Patriot and Navy Aegis, increasing the weapons' capabilities by allowing systems to engage targets normally below, outside or beyond surface based weapons' field of view. JLENS also provides fire control quality data to fighter aircraft allowing them to engage hostile threats from extended ranges, and contributes to the development of a single integrated air picture.\n\nJLENS Product Office (JPO) demonstrated the system's operational capability with the Weapon Systems Evaluation Program (WSEP) exercise using JLENS with an United States Air Force (USAF) operational aircraft and Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System (NASAMS) to track and neutralize targets in August 2013.\n\nGuidance from the Senate Appropriations Committee - Defense (SAC-D) congressional marks language requires that the JLENS Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) parent funding line be divided between two separate funding lines, Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Combatant Command (COCOM) Exercise, which are summed under the parent funding line.

There is currently no funding beyond Block I.  \n\nOn 28 Jun 05, the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) approved the JLENS program for entry into Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) as recommended by the Army Acquisition Executive. The DAB elected to maintain oversight of JLENS as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program as stated in the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed on August 5, 2005.\n\nOn 24 May 2012, the Acting Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) signed the JLENS Nunn-McCurdy (NM) ADM certifying the restructured JLENS Program, and signed a memorandum rescinding the Milestone B approval for the JLENS program, granted on August 5, 2005.  The ADM directs the Army to restructure the JLENS program to consist of two EMD orbits; complete scheduled EMD test and evaluation to include the Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air demonstration, Limited User Test, Developmental Test 2, and Developmental Test 3 that concludes in 4th Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 (4QFY2013); and to assist in site selection and planning for the employment of one JLENS orbit to support an operational Continental United States based exercise when a location is determined and orders are approved by the National Command Authority.  Letters were provided to Congress notifying them that the NM review was complete and program was certified and restructured as detailed above.\n\nThe Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) reviewed the results of the Army's 60 Day Deep-Dive employment assessment of JLENS for Homeland Defense.  The JROC concurs with the proposed JLENS employment to Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD for an operational exercise duration Fiscal Year 2014-2017.\n\nThe JLENS Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) was reset by the Nunn-McCurdy Process in accordance with 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2435(d). The proposed APB was signed by the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) on 10 July 2013 and the DAE on 8 August 2013. The new APB reclassifies JLENS as an ACAT IC program and removes all Nunn-McCurdy unit cost breaches and reporting requirements.\n\nGuidance from the Senate Appropriations Committee - Defense (SAC-D) congressional marks language requires that the JLENS Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) parent funding line be divided between two separate funding lines, Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Combatant Command (COCOM) Exercise, which are summed under the parent funding line. The EMD line will be funded at $60.000 million and the COCOM Exercise line will be funded at $23.406 million for a total of $83.406 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2014. This guidance was not reflected in the FY 2015 President's Budget, and The Army Budget Office will not separate these funding lines in the P&R Form database until the FY 2016 President's Budget submission."
