This program consists of a portfolio of small programs and projects called the Offensive Cyber Product Line (OCPL). The OCPL establishes a flexible and balanced approach to the rapid acquisition of cyber operational capabilities. OCPL effectiveness comes from consciously balancing funding into three capability areas required for effective operations: Platforms (includes Cyber Mission Platform(CMP)), access, and capabilities. \n\nThe program office provides advanced OCPL cyber warfare capabilities to the 24th Air Force in direct support of USCYBERCOM, AF major commands (MAJCOMs), unified commands, and national agencies. In accordance with AF Policy, the program office develops capabilities in the cyberspace superiority core areas.  OCPL efforts also directly support the Joint Network Attack Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO), the USCYBERCOM operational directives, and the latest AF Space Command (AFSPC) Offensive Cyberspace Operations System Flight Plan, and other formal requirements documents. Planned areas of study, prototyping, and technology demonstration will be used to provide warfighters access, platforms, Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO) production (e.g. test and budgets), infrastructure (e.g. mission planning, intelligence, Command and Control\/Situational Awareness (C2SA)), and tools needed to attack enemy networks, telephony, Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), electronic warfare operations, and Command and Control systems. These advancements will be used to develop and deliver cutting-edge technologies to the warfighter. This capability area leverages cyber technology investments by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Air Force Research Labs, and DOD national laboratories, and other sources. Many program activities are protected under AF Network Warfare Special Access Program(s).  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to mature systems to full operational capability or sustain fielded systems."
