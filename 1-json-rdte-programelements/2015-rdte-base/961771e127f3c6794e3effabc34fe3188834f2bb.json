Concepts that provide capability improvements to Combatant Commanders will be identified for accelerated prototype demonstration and worked as joint projects with the Services to speed transition time for rapid fielding.  The program objectives are to develop disruptive anticipatory products, processes and services suited for quick deployment to fulfill emerging pre-conflict requirements.  Disruptive technology and process demonstrations will leverage low cost, commercial, and often low technology options that don\u2019t conform to the typical DoD acquisition business model but have the potential to disrupt and change warfighting capabilities by avoiding or creating technological surprise.
