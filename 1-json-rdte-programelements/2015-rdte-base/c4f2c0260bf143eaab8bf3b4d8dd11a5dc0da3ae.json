Further, this acquisition was awarded to a single integrator to accomplish all activities and utilizes a firm fixed price (FFP) contract with performance based payments. Payments (expenditures) on this contract are intentionally deferred, to the advantage of the government, to incentivize the contractor to successfully complete program milestones.  These deferred payments cannot be paid until these milestones have been successfully completed; thus, delaying complete expenditure of those funds.  Therefore, expenditures for this effort will lag behind OSD goals.\n\nMode 5: Acquisition strategy will be a sole source, FFP contract for a 15-month RDT&E effort followed by procurement of kits and modification of fleet at depot."
