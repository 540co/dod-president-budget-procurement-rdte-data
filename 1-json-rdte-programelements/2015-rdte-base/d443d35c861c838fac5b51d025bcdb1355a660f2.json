            "val": "The Defense Technical Information Center\u2019s (DTIC) unique mission is to provide rapid, accurate, and reliable access to essential research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) information, supporting all DoD users.  DTIC, a DoD Field Activity, is the DoD\u2019s singular executive agent and designated source for DoD-funded scientific, technical, engineering, and industry-related information.  DTIC operates DoD Information Analysis Centers focused on Defense Systems, Cyber Security, and Homeland Defense and Security.   DTIC captures, preserves, protects, and shares research and development (R&D) information assets and connects communities.   These activities and results advance research by providing department level mapping of activities and results to researchers, warfighters, research and engineering (R&E) management, and decision makers.  DTIC manages this mapping through five key areas:\n\n1) Document and preserve what works, what has promise (reuse and additional investments).\n2) Determine dead-ends that do not merit additional investment (avoid waste).\n3) Facilitate and encourage engagement among cross-cutting Communities of Interest (bring together experts across the Acquisition Enterprise and warfighter community driving requirements).\n4) Present overarching picture of activity that optimizes decision-makers\u2019 ability to coordinate and orchestrate multiple efforts into integrated capabilities (employ assets to highest priority efforts and coordinate efforts across services).\n5) Protect intellectual property (IP) and industry proprietary data assets entrusted to DTIC\u2019s stewardship (access to those DoD trusts, protection from those we don\u2019t).\n\nDTIC must accomplish its mission in an environment of Department-wide budget reductions while increasing our value.  DTIC is leading the Department in efforts to provide Open Access to DoD funded journal articles and research data.  We must ensure our activities are efficient and effective, meet users\u2019 expectations, and employ industry best practices and standards, while protecting from cyber threats.\n\nDoD\u2019s $120 Billion annual investment in research, development and procurement, support current and future capabilities to defeat our adversaries and protect national security.  The results of these efforts are a national asset that DTIC preserves and facilitates their reuse across the Acquisition Enterprise.  Approximately 21% of the 4 million records in DTIC\u2019s information holdings are sensitive DoD only, federal government only and industry proprietary.  DTIC is the only enterprise source for both publicly accessible and DoD sensitive material in a single location.\n\nThe Information Analysis Center (IAC) Program Office at DTIC provides core funding, management and oversight of the IACs.  The IACs are chartered by DoD to collect, analyze, and disseminate worldwide scientific and technical information in specialized fields.  The IAC program is in a multi-year restructuring from ten IACs to three, reducing customer costs and reflecting new DoD technical interest areas.  The new structure will focus on three technology groupings, to include Cyber Security and Information Systems, Homeland Defense and Security, and Defense Systems.  As part of the Department\u2019s Better Buying Power initiative, new multi-award contracts are being put into place, improving competition, small-business presence, and reducing government costs.  The restructured IAC Program will improve affordability, productivity, and standardization within defense acquisition programs.  Providing the Acquisition Enterprise access to thousands of industry Subject Matter Experts, DTIC\u2019s IACs perform well over a billion dollars of customer funded research and prototyping support annually.  The results of the work are a rich source of material in DTIC\u2019s information asset collections and are available to users across the Department (and other federal agencies, e.g. Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security).\n\nThis Program Element (PE) supports DTIC mission operations.  DTIC focuses on core mission, and buys space, Human Resources, Financial Management, and civilian payroll services from expert and efficient providers:  funding provides for salaries and benefits of government civilian personnel assigned to DTIC; training, professional development, and travel for DTIC personnel; support agreements for Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) facility-related services; Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) financial activities and Human Resource (HR) services; Defense Information Services Agency (DISA) communications support; annual maintenance and licensing requirements; supplies, equipment, hardware\/software; and support contracts for Information Technology services, Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI) system integration, and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliance efforts in concert with the Department\u2019s Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) program.  In addition, this PE provides funding in support of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, in accordance with Public Law 111-251 (Small Business Reauthorization Act) and Small Business Technology Transfer Program Reauthorization Act.  Within the PE, an annual set-aside contribution totaling approximately $400,000 is provided to the DoD's Commercialization Pilot Program, as directed by the Department's Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP)."

Reduce DTIC appropriated funding support to necessary oversight activities, and pass all other web-hosting direct costs (to the extent allowed) to the customer organization.  DTIC will work with customers in their transition from the DTIC web-hosting environment, and assist them in the migration to other approved facilities.  During this divestiture process, DTIC\u2019s appropriated support will be limited to less than $500,000.\n- Reduce DTIC HQ Management staff by 22 percent in FY 2015.\n- Adjust Continuity of Operations (COOP) plans and investments in light of the Data Center Consolidation initiative and the Department\u2019s cloud services initiative. \n- Work to meet the Department\u2019s audit readiness milestones while assuming additional program risk in FY 2015."

In this role, DTIC sets policy for scientific and technical information (STI) exchanges for the research and engineering (R&E) community.  DTIC\u2019s aim is to maximize the availability and use of technical information and products resulting from Defense-funded technical activities while ensuring restrictions to safeguard national security, export control, and intellectual property rights.\n\nRecognizing the common elements across budget justification documents, progress reports, completed work reports, studies, and journal articles, DTIC is mapping relationships to enable users to access the life cycle of research projects from planning to final results. DTIC employs technology to verify and validate information submitted and improve user confidence in DoD research documentation.\n\nDTIC is leading the Department\u2019s efforts to implement Open Access to published journal articles, and digital data from research funded by taxpayers. In this role, DTIC is actively working with partners across the Services and components.  Consistent with the Administration\u2019s emphasis for open standards and machine readable formats, DTIC initiated the transition from paper and Portable Document Format (PDF) based information to WebService XML standard data submission and machine readable delivery.  DTIC partnered with the OSD Comptroller to collect investment account budget justification documentation in XML and embed this XML in PDF for justification books delivered to Congress.  We employed this same technology in collecting S&T progress reports from the Services and Agencies, and IR&D from industry. We are planning migration of completed technical reports collection to the same open standards \u2013 machine readable formats.\n\nThrough the use of commercial search technology, DTIC provides an industry leading search capability that is combined with its knowledge of the DoD domain and metadata that supports both text searches and data mining.  DTIC continually works to enable additional features within our search capabilities and from commercial partners to improve information discovery and relevance.\n\nWith the September 2013 initial operating capability (IOC) release of the commercial product based R&E Gateway, DTIC provides the means to connect 60,000+ members in the Acquisition Enterprise (DoD Labs, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), Program Executive Officers, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L) and Combatant Commands (CCMD).  In an access controlled environment all of DTIC\u2019s unclassified assets, tools and community interaction capabilities foster innovation, competition and identification of solutions.  DoD conducts research at its 60+ labs, in the FFRDC\u2019s, DTIC\u2019s Information Analysis Centers (IACs), and across over a dozen distinct priority area communities of interest; all of this work is available through the R&E Gateway.\n\nTo protect data, DTIC maintains a database of registered users.  DTIC utilizes commercial software and follows DoD Identity Management Standards, while providing CAC users instant registration and authenticated access.  We are working with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to give users more control of their online profile and extend immediate access to federal government employees and contractors holding valid credentials. \n\nFocus on User Communities and Distribution Points:  DTIC supports user communities on the network where they work, NIPRNET, SIPRNET and Internet, and uniquely provides access controls within unclassified and classified material to protect intellectual property in our search, distribution, and collaboration tools.\n\n- DoD\u2019s Acquisition Enterprise:  As a Field Activity to ASD(R&E)\/AT&L, DTIC\u2019s priority is the Acquisition Enterprise, hosting information assets and tools on the NIPRNET (the primary network for the community).  During a time of sequestration and furloughs, DTIC has seen a 10% increase from FY12 to FY13 in registered user activity.   \n- Warfighter:  Improving coordination between the Acquisition Enterprise and warfighter communities, DTIC hosts as subset of information assets and tools on the SIPRNET.  DTIC is building these out.\n- Industry and Academia via Internet:  Engaging Industry outside the NIPRNET \u201cfirewall\u201d to support Better Buying Power initiatives and encourage the introduction of innovation, DTIC hosts unclassified \u201cpublic\u201d information and tools accessible to all users on the Internet.  Open Access initiatives add importance to this distribution point.\n\nSummary.  DTIC protects and preserves DoD\u2019s multi-billion dollar investment in research, which empowers the Acquisition Enterprise through innovative tools, information systems, and decision support capabilities.  The benefits can be enormous; each 1% increase in reuse of S&T, elimination of inefficient redundancy, increased community interaction, results in a more capable military and gives the DoD the opportunity to redirect >$100 Million.  DTIC is uniquely positioned to unleash the value of DoD\u2019s R&D portfolio."

IACs serve as a bridge between the warfighter and the Acquisition\/Research community, providing essential technical analysis and data support to a diverse customer base, to include the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Defense Agencies, and the Military Services. IACs actively partner and collaborate with Defense Research & Engineering focus groups and communities of interest in areas of specialized fields or specific technologies. The IACs create and maintain comprehensive knowledge analysis centers that include historical, technical, scientific, and other data and\ninformation collected worldwide. They are staffed with scientists, engineers and information specialists to provide research and analysis to customers with diverse, complex and challenging requirements. IAC operations directly support the warfighter, and play an ongoing and critical role in solving key CCMD operational issues such as cyber security, improvised explosive device (IED) defeat and helicopter survivability. \n\nThe IAC Program Management Office at DTIC performs contract acquisition, management, and operational support for IAC contract operations and the technical information that is generated as a result of research and studies.  In a time of shrinking budgets and increasing responsibility, IACs are a valuable resource for accessing Scientific and Technical Information culled from efforts to solve new and historic challenges. Direct IAC customer support activities, such as Technical Area Task (TAT) order processing, Basic Center Operations (BCO) support, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) activities, contracting\/acquisition related activities, etc., are funded in part through partnerships with the Defense Research & Engineering community and the annual collection of customer reimbursements for shared direct costs, in accordance with the IAC Reimbursable Review Board (IRRB) recommendations, with OSD-COMPT and Office of General Counsel concurrence. This represents the maximum cost-sharing with IAC customers allowable, per guidance from the OSD Office of General Counsel. Annual IAC efforts and accomplishments are dependent on the level of participation and collaboration by the R&E community at large."
