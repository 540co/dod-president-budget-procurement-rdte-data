The program develops and swiftly deploys disruptive innovation to counter emerging threats in order to maintain the United States' current undersea warfare superiority. AAI employs the capability to quickly reconstruct and analyze passive and active measurements of submarine vulnerabilities providing actionable intelligence to fleet commanders. The AAI data collection program provides full spectrum intelligence data essential for the design and development of advanced sensors, weapon systems, environmental models, and tactical decision aids. AAI collection systems are installed and employed on uniquely configured aircraft, specially configured ground support facilities, ships, and other assets as required for the collection, processing, exfiltration, and dissemination of undersea intelligence.
