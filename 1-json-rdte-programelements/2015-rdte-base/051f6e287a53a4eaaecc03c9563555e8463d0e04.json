Extensive utilization of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) based solutions allows rapid fielding of needed capabilities through continuous technology refresh cycles and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS)\/vanishing vendor items (VVI) logistics mitigation efforts.  The results of these efforts provide for preliminary assessments of technical feasibility, operability, or military utility as well as specific engineering implementations for integration into the various systems baseline configurations.  \n\nThese activities are managed by the Air Force through the 645th Aeronautical System Group (645 AESG), BIG SAFARI Systems Program Office (SPO), Aeronautical Systems Center, Air Force Materiel Command, Wright Patterson AFB, OH.  BIG SAFARI manages engineering, ground and support systems modifications, integration, flight testing, product assurance, acceptance testing, logistics, and training activities.  \n\nAircraft, sensor systems, and associated ground support system engineering planned for FY 2015 include support for the RC-135V\/W RIVET JOINT Baseline 12, the RC-135U COMBAT SENT Baseline 5 and the RC-135S COBRA BALL Baseline 5 configurations.  The world-wide challenge of keeping pace against technologically agile targets used by both nation and non-nation-state adversaries and the rapid evolution of COTS technologies demands a responsive and adaptive acquisition strategy for fielding baseline capabilities that are logistically supportable at all locations.  BIG SAFARI uses an incremental baseline strategy to mitigate risk, find affordable solutions and field needed capabilities on the aircraft and ground support and training systems.  Obsolescence and diminished manufacturing sources\/vanishing vendor items (DMS\/VVI) are addressed with each baseline upgrade and annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.  \n\nRIVET JOINT Baseline 12 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, increased digital signal exploitation, increased digital signal recorder bandwidth, enhanced spatial processing\/exploitation, enhanced weather radar, AF-DCGS interoperability, operator work station 3-D map projection, and new steerable beam antenna.\n\nCOMBAT SENT Baseline 5 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, continued Communications, Navigation and Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) and Required Navigational Performance (RNP) compliant cockpit avionics enhancements, active ranging and geolocation capability, cooling duct improvements, precision electronic intelligence (ELINT) (CORVUS system) super wideband compressive receiver, RJ Baseline 11 COMINT, wideband global satellite (WGS) communications enhanced integration, and communications upgrade to include Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS-J).\n\nCOBRA BALL Baseline 5 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, RJ Baseline 11 COMINT, Medium-Wave Infra-Red Acquisition (MIRA) sensor\/processor upgrade, MASINT Collection System (MCS) optical upgrade, WGS communications enhanced integration, communications upgrade to include MIDS-J, continued CNS\/ATM and RNP compliant cockpit avionics enhancements.         \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fielding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

BIG SAFARI manages engineering, ground and support systems modifications, integration, flight testing, product assurance, acceptance testing, logistics, and training activities.  \n\nAircraft, sensor systems, and associated ground support system engineering planned for FY 2015 include support for the RC-135V\/W RIVET JOINT Baseline 12, the RC-135U COMBAT SENT Baseline 5 and the RC-135S COBRA BALL Baseline 5 configurations.  The world-wide challenge of keeping pace against technologically agile targets used by both nation and non-nation-state adversaries and the rapid evolution of COTS technologies demands a responsive and adaptive acquisition strategy for fielding baseline capabilities that are logistically supportable at all locations.  BIG SAFARI uses an incremental baseline strategy to mitigate risk, find affordable solutions and field needed capabilities on the aircraft and ground support and training systems.  Obsolescence and Diminished Manufacturing Sources\/Vanishing Vendor Items (DMS\/VVI) are addressed with each baseline upgrade and annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.  \n\nRIVET JOINT Baseline 12 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, increased digital signal exploitation, increased digital signal recorder bandwidth, enhanced spatial processing\/exploitation, enhanced weather radar, AF-DCGS interoperability, operator work station 3-D map projection, and new steerable beam antenna.\n\nCOMBAT SENT Baseline 5 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, continued Communications, Navigation and Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) and Required Navigational Performance (RNP) compliant cockpit avionics enhancements, active ranging and geolocation capability, cooling duct improvements, precision electronic intelligence (ELINT) (CORVUS system) super wideband compressive receiver, RJ Baseline 11 COMINT, wideband global satellite (WGS) communications enhanced integration, and communications upgrade to include Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS-J).\n\nCOBRA BALL Baseline 5 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, RJ Baseline 11 COMINT, Medium-Wave Infra-Red Acquisition (MIRA) sensor\/processor upgrade, MASINT Collection System (MCS) optical upgrade, WGS communications enhanced integration, communications upgrade to include MIDS-J, continued CNS\/ATM and RNP compliant cockpit avionics enhancements.         \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fielding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The supplies and services procured by 645 AESG under their standing J&A to satisfy National Security (FAR 6.302-6) or individually prepared J&A for Unusual and Compelling Urgency (FAR 6.302-2) requirements are supported by the BIG SAFARI Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) across the full spectrum of system life cycle management from developmental engineering to system retirement (\"cradle to grave\") support.  Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging Combatant Commander requirements."
