            "val": "The Networked Communications Capability Program (NCCP) seeks to accelerate the wireless mobile networking capability of Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) current and planned investments in response to national military strategy and ever growing needs.  Today's Warfighter rely more and more on communications networks to support and enable actions from targeting and shooting weapons to video-conferencing.  Though military basic infrastructure capabilities follow the mainstream commercial internet, for many reasons (security, mobility, and robustness), commercial telecommunications especially commercial wireless (tactical edge) communications are not well-matched with the requirements of today\u2019s warfighter.  These trends will continue as the military data load becomes more diverse and heavy.  These tactical edge technology challenges cut across all warfare domains (space, air, ground, and sea).  In response to recognized technical problems today, as well as anticipated problems in the future, this research will focus on two key problems in networked technologies:  the need for \"Joint interoperability\" and  \"expanded reach\" (resilient and robust) where no communication infrastructure exists.  The main research objectives of this program are to:\n\n\u2013 Perform Network Communications Analysis to establish the scientific foundations for tactical mobile networking with a specific emphasis on integrating heterogeneous Networks and Integrated Network Operations (NetOps) for tactical networks.\n\u2013 Complete the enhancements of joint integrated capability to predict performance of heterogeneous communication networks and expand the reach\/connectivity and capacity. \n\u2013 Jointly manage and operate existing and planned diverse communications networks, services and applications.\n\u2013 Create mature products for transition to programs of record (POR) or directly to field.\n\t1)  Wireless mobile network design, development and operations, spectrum management, information assurance and information dissemination management software tools.\n\t2)  Joint Aerial Layer Networking (JALN), services and applications packages including hardware and software systems and integrated\/joint network operations software tools and new information architectures.\n\nThis research provides the technical basis to standardize the implementation of military network communications capabilities in the areas of joint airborne network gateways and network communications analysis across the military services, Joint Staff, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and defense agencies."

                            "val": "Tactical Mobile Networking - As studies have suggested, for instance, the National Research Council\u2019s Network Science Report (2005) and Army Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) JASON's Report (January 2006), the type of networking projected to meet military tactical requirements is not supported by network theory, network design, and analysis tools.  This research will define those technical parameters important to military tactical mobile networking environments, investigate the status of network design and analysis tools, and evaluate how modeling and simulation is conducted to support tactical mobile networking environments.  The role of network experimentation with respect to network modeling will be explored.  Further development and analysis will be conducted to improve the awareness of the condition of tactical mobile networking technologies.  Design tools, architectures, and technical approaches will be recommended to acquisition programs as a result of this research.  \n  \nNetwork Management Tools and Analysis - Network management in the commercial world is a highly organized, synchronized activity that has excellent tools to monitor activity and repair disrupted networks as needed.  These same tools are ill-matched for management in the wireless world, and specifically for military tactical mobile networking.  In addition, the military tactical mobile networking environment lacks the infrastructure (connectivity) and support (helpdesk) because resources (spectrum, people, and equipment) are scarce (not in harm's way).  As the complexity of networking grows and as network capabilities are introduced, improved network management is required.  For military operations, assured delivery may be needed for specific information and operations.  This requires management tools to be in place to ensure continued secure and robust operations, which is not achieved with commercial wireless technologies.  This research will assess network management tools in place for the military tactical mobile networking environment and develop technology and tools to address shortfalls with the goal to transition technology to operational systems.   \n  \nSpectrum Management Tools and Analysis - For wireless, tactical mobile networking, the management of the use of spectrum effects network operations.  The demand for spectrum is increasing due to the expanded use of sensors, imagery, and voice.  This demand increases the pressure on the limited shared radio frequency (RF) spectrum for military tactical networking.  The current Department of Defense (DoD) frequency planning and management infrastructure will have a limited ability to cope with this demand through operational planning, Coalition Joint Spectrum Management Planning Tool (CJSMPT) Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD), and the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS).  Advanced spectrum management concepts such as sense and adapt, spectrum sharing, and dynamic reallocation are under investigation but not yet mature support operations.  This research will evaluate opportunities for more efficient and effective use of the frequency spectrum within DoD.  Technology advances are expected to advance the concept of cognitive radio and cognitive antenna devices to sense and adapt operations based on spectrum policy and usage, the management of multi-band and multifunction apertures, and the use of spectrum efficient waveforms for use in military environments.  This research will develop the models and tools to demonstrate capabilities for operational planning and monitoring of spectrum as these technologies are introduced.  \n  \nIntegrated Network Management Capability - Network management becomes more complex as more and different types of networking capability become available.  Integrated network management across heterogeneous systems, especially wireless systems, requires definition, design, and development.  Operationally, network management assumes all functions required to share networking resources and ensure proper operation for participants.  This research will define integrated network operations tools for all aspects of network resource management and to prioritize across operational spectrum management, security management, network management, and information management.  This research will also develop test beds especially to validate models and simulations used to develop and test network management tools, and conduct experimentation on approaches developed. \n\nTactical Networking Evolution and Expansion - Fielded and about-to-be-fielded tactical networks can be vastly expanded and evolved from their current capabilities by developing and applying new techniques (or existing techniques developed in basic research) to the existing systems, providing modern capability to the warfighter without the large expense to the DoD of developing new systems.  This research will focus on developing and applying new DoD specific techniques to create leap-ahead approaches to Anti-Jam resistance of tactical networks, larger, more fully exploited networks, and expanded capabilities for signal\/data processing and data compression in radios and across the networks.  This research will take advantage of new software defined radios about to be fielded by the Department, as well as focus on the existing legacy systems, using the successful approach we developed when fielding the Netted Iridium capability."
