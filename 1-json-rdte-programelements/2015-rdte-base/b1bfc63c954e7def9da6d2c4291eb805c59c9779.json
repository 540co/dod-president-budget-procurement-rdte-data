SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to enemy threats to ensure mission success."

SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorist, or highly sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to enemy threats to ensure mission success.\n\nVisual Augmentation Systems (VAS).  This program develops, buys prototypes, and supports fielding of operator-borne combat optics for SOF.  These devices provide the SOF operator the ability to maneuver, conduct fire control operations, and perform surveillance and reconnaissance.  Research and Development efforts will develop, test, and evaluate prototype systems of the next generation Fusion system.\n\nThese Visual Augmentation Systems will provide an all-weather, low-light capability for SOF personnel by employing a Block approach.  This Block approach produces a family of VAS systems which will utilize a variety of different sensor technologies to satisfy the capabilities defined by individual Block requirement.  Some examples of the types of sensor technologies that these systems may utilize include:  Image Intensification, Thermal, Short Wave Infrared and\/or multi-spectral.  To date the Target Engagement Portfolio has utilized several Block system approaches that have been fielded by the VAS program.  These VAS programs will be a developmental effort to produce and field the next generation systems for SOF personnel.  SOF Improvements include the following:  (1) Ability to detect, classify and engage targets without the use of an infrared illuminator; (2) ability to determine wind speed; (3) ability to observe bullet trace.\n\nVAS Weapons Accessories (VASWA).  This program effort enhances all SOF weapons, both individual and crew served, by leveraging the latest technological advances in optional accessories (up to 30 different functions \/ capabilities) such as combat optics, aiming laser modules, visible lights, and close quarters battle sights.  Miniature Day-Night Sight (MDNS) for crew-served weapons enhances all SOF Weapons by leveraging existing image intensification and thermal technology to improve combat effectiveness for all crew-served weapon systems.  Development efforts include test and evaluation of the Advanced Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Laser hardening to withstand the live-fire shock profiles for the Combat Assault Rifle, VAS and clandestine pointer.  Leveraging extensive modeling and simulation efforts executed by National Labs.  Develop clandestine operator-borne visual augmentation devices.  These accessories greatly improve the combat effectiveness of the weapon systems and the survivability of the SOF operator."
