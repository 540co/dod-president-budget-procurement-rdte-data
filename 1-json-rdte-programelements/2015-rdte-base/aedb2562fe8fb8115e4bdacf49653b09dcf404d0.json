The F-22 is a first-of-a-kind multi-mission fighter aircraft that combines stealth, supercruise, advanced maneuverability and integrated avionics to make it the world's most capable combat aircraft.  While F-22 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and aircraft production completed May 2012, funding for F-22 modernization is \"continuing\" beyond the FYDP. \n\nThis program funds all non-MDAP development efforts for the F-22.  The program is now continuing the pre-planned and evolutionary modernization effort through incremental development phases that enhance the F-22 anti-access, area denial, and Global Strike capability.  The development program modernizes and upgrades the air vehicle, engine, avionics, and training systems to improve\/enhance F-22 weapons, communications, and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.  \n\nBA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Each increment is broken into phases to initiate requirements analysis, the design phase and the development, integration and verification phase of a specific incremental development effort.

Each increment is broken into phases to initiate requirements analysis, the design phase and the development, integration and verification phase of a specific incremental development effort. The (REDI) II contract is a follow-on Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity contract to the initial REDI contract. REDI II provides maximum flexibility to manage various modernization projects. The REDI II contract allows for the issuance of orders for efforts associated with the planning, analysis, design, development, qualification, test and documentation of F-22 weapon system performance enhancements, life-cycle improvements, Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades, and associated efforts essential to accomplishing the F-22 mission."
