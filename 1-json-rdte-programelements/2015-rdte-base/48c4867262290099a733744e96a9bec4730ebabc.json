This multi-phase plan, called Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) is intended to increase the air traffic capacity while at the same time improving safety and efficiency.  In part, NextGen implements a capability called Performance Based Navigation (PBN) in which the aircraft's navigation performance capability will be a determining factor as to whether or not it can fly within specific airspace, certain air traffic routes or instrument procedures.  Also, NextGen transforms the NAS from a radar based system, with aircraft interrogation, to a satellite based system utilizing Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B Out) communication in order to transmit the aircraft's own position to the controllers and other ADS-B In capable aircraft.  PBN is an enabler for ADS-B functionality.\n\nOn May 28th, 2010 the FAA released DoT\/FAA, 14 CFR Part 91: Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out Performance Requirements To Support Air Traffic Control (ATC) Service Final Rule.  This mandate stipulated that all aircraft required to have unrestricted access to operate in Classes A, B, and C airspace, certain Class E airspace, and other specified airspace requiring ADS-B Out, must be in compliance with this regulation by January 1, 2020."

This research and development effort will be an ACAT III program and consists of the minimum required capability increase necessary for ADS-B Out, enabling 190 aircraft and 18 simulators to meet the January 1st, 2020 FAA ADS-B Out mandate.  Specifically, this includes the development, integration, test and certification of an upgrade or replacement of the Global Position System\/Inertial Navigation Assembly (GINA), the replacement of the APX-100 Transponder with associated data bus connectivity, antennas, and an updated Mission Display Processor Operational Flight Program (MDP\/OFP), simulators and support equipment.\n\nThe T-6 Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Communication and Navigation System\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM):\nJPATS is a joint United States Navy (USN)\/United States Air Force (USAF) Acquisition Program designed to replace the aging primary aircraft (T-34\/T-37) fleet.  Principle JPATS mission is primary training for entry-level Navy\/Air Force student pilots, associated instructor pilots, and primary\/intermediate training for USN NFOs.  JPATS includes the T-6 Texan II which is a stepped tandem seat, commercially derived aircraft powered by a single Pratt & Whitney PT6A-68 turboprop engine.  It serves as the aircraft component of the JPATS integrated primary pilot training system which replaces the T-34C primary training aircraft. ADS-B Out capability will be developed, tested, and integrated into the T-6 fleet to meet the FAA January 1st, 2020 requirement to fly in NAS."

The RDT&E effort will consist of a sole source EMD contract effort to be awarded in FY15.  Replacement or modification kits for the Weapon Replaceable Assemblies (WRA) associated with the ADS-B Out capability will be either acquired through the iGATM Catalog, Global Air Traffic Management Division's online catalog managed by the 853rd Electronic Systems Group at Hanscom AFB, MA, or contracted through the Lead Systems Integrator.  The System Support Activity (SSA) will be developing and testing all software for this capability increase with contracted support.\n\nT6 Communication, Navigation, System\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) and Avionics Upgrades for FAA Compliance are outside of the JPATS Major Defense Acquisition Program and will be established as a new Joint Acquisition Program with the Air Force.  For the JPATS Avionics Upgrade for FAA Compliance effort, a competitive award will be the strategy for the T-6A air vehicles due to their federated design.  However, a sole source strategy will be sought for the T-6B air vehicles due to proprietary hardware and software."
