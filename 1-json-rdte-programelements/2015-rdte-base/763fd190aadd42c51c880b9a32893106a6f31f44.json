This project encompasses the Engineering & Manufacturing Development phase and the follow on Production and Deployment Phase of sensor systems to improve the mission effectiveness of airborne ASW platforms in cueing, searching, localizing, tracking, and attacking subsurface targets.  Smaller and quieter threat submarines drive the requirement for continued advancement in ASW sensor capabilities for both blue water and littoral environments.  The littoral regions of the world create an additional ASW challenge to overcome the increase in background clutter caused by the shallow water depth, high volume of shipping, and commercial radio frequency interference. Project 0480 provides funding to the multi-static active ASW family of systems for the engineering development of solutions that detect, classify, and track threat submarines. Multi-static Active Coherent (MAC) and Advanced Processing Builds (APB) are efforts funded during the period identified. The MAC program encompasses the development of an active coherent (electronic) source sonobuoy, modifications to the existing Air Deployable Active Receiver sonobuoy and development, integration, and test of aircraft software.  It also provides upgrades to the Multi-static mission planning tool, the Tactical Operational Readiness Trainer and the Tactical Ground Replay System. MAC provides a large area search capability in all water environments and will eliminate current impulsive source safety, training, and Rules of Engagement restrictions. Project 0480 also provides funding for the APB program which provides software enhancements for signal processing improvements, clutter reduction, automation, improved displays and controls, as well as improved communication links for reduced operator workload resulting in increased target detection and classification capabilities and interoperability. APB also includes an Air ASW Engineering Measurement Program that collects ASW system data and identifies areas where beneficial improvements can be made and provides common software and hardware solutions across all Air ASW platforms.  The 325 sonobuoy test articles in FY13\/15 will support software and hardware integration flight tests and Technical Evaluation\/Follow-On Test & Evaluation for the MAC program."

TD includes hardware modifications to current production sonobuoys and software development for the aircraft.  Global Positioning System (GPS) integration will provide precise sonobuoy location regardless of aircraft altitude\/location to enhance wide area ASW search, localization, track and targeting.  The digital telemetry will improve sonobuoy communication performance in high Radio Frequency Interference environments, increase Air Deployable Active Receiver (SSQ-101) channel availability, and provide NATO compatibility. FY16-FY19 activities include the integration of an algorithm that will adjust sonobuoy release\/drop points for more accurate sonobuoy placement and integrating digital telemetry into the SSQ-53 and SSQ-62."
