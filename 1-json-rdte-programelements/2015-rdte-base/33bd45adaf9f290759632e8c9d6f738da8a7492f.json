The surprisingly fast appearance of these threats is accelerating and is now happening quicker than the requirements and acquisition process can respond.\n\nThe use of asymmetric devices is well understood by terrorists and nation-states alike.

Distributed electronic effects development will seek to identify and match technologies together that have natural synergies and produce more capability than the sum of the individual capabilities.  \n\nSoftware Programmable\/Spectrum Diverse Electronic Attack (EA) Capability \u2013 Opportunities exist to adapt existing technology used for communication and other purposes into highly configurable EA capability.
