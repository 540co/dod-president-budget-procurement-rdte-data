Criteria for project selection will include factors such as 1) identifiable path of preservation, transformation or innovation between an existing capability and a capability with a very high probability of being needed in the short to medium term (< 5 years); 2) loss of the capability is likely in the absence of the proposed project; 3) analysis showing that the project results in a lower overall cost to the department than if capability is developed from scratch when needed; and 4) preference is given to projects supporting multiple programs or services with no clearly identifiable principle beneficiary."

These tools collaboratively identify elements of the industrial base where current acquisition programs will not invest enough in production and\/or research to support the minimum sustaining rate that would keep critical suppliers viable.  While industrial base risks identified through these assessment tools are to be mitigated primarily through direct engagement with military departments, agencies, and industry, exceptional cases will require defense-wide intervention via investment accounts, often in collaboration with multiple Services and agencies, to ensure adequate industrial capability to support future defense needs.\n\nThis funding is a key tool for addressing supply chain risks and diminishing manufacturing sources.  Investments are prioritized though a careful analysis at every tier of the supply chain according to a numerical scale of risk-area's fragility and criticality.  Criticality examines characteristics that make a specific product or service difficult to replace if disrupted; fragility examines characteristics that make small deviations in the status quo likely to have substantial effects on an industry \/ supplier.  These concepts underpin AT&L\u2019s core mission and inform critical investment, budgetary, and programmatic decision-making."

Since 2008, DoD\u2019s projected requirements have shrunk to levels that substantially change the business case for development of new domestic source.  To re-enable the business case and develop a permanent domestic industrial base, DoD plans to fund a project to close the gap between the new and old business cases.\n\nInfrared Focal Plane Array (IRFPA): This project focuses on sustaining a continuous production capability for the impending modernization program of Improved Forward Looking Infrared (I-FLIR).  There is a gap between the end of horizontal integration of FLIR and the slated start of I-FLIR modernization.  In order to bridge the gap, the Department plans to maintain the foundry capability and intellectual base of critical suppliers through time-phased lots of IRFPAs.\n\nAdvanced Solid Rocket Propulsion: To support future missile interceptor missions, advanced kill vehicle thrusters for high precision and long duration missions are required.

Projects will be executed to improve the efficiency of existing production processes, explore advanced materials for higher performance and upgrade outdated technology.\n\nIndustrial Base Sustainment Other: DoD will conduct additional industrial base assessments in FY 2014 to identify weaknesses and fragile and critical capabilities for FY 2015 project development.  A call for FY 2015 projects has also been sent to the Service\u2019s Acquisition Executives requesting that proposals rate the fragility and criticality of subject capabilities.  A Joint Industrial Base Working Group Panel will rank the proposals, and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy will make the final selection."
