            "val": "The B-2 Spirit is the world's most advanced long-range strike asset. The unique combination of range, precision, payload, and ability to operate in anti-access area denial environments allow the B-2 to identify, locate, target, and destroy the highest value enemy targets. The B-2 can, with necessary upgrades, accomplish its mission regardless of location, return to base safely, and permit freedom of movement for follow-on forces, including other long range strike platforms. An array of planned RDT&E projects are necessary to preserve a strategic advantage against 21st century threats as well as increase flexibility, lethality, and survivability of this national asset tasked across a broad spectrum of tactical and national strategic objectives. B-2 will achieve these objectives by adapting mature technologies\/systems in the fleet to rapidly deliver affordable and relevant combat capability, leveraging other Department of Defense investments and programs utilizing innovative acquisition strategies.  \n\nThe B-2 has a projected service life through 2058. To ensure the fleet can accomplish its nuclear and conventional mission in highly defended and anti-access environments, periodic modernization efforts must be undertaken to upgrade combat capability as well as improve the viability, supportability, and survivability of the weapon system.  Recent and ongoing investments in avionics, structures, communications, and weapons upgrades keep the B-2 viable in the immediate future. Current system upgrades include Defensive Management System Modernization, Extremely High Frequency Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and Computers Increments 1, alternative communication solutions such as Common Very Low Frequency Receiver and Adaptable Communications Suite, Massive Ordnance Penetrator integration and modernization of Global Positioning System hardware and signal enhancement, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff missile-Extended Range integration, Flexible Strike Phase 1, Link-16 Center Instrument Display\/In-Flight Replanner, Low Observable Signature and Supportability Modifications, Aircraft Supportability Modifications, Training System Upgrades, Mission Planning System improvements, flight test aircraft upgrades and base of operations support, Advanced Low Detection Data Link studies, other weapons integration and engine improvements, as well as B-2 platform studies and acquisition planning.\n\nB-2 modernization of weapons carriage and armament interfaces, communications, navigation, avionics, and supportability efforts will establish an improved foundation for Moving Target Kill and Non-Traditional Surveillance and Reconnaissance combat capabilities necessary to ensure air superiority in 21st century nuclear and conventional combat environments. Flexible Strike Phase 2 efforts will modify Stores Management hardware and software necessary to accommodate integration of updated conventional and nuclear System 2 weapons into the B-2 fleet.  It will provide for mixed carriage of an assortment of weapons on the B-2, providing any combination of weapons in both B-2 weapons bays.  B-2 will have the capability to carry a fully loaded conventional Rotary Launcher Assembly along with a fully loaded Smart Bomb Rack Assembly or a Monitor and Control Assembly with Massive Ordnance Penetrator weapon on a single B-2 aircraft, providing unprecedented capability to destroy a wider array of target sets.  Other efforts include: the development of a Universal Armament Interface, integrating multi-platform advanced data links with high bandwidth satellite communication links, integration of the Global Positioning System M-Code hardware and software necessary for modernization of Air Traffic Management communications\/navigation\/ surveillance systems, and enhancement of the Mode 5\/S Identification Friend or Foe system with Automatic Dependence Surveillance-Broadcast capability mandated by US and European military and civil aviation agencies to improve situational awareness of controlled and contested airspaces. Finally, improvements are required on the B-2 data\/voice\/video recorders to comply with Air Force Safety Board mandates to provide specific flight and aircraft data, frequency of update, data precision, and recording duration that do not exist in the B-2 recorders today.\n\nAfter the above modifications are implemented, the B-2 fleet will be poised to deliver a Moving Target Kill combat capability, forming a foundation to exploit the modularity and improved precision algorithms of Universal Armament Interface. The inherent low observable characteristics of the B-2 will enable accomplishment of a Non-Traditional Surveillance and Reconnaissance mission. Necessary modifications include, but are not limited to, enhancement of current radar modes, high resolution improvements to the synthetic aperture radar, and improved information fusion required to gather, analyze, and communicate enemy movements and combat capabilities to friendly follow-on forces, the National Command Authority, and other operation centers via the Global Information Grid.\n\nIn FY13, Defensive Management System Modernization transfered to PE 65931F, project 653844.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes developmental efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "The B-2 is currently undergoing modernization of avionics\/communications systems, engines, armament systems, low observable components, core training system components, aircraft supportability improvements, support equipment development, as well as studying future Integrated Strike Warfare and Advanced Tactical Data Link integration requirements.\n\nLow Observable Signature and Supportability Modifications (LOSSM) and Aircraft Supportability Modifications (ASM) directly address B-2 aircraft availability, the primary stated B-2 user requirement.  Given the extremely small fleet size (20 aircraft), mission accomplishment is particularly sensitive to the availability of this high-demand strategic asset.  LOSSM projects increase aircraft availability, decrease low observable (LO) maintenance,  and maintain and improve the combat-ready LO signature for the B-2 fleet ensuring survivable combat operations. LOSSM projects improve materials, structures, and diagnostic tools necessary to evaluate LO materials and systems in the B-2 fleet. LOSSM structure improvement projects include, but are not limited to, advanced high frequency materials placement, windshield bounce patch and tape improvements, composite plies, advanced signature reduction, and radome improvements.  Material improvements include, but are not limited to, tailpipe and inlet coatings, pre-cured gap fillers, and other advanced LO materials development. Diagnostic tool efforts include, but are not limited to, improved radar frequency diagnostics, signature diagnostic system database upgrades, Tier One Material Inspection System improvements, Portable Laser Removal Tool development, Integrated Collections And Reporting System, Mobile Diagnostics Laboratory, Ground Air Radar System development, and other low observable special test equipment and information systems upgrades.\n\nThe Air Force will also study multiple structural, avionics, and engine modifications that could improve the performance of the aircraft and engines as well as reduce maintenance manhours and the logistics footprint of the fleet. Focus of the studies will be on non-mission capable (maintenance) drivers, safety issues, and obsolescence issues through modernization of key components in the airframe, avionics, and engines resulting in improved aircraft availability of a high demand\/low density fleet. Potential structural and avionics modifications include, but are not limited to, B-2 Common Processor, Proximity Sensor Logic Unit, Generator Control Unit, Rudder Access Panel and Elevon Drain Hole upgrades, Cockpit Voice and Flight Data Recorder, Radomes, Audio Control Display Unit, Center Instrument Display improvements, Aft Deck Doublers, Center Instrument Display connection to the aircraft Digital Video Recorder, Multi-function Information Distribution System Power Transfer, Global Positioning System Splitter Cable, Airborne Integrated Terminal Crypto, and upgraded cryptological functionality of all B-2 communications systems as necessary.  Engine improvements include, but are not limited to, the F118 engine Service Life Extension Program, Extended Mission Oil Tank, and the Next Generation Engine Core upgrade. Stage 1 and 3 engine fan blade improvements will reduce engine changes while increasing aircraft availability and reducing maintenance costs. Engine upgrades are necessary to maintain commonality with the F110 engine core and reduce maintenance and repair costs of divergent engine configurations.   \n\nModern communications are key enablers for the B-2 in the Anti-Access\/Area Denial battlespace, and directly enhance lethality and force multiplication. The Common Very Low Frequency (VLF) Receiver effort develops and integrates a receive-only very low bandwidth VLF receiver and antenna subsystem to provide a secure, survivable strategic nuclear communication capability for the B-2.  The receiver will be adaptable for use by other Department of Defense platforms. Secure, survivable two-way communications in an Anti-Access\/Area Denial environment remains a requirement for the B-2, and the Air Force will study requirements and potential efforts which might address those requirements. The Adaptable Communications Suite provides a non-integrated communications system that allows B-2 to receive a complete integrated mission, time sensitive targeting information, intelligence updates, and positive command and control procedures while en route to a combat theater. Link-16 Center Instrument Display\/In-Flight Replanner upgrade allows B-2 access to theater tactical data links, improving on-board situational awareness while greatly enhancing the ability of theater commanders to coordinate B-2 with other assets.  Mode 5\/S Identification Friend or Foe with Automatic Dependence Surveillance-Broadcast will provide improved situational awareness of controlled and contested airspaces in the United States and Europe.\n \nB-2 Armament upgrades integrate new and\/or advanced weapons on the B-2 to destroy a wider array of target sets, to include moving target sets, and hardened, deeply buried targets, as well as destroy more targets per sortie. Integration of the 30K pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) provides the nation with the ability to hold additional hardened, deeply buried targets at risk that are currently unachievable with 5K pound penetrator munitions. The B-2 is the only anti-access area denial penetrating platform capable of carrying the MOP, a capability which meets Urgent Operational Need requirements. The MOP integration project designs, develops, integrates, and tests hardware, software, and support equipment required for carriage, jettison, and release of two MOP weapons from the B-2. The MOP integration effort also includes modernization of the Global Positioning Signal (GPS) antenna enabling an enhanced GPS signal to be routed into the weapon bays to allow Monitor and Control Equipment (MACE) weapons, Smart Bomb Rack Assembly (SBRA) weapons, and Rotary Launch Assembly (RLA) weapons to acquire and track GPS satellites prior to weapons release, maintaining unjammed delivery accuracy in a jamming environment. The MOP Quick Reaction Capability effort includes dual fuze control and single Smart Bomb Rack Controller per bay weapon control and monitor. The Flexible Strike Phase 1 program will recombine and rehost the current B-2 stores management software onto a new integrated processor; Flexible Strike Phase 2 will update other Operational Flight Plans and hardware to enable simultaneous configuration of multiple weapons carriage capabilities, providing B-2 with maximum strategic nuclear and conventional strike flexibility.  Planned weapons integration efforts also include integration of currently fielded weapons and upgraded weapons such as, but not limited to, GBU-28 E\/B Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) with impact angle control, GBU-28D\/B SAASM with impact angle control, Hard Target Void Sensing Fuse, extended range Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, JDAM-5000, GBU 56, Long Range Standoff Missile, and Small Diameter Bomb II. The B-2 Weapons System Tester and its associated Test Program Sets (TPS), to include but not limited to, the Common Organizational Level Tester (COLT), MUSTANG, and B-2 Armament Tester, will be continually upgraded for increased reliability and performance to support current and new B-2 weapon suspension and release systems. \n\nPeculiar support equipment development activities include design, development, test, and procurement of new peculiar support equipment, to include but not limited to, special test equipment for newly emerging test and support requirements of legacy B-2 capabilities and\/or functionality. Development of new peculiar support equipment will support test and sustainment activities at the B-2 Weapon System Support Center Ground Test Facility, Program Depot Maintenance facility, Test Range facilities, and AFGSC operating locations.\n\nThe B-2 Training System upgrades include updates to training device hardware and components, simulation software, courseware and academic materials, instructional system design architectures, engineering drawings, and system documentation that is not driven by a funded aircraft modification.  Improvements include, but are not limited to, threat systems parametrics and order of battle information, radar display emulation improvements, improved aero fidelity of key pilot procedures, courseware improvements, and upgrades to display systems, subsystems, and simulation and computational processors. Other upgrades include, but are not limited to, conventional and nuclear guided weapons delivery training, expanded crypto keyfill capability in simulators, upgraded capability to train weapons as powered up upon completion of initial conditions, as well as upgrades to the electronic combat environment threat database tools to include threat laydown, threat parametrics, and Integrated Air Defense System. Upgrades also include the current Defensive Management System (DMS) simulation, improved DMS alternative\/ emergency procedures courseware, and upgraded Mission Generation System, Suppressor tool, and simulation and computational processors as necessary. Enhancements are provided to the B-2 family of trainers to include the Weapon System Trainers, Mission Trainer, Cockpit Procedures Trainers, Computerized Maintenance Training System, Weapon System Training Aids, Weapons Load Trainer, Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, Flight Control System Trainer, instructor-operator station, and Training System Support Center.\n\nThe Integrated Strike Warfare Airborne Network effort models and simulates combat effects and performance constraints in an environment that can demonstrate, integrate, generate, and validate four generic waveform models which will be used on the B-2 platform. Additionally, this effort establishes a viable end-to-end distributed modeling and simulation network. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Additionally, the new Integrated Processing Units and Disk Drive Unit architectures establish a high-speed fiber optic structure network while maintaining connectivity to legacy interfaces.  This upgrade provides the required processing growth path to future B-2 upgrades such as, but not limited to, future communications capabilities, Defensive Management System Modernization, Flexible Strike, B61-12 and other weapons integration efforts.   \n\nFour kits were developed with Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funds for three aircraft installs, which includes two Force Development Evaluation installs and one Developmental\/Operational Test aircraft install.  The fourth development kit will be refurbished and utilized as a production install via procurement funding.   Procurement funding will purchase the remaining 16 kits\/installs for a total of 20 aircraft.  Modification of the training system will be accomplished at the operational base and other locations as required.  This effort also includes updating the aircrew and maintenance trainers and academics\/courseware.  The Production and Deployment phase acquisition strategy is based on a two lot buy:  Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) in FY2012 and Full Rate Production (FRP) in FY2013.   Funds on the Support Equipment line are for upgrades to related support equipment.\n\nEHF Increment 2 was deferred in the FY13 President's Budget.  The Air Force will pursue an alternative strategic communications method, the Common Very Low Frequency Receiver, to satisfy the immediate user need date.  However, secure, survivable two-way communication remains a requirement for the warfighter.\n \nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate\nproduction and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
