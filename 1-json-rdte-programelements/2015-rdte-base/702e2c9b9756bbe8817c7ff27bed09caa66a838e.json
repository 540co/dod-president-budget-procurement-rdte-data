            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Applied Research associated with the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The FNC Program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented portion of the Navy Science and Technology (S&T) portfolio.  FNC investments respond to Naval S&T Gaps that are identified by the Navy and Marine Corps after receiving input from Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders. The Enabling Capabilities (ECs) and associated technology product investments of the FNC Program are competitively selected by a 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG), chartered by the S&T Corporate Board and representing the requirements, acquisition, research and fleet\/forces communities of the Navy and the Marine Corps.  \n\nThis was a new PE in FY 2013 that consolidated all Navy 6.2 FNC Program investments into a single Navy 6.2 PE.  Marine Corps FNC 6.2 investments are consolidated in a single Marine Corps 6.2 PE (0602131M). In FY 2011 and FY 2012, Navy 6.2 FNC Program investments were spread across 7 separate 6.2 PEs:  0602114N, 0602123N, 0602235N, 0602236N, 0602271N, 0602747N and 0602782N.  The consolidation in this PE allows all investments to be viewed by FNC Pillar, Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product.  It greatly enhances the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single place."

They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or 4 to a TRL of 6.  All FNC products require BA2 and BA3 funded technology development, which is coordinated to ensure tangible technology products are delivered upon completion of each investment.  Each year the TOG refreshes the FNC Program by approving new ECs and technology products as older ones get delivered.  After transition to an acquisition program, FNC products are further engineered, integrated and, ultimately, delivered to the warfighter. The development and delivery of each FNC product is guided by a Technology Transition Agreement (TTA) that is signed by the requirements and acquisition sponsors, as well as the S&T developer.\n\nThis project supports the naval pillars of Capable Manpower, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Force Health Protection, Forcenet, Power and Energy, Sea Basing, Sea Shield and Sea Strike.  Each of these pillars is listed as a separate R-2 Activity, as is FNC Management.  Under each R-2 Activity, the BA 6.2 accomplishments and plans for every Enabling Capability (EC) and Technology Product in the FNC Program are listed.

In all cases, these technology products support the Department of the Navy FNC Program and are managed at the Office of Naval Research.  All FNC investments in this PE are subjected to management oversight by 2-star chaired Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) that control the naval pillars of Sea Shield, Sea Strike, Sea Basing, Forcenet, Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, Enterprise and Platform Enablers, Power and Energy, Capable Manpower, and Force Health Protection.  Each EC is aligned to a pillar and each technology product is aligned to an EC.  At the lowest level, each technology product is measured against both technical and financial milestones on a monthly basis.  Annually, each technology product is reviewed in depth for technical performance and development status by the Chief of Naval Research against goals that have been approved by the Navy's 3-star Technology Oversight Group (TOG).  Also annually, each technology product is reviewed by its 2-star chaired pillar IPT for transition planning adequacy and transition commitment level.   Products must meet TOG required transition commitment levels for S&T development to continue.  Transition issues and required adjustments are reported annually by the Chief of Naval Research to the TOG, which establishes investment priorities for the FNC Program."
