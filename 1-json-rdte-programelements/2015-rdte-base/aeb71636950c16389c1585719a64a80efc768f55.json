This program element provides the critical funding incentive needed to pursue air, space and cyber related International Cooperative Research Development and Acquisition (ICRD&A) agreements and helps to (a) leverage USAF and allied resources through cost sharing and economies of scale; (b) exploit the best US and allied technologies for equipping coalition forces; (c) demonstrate areas of commonality or interoperability with our allies; and (d) accelerate the availability of defense technology and systems. Candidate projects are reviewed against USAF goals, DoD objectives, and warfighter needs prior to being approved.  An international agreement defining project objectives, responsibilities and costs is required prior to release of funds.  To obtain these funds and ensure service commitment, projects are selected from existing or new RDT&E programs funded in the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP).  Project offices must show matching funds and contributions from associated program elements and equitable allied funding.  As appropriate, funding responsibility for out-year requirements and follow-on efforts are transferred to the project office and associated program elements.  Any new contracts are awarded after full and open competition."
