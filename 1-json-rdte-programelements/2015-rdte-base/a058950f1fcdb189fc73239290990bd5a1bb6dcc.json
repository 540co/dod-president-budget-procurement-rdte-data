This test process provides a scientific methodology to ensure the effective disciplined and efficient testing of EW and avionics systems.  Each capability or facility improvement is pursued in concert with the others to avoid duplicate capabilities while at the same time producing the proper mix of test resources needed to support the AF EW Test Process and testing of EW systems which can be used in any action involving the use of electromagnetic and DE to control the electromagnetic spectrum or to attack the enemy.  This PE provides funding for the management and technical oversight of implementation activities, development and improvement of digital EW models, measurement facilities improvements, hardware-in-the-loop test facilities improvements, and installed system test facility improvements.  Support includes requirements definition and analysis, project planning, programming and budgeting, technical oversight, and application of T&E facility Improvement & Modernization (I&M).  Products include studies, analyses, improved Modeling & Simulation (M&S) of threat sources, improved or new T&E capabilties to support EW testing and related documentation.  Additionally, this PE provides funding to support the acquisition and analysis efforts of the Foreign Materiel Program and EW intelligence efforts.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

To manage program risk effectively throughout the weapons system acquisition process, and conduct T&E effectively and efficiently, a broad multi-spectrum, integrated set of T&E capabilities for modeling and simulation through open-air ranges (OAR) are required. The EW Test Process Support task provides for investment management, coordinated technical oversight, and application of EW T&E facilities, including studies, analyses, and related documentation.  The National Radar Cross Section (RCS) Test Facility (NRTF) at Holloman AFB, NM, provides timely, accurate, and secure RCS and antenna measurements for tri-service and joint program offices, DoD laboratories, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and industry. The NRTF tests fielded and developmental systems and technology to meet Low Observable (a.k.a. stealth) and EW customer requirements.  The Guided Weapons Evaluation Facility (GWEF), 412 EWG\/OL-HN and the Digital Integrated Air Defense System (DIADS) provide the ability to realistically evaluate hardware components and simulated weapon systems against manned hardware threat representations throughout the acquisition process.  GWEF provides simulations of advanced Infrared (IR) & Radio Frequency (RF) semi-active Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs), Air-to-Air Missiles (AAMs), RF missile warning, IR and Laser countermeasure functions; integration of actual threat hardware and ground clutter into advanced threat RF and IR missile simulations.  DIADS provides algorithm based enemy command and control (C2) capabilities plus early warning radar detection, limited ground control intercept features and also allows man-in-the-loop interaction for the enemy C2 positions.  The Advanced Warfare Test and Evaluation Capability (AWTEC) will replace 90's technology with state-of-the-art stimulators to upgrade the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) at Edwards AFB, CA and provides Electromagnetic Interference\/Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMI\/EMC) capabilities at the BAF.  Improvement and modernization efforts within this PE are identified for the EW mission area.  EW provides planning, improvements, and modernization needed for test capabilities to conduct and support the AF EW test process, including DE.  This test process provides a scientific methodology to ensure the effective disciplined and efficient testing of EW and avionics systems."

The 412 EWG\/OL-HN began facility renovations and conducted initial operator training and functional checkouts of 33% of RF equipment transferred from Ft Worth in 2012.  The Digital Integrated Air Defense System (DIADS) upgrade project fielded software version 7.2 containing Remote Interface Control updates to support multiple interfaces; continued development of advanced jamming capabilities, control and display system upgrades, and improved sensor and multi-mode capabilities; and initiated efforts to improve weapon command and control algorithms to simulate evolving air defense threats in support of acquisition programs such as F-22, F-35, B-2 and MALD-J.  The Advanced Warfare Test & Evaluation Capability (AWTEC) project completed regression and acceptance testing of Electromagnetic Interference\/Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMI\/EMC) upgrades at the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) and continued integrating an advanced radar environment simulation (ARES) upgrade, new real-time displays and controls, new Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) software, and advanced Global Positioning System (GPS) and navigation system upgrades in the BAF.  The National Radar Cross Section (RCS) Test Facility (NRTF) upgrade project began site preparation for the new operations center; completed the design of the RCS Advanced Measurement Site (RAMS) utility improvements design; and initiated development of consolidated machine\/supply shops and a new specialized paint booth fire supression system to enhance efficiency of operations and accuracy for measuring RCS of Low Observable platforms and antennas.  NRTF also completed design of a new Radar VHF\/UHF Measurement System (RVUMS) Antenna Feed to enhance broadband signal performance and completed several studies addressing improvements in signal processing and system accuracy."

Annually, the MAJCOM commanders establish a list of their top 20 requirements. The MAJCOMs' requirements lists are integrated and prioritized into a classified Air Force requirement list.  Each MAJCOM then approves the FMA Top 20 List and final validation comes from the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff.  System analyses are based on and driven by acquisitions.  The USAF provides assessments and data for threat systems to all DoD components."
