Due to the uncertainty of these issues,  investment programs reduced immediate FY2013 and FY2014 execution requirements to those actions needed to prevent breaks in service pending final resolution of the President's budget.  The delay in the final approval of the budget also impacted the ability to initiate planned acquisition  that have longer contractual lead times.  The combined impact of the actions resulted in  Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI) delaying the start of mandatory ERP software version migration to Oracle R12 to FY2014 and delaying the deployment to additional Agencies; Defense Retiree and Annuitant Pay System (DRAS2) 2, delayed the prime contract award until  FY 2014; Defense Information System for Security (DISS) delayed and down scoped key contract actions needed to fully implement the intent of Section 3001 Public Law 108-458, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12.  Funds that would have supported functional enhancements to the Defense Travel System (DTS), Wide Area Workflow and systematic technology research were diverted to the higher priority programs.\n\nFY 2015 Secretary of Defense Initiatives: $1.117million - due to additional DEBS program requirements."

The goals of BEIS are to ensure data compliance with Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) standards; provide security-defined, enterprise-level access to information for ad hoc management queries; and produce external financial management reports\/statements based on standardized data.  BEIS provides solutions to these goals by:\n- Establishing the authoritative source for SFIS values and providing for standardization by implementing SFIS and United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) compliant financial reporting capabilities for Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports.\n- Providing an enterprise-wide information environment that will serve as the single source for enterprise-wide financial information.\n- Serving as the DoD-wide system for Treasury Reporting.\n- Providing decision makers with significantly greater access to financial information through data visibility and business intelligence (e.g., Executive Dashboard).\nThe BEIS functional baseline encompasses a family of services organized into six distinct lines of business, four of which have achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC).  The remaining two services, Financial Reporting Services and Cash Accountability Reporting Services, will provide DoD enterprise-wide financial visibility and will serve as the centralized financial data source and the single source for enterprise Audited Financial Statements and Budgetary Reports, as well as Treasury Reporting.  The BEIS financial management capabilities will be used by the Military Services, Defense Agencies, and the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller).  These modernization efforts will complete deployment\/implementation of BEIS capabilities and will serve the Department Auditability goals and objectives."

BEIS has and will continue to deliver needed capabilities more rapidly and efficiently using a Family of Systems (FoS) concept providing a functional baseline organized into six distinct lines of business: General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, Enterprise Level Business Intelligence Services, Cash Accountability and Reporting Services, and Financial Reporting Services. These services are provided by individual IT systems that collectively, make up the BEIS FoS. The BEIS FoS program is composed of four core systems; Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS), Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI), and Defense Corporate Database\/Defense Corporate Warehouse (DCD\/DCW). Capabilities are being developed incrementally with multiple releases per year to meet the Enterprise Transition Plan milestones provided to Congress. BEIS has achieved FOC for the following system components\/services: DCD\/DCW, to include General Ledger Services, Business Integration Services, Reference Data Services, and Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI) and transitioned these to DFAS for operations and sustainment.   Based on the list of remaining requirements for BEIS DDRS Financial Reporting Services and BEIS DCAS Cash Accountability and Reporting Services an overall schedule including integrated activities as well as identified products and milestones has been developed. Contracts are competitively awarded to keep costs down. Intra-governmental services are being used where possible for infrastructure support by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Technical Services Organization and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Information Processing Center."

                            "val": "The DAI mission is to deliver auditable Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliant business environments for Defense Agencies providing accurate, timely, authoritative financial data supporting the DoD goal of standardizing financial management practices improving financial decision support, and supporting audit readiness.  Currently, Defense Agencies use more than 10 different non-compliant financial management systems supporting diverse operational functions and the warfighter in decision making and financial reporting.  These disparate, non-integrated systems do not meet statutory requirements to produce timely, auditable reports.\n\n\nThe DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies\u2019 financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of  agencies and field activities across the DoD.  DAI will support a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision making.   The DAI business solution, once implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a \u201c.mil\u201d environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.\n\n\nThe DAI implementation approach is to deploy a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), version 11i (R11).  DAI implemented an Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards.   The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative source).  \n\n\nDAI supports the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Strategy 5, \u201cReform the business and support functions of the Defense enterprise\u201d.  DAI is also aligned to the FY 2012\/FY 2013 DOD Strategic Management Plan Business Goal 2: \u201cStrengthen DoD financial management to respond to warfighter needs and sustain public confidence through auditable financial statements\u201d. The objective of the Defense Agencies Initiative is to achieve auditable, CFO Act compliant business environments for the Defense Agencies with accurate, timely, authoritative financial data. \n\n\nThe primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements. Common business functions within budget execution include  the Department\u2019s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report; Procure to Pay;  Acquire to Retire (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (Time and Labor reporting only); and Order to Cash.  Future capabilities will support Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, Budget Formulation, Grants Financial Management, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA)) as well as a Contract Writing capability.\n\n\nDAI is currently implemented at 11 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, (OUSD(C)) (Time and Labor only) and supporting over 9,200 users.  In addition, since Oracle is phasing out maintenance of Oracle EBS, Release 11i, the program is required to migrate to EBS Release 12 (R12). The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system.  Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, complete the R12 upgrade, initiate the annual Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE 16) assertion packages, and sustain the system.  \n\n\nThe benefits of DAI are:\n- Common business processes and data standards;\n- Access to real-time financial data transactions;\n- Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements;\n- Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities; Standardized line of accounting with the use of SFIS; and\n- Use of United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.\n\n\nThe DAI PMO will provide the R12 Upgrade system integration services that include: acquisition management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows (RICEFW) objects; testing (information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, security, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer\/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated enterprise resource planning system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support."

DTS automates travel authorizations, reservations and arrangements, voucher processing, payment, reconciliation, accountability and archiving. DTS employs Digital Signature and Login\/Authentication which requires users to provide a signed response using a valid DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate to gain access to the DTS application. Travel documents created in DTS are digitally signed with the user\u2019s PKI certificate to provide a means of identifying the signer, verifying the document\u2019s integrity, and enforcing non-repudiation of the signature by the signer.\n\nDTS is a Major Automated Information System (MAIS), Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1AC program. DTS delivers capability by evolutionary acquisition utilizing incremental development; recognizing up front the need for future capability improvements. DTS has a flexible design so that each increment builds upon its core functionality, dependent on available, mature technology providing increasing capabilities to travelers, travel administrators, and process owners. Full Operational Capability (FOC) was declared in March 2010. Future capability improvements will be implemented as P3I beginning FY 2011."

USMEPCOM serves as the single entry point for determining the physical, aptitude, and conduct qualifications of candidates for enlistment. VIPS would have provided the capability to electronically acquire, process, store, secure, and seamlessly share personnel data across the Accessions Community of Interest. If VIPS had been fully implemented, VIPS would have reduced the cycle time required to induct enlistees to meet the needs of Homeland Defense, reduced the number of visits to the Military Entrance Processing Stations, reduced manual data entry errors, and reduced attrition through better pre-screening practices. GAO reported that better pre-screening practices would have yielded cost savings and cost avoidance of $83M per year for the VIPS automated elements.  \n\nDue to schedule delays and further refinement of the requirements, VIPS entered into a Critical Change state on May 11, 2011.  The Department of Defense (DoD) Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO) Acquisition Decision Memorandum dated December 7, 2012, cancelled the VIPS program and directed the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to conduct a Technical Demonstration (TD) of a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) to inform any future acquisition approach to meet existing requirements."

It is mandated for use by all DoD Services and Agencies for electronic invoicing by DFAR 252.232-7003. WAWF processes over 86 million transactions worth $301B per year and saves DoD millions of dollars annually in processing cost and avoided interest (over $77.6 M in FY10). WAWF brings together the invoice, the receiving report, and the contract from EDA to provide the accounting and entitlement systems with the three-way match needed to authorize payment. WAWF is also the Enterprise data entry point for the Item Unique Identifier (IUID) and Government Furnished Property (GFP) programs, the source of receipt and acceptance data for Service Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERP), and is central for the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) enterprise solutions for Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) and Inter Governmental Transfer (IGT). The benefits to DoD are a single face to industry suppliers, global accessibility of documents, reduced need for re-keying, improved data accuracy, real-time processing, secure transactions with audit capability, and faster processing resulting in reduced interest penalties. For vendors, benefits include the capability to electronically submit invoices, reduction of lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contract payment records."

Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems. The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place.  \n\nWithin the current DoD environment, progress has been made streamlining a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems.  Efforts continue to improve the visibility of funding information, eliminate manual efforts and  undue complexities to the management of budget authority, and to eliminate impediments in the flow of funding documents.  The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions.   This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous.  \n\nThe envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow.  Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data.  Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.\n\nThe operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment.  The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding."
