            "val": "The Navy's Strategy is to remain the preeminent maritime power, providing the U.S. a global expeditionary force committed to security and prosperity, while defending the Nation's interests.  Within this vision, Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) remains a Navy core competency in a dynamic and uncertain maritime environment.  U.S. adversaries continue to develop asymmetric capabilities and capacities to deter, disrupt, or delay the entry of U.S. and allied naval forces, and pose a constant challenge as we implement the Maritime Strategy.  Evolving submarine technologies offer enhanced stealth, speed, endurance, weapons, and operational proficiency, trends foretelling that the adversary submarine of the future will have a significantly larger sphere of influence, while presenting less vulnerability to ASW forces.  The effective offensive engagement range of the adversary submarine of the future will continue to match or outrange individual U.S. and multinational platform sensors and weapons in many tactical environments.  Submarines are an increasing threat to all Naval and Allied ships, particularly modern diesel subs and faster torpedoes.  Not only can the presence of potential hostile submarines delay naval combatant action until they are located and neutralized, submarines can also disrupt all seaborne logistics supply for any ground campaign as well as maritime commerce.  ASW forces must be effective in all operating environments, ranging from the deep open ocean to the littorals, and are key to countering adversarial anti-access and area denial strategies.\n\nThe objective of this Program Element (PE) is to significantly improve existing Surface Ship Undersea Warfare (USW) sonar system capabilities through quick and affordable development\/integration of emergent, transformational technologies in support of Littoral ASW, Theater ASW, Mine Reconnaissance, and overall Sea Shield efforts required to pace the threat.  Detection and classification play uniquely vital roles in the success of any ASW campaign.  To be effective against increasingly stealthy threats in an often ambiguous undersea environment, future sensors must be environmentally adaptive, have very low false alarm rates, and exploit the full range of current and future submarine detection vulnerabilities.\n\nProject 1916's primary mission is to improve AN\/SQQ-89(V) Measures Of Performance (MOP) by enhancing detection, tracking, classification, passive, active, torpedo Detection, Classification, and Localization (DCL) and sonobuoy data processing and display capabilities, and increasing acoustic sensor frequency bandwidth (Operational Requirements Document #667-76-05 titled 'AN\/SQQ-89 Improvement Program', Test and Evaluation Master Plan 802-2 (TEMP 802-2)). Improvements to system simulation, stimulation, Information Assurance (IA), software and network architectures, and safety are included.  This project takes advantage of the AN\/SQQ-89(V) Open System Architecture (OSA) and Acoustic Rapid Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Insertion (ARCI) initiatives to integrate a torpedo DCL and ASW sonar combat system capability improvements.  This COTS-based Surface Ship ASW combat system, the AN\/SQQ-89A(V)15, is currently planned as a backfit program for both CG47 (select CG59-73 Baseline 3 and 4 ships) and DDG51 (All DDG and follow FLT I\/II\/IIA) class ships.  The Open Architecture (OA) (level 3 compliant) of the AN\/SQQ-89A(V)15 system drives the Advanced Capability Build (ACB) spiral development process and provides budget flexibility to make COTS\/OA technology solutions and ARCI-type initiatives affordable.  This will be accomplished via the incorporation of select Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and emergent, transformational ASW technologies delivered to the AN\/SQQ-89(V) prime integrator every two years.  ASW technology implementation will take advantage of improvements developed under the submarine Advanced Processing Build (APB) program and will in turn share unique improvements developed under this program with the submarine and surveillance ASW communities.  This project will also contribute to the development of Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) ASW Mission Packages.\n\nProject 1916 also includes funding for the Surface Ship Enhanced Measurement Program (SSEMP), which will measure the performance of existing and new Surface Ship ASW combat systems and enables data-based assessment of the capabilities and shortfalls in the performance of these systems in realistic scenarios."

This project will improve AN\/SQQ-89(V) MOP by enhancing detection, tracking, classification, active, passive, torpedo DCL, and sonobuoy data processing and display capabilities, and increasing acoustic sensor frequency bandwidth (Operational Requirements Document #667-76-05 titled 'AN\/SQQ-89 Improvement Program'), TEMP 802-2.\n\nThis project will take advantage of the AN\/SQQ-89(V) OSA and ARCI initiatives to integrate a TDCL and ASW sonar and combat system capability improvements.  This COTS-based Surface Ship ASW combat system, the AN\/SQQ-89A(V)15, is currently planned as a backfit program for both CG47 (select CG59-73 Baseline 3 and 4 ships) and DDG51 (All DDG51 and follow FLT I\/II\/IIA) class ships.  This project has delivered the AN\/SQQ-89A(V)15 Pre-Production Prototype, performed installation on board CG73, and conducted subsequent Developmental Test & Evaluation (DT&E) and Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) where the system was found 'Operationally Effective' by Command Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR).\n\nThe OSA and high performance COTS processing hardware on ships fielded with the AN\/SQQ-89A(V)15 combat system provides an opportunity to integrate select P3I as well as emergent, transformational ASW technological improvements that were previously unachievable.  The Undersea Warfare (USW) suites on these ships will require periodic upgrades to remain effective well into the 21st century and to pace the threat.  Software upgrades target capability increases in high interest areas as prescribed by the Fleet and captured in campaign analysis.  To achieve this, this project will package and deliver incremental upgrades every two years to the AN\/SQQ-89A(V)15 production program via an ACB spiral development process (ACB-11, ACB-13, etc.) by inserting maturing USW technologies, such as enhancements to improve USW performance in the littoral, reduced manning on AN\/SQQ-89(V) equipped ships, operator efficiency upgrades via the implementation of robust embedded data record and replay capability and active\/passive sonar simulation\/stimulation, DCL active\/passive processing upgrades, passive sonar automated detection and classification processing bell-ringers from the ASW Community-of-Interest, detect and track through maneuvers, integration of MH-60R mission systems with the AN\/SQQ-89A(V)15 combat system, integration of Mid-Frequency active detection improvements, false-alarm rate reduction, clutter reduction, integration of ASW Community-of-Interest improved acoustic intercept and small-object avoidance, ASW Multi-Sensor integration (acoustic similar-source fusion and implementation of integrated shipboard system data, and ASW combat display architecture), distributed engagement management (Network Centric Enterprise Services implementation, new displays and decision aids, ASW Community-of-Interest model capabilities implementation), Multi-Frequency Acoustic Communications (MF ACOMMS) between Surface Combatants and Submarines, and upgraded technologies such as algorithm improvements, increased Passive Narrow Band (PNB) frequency, Continuous Active Sonar (CAS), and beamformer improvements. A rigorous testing program is also required to ensure that these performance enhancements are operationally effective and suitable."
