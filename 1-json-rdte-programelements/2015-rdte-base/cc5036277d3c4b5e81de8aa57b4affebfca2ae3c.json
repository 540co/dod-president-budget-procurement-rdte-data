            "val": "The Coastal Riverine Force (CRF), formerly Maritime Expeditionary Security Force (MESF), Riverine, and Naval Coastal Warfare (NCW), consists of two Groups and ten Squadrons; nine regular and one special (Guam). Each squadron is organized by Boat Detachments, Security Detachments and Command and Control (C2) divisions. The C2 Division is comprised of Sensor Detachments (SENSDET) operating the Radar Sonar Surveillance Center (RSSC) and Communications Detachments (COMMSDET) operating the Mobile Ashore Support Terminal (MAST IIIs), each separately funded. The Radar Sonar Surveillance Center (RSSC) is the only land-based and rapidly deployable mobile Navy system with the ability to conduct surface and subsurface surveillance in coastal and littoral areas. The system provides detailed contact information via various C4I systems to the tactical area commander based on radar, visual, thermal, electronic, and underwater acoustic sensor information. Missions supported with the MIUW-RSSCs are: OCONUS and INCONUS Force Protection, protecting port areas, high value assets, and surveilling the near shore areas. The MAST III is the C4ISR hub for the NCW Commander. MAST IIIs deploy to support Force Protection\/Force Security Officer for Commander, Amphibious Group in its Harbor Defense and Coastal Sea Control missions.\n\nAs stated in the Maritime Expeditionary Security Force (MESF) CONOPS dated 11 April 2007: The MESF organization will be established through realignment of the CRF organizations (CRF Squadrons, Mobile Inshore Undersea Warfare Units, Inshore Boat Units, Mobile Security Squadrons, Mobile Security Detachments, Embarked Security Detachments, and Embarked Security Teams) into the CRF structure. Further realignment will result in the integration of intelligence, VBSS, and additional waterborne and security detachments to support new mission capability and provide additional NCC \/ JFMCC capacity. In addition to enhancing readiness of the current force, CRF will deploy adaptive force packages (AFPs) tailored for the specific missions to achieve greater efficiency and combat readiness than the current CRF force. By establishing a professional warfare community and dedicated Maritime Expeditionary Security Force capable of meeting the full range of security requirements, CRF closes a critical gap essential to full mission readiness for MSO. CRF provides a structure that establishes a single integrated maritime security force with one standard for training, certification, employment, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).  This funding supports the future direction of the CRF as it is being determined externally by world events and internally by the progress of DoD initiatives modernize forces and capabilities.. CRF force will be agile, tailorable, and scalable and will use applied technology to quickly detect, deter or interdict potential threats to DoN assets in the littoral environment. Next generation surface and subsurface surveillance systems, as well as enhanced C4I capabilities, are required to meet these operational objectives. These capabilities must be interoperable with higher and adjacent echelons of command (to include coalition allies) as well as with supporting elements to include joint forces.\n\nThe Expeditionary Warfare Decision System (EWDS) (formerly Tactically Integrated Sensors (TIS)) software constitutes an upgrade to the MAST-RSSC and is being executed as a separate Abbreviated Acquisition Program. The AAP will enable the deployment of a currently fielded Program of Record (POR) combat system (AN\/SQQ-34C) known as Tactically Integrated Sensors (TIS) to the CRF units. TIS system restores the acoustic surveillance capability that has been eroded from the current RSSC suite. Additionally, future mult-spectal technologies are being looked at as enabling capabilities to expand the situational awareness of the littoral region, providing additional tactical decision aids to the local area commander.\n\nThis funding supports the Identity Dominance System (IDS) as key enabler in support of the Joint Personnel Identity (JPI) program. OPNAV N957 conducted the NCW CBA and MES ICD. MESF forces have a mobile security mission that requires methodologies, procedures, equipment and the communications capacity to identify individuals who represent a potential threat as a means to deter and eliminate individuals from conducting asymmetric\/non-traditional attacks upon friendly forces, high value assets and coastal areas that NCW is charged with protecting. The Vessel Boarding Search and Seizure (VBSS) teams conducting Expanded Maritime Interception Operations also have a similar requirement to identify individuals. The development of a device to support identity functions is captured in the Identity Dominance System Capability Development Document (IDS CDD). IDS will be used in the following environments: aboard ship and ashore in ports, the littorals and extended inland field environments worldwide. IDS will be employed in maritime and very austere ashore environments and carried by individuals who are part of ship boarding parties and dismounted patrols. These mission and environmental demands dictate a portable, lightweight, rugged, and reliable system with intuitive and user friendly features. IDS biometric modalities may differ by mission profile, requiring the authoritative response to the On-Scene Commander\/Boarding Officer on whether to detain or further investigate an individual of interest.\n\nCoastal Riverine Force will integrate and employ a variety of surface and air assets, special vehicles, weapons and appropriately trained personnel. Mission assets needed to support the operational capabilities will vary widely dependant on the Host Nations involved. The Riverine Squadron will deploy with inherent, but limited, force protection capabilities. The Modular Unmanned Scouting Craft Littoral (MUSCL), is man-portable \"X-Class\" Unmanned Surface Vehicle providing enhanced surveillance and reconnaissance capability to Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) Riverine forces.\n\nThis program provides efforts in support of the Navy Expeditionary Warfare Division (formerly known as Navy Irregular Warfare (IW) Office).  It provides for the identification and assessment of available technologies to confront expeditionary challenges, including irregular warfare, urgent\/emergent and unfulfilled needs of the warfighter.  It provides for the validation and combat demonstration of identified technologies and\/or packages of technologies to meet Oversea Contingency Operation (OCO) goals.  It also provides funding necessary to attract additional investment and sustainment of demonstrated capabilities.  The goal of the Navy Expeditionary Warfare Innovations Branch office is to: identify those requirements necessary to meet the immediate warfighter needs; integrate those existing unique and\/or related capabilities that can best meet those warfighter needs; test those integrated capabilities; and then demonstrate in real time and\/or during planned deployments all within an 8 month period. \n\nCombatant Craft Replacements will provide second generation Riverine Multi Mission Craft that will replace in-service Riverine Patrol Boats (RPBs) and Riverine Assault Boats (RABs).  Combatant Craft replacements will: conduct inland waterway patrol and interdiction to preserve the rivers for friendly use as lines of communications; deny the use of rivers and waterways to waterborne and immediate shore sited hostile forces by barrier and interdiction operations;  and, with augmentation of ground and air forces, locate and destroy hostile forces within a riparian area.  Specific mission and capabilities will be identified in an NECC developed\/OPNAV N95 approved Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).  RDT&E funding will fund feasibility studies and procurement of mock-ups and prototype craft to demonstrate capabilities prior to production craft procurement."

It provides for the validation and combat demonstration of identified technologies and\/or packages of technologies to meet Oversea Contingency Operation (OCO) goals.  It also provides funding necessary to attract additional investment and sustainment of demonstrated capabilities.  The goal of the Navy Expeditionary Warfare Innovations Branch office is to: identify those requirements necessary to meet the immediate warfighter needs; integrate those existing unique and\/or related capabilities that can best meet those warfighter needs; test those integrated capabilities; and then demonstrate in real time and\/or during planned deployments all within an 8 month period. Those areas of capability to be investigated by the Expeditionary Warfare Innovations Branch include any or all of the following:\n- Persistent Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR)\n- Close-in, expeditionary ISR \n- Conventional forces support to SOF\n- Rotary wing support to SOF \n- All source intelligence fusion \n- Littoral precision strike capability\n- Unmanned Vehicles (Undersea\/Air\/Surface\/Ground vehicles for Mine\/ISR\/Strike\/Surveillance\/Detection\/IED capabilities"

NECC will develop and deploy adaptive force packages (AFPs) tailored for the specific missions to achieve greater efficiency and combat readiness. NECC units have a number of Command, Control, Communications, Computers (C4) current and future technological requirements for Tactical Operations Center, vehicles, craft, personnel capabilities and SATCOM availability. Next generation air, surface and subsurface surveillance systems, as well as enhanced C4I capabilities, are required to meet operational objectives. For each NECC operation, units maintain effective command and control, develop and display a tactical picture, and share intelligence and current operational information with higher, adjacent, and subordinate headquarters. These capabilities must be interoperable with higher and adjacent echelons of command (to include coalition allies) as well as with supporting elements to include joint forces. Future technologies are being evaluated as enabling capabilities to expand situational awareness, providing additional tactical decision aids to the local area commander. \n\nFuture C4I research and development will be driven by requirements to increase agility, mobility and network security posture. Small, Medium and\/or Large Scale Communication Systems (LSCS) are the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) hub for the NECC Forces. LSCS suites are interoperable with joint systems and include communications HF, VHF, and UHF in all common modes with encrypted and clear voice and data, to include Tactical Data Link Network capability. The future of Large scale communications assets such as Mobile Ashore Support Terminal (MAST) and Deployable Expeditionary Network-Medium (DEXNet-M) supporting Radar Sonar Surveillance Center (RSSC) will be converging to a common baseline, the NECC Enterprise Tactical Command and Control (NETC2). \n\nBeginning in FY15 funding for CRF Modernization was moved to NECC C4ISR Modernization"

The intent of this strategy is to: drive down development, production, and logistics costs, while leveraging technologies developed for other agencies to increase the capabilities of Navy Expeditionary Forces. The future baseline configuration for Large Scale Communication Systems (LSCS) will be the NETC2, a system scalable to the Adaptive Force Package levels. Efforts include development of capabilities based on emergent the requirements and operational feedback, to include reach back for tactical vehicles and craft in the coastal, littoral and riverine environments, tactical data link capability, and develop sensor technologies in support of harbor defense, littoral surveillance and reconnaissance missions."
