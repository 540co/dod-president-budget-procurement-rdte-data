State-of-the-science advances are made in warfighter training, warfighter system interfaces, directed energy bioeffects, deployment and sustainment of warfighters in extreme environments, and understanding and shaping adversarial behavior.  The Directed Energy Bioeffects Parameters project develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies to predict, evaluate, and mitigate the effects of directed energy on personnel and mission performance, and exploits the offensive capabilities of directed energy systems.  The Human Dynamics and Terrain Demonstration project develops, demonstrates, and transitions human-centric technologies to address processing, exploitation, and dissemination of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability needs.  The Mission Effective Performance project develops, demonstrates, and transitions advanced training, simulation, mission rehearsal, and other performance-aiding methods and technologies to enhance warfighter readiness.  The Warfighter Interfaces project develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies to revolutionize the way human operators synergistically use Air Force systems, including autonomous machines and adaptive teams of humans and machines.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops and demonstrates technologies to protect and enhance the performance of Air Force personnel in operational environments."
