            "val": "Weapons Technology develops solutions for destroying an increasing number of threat objects.  Weapons Technology focuses on reducing the cost of an engagement by developing compact, efficient high energy lasers (HEL) and the novel beam propagation technology required for low-power to strategic-class Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) applications. Weapons Technology works closely with Discrimination Sensor Technology to correlate threat identification and engagement hand over requirements to build the foundation for next-generation interceptors and multi-mission directed energy platforms.\n\nThe Missile Defense Agency (MDA) works in collaboration with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office and Service partners in a systems engineering based strategy for collaborative research, development, test and evaluation of weapons technologies. \n\nWithin the Directed Energy Technology area, the MDA is conducting research into the transmission and control of directed energy largely above the atmosphere for mid-term missile defense applications and ultimately boost phase intercepts. First, MDA is pursuing two promising laser technologies in a competitive environment. Both technologies have demonstrated potential to efficiently scale to high power. MDA will continue HEL technology development with the goal of scaling to power levels required for robust, speed of light missile defense.  Second, incrementally integrate and test lower power laser systems on unmanned aerial vehicles. These laser test platforms will address a broad spectrum of mission applications while wringing out concept of operations doctrine for incorporating lasers into the battle space. MDA is actively engaging with the other DoD Agencies and the Services to identify joint airborne laser ventures that address mid-term mission capabilities for directed energy technology. To further support these BMDS Directed Energy applications, MDA continues to invest in a number of advanced technology initiatives. \n\nThe Weapons Technology contributions to the Prioritized Capabilities List include: Prevent Attack - counter emerging or advanced air and missile threats and Persistent Surveillance - improve birth-to-death tracking, identification and targeting."
