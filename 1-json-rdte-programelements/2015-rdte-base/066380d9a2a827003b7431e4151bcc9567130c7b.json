This project investigates and designs training applications to enable the Army to train any time and any place.  Efforts include designing virtual humans that embody natural language, speech recognition in noisy environments, gesture, gaze, and conversational speech.  Techniques and methods are assessed for integrating different sensory cues into virtual environments that result in enhanced training and leader development. The project leverages the capabilities of industry and the research and development community through the synthesis of creativity and technology, including work at the Army Research Institute and the Army Research Laboratory. \n\nEfforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nDeveloped technologies and techniques are transitioned for maturation and demonstration to PE 0603015A\/project S28.     \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n \nWork in this project is performed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Human Research and Engineering Directorate, Simulation and Training Technology Center (STTC), Orlando, FL."
