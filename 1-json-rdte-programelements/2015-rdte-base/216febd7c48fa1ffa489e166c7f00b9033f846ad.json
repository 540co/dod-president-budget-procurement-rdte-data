The Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) for the AH-64E Apache Block III aircraft, and 2. The Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) for the Apache, Blackhawk, Kiowa Warrior, Chinook, Gray Eagle and other Special Operations Forces aircraft.  The SALT radio will be capable of operating Link-16 and the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW). The SANR radio will be capable of operating the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW), Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), and Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS).  The AMF Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM), once signed by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD(AT&L)), will officially split AMF-SA into the sub-programs of SALT and SANR while also delegating Milestone Decision Authority for SALT to the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE). The revised  acquisition strategy for SALT changes it from sole source to a full and open competition using a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) procurement approach. The strategy supports a concept in which NDI radios can be selected from a qualified vendor base and tailored to platform needs.  SANR capability deferment duration is TBD."
