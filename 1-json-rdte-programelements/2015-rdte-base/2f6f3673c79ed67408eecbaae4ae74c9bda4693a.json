            "val": "Aviation Systems Advanced Development:\nThis project provides for the development, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF specific avionics; Low Probability of Intercept\/Low Probability of Detection (LPI\/LPD) terrain following\/terrain avoidance radar; Defensive Countermeasures; Electronic Warfare (EW) - Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP) for AC-130W; AC-130H, AC-130W, and AC-130U Recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR); data fusion; threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection, and identification technologies; weapons integration; digital broadcast capabilities; aerial refueling; and ISR payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF ISR platforms. \n\nCV-22 Development:\nThe CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft. The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved capabilities in block increments. The funding in this project supports these block increments as well as associated flight test support. The Block 10 increment was completed in FY 2007, and the Block 20 increment started in FY 2008.  Block 10: Integrate and test Directional Infrared Countermeasures, a system that protects against infrared guided missiles; design, integrate and validate the Troop Commander Situational Awareness Station to provide the embarked troop commander access to the CV-22's communication, navigation and mission management system; relocate the ALE-47 chaff and flare dispenser control head to allow any cockpit crew member to activate defensive countermeasures; add a second forward firing chaff and flare dispenser to provide an adequate quantity of consumable countermeasures for the extended duration of SOF infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply missions; and incorporate a dual access feature to the Digital Map System to allow both the pilot and co-pilot to independently access and control the digital map display from the mission computer.\nBlock 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing.  This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance,  weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.\n\nMission Training and Preparation Systems:\nThe Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) project funds the definition, design, development, prototyping, integration, and testing of SOMPE systems to support mission planning and rehearsal  required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies in current mission planning and rehearsal capabilities. The MTPS project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse mission planning systems. \n\nAC\/MC-130J:\nThe AC\/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II, AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky airframes. The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the PSP to achieve the AC-130J configuration. These platforms perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; airdrop of leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft; and provide close air support, air interdiction, armed reconnaissance, escort, and force protection - integrated base defense. Additional capabilities include low-level navigation and in-flight refueling. The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM. An incremental upgrade approach will be used to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft.\n\nRotary Wing Aviation:\nThis project develops SOF-unique modifications and upgrades to SOF rotary wing aircraft that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A\/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters."

This\nis a capability not currently provided by existing aircraft. The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved capabilities in block increments supported with rapid\nprototyping. The funding in this project supports these block increments as well as associated flight test support. The Block 20 increment started in FY 2008.\n\nBlock 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous\ntesting. This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment, improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform."

The MTPS project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse SOF training systems.\n\nSub-projects include:\n\u2022 The Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) project develops, integrates, tests, and validates software enhancements required to meet SOF-unique requirements for, and correct deficiencies to, mission planning, preview, and execution software tools to support all phases of SOF operations from deliberate to time-critical. The SOMPE project automates time-sensitive planning activities and provides enhanced situational awareness during mission execution. SOMPE provides the interoperable environment for SOF adaptive planning to integrate global operations including, but not limited to, precision strike software, digital navigation, and unmanned aerial systems command and control. This project also provides the integration of SOMPE with multi-dimensional visualization systems, providing immersive mission rehearsal in minimal timeframes from the SOMPE mission plan. SOMPE is embedded in the USSOCOM Headquarters, Theater Special Operations Commands, Joint Special Operations Task Forces, Joint Special Operations Aviation Components, SOF warfighters, and SOF warfighter platforms."

The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J configuration. These platforms perform clandestine or low visibility, single- or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; airdrop leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft; and close air support (CAS), air interdiction, armed reconnaissance, escort, and force protection - integrated base defense. Additional capabilities include low-level navigation and in-flight refueling.  The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM. USSOCOM will then employ an incremental upgrade approach to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the Air Force-provided aircraft.\n\nConducts development, integration, and testing of aircraft enhancements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements. Enhancements include, but are not limited to, SOF communications, mission processors, aircraft performance enhancements, enhanced situational awareness (ESA), electronic warfare and survivability systems, and other SOF mission kits.

                            "val": "This project develops\/upgrades SOF rotary wing aircraft systems that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A\/MH-6M.  These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in world-wide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts, and they must be capable of rapid deployment; undetected penetration of hostile areas; and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  Sub-projects include:  \n\n\u2022  A\/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade is necessary to restore structural, performance, and safety margins for the aircrews.  An airframe structural modification will address recurring structural failures due to high intensity, high gross weight operations, and a decade of battle damage.  A main\/tail rotor drive train and engine control improvement efforts will reduce airframe loads and restore sufficient safety and performance margins.  An avionics upgrade Non-Developmental Item\/Commercial Off-the-Shelf will replace obsolescent components and provide improved battlefield situational awareness to the aircrews and customers necessary to support time sensitive mission requirements.  This upgrade is critical in keeping the A\/MH-6M aircraft operational through FY 2020 and beyond, or until a suitable replacement aircraft is available.  The non-recurring effort supports development, fabrication of test hardware, qualification of components and systems, and data items to support issuance of Government airworthiness releases for structural and software modifications.\n\n\u2022   MH-60 SOF Modernization program provides for the recurring\/non-recurring systems engineering and platform integration efforts, to include continued flight and qualification testing and test support.     \n\n\u2022   Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) solution will fuse information from currently fielded aircraft sensors with emerging technology to display real-time reference points, obstacles, and landing zone information to the aviator.  The DVE solution will provide MH-47\/60 aircrews with visual cues for obstacle avoidance and aircraft control during all phases of flight and significantly increase crew and passenger survivability in DVE such as dirt and snow.\n\n\u2022   Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program provides for the long-term replacement of an aging fleet of aircraft and provides a significant increase in range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and maintainability of vertical lift aircraft to meet emerging mission requirements.  USSOCOM will participate in the service-common development of a joint future vertical lift aircraft by injecting USSOCOM requirements and equities into the initial development and design efforts to minimize SOF-peculiar modifications to the common aircraft.\n\n\u2022   Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) program provides a low Space, Weight, and Power (SWaP) capability suitable for the A\/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB).  The IRCM program will develop, integrate, qualify, and test a complete lightweight IRCM system to include a missile warning system and countermeasure capability.  The A\/MH-6 is the only tactical aircraft in the U.S. Army inventory without protection from IR guided, and other advanced Man Portable Air Defense  missiles.\n\n\u2022   MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades program develops technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the Active Parallel Actuator System (APAS), Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), and Engine Barrier Filter.\n\n\u2022   Mission Processor Upgrade (MPU) program provides for non-recurring engineering, systems engineering\/testing, and future aircraft architecture studies that support the replacement and upgrade of the current mission and video processors for all Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA).  Upgrading all internal processors increases the processing power to support critical functionality and emerging technologies that will be integrated into the Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS). This MPU provides the processing and memory resources required to incorporate the following functions into the General Purpose Processing Unit (GPPU): (1) Global Air Traffic Management replaces ground-based navigation aids with a capability that meets the international requirement that all aircraft be compliant with digital and space-based navigation systems; (2) Situational Awareness for Safe Aircraft Recovery provides passive survivability for flight operations in all weather conditions by providing three-dimensional displays with flight path guidance to increase battle space awareness in zero-visibility conditions; (3) Cognitive Decision Aiding System fuses information on threat, route, weather, terrain, and friendly forces, instantaneously adjusting an aircraft\u2019s route to protect the flight crew in hazardous weather, low levels, and night conditions. This program is an FY 2015 new start.\n\n\u2022   Next Generation Forward Looking Infrared (NGFLIR) program is a pre-planned product improvement that incorporates a multispectral sensor (Shortwave Infrared, Image Intensifying TV, and Color Day TV) into the existing Q2 Electro-Optical Sensor System.  This will improve targeting, tracking, and aircrew situational awareness.  This program also maximizes the service life of the Q2 sensor by mitigating obsolescence and increasing functionality on the light and heavy assault platforms within the ARSOA fleet.  This program is an FY 2015 new start."

                            "val": "1. A\/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade comprises three major efforts:  airframe\/rotors, engine control, and cockpit.  The airframe\/rotors development effort will be a sole source contract to Boeing, who owns the technical data associated with the A\/MH-6 airframe.  The engine control work will be performed by Rolls-Royce and Goodrich Power and Engine Control under subcontract to Boeing.  As part of the airframe upgrade, the main and tail rotor blades are being replaced with one of several blades available off-the-shelf through a competitive evaluation.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins, with the intent to leverage the CAAS source code to the extent possible.  Any new hardware components will be NDI\/COTS and will be competitively selected.  The production software effort will be a Firm Fixed Price contract.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.\n\n2. MH-60M SOF Modernization Program supports the systems integration and qualification efforts on the prototype Block 1 MH-60M helicopter. This includes, but is not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation. Contractor flight test support will be conducted by Sikorsky Aircraft, while aircraft modification efforts will be performed at the SOFSA by the incumbent contractor.\n\n3. DVE - Effort will be a competitive source selection that will procure, integrate, and install components to provide real-time \u201csee through\u201d imagery and heads up display of visual cues for obstacle avoidance and landing zone information during all phases of flight.  DVE will increase MH-60 and MH-47 and customer survivability in degraded visual environments.\n\n4. FVL - This effort is the SOF aviation participation in the Joint FVL effort to develop the next generation of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft and establishes the foundation for the transformation of the DoD vertical lift Aviation capabilities over the next forty years.   \n\n5. IRCM - This program will be a competitive source selection effort that develops, integrates, and qualifies a mission configurable Missile Warning System (MWS) and IRCM capability which does not currently exist at a weight suitable for the A\/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB).  Special operations aviation requires the addition of IRCM to protect against increasingly proliferated and sophisticated infrared-guided weapons.   \n\n6. MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades - These efforts develop technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the APAS, ANC and Engine Barrier Filter.  The upgrades and modifications mostly consist of Government executed integration, testing and qualification efforts with some analytical engineering services to be completed.\n\n7. Mission Processor Upgrade (MPU) - The General Purpose Processing Unit (GPPU) non-recurring engineering (NRE) supports improvements to the video processing and Ethernet switch capabilities for Common Avionics Architecture System aircraft.  The engineering and testing will be sole source to Rockwell Collins, the OEM for the GPPU.  The DCU Modernization NRE will be used to improve analog-to-digital signal processing and reliability, as well as reduce weight.  The DCU efforts will be sole source to Sanmina SCI, the OEM for the DCU.  The Future Aircraft Architecture Studies will be competitively awarded.\n\n8. Next Generation Forward Looking Infrared (NGFLIR) - The NGFLIR integration of a multi-spectral sensor into the Q2 EOSS will be sole-source procurement through Raytheon.  As the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Raytheon maintains overall responsibility for the Q2 System, and will develop an acquisition strategy to develop, test, and integrate the multi-spectral sensor.  Raytheon is closely monitoring the joint TAPO\/Night Vision Electronic Sensors Directorate multi-spectral work, and is currently using Independent Research and Development to further mature that technology."
