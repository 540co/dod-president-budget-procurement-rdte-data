            "val": "Since 1986, the United States and the State of Israel have cooperated on missile defense. Currently Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has four major projects with Israel to develop and improve their indigenous capability to defend against short and medium range ballistic missiles. These include Upper Tier Interceptors (MD20), the Iron Dome Program (MD83), the Arrow Weapon System (MD26), and the Short-Range Ballistic Missile Defense, also known as the David's Sling Weapon System (MD34). Within these projects MDA develops and produces weapon systems, conducts tests, and exercises interoperability between U.S. BMDS and the Israeli Missile Defense Architecture. \n\nU.S.-Israel Cooperative Programs consist of the following major efforts: \n\nIsraeli Upper Tier Interceptor Project (UTI)(MD20):\nThe Upper Tier Program provides the Arrow 3 missile, increasing the system`s capability against advanced medium range threats by providing approximately four times the current Arrow-2 battle space. The primary near term objective is to complete and demonstrate Upper Tier design and continue acquisition for Long Lead Initial Lot Production (ILP) with first unit delivery in    FY 2016.\n\nIron Dome (ID)(MD83): \nIron Dome is a mobile all-weather air defense system developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. The system is designed to intercept and destroy short-range rockets and artillery shells whose trajectory would take them to a populated area.  \nFY 2014 funding is for non-recurring engineering costs in connection with the establishment of a capacity for co-production in the United States. Industry of the United States shall produce parts and components for the Iron Dome short-range rocket defense program. Congressional language also states \u201cThat funds made available under this provision for production of missiles and missile components may be transferred to appropriations available for the procurement of weapons and equipment, to be merged with and to be available for the same time period and the same purposes as the appropriation to which transferred: Provided further, That the transfer authority provided under this provision is in addition to any other transfer authority contained in this Act.\"\n\nIsraeli Arrow Weapon System (AWS)(MD26):\nThe Arrow System Improvement Program (ASIP) includes block upgrades to the Arrow Weapon System that enhances capabilities against more stressing evolving medium range threats by increasing the total defended area by approximately 50 percent. ASIP elements include the Arrow-2 missile and launcher, Citron Tree Battle Management Center (BMC), Green Pine (GP) and Super Green Pine (SGP) Radars, and the Hazelnut Tree Launcher Control Center (LCC). Also included is the integration of Block 5 assets which include the Arrow-3 missile and launcher. Arrow Block 5, under the ASIP agreement will also incorporate a Long Range Detection suite that consists of an unmanned aerial vehicle Airborne Early Warning System (ABEWS) and a S-Band Silver Oak radar for increased sensor range, early detection and enhanced raid size capacity. The program also includes the continued development of Arrow`s interoperability with U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS). Related activities include the Israeli Test Bed (ITB) and the Israeli Systems Architecture and Integration (ISA&I) study that assesses requirements and growth paths for the 2025 Israel Missile Defense Architecture. \n\nShort Range Ballistic Missile Defense (SRBMD)(MD34):\nSRBMD, also known as The David`s Sling Weapon System (DSWS), is designed to counter short range rockets and missiles and will be integrated into the Israeli Missile Defense Architecture adding another layer of defense to the current Arrow System. Block 1 capability will enhance the short range rocket and missile defense capability.  Block 2 will add capability to defend against medium range and cruise missiles. Block 3 will provide robust defense capability and add significant detection capability to the Israeli Air Defense Architecture The David`s Sling Weapon System (DSWS) includes the Stunner Interceptor, Missile Firing Unit (MFU), Multi-Mission Radar (MMR), Launch Site Controller (LSC) and the Golden Almond Battle Management Center (BMC). The near term objectives are completion of Block 1 development, demonstrate system capability and flight test, and procure material of Initial Lot Production (ILP) utilizing RDT&E funding and field the system to the Israeli Air Force for first unit delivery in 2015."

The Upper Tier Interceptor will enhance Israel's indigenous capability to defend against short and medium range ballistic missiles by increasing the battle space by a factor of four. The scope of the Upper Tier Program covers interceptor development, testing, material procurement to include initial lot production, and integration of spiral software development for Block 5 AWS. The United States through the cooperative effort gains knowledge and experience of the Israeli Defense Forces operation of a multi-layered defense architecture. This project also includes the procurement of the Silver Sparrow Air-Launched Target which is necessary to validate the performance of the Arrow 3 Missile and related Block 5 spiral development activities. \n\nThe Upper-Tier Interceptor Project Agreement was signed in 2010. This agreement states that the project will be jointly managed by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and the Israeli Missile Defense Organization. The agreement also documents the U.S.-Israeli cost share, in which the development costs will be equitable between the U.S. and Israel."

Also included is the integration of Block 5 assets which consists of the Arrow-3 missile, launcher and the Long Range Detection Suite (LRDS). The LRDS consists of an unmanned aerial vehicle Airborne Early Warning System (ABEWS) and an S-Band Silver Oak radar for increased sensor range and early detection and enhanced salvo engagement capability. The AWS provides Israel an indigenous capability to defend against short and medium range ballistic missiles. The ASIP effort will enhance the performance of the AWS to defeat longer-range and more robust ballistic missile threats expected to be introduced in the Middle East in the near future. ASIP elements include the Arrow-2 missile and launcher, Citron Tree Battle Management Center (BMC), Green Pine (GP) and Super Green Pine (SGP) Radars, and the Hazelnut Tree Launcher Control Center (LCC). The ASIP also ensures AWS interoperability via Joint Tactical Information Data System (JTIDS) Link-16 common communication architecture with the U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense System elements such as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), AEGIS, Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC), Army Navy\/Transportable Radar Surveillance and Control (AN\/TPY-2), and Phased Array Tracking Intercept of Target (PATRIOT) through ground tests, flight tests, and operational exercises.\n\nThe Israeli Test Bed (ITB) provides experiments to evaluate Human-In-The-Loop (HIL) battle management. Israeli Systems Architecture and Integration (ISA&I) conducts studies to assess Israel's future 2025 Missile Defense Architecture. The ITB and ISA&I efforts will continue to support AWS development as well as to define future missile defense architectures and growth paths."

The program funding is equitably funded between the U.S. and Israel with Israel providing matching contributions. However, a portion of the Israeli cost share comes from non-financial contributions such as previously completed work prior to joint program initiation. Contracts are awarded by IMoD or MDA dependent on what is most advantageous to the Joint Governments. In regard to Arrow System Improvement Program (ASIP), IMoD contracts on behalf of U.S. government with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). IAI subcontracts with Israeli and U.S. companies. For the Israeli Test Bed, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) contracts directly with Elbit Systems, Ltd. while IMoD provides an equitable share of the funding to the U.S. Finally, MDA contracts directly with WALES, Ltd for the Israeli System Architecture and Integration program."

The goal of the Israeli Short Range Ballistic Missile Defense (SRBMD) program is to provide an affordable SRBM and large caliber rocket defense capability. In March 2005 the U.S. and Israel initiated a joint feasibility study of a low-cost SRBMD capability that will  complement the existing Arrow Weapon System. The David's Sling Weapon System (DSWS) was selected in May of 2006. The current Program Agreement for Block 1 utilizes RDT&E funding to procure material for Initial Lot Production (ILP). Block 1 will provide capability against large caliber rockets and short range ballistic missiles. The DSWS is comprised of the Stunner Interceptor, Golden Almond Battle Management Center, the Multi-Mission Radar, Launch Site Controller and the Missile Firing Unit. \n\nUnder the U.S.-Israeli Project Agreement signed in September 2008. The DSWS Program is jointly managed by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and the Israeli Missile Defense Organization. Responsibilities and cost share are specified in the Project Agreement. Development costs are equitably shared between the U.S. and Israel."

The DoD U.S. Israeli Cooperative Program Office jointly manages the SRBMD program with IMoD to ensure that all systems are delivered on time, on budget, and meet the needs of the warfighter. The program is equitably funded between the U.S. and Israel. A portion of the Israeli cost share comes from non-financial contributions such as previously completed work prior to joint program initiation. Contracts are awarded by IMoD or MDA dependent on what is most advantageous to the Joint Governments.
