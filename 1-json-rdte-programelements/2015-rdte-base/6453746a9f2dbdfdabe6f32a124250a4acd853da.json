The goal of the F\/A-18 SLAP program is to identify critical structures and components that can achieve the extended service life limit goals.  SLAP consists of structural analyses of the main landing gear, arresting hook and catapult back-up structures, vertical tails, wings and fuselage. A second effort is to assess the subsystem components (hydraulics, wiring, actuators, etc) to identify over and above inspections, overhaul intervals or replacement schedules to fly past design of 6,000 hours.  The current life limits for the F\/A-18 E\/F are 6,000 Flight Hours (FH), 2,250 catapults\/arrestments (Cat\/Traps) and 15,750 total landings. The F\/A-18 SLAP program of record states the SLAP goals as 12,000 FH, 3,500 Cat\/Traps and 22,500 total landings. The primary objective of F\/A-18 SLAP is to determine if the stated SLAP goals are feasible.   An increase in total landings and flight hours would allow the F\/A-18 to meet CNO inventory requirements, to include planning for the announced one year Joint Strike Fighter slide. This effort is required to be conducted for these airframes and subsystems to ascertain what actions and modifications must be taken to safely operate each system beyond its designed life until the targeted end of service life."

These analyses will provide the raw engineering data to develop aircraft modifications to extend total aircraft landings, Cat\/Traps, and FH.  The F\/A-18 SLAP Program consists of two major engineering efforts: the aircraft structural assessment and the aircraft subsystems assessment.  Both efforts are broken into multiple phases which develop tools and models, assess current aircraft usage, and develop concepts to extend aircraft life to meet CNO objectives.  The program will combine exploitation of complete structural fatigue testing and actual fleet usage with the expectation of extending the service life of the F\/A-18 aircraft.  Conducting F\/A-18 SLAP to study the aircraft lifetime will provide a better estimate of aircraft service life and a follow on Service Life Extension Program (SLEP)."

This service life limit prevents the T-45 fleet from meeting Integrated Production Plan (IPP), previously Pilot Training Requirements, past 2025. Recent studies have determined that the fleet squadrons have not been flying the T-45 aircraft as aggressively as the initial fatigue studies predicted. These studies demonstrate that the 14,400 flight hour service life can likely be extended, with a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), to 21,600 flight hours, which will support meeting IPP until 2035. A T-45 Structural Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) was completed in February 2012.   The results are being used to provide guidance on what structural areas to SLEP. In order for the T-45 to meet IPP until 2035, it is also necessary to assess the sub-systems of the T-45 in their ability to remain viable.  Beginning in FY13, the T-45 sub-systems SLAP effort will assess the sub-system condition of the T-45 fleet in order to determine sub-system modifications and\/or redesign necessary to extend the aircraft designed service life to support IPP and Naval Flight Officer Training Requirements (NTR) until 2035. This sub-system assessment will be based on the updated fleet aircraft usage spectrum and future predicted training missions of the T-45 aircraft. The assessment will address all critical sub-systems required and their ability to maintain IPP\/NTR until 2035, analysis and studies will be conducted to outline improvements, assess manufacturing capabilities, prototype redesign and test of sub-systems for trainer aircraft. The original funding within the T-45 SLAP budget programmed for T-45 tail hook has been absorbed into the overarching SLAP effort due to the success of T-45 additional tail hook life extension efforts."
