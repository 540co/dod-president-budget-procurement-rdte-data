PBES will replace legacy systems such as as the Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment System (ABIDES) and the Resource Allocation Programming Information Decision System (RAPIDS) and will support the budget formulation and force programming process.\n\nPBES is leveraging existing authoritative data sources to provide needed capability in four (4) incremental releases rather than a single release.  Release capabilities are briefly described below.\nRelease 1 - Creating the baseline, service top line receipt and allocation, and submission of Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and President's Budget (PB).\nRelease 2 - Development of options after receiving the Service Top Line from OSD, as well as the integration of Resource  Management Decisions (RMDs).  The second release will also address  integrating Congressional marks prior to execution year fund  distribution.\nRelease 3 - Air Force cost modeling processes for civilian and military personnel, flying hours, and force structure data management.\nRelease 4 - capabilities include our justification book processes.\n\nThe PBES system is being developed to deliver a flexible programming and budgeting system that can keep up with the constantly changing budget requirements.  The PBES effort will be measured using established approved performance metrics which will create efficiencies and allow budget analysts more time to focus on analytical tasks aleviating manual entry, manual checks and balances, and greater flexibility which leads to the best decision making tools for leadership.\n\nThe PBES requirement is authorized per the SAF\/FM-approved 1 May 2013 PBES Problem Statement.\n\nProgram funding for FY 2016 and beyond is deferred at this time.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning."

These products will improve the quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of the acquisition program cost estimates required by statute (e.g., 10 USC 2366, 2433, 2434) and regulation (e.g., DoDI 5000.02) in support of Air Force and Department of Defense acquisition decisions, programming and execution decisions, and Congressional mandates.   \n\nThe Air Force has several requirements for research and development of new and modernized cost estimating capabilities for each weapon system type (aircraft, ballistic missiles, electronics and aircraft modifications, ground stations and automated information systems, cross cutting databases, satellites and launch vehicles, tactical missiles and munitions).  In addition, unanticipated requirements often emerge due to changing acquisition laws, regulations, initiatives; changing technologies; and evolving warfighter requirements which drive the need for cost tool updates or expanded capability.  For example, current shortfalls in capability reflect efforts needed to fill gaps in response to the laws and regulations such as the FY06 NDAA report {PL 109-163--Provisions relating to Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs)}, Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) {provisions related to improving cost estimating quality, especially earlier in the program life-cycle and affordability analysis}, Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) Acquisition Excellence Plan {priorities to improve cost estimating capability and affordability analysis and improved cost estimating support to requirements process}, and new Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) policy {better buying power initiatives on enhanced trade-off analysis, affordability analysis, and will versus should cost analysis}.   \n\nThis project will perform knowledge-based studies (KBS) analyzing historical data to produce cost estimate reviews (CERs) or statistical data that will inform a future decision to develop cost estimating databases, methods, and models across hundreds of product work breakdown structure (WBS) elements and functional cost elements within each weapon system type.  The different weapon system types are:  Aircraft, Ballistic Missiles,  Electronics and Aircraft Modifications, Ground Stations and Automated Information Systems (AIS), Cross-Cutting Databases, Satellite and Launch Vehicles (Space Systems), and Tactical Missiles and Munitions.  Some areas of cost modeling efforts that are cross-cutting within all weapon system types are:  cost risk metrics, methods development, statistical model enhancements; software cost database, metrics, statistical model development; contract or engineering change order analysis models; other government cost elements (e.g., program office manning, administration, government test); and commodity area price escalation analysis and models.\n\nThe CEM requirement is authorized per the 8 November 2013 Cost Estimating Modeling (CEM) Requirements Justification memo signed by Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Cost & Economics)."

DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). \n\nDEAMS Increment 2 (Inc 2) continues the DEAMS effort started by the DEAMS Inc 1 program and will further deploy the Air Force financial management solution, adding cost accounting, investment funds accounting, and time and labor accounting capabilities.  Completion and deployment of Release 1 will complete the FIAR requirement.  Release 2 will add Foreign Military Sales (FMS).\n\nDEAMS Inc 2 is planned as a two (2) Release program:\nRelease 1 - Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC).  Completes FIAR requirement.\nRelease 2 - Contingency Operations (CO) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS).\n\nDEAMS Inc 2 requirement is authorized per the June 2005 Business Enterprise Architecture Initial Capabilities Document as stated in Major Automated Information System (MAIS) Annual Reports.  DEAMS Inc 2 will complete the DEAMS effort initiated with DEAMS Inc 1.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program and execution and future program planning.\n\nThe overall DEAMS program is under review by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).  The acquisition and deployment strategy are expected to be adjusted to deploy the current software baseline to all Air Force locations and re-evaluate software upgrade scenarios.  Funding adjustments will be reflected in the FY16 President's Budget."

DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF).\n\nDEAMS Increment 1 (Inc 1) is planned as a six (6) Release program:\nRelease 1 - Air Mobility Command (AMC) without Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)\nRelease 2 - AMC with TWCF\nRelease 3 - Software Upgrades\nRelease 4 - USTRANSCOM Headquarters \nRelease 5 - USAF locations in Continental United States (CONUS)\nRelease 6 - USAF locations outside the CONUS (OCONUS)\n\nDEAMS Inc 1 capability is deployed and in use at seven locations:  Scott AFB, IL; Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)-Limestone, ME; McConnell AFB, IL; Dover AFB, DE; Grand Forks AFB, ND; Little Rock AFB, AR; and Pope Field, NC.  DEAMS Inc 1 is expected to be deployed to a number of additional locations throughout FY 2014-15.\n\nDEAMS Inc 1 capability will continue to be deployed to additional locations as approved by the Milestone Decision Authority.  The overall DEAMS program is under review by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).   The acquisition and deployment strategy are expected to be adjusted to deploy the current software baseline to all Air Force locations and re-evaluate software upgrade scenarios.  \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nDEAMS Inc 1 requirement is authorized per the June 2005 Business Enterprise Architecture Initial Capabilities Document as stated in Major Automated Information System (MAIS) Annual Reports.\n\nThe overall DEAMS program is under review by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).  The acquisition and deployment strategy are expected to be adjusted to deploy the current software baseline to all Air Force locations and re-evaluate software upgrade scenarios.  Funding adjustments will be reflected in the FY16 President's Budget."

The acquisition and deployment strategy are expected to be adjusted to deploy the current software baseline to all Air Force locations and re-evaluate software upgrade scenarios.  Funding adjustments will be reflected in the FY16 President's Budget.\n\nContracting adjustments are anticipated based on the results of the MDA's review of the overall DEAMS program."
