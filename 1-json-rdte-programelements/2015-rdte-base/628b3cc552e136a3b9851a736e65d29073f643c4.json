Sub-projects include:  \n\n\u2022  A\/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade is necessary to restore structural, performance, and safety margins for the aircrews.  An airframe structural modification will address structural failures due to high intensity, high gross weight operations, and a decade of battle damage.  A main\/tail rotor drive train and engine control effort will reduce airframe loads and restore sufficient safety and performance margins.  An avionics upgrade Non-Developmental Item\/Commercial Off-The-Shelf (NDI\/COTS) will replace obsolescent components and provide improved battlefield situational awareness to the aircrews and customers necessary to support time sensitive mission requirements. This upgrade is critical in keeping A\/MH-6M aircraft in the fight through the 2020\u2019s and likely beyond until a suitable replacement aircraft is available.  The non-recurring effort supports development, fabrication of test hardware, qualification of components and system data items to support issuance of Government airworthiness releases for structural and software modifications.\n\n\u2022   MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades program develops technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the Active Parallel Actuator System (APAS), Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), and Engine Barrier Filter.\n\n\u2022   MH-60 SOF Modernization program provides for the systems engineering and platform integration efforts, to include continued flight and qualification testing and test support.   \n\n\u2022   Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) solution will fuse information from currently fielded aircraft sensors with emerging technology to display real-time reference points, obstacles, and landing zone information to the aviator.  The DVE solution will provide MH-47\/60 aircrews with visual cues for obstacle avoidance and aircraft control during all phases of flight and significantly increase crew and passenger survivability in DVE such as dirt and snow."

The airframe\/rotors development effort will be a sole source contract to Boeing, who owns the technical data associated with the A\/MH-6 airframe.  The engine control work will be performed by Rolls-Royce and Goodrich Power and Engine Control under subcontract to Boeing.  As part of the airframe upgrade, the main and tail rotor blades are being replaced with one of several blades available off-the-shelf through a competitive evaluation.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins, with the intent to leverage the Common Avionics Architecture System source code to the extent possible.  Any new hardware components will be NDI\/COTS and will be competitively selected.  The production software effort will be a FFP contract.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.\n\n\u2022  MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades - These efforts develop technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the APAS, ANC, and Engine Barrier Filter.  This effort will consist mostly of Government executed integration, testing, and qualification efforts with some analytical engineering services to be procured.  Because of proprietary considerations, efforts may be directed to the original equipment manufacturer.  \n\n\u2022   MH-60M SOF Modernization Program - This supports the Systems Integration and Qualification efforts on the prototype MH-60M helicopter. This includes, but is not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation. Contractor Flight test support will be conducted at the SOFSA by the incumbent contractor.    \n\n\u2022   DVE - This effort integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in degraded visual environments.  A competitive source selection process will be conducted for the DVE solution which will procure, integrate and install components to provide real time \u201csee through\u201d imagery and heads up display of visual cues for obstacle avoidance and landing zone information during all phases of flight.  DVE will increase MH-60 and MH-47 aircrew and customer survivability in a DVE."
