Basic research sustains scientific and engineering communities in areas that form the critical technical underpinnings of DoD capabilities.  Basic research through exploration and discovery provides the unique means for disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military capabilities, strategy, and operations. \n\nThe Minerva Research Initiative is a university-based social science basic research program directed from within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and executed by the Services, consistent with the January 2012 priorities document \"Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense\" and the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) requirements.  This program seeks to build a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political forces that shape regions of the world of strategic importance to the United States.  Deeper understanding of the cultural and political environments where threats, such as radical actors and regime disruptions, develop supports more effective strategic and operational policy decisions.\n\nThe Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR) program funds initiatives to implement the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) strategic plan for defense basic research.  This plan defines specific and quantifiable actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of creating high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for DoD.  The SSBR initiatives support the five aims of: (1) providing scientific leadership; (2) attracting the Nation\u2019s best Scientists and Engineers (S&Es); (3) ensuring the coherence and balance of the Basic Research portfolio; (4) fostering connections between DoD performers and DoD; and (5) improving the efficiency of the defense research business environment.\n\nThe National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program supports world-class researchers in scientific areas of critical importance to DoD and ensures the cultivation of exceptional talent.  NSSEFF provides a critical resource for connections between academia and the DoD science and engineering enterprise.  Fellows\u2019 work spans all seven DoD S&T priorities and defines a broad set of emerging scientific areas.  Fellows serve as speakers at DoD events, reviewers on panels for DoD science, and as collaborators with DoD laboratory scientists and engineers."
