This mission directly reflects several national and Department of Defense level guidance\/vision documents to include the National Security Strategy, Unified Command Plan, National Strategy to Combat WMD, Counterproliferation Interdiction, National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, National Military Strategy, Global Development of Forces, Global Employment of Forces, National Military Strategy for Combating WMD, National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (including the Nuclear Annex), and Nuclear Posture Review.  To achieve this mission, DTRA has identified principal objectives along with strategies and tasks to ensure the objectives are met.  These objectives are:\n1)\tEnsure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent;\n2)\tAnticipate emerging WMD threats;\n3)\tProvide Counter WMD (CWMD) situational awareness;\n4)\tAssess infrastructure and personnel vulnerabilities;\n5)\tPrevent proliferation and use of WMD;\n6)\tDefend against WMD threats;\n7)\tDefeat WMD threats;\n8)\tRecover from WMD consequences;\n9)\tSynchronize countering WMD activities.\n\nThe Proliferation, Prevention, and Defeat program element reduces WMD proliferation and enhances WMD defeat capabilities through advanced technology development.  To accomplish this objective, eight project areas were developed: RA-Information Science and Applications, RE-Counter-Terrorism Technologies, RF-Detection and Forensics Technologies, RG-Defeat Technologies, RI-Nuclear Survivability, RM-WMD Counterforce Technologies, RR-Combating WMD Test and Evaluation, and RT-Target Assessment Technologies.  These projects support technology requirements in line with the Joint Functional Concepts (Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01)."

The increase in FY 2015 from the previous President's Budget Submission is a result of the net effect of decreased investments in nuclear detection, nuclear treaty technology, counter-terrorism\/counterproliferation support and reachback tools and increased investment in the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize, and assess technologies in RT-Target Assessment Technologies.  This project has the only identified solution capable of meeting a time sensitive, mission critical technology gap.  Reduced investment impacted RA-Information Science and Applications, RE-Counter Terrorism Technologies, RF-Detection and Forensics Technologies, RG-Defeat Technologies, and RI-Nuclear Survivability."

The Technical Reachback effort provides 24 hour\/7 days per week information and analyses on potential impacts of a WMD event to Warfighters and First Responders in consult with DTRA\u2019s Combating WMD Research and Development subject matter experts. This effort develops and integrates capabilities and processes to support WMD effects and consequences, to include secondary and tertiary effects.  This project also provides support to international CWMD science and technology cooperation by developing modifications, improvements, or new technologies and information tools suitable for foreign release and cooperative efforts. Further, this project provides the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) on-site support to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers, Europe (SHAPE) with a current primary focus on support to U.S. European Command (USEUCOM), NATO, and SHAPE in combating WMD and maintaining the NATO nuclear deterrent.  A significant element of this project includes support to Command Elements and the warfighting Combatant Commands (COCOMs) on strategies for reducing\/countering the WMD threat in the COCOMs Areas of Responsibility.  This project also provides for the solution to the Secretary of Defense mandate for DTRA to account, maintain, report, and track the National Nuclear Weapons Stockpile & Nuclear Weapon-Related Materiel during peacetime, crisis, and wartime.  In support of national requirements necessary to maintain a viable nuclear deterrent, the Defense Integration and Management of Nuclear Data Services provides a platform to ensure continued sustainability and viability of the nuclear weapons stockpile.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the consolidation of Reachback Support operations in Project RM - WMD Counterforce Technologies in Program Element (PE) 0603160BR and increased investment in research and development analysis support funded by a transfer from PE 0602718BR.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to the completion of efforts in building partner capacity development activities."

This project supports Joint U.S. Military Forces, and in particular, the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  This research and development support directly enhances USSOCOM, the highest priority mission areas in the National Security Strategy, the National Strategy to Combat WMD, the National Military Strategy to Combat WMD, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the Guidance on the Employment of the Force, and is therefore a high priority for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).  The following efforts are included in this project:\n\nThe Counter WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) Counterproliferation (CP) research and development program is a collaborative effort with USSOCOM where the DTRA manages and sub-allocates funding directly to USSOCOM to develop warfighter-unique technologies in support of USSOCOM\u2019s Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation (CT\/CP) mission.  New CT\/CP technologies are developed under USSOCOM management that provides warfighters with the operational capability to counter WMD threats.\n\nThe Counter WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) technologies program builds upon collaborative efforts with the warfighter.  This program develops proofs of concept and subsequent advancements in research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) and provides multi-mission capabilities that may be applied throughout the entire spectrum of warfare while significantly eliminating collateral damage.  The CWMD-T technologies program develops technologies to enable the warfighter to locate, identify, characterize, and access Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) WMDs, their production and storage facilities, and associated enablers along multiple nodes concurrently or simultaneously within the terrorist pathway to disrupt, delay, degrade, destroy, or deny WMDs while minimizing risk to U.S. forces in support of CT\/CP offensive operations.\n\nThe USSOCOM Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction \u2013 Terrorism Support Program (SCSP) addresses Commander USSOCOM responsibilities under the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Unified Command Plan (UCP) for integrating and synchronizing operations and activities to prevent terrorists from developing, acquiring, proliferating, or using WMD.\n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to increased investment in CWMD-T support to USSOCOM in FY 2014 for planned high fidelity CWMD test article development and testing and increased capabilities to address CWMD information gaps. The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominantly due to reduced investment in CWMD-T support to USSOCOM due to planned efficiencies in tool and application developments to counter WMD upstream defeat efforts."

This project researches, develops, demonstrates, and transitions advanced technologies to improve operational capabilities to detect and identify nuclear and radiological weapons.  It supports the attribution process through development, demonstration, and transition of improved post-detonation National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) capabilities in the areas of materials collection, debris diagnostics and materials analysis, and prompt diagnostics and device reconstruction.  Efforts under this project also support international peacekeeping and nonproliferation objectives, on-site and aerial inspections and monitoring, on-site sampling and sample transport, and on- and off-site analysis to meet forensic, verification, monitoring, and confidence-building requirements.\n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the relative effect of Congressional reductions in FY 2013 causing decreased investment in radiation detection.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominantly due to reduced investment in novel advanced nuclear\/radiological detection technologies and emerging requirements in support of nuclear treaties implementation."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of advanced technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems or rapid WMD elimination capabilities that are most relevant to the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) WMD Defeat Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and their Area of Responsibility (AOR).  This program includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation (DT&E) of next-generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved based on this technology.  The program is addressing defeat of adversaries' offensive WMD programs through integration of current conventional weapons capabilities and next generation kinetic and non-kinetic solutions to provide full-spectrum asymmetric defeat options.  The program addresses requirements delineated in the Quadrennial Defense Review and Strategic Planning Guidance as codified in the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), Service requirements documents, and COCOM and Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Counter-WMD (C-WMD) capability.\n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to increased investment in C-WMD Hard Target Defeat (HTD) Weapons Technologies efforts in FY 2014.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominantly due to reduced investment in Next Generation C-WMD Weapon Concept research and demonstration of select technologies."

This program develops and demonstrates radiation-hardened, high performance prototype microelectronics to support the availability of RHM and photonics for DoD missions from both private sector and government organizations. \n\nMighty Guardian Force-on-Force Tests aid in satisfying requirements for the Services by providing denial of access to nuclear resources in all environments: operational, storage and in transit.  The results of the evaluations identify security vulnerabilities to weapons systems that are then addressed through targeted application of research and development projects requested by the resource owners.  These projects are designed to demonstrate, test, and evaluate security enhancement systems prior to service procurement.\n\nNuclear Weapons Surety, as tasked by the DoD Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program, provides Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Services, and Joint Chiefs of Staff with technical analyses, studies, research, and experimental data necessary to identify and quantify risks of plutonium dispersal and Loss of Assured Safety due to accidents, fires, or natural causes during peacetime operations of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapon systems.  Additionally, this will provide studies necessary to quantify the probability of success against targeted terrorist attacks on DoD facilities, while leveraging these risk assessment advances.  It also provides new and innovative technologies for the protection of nuclear resources in support of COCOMs and Services.  \n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the relative impact of Congressional reductions to nuclear surety in FY 2013.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is predominately due to the net impact of increased investment in stockpile logistics and decreased investment in nuclear surety in FY 2015."

This activity specifically focuses on three critical components in countering the WMD threat: (1) end-to-end planning capabilities; (2) emerging\/innovative technologies; and (3) Technical Reachback support.\n\nDeveloping end-to-end planning capabilities includes: weaponeering tools to aid the Combatant Command's (COCOM) targeting and weapons officers in choosing the proper weapon, fuze, and employment parameters to optimize the defeat of WMD and related hard targets delivering modernized, validated and fast running attack planning tools, and integrating software.  Leveraging attack planning tools to support force protection planners and vulnerability assessment teams.\n\nEmerging\/innovative technologies are developed, integrated, demonstrated and transitioned to provide the warfighter with an enhanced near real-time combat and battle damage assessment capability.  Capability is achieved through the development of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and weapon-based sensors, platforms, taggants, seekers and other innovative technologies to:  remotely sense, identify, track and target WMD-related threats; perform battle damage assessment\/indication of strikes against these threats; and locate, track, collect, detect, selectively identify, and characterize Chemical Weapon and Biological Weapon aerosol agents released during these WMD counterforce strikes.\n\nThe Technical Reachback support provides 24 hour\/7 days per week information and analyses on potential impacts of a WMD event to Warfighters and First Responders in consult with DTRA\u2019s Combating WMD Research and Development subject matter experts.  This effort develops and integrates capabilities and processes to support WMD effects and consequences, to include secondary and tertiary effects.  \n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to increased investment in WMD Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance activities and the consolidation of Reachback support operations from Project RA-Information Science and Applications."

It may be possible or preferable, to achieve operational objectives by denying or disrupting the mission or function of the target facility.  Functional defeat, however, requires extensive and highly detailed analysis of the target.  The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining its vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and if necessary, suppressing reconstitution efforts and re-attacking the facility.  Target Assessment Technologies develops for the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) and the Intelligence Community (IC), the analytical tools and processes required to find and characterize WMD targets and HDBTs and then, in near-real-time, assess the results of attacks against those targets.  Overall objectives are to develop new methodologies, processes and technologies for detecting, locating, identifying, physically and functionally characterizing, modeling, and assessing new and existing hard and deeply buried targets to support physical or functional defeat.  Applying these processes to WMD time-dependent target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge.  The Target Assessment Technologies project is meeting this challenge through three subordinate and related activities: (1) Targeting and Intelligence Community Technologies Development; (2) Find, Characterize, Assess Technologies Development; and (3) Counter-WMD Analysis Cell (C-WAC) Technologies Development.\n\nThis program supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threat priority\/focus areas 3) Capability Expansion and 4) Leveraging Science.  The Counter WMD Analysis Cell (C-WAC) Technologies Development program has cooperative Research and Development projects with the United Kingdom and Commonwealth nations.  The C-WAC project is also developing the Bio Dual-Use Analytical Tool as an aid in discriminating the employment of dual use technologies in the disguised development of bio warfare capabilities.\n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the relative impact of Congressional reductions in FY 2013 impacting the Counter-WMD Analysis Cell (C-WAC).  The increase from FY 2014 to FY2015 is due to increased investment in the development and integration of high-priority find, characterize and assess sensor technologies and supporting algorithms and software. This project has the only identified solution capable of meeting a time sensitive mission critical technology gap."
