            "val": "This project provides for the identification, study, design, development, demonstration, test, evaluation, and qualification of standard avionics capabilities for Navy use, and wherever practicable, use across all Services and Foreign Military Sales.  Such air combat electronics developments include communications and airborne networking, navigation and sensors, flight avionics, safety systems, and flight mission information systems for both forward fit and retrofit aircraft. These efforts continue to maintain federated systems while encouraging transition of procurements to support a modular system for enhanced performance and affordability.  Consideration is given up front to reduce acquisition costs through larger procurement quantities that satisfy multi-aircraft customer requirements and that reduce life cycle costs in the areas of reliability, maintainability, and training.  This project also provides a Navy-wide program to develop required calibration standards (hardware) in all major measurement technology areas in support of Navy Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&E) systems as well as Navy Weapons systems, ground and air, throughout the Fleet.  It funds Navy lead-service responsibilities in the Department of Defense and Joint Services Metrology Research and Development program.  This project supports the military requirement to verify the performance of all test systems used to validate the operation of HM&E as well as Navy Weapon Systems with calibration standards traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION because it includes those projects that have passed Milestone B approval and are conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirement prior to full-rate production decision."

Evaluation of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B (Out)) technologies\/develop solutions to support platform integrations delayed after 1Q\/14 due to FY14 Congressional Reductions.  Will resume 1Q\/16 to incorporate ISSUE# 51203 efforts to evaluate updates to Federal Avaiation Administration ADS-B (Out) mandate.  CH-53K and E-2D ADS-B (Out) test and evaluation efforts added 1Q\/16 to 4Q\/18.\n\nTactical Communications - Crypto Algorithm Assess\/Dev line extended through 4Q\/14 to address National Security Agency (NSA) specification change and addition of Tactical Secure Voice 2. Added a new line for 1Q\/17 to 2Q\/19 labeled \"Crypto Engine Design\". This addresses a solution change to develop\/embed a Fixed Point Gate Array based crypto engine in the Gen5 radio meeting NSA requirements.  Under the software (S\/W) release milestones, removed the release numbers.  The numbers previously reflected the base radio release last digit of the part number. The numbers are not appropriate since they are changed when a nomenclature change occurs. It is best to just indicate the release event and eliminate the confusion if the number was included.  Joint Interoperability Test Command and NSA certifications were added\/adjusted to reflect test and evaluation events. Production Milestone S\/W release events were adjusted to reflect a refined schedule.   \n   \nGround Proximity Warning System\/Terrain Awareness Warning System (GPWS\/TAWS) - Milestone B schedule delayed 3Q\/13 to 3Q\/14 due to Platform Integration contract award date (they are combining TAWS II platform integration with Communication Navigation Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management software development efforts (Required Navigation Performance Area Navigation and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (Out)) and to align with the completion of technical evaluation for combined Lockheed Martin Services, Inc. integration contract. H-1 GPWS S\/W Development extended to 4Q\/13 due to need for second deficiency correction build for GPWS S\/W.  H-1 GPWS Development Test extended to 1Q\/15 due to need to test the second deficiency correction build for GPWS S\/W and meet H-1 Software Configuration Set 7.0 platform Operational Flight Plan delays.  H-60 Terrain Awareness Warning System II (TAWS II) software development extended to 4Q\/15 to align with platform System Configuration 17 schedule milestones.  H-60 TAWS II Development Test adjusted to align with platform System Configuration 17 schedule milestones was 3Q\/15 to 3Q\/16 now 2Q\/16 to 2Q\/17.   \n\nMilitary Flight Operations Quality Assurance - Phase 2 Fielding Decision moved from 2Q\/16 to 4Q\/15 and Phase 2 squadron deliveries of MH-60R\/S, CH-53E and AH-1Z\/UH-1Y moved from 3Q\/16 to 4Q\/15 due to lessons learned during Phase 1 testing resulting in a shift of Phase 2 test and evaluation efforts.\n\nCollaborative Warfare - Changed Title of Flex 13 to TRIDENT WARRIOR 13 in FY13.  Changed title Next Gate 1 Resource Requirement Review Board (R3B) to Tactical Networking Requirements R3B and adjusted 4Q\/13 to 2Q\/14 due to re-scope of effort to include broader requirements solicited from analysis such as the Joint Tactical Networking Concept of Employment and fleet needs such as Integrated Priority Lists and Urgent Operational Needs.  Added TRIDENT WARRIOR 15 to schedule to demonstrate the military utility of a netted sensors Family of Systems as an evolution of TRIDENT WARRIOR 13.  It will use Common Operating Environments to run collaborative multi-intelligence correlation software across platforms and domains to enhance targeting capabilities.  Added Naval Aviation Tactical Networking Requirements in order to align with requirements strategy.\n\nMid Air Collision Avoidance Capability - FY14 Congressional Reduction resulted in the following schedule changes: Analysis of Alternatives complete in 1Q\/15, Materiel Development Decision\/Acquisition Strategy Review from 3Q\/14 to 2Q\/15, Capability Development Document complete from 1Q\/14 to 1Q\/16, removal of Pre-Engineering, Manufacturing and Development phase, Milestone B from 3Q\/14 to 2Q\/16, Milestone C from 1Q\/18 to 1Q\/19, Specification Review Board, System Readiness Review, and System Functional Review from 2Q\/14 to 2Q\/15, Preliminary Design Review from 4Q\/14 to 3Q\/15, Critical Design Review from 1Q\/15 to 2Q\/16, Software Design and Development from 4Q\/14 to 3Q\/15, Platform Integration and Test Support from 1Q\/15 to 3Q\/15, MH-60R\/S integration from 1Q\/15 to 1Q\/16, UH-1Y\/AH-1Z integration from 4Q\/15 to 3Q\/16, added F\/A-18 integration in 3Q\/18, MH-60R\/S test and evaluation from 1Q\/16 to 1Q\/17, UH-1Y\/AH-1Z test and evaluation from 1Q\/17 to 1Q\/18, and added F\/A-18 in 3Q\/19.\n\n2311: Acquisition Milestone Changes:\n\nDue to funding reductions in FY13, the Weaponeering and Stores Planning (WASP) product development, testing, and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) schedules for V3.2, and all versions thereafter, have been delayed. \n\nV3.2 Milestones were adjusted accordingly: Software Requirements Review (SRR) from 4QFY13 to 2QFY14, Preliminary Design Review (PDR) from 1QFY14 to 3QFY14, Critical Design Review (CDR) from 1QFY14 to 3QFY14, Test Readiness Review (TRR) from 3QFY14 to 1QFY15, Technical Information Review Board (TIRB) from 1QFY15 to 2QFY15, Functional Qualification Test (FQT) from 1QFY15 to 2QFY15, Test & Evaluation (T&E) from 3QFY14 to 1QFY15, and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) from 3QFY15 to to 1QFY16. \n\nV3.3 Milestones were adjusted accordingly: SRR from 1QFY15 to 3QFY15, PDR from 2QFY15 to 4QFY15, CDR from 2QFY15 to 4QFY15, TRR from 4QFY15 to 2QFY16, TIRB from 2QFY16 to 4QFY16, FQT from 2QFY16 to 4QFY16, T&E from 4QFY15 to 2QFY16, and IOC from 3QFY16 to 2QFY17. \n\nV4.0 Milestones were adjusted accordingly: SRR from 2QFY16 to 1QFY17, PDR from 3QFY16 to 2QFY17, CDR from 3QFY16 to 2QFY17, TRR from 1QFY17 to 3QFY17, TIRB from 3QFY17 to 1QFY18, FQT from 3QFY17 to 1QFY18, T&E from 1QFY17 to 3QFY17, and IOC from 4QFY17 to 3QFY18. \n                                 \nV4.1 Milestones were adjusted accordingly: SRR from 3QFY17 to 2QFY18, PDR from 4QFY17 to 3QFY18, CDR from 4QFY17 to 3QFY18, TRR from 2QFY18 to 1QFY19, TIRB from 4QFY18 to 3QFY19, FQT from 4QFY18 to 3QFY19, T&E from 2QFY18 to 1QFY19, and IOC from 1QFY19 to 1QFY20."

Stop operating and sustainment cost growth by reducing costs for fielded systems and implementing life-cycle cost reduction initiatives as part of new systems development.  This program positions resources for next year application to fast-track corrections to existing problematic systems. Projects address critical readiness issues (significant back-orders or impending sustainability failures that threaten to down aircraft), functional performance obsolescence issues (system failing to support mission requirement), and top sustainment cost drivers (out of proportion annual maintenance or repair costs). Resources enable design and development of technology insertion and product redesign or replacement to meet readiness goals, meet mission objectives, or reduce overall sustainment costs. Candidate projects are submitted via a rigorous template, reviewed by a panel of Avionics professionals, and selected based upon urgency, warfighting contributions, breadth of application and scope of Return On Investment. Resources cover non-recurring engineering elements (including design and development, prototypes, platform integration, test and evaluation), program management and associated logistics elements (including technical data preparation, support equipment, provisioning, and training). Analysis shows that funding applied under this program between 2006 and 2011 will enable sustainment and procurement cost avoidances exceeding a five to one margin by 2020."

Tactical Communications is utilizing a firm fixed price contract to Rockwell Collins for research and development of the ARC-210 Gen 5 and other Navy contract vehicles for integration studies.  The Navy will integrate systems and components to satisfy platform requirements to achieve tactical communication capability as determined by analyses. Ground Proximity Warning System\/Terrain Awareness Warning System Software Modules will be developed by a Government Software Product Team in collaboration with Industry where required.  Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) Government activities include integrating a combination of existing aircraft hardware, ground support equipment, Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS), government off the shelf hardware and software products.  MFOQA program interfaces will be created to share data captured by the automated maintenance systems (e.g., Automated Maintenance Environment, Health and Usage Monitoring Systems) and existing databases.  The Navy conducted a full and open competition for the MFOQA software development, integration and support contract as well as the COTS software data analysis product.  Follow-on Sole Source Product Contracts will be awarded to complete MFOQA development, as required. Avionics Component Improvement Program (AvCIP) will annually review, compete and select candidate component improvement proposals according to urgency, criticality of warfighting contributions, technical risk, breadth of application, and scope of Return On Investment (ROI). Projects are selected by a panel of Avionics management experts, including representatives from OPNAV N98, NAVAIR, NAVICP, and the Fleet. Projects are executed by managers in platform or commodity offices that own the component. The AvCIP program management team manages project selection, allocates funds, monitors multiple project executions against proposed spend plans, and tracks solution performance and achievement of projected ROI's over time using Fleet maintenance and component performance databases. Cost avoidances are coordinated with OPNAV N98 to balance Flying Hour Program costs. Component improvement solutions include modular hardware, software and material upgrades. Resources cover engineering elements (including design and development, prototypes, platform integration, test and evaluation), program management and associated logistics elements (including technical data preparation, support equipment, provisioning, and training).  Advanced Digital Data Set will award a contract(s) to Industry for the development and procurement of enabling hardware and software in collaboration with platform program offices utilizing competitive methods wherever possible.  Mid Air Collision Avoidance Capability (MCAC) is the capability umbrella which encompasses all systems designed and developed which aid in air-to-air collision avoidance.  Systems include but are not limited to Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems and Mid Air Collision Avoidance Systems.  Mid Air Collision Avoidance Capability Software Modules will be developed by a Government Software Product Team in collaboration with Industry where required.  Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) will provide acquisition strategy guidance and support to platforms implementing the FACE Technical Standard to address open architecture requirements."

It funds Navy unique and lead service responsibilities in DoD and Joint Services Metrology Research Programs to develop calibration solutions.  The line supports development of measurement requirements to verify performance of all test systems used to validate the operation of Navy weapon Systems with calibration standards traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology to calibrate, sustain and ensure performance accuracy.\n\nThis program also provides benefits and efficiencies in a joint collaborative environment within the Tri-Services.  Projects are identified and defined so that they will meet the universal requirement.  Development efforts are integrated in order to achieve the common capabilities required at minimum cost.  This is also a regular and common business practice within the Navy Metrology Community where R&D efforts are communicated and integrated into the multiple testing and Monitoring Systems.

WASP is approved by Air Warfare Division (N98) as a flight clearance implementation system for the F\/A-18 A, A+, B, C, D, D (RC), E, F; and EA-18G.  WASP components will alert pilots if their planned weapon release conditions meet flight clearance limits, will result in bomb-to-bomb collisions, bomb-to-aircraft collisions, aircraft overstress, or excessive risk of aircraft loss\/damage in the event of fuze early bursts. Weapon employment planning is fundamental to the Joint Capability Area of Force Application and joint mission areas of Strike and Amphibious Warfare.  WASP provides the Navy and Marine Corp with weaponeering capabilities that are critical requirements for Interdiction, Armed Reconnaissance and Close Air Support mission planning.  Therefore, WASP product availability is critical to successful employment of the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS)  for the F\/A-18 A-F and EA-18G.  The WASP product encompasses a multitude of Government Furnished Information software components and tools (aircraft target maneuver simulations, weapon flyout models, target probability of damage calculators).  WASP products will require updates as emergent requirements for new aircraft T\/M\/S, stores and weapons are approved, and new flight clearances and flight restrictions are issued by Naval Air Systems Command Headquarters (NAVAIRSYSCOM)."
