Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  The systems developed  and tested in this line item are Hostile Forces - Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (HF-TTL);  Integrated Survey Program (ISP);  Counter-Proliferation Analyses and Planning System (CAPS);  Joint Threat Warning System (JTWS);  National Systems Support to SOF (NSSS);  and Special Operations Tactical Video System (SOTVS).\n\nU.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.  The intelligence programs funded in this project will meet annual emergent requirements and are grouped by the level of organizational element they support: Operational Element (Team) and Above Operational Element (Garrison).    \n\nOPERATIONAL ELEMENT (TEAM)    \n\n\u2022   NSSS.  This program provides a research and development rapid prototyping capability which functions as HQ SOCOM's Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities program.  NSSS improves the combat effectiveness of USSOCOM, its components, and the Theater Special Operations Commands by leveraging National Agency and Service development efforts to provide innovative space-based intelligence systems technologies and enhancements, products and special communications capabilities to tactical SOF units, to include field-deployed signal intelligence (SIGINT) and communications systems such as the Firefly SIGINT and Rapid Reliable Targeting (RRT) geo-location payload and future Friendly Force Trackers (FFT).  Similarly, the Enhanced Software-Defined Radio Tag effort will provide a unique, mission-relevant and globally flexible field device which will provide tactical forces the ability to clandestinely tag and persistently track almost any target, using multiple National Theater and Tactical collection platforms.\n\n\u2022   JTWS.  This program  is an evolutionary acquisition (EA) effort that provides threat warning, force protection, enhanced situational awareness, and target identification\/acquisition information to SOF via signal intercept, direction finding and SIGINT.  JTWS will employ continuing technology updates to address the changing threat environment.  SOF SIGINT operators are globally deployed and fully embedded within Special Operations teams and aircrews in every operational environment.  This state-of-the-art technology enables SOF operators to provide critical time-sensitive targeting and actionable intelligence to the operational commander during mission execution.  Intelligence derived from operations supports campaign objectives and the National Military Strategy.  This system has variants that utilize common technologies and interfaces allowing operators to task, organize, and scale equipment based on anticipated signal environments and areas of operation.  Variants will be modular; lightweight with minimal power requirements; and configurable to support body worn\/mobile or static, air, maritime and precision geo-location operations in support of all SOF missions.  Each variant, except static, will be capable of operation by a single trained operator.  The four variants are Ground SIGINT Kit (GSK) Bodyworn\/Mobile and Team Transportable (GSK static), Air, Maritime, and Precision Geo-Location (Ground and Air).\n\n\u2022   HF-TTL.  This program utilizes a commodity procurement strategy to provide SOF warfighters with the necessary tools to find, fix, and finish terrorist networks through the emplacement of sophisticated tags and devices that feed into an integrated architecture.  HF-TTL provides Regional Combatant Commanders and SOF operators with an immediate capability to tag, track, and locate people, things, and activities.  The HF-TTL program provides actionable intelligence for SOF planners.  The Mission Sets are comprised of a mix of different classes of tags and their associated detection, interrogation, viewing, tracking, and communications systems that are fielded annually to SOF Components and Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOC) based upon dynamic and emergent SOF operational requirements.  \n\n\u2022  SOTVS.  This program employs an evolutionary strategy to meet SOF reconnaissance and surveillance mission requirements. The program consists of a family of interoperable digital commercial-off-the-shelf systems to capture and transfer near-real time day\/night tactical ground imagery utilizing SOF organic radios and global C4I infrastructure.  The program provides the capability to forward imagery in near-real time via current or future communication systems (i.e., land-line, High Frequency, Very High Frequency, and Satellite Communications radios) in support of surveillance and reconnaissance missions. This man-packable tactical system consists of digital still cameras, camcorders, ruggedized laptop computers with image manipulation software and data controller. \n\nABOVE OPERATIONAL ELEMENT (GARRISON)  \n\n\u2022   CAPS.  Department of Defense (DoD) has a planning mission for counter-proliferation (CP) contingency operations.  CAPS has been identified by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) as the standard CP planning tool set for DoD. U.S. Strategic Command serves as the coordinator for CAPS requirements.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency provides science and technology expertise and integration support to enhance CAPS capabilities.  CAPS provides tools and assessments to DoD and SOF mission planners to aid in worldwide identification and analysis of suspected weapons of mass destruction and potential targets; assesses the associated effectiveness, costs and risks of various CP options and their collateral effects; and develops alternative plans.  CAPS is a primary source of CP mission planning information for Combatant Commanders who are the principal customers.  CAPS requires ongoing development, integration and testing of leading edge technology for operational planning and processes in order to provide the best possible engineering analysis and to support consequence engineering to meet changing threats.   CAPS program funding and responsibility transferred to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for consolidation and interface with DIA's Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Analysis Cell in FY 2014.\n\n\u2022   ISP.  This program supports Joint Chiefs of Staff contingency planning.  ISP collects and produces current, detailed, tactical planning data to support military operations to counter threats against US citizens, interests, and property located both domestic and overseas.  ISP products are specifically tailored packages that reflect unevaluated operational information as well as intelligence data for use by DoD and DoS to support operational planners for Counter-Terrorism operations, evacuations, and other rescue missions."
