The program provides F-16 Block 50\/52 and Block 40\/42 aircraft with the ability to employ the AN\/ASQ-213 Pod. With the introduction of HTS Revision 7 (HTS R7) in 2007, the AN\/ASQ-213 Pod now has a precision geo-location capability to target Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) to destroy fixed and mobile enemy air defense elements.  Additionally, by relocating the AN\/ASQ-213 HTS R7 Pod to the aircraft's left inlet hard point, the F-16 can simultaneously carry the HTS R7 Pod and an Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). HTS R7 fielding is complete and represents the Air Force's near-term solution for reactive time critical targeting for DEAD until this mission can be transferred to F-35 or a yet to be defined system. HTS R7 derived precision targeting data can be provided to all Joint Forces via Link-16. This effort continues preplanned product improvements (P3I) for the HTS and applies technologies similar to those demonstrated in the Advanced Tactical Targeting Technologies (AT3) program and HTS R7 development. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
