ATC systems are required to achieve or maintain compliance with civil, military, domestic and international air traffic control mandates and combat identification requirements.  Funding will be utilized to develop, evaluate and integrate technologies required to support ATC requirements.  Efforts funded include the Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS) Web Based Architecture and Airspace Improvements Initiative, Air Traffic Navigation Integration and Coordination System (ATNAVICS) Modernization, Advanced Surveillance, the development of an ATC Tactical Network, and Tactical Terminal Control System (TTCS) modernization. \n\nTAIS, the Airspace Management System of the Army Mission Command System, requires the development and testing of web-based services for Airspace Control, and integration of these new web-based services into the TAIS common Army Mission Command hardware, Air Traffic Services (ATS) and Airspace Integration Improvement Initiatives.  Additional capabilities will be provided through advanced surveillance interfaces, mission planning interfaces, and TAIS dynamic airspace updates to the cockpit.  TAIS efforts also include developing and testing improvements to the air picture including the addition of Blue Force Tracker correlation and radar fusion capability.  TAIS develops software and required hardware for airspace management web services, to operate effectively in a dynamic net-centric interconnected environment.  TAIS also integrates advanced surveillance interfaces to further enhance airspace integration and dynamic management capabilities.  ATNAVICS provides all weather instrument flight capabilities to include, terminal, radar precision approach and landing services to all Army, Joint, and Allied aircraft. ATNAVICS will integrate Mode S capabilities required to control aircraft both OCONUS and CONUS.  ATNAVICS will network its radar picture and advanced surveillance data (Mode 5 and Mode S) to aviation and joint network nodes through TAIS.  As the Department of Defense transitions military aircraft to positional self-reporting technologies, these various technologies will be incorporated in the Advanced Surveillance program.  Advanced Surveillance allows ATC reception of aircraft self-reporting data which include Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), Mode 5 and Mode S.  Advanced Surveillance integrates local radar feeds and self-reporting aircraft positional data into a correlated air situational awareness picture.  ATC Tactical Networking supports the non recurring engineering, test and evaluation tasks necessary for the integration of the radios, control stations and transmitter\/receivers and software that will provide all ATC tactical systems an airfield network node capability.  This will enable each ATC system to send voice and data between ATC platforms including connectivity to an external network for long range flight-following and data exchange.  ATC Networking is required to meet the Net Ready Key Performance Parameter for ATC tactical systems.  The TTCS provides initial Air Traffic Services at remote landing sites and drop zones.  TTCS includes secure communications equipment for aircraft separation and ground control, meteorological measuring system for basic weather information, and precision location capability.  The design, development and testing of the platform specific architecture for the integration of the ATC Wireless Network Backbone into the TTCS are required to support implementation of the ATC Tactical Network."
