Development in this line will focus on hard kill capabilities in which missiles are used to intercept incoming Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles (ASCM). Missile and system improvements necessary to meet their requirements are being addressed via NATO SEASPARROW Missile System (NSSMS) (0173), Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) (0167), Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) SeaRAM (9853A), Griffin, Javelin and Spike missile (3342). Missile improvements include improved kinematic performance plus advanced seeker and low elevation fusing\/warhead capability improvements. CIWS System improvements include Technology Refresh for current fleet population and Next Generation CIWS. New system developments include integration of Griffin missile into Patrol Coastal (PC) and Littoral Combat Ship Missile Module, and development and\/or qualification of shoulder launched missile system."

Funding will deliver software baseline changes to the RAM Block 1A and Block 2 Missiles, launcher software updates and updated interface to the combat system.  FY15 funding increases also supports ESSM block 2 risk reduction and dual band transceiver development.  The increases were offset by a decrease to the ESSM program due to Department decision to reduce contracted services and a decrease due to underexecution."

The baseline system (Block 0) provides a self-defense system to counter ASCMs. RAM Block 0\/1 provide defense capability against active and passive anti-ship missiles, very low altitude missiles, and maneuvering missiles through the utilization of passive radio frequency and infrared seekers and a maritime optimized fuse. The RAM Block 1A software update and the Mk 49 MOD 3 launcher upgrade program provide an additional asymmetric capability against helicopters, aircraft and surface craft. The RAM Block 2 upgrade program is a cooperative requirement of the U.S. and Federal Republic of Germany, as agreed to in an international Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), and allows RAM to counter emerging highly maneuverable ASCM threats utilizing advanced seeksers while maintaining all the proven capabilities of RAM Block 0\/1\/1A's accurate terminal guidance, proven lethality, and no shipboard post launch dependence.  Funding supports formal Developmental and Operational Testing (DT\/OT) scheduled through FY16, data analysis, operational\/test driven studies, support of combat system performance analysis, identification of operationally relevant improvements."

Evolved SEASPARROW Missile (ESSM) Testing: A cooperative effort among 10 NATO SEASPARROW Nations and the U.S., to improve the capability of the SEASPARROW Missile to counter the low altitude, highly maneuverable ASCM threat. The program consists of evolving the SEASPARROW Missile through the development of a new rocket motor with tail control; thrust vector control and ordnance (warhead) upgrade; modifications to the MK 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) to fire from a single cell with 4 ESSM (QuadPack); and modifications to the NATO SEASPARROW Surface Missile System (NSSMS) to provide ESSM capability.\n\n2. NATO SEASPARROW Objective Configuration (OC).  The OC Program consists of segmenting and automating the existing MK 57 NSSMS radars (MK 9 Track Illuminator System) and launchers (MK 29 Guided Missile Launching System).  The program eliminates all MK 57 watch stations, reduces the required system hardware. \n\n3. NATO SEASPARROW Technical Direction Agent - MK 91 Rearchitecture: The MK 91 rearchitecture program integrates NSSMS into the SSDS architecture to provide ship missile defense utilizing an open architected system technical design agent.\n\n4. STALKER LONG RANGE Electro Optic (EO)\/Infra Red (IR)\/Laser Range Finder (LRF) System: Detects, acquires, classifies, identifies and determines intent of conventional,asymmetrical and advanced threats supporting Anti-Air Warefare (AAW), Anti-Surface Warefare (ASUW), Anti-terrorism\/Force Protection (AT\/FP) and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). Long Range Visible\/Infra Red Sensors and Laser Range Finder provide multi-spectral target imagery and accurate range data in non-benign environments. Classification to the horizon, visual resolution of 1ft @ 10 nm and range resolution\/rate within 1 ft\/1kt\/nm.  This effort is in response to the NAVCENT Counter Swarm Urgent Operational Need (UON) to combat Fast Attack Craft\/Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FAC\/FIAC).\n\n5. ESSM Block 2 Risk Reduction: ESSM Block 2 upgrade is a cooperative effort between U.S Navy and NATO SEASPARROW Consortium Nations.  ESSM Block 2 upgrade replaces the largely obsolete guidance section with a dual mode Active\/Semi-Active X-Band seeker capable of defeating future threat capabilities within the existing envelope, including; smaller signatures, increased raid sizes, and adverse environments including countermeasures.  Threat types include; advanced ASCMs, Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles (ASBMs), surface and asymmetrical.\n\n6. Dual-Band Transceiver (DBT).  The ESSM Block 2 missile will utilize a DBT for in-flight data communications.  This two-way datalink enables control and management of the missile during flight.  This DBT Leverages the new DDG-1000\/CVN-78 X-Band Transceiver (XBT) to incorporate the functions to support S-Band Aegis data link (i.e. a Dual Band Transceiver).  This solves the S-band obsolescence issues and gives one common transceiver across the ESSM inventory."

Conducted Guided Test Vehicle (GTV)\/structural test firing of Griffin missile and Quick Reaction Assessment (QRA) with Commander Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR).  Performed Delta live-fire testing events as required to prove out performance enhancements, comply with latest safety\/Information Assurance directives and support Fleet required in-theater tests. Completed lead PC design, develop training and logistics support, obtain safety approvals for system deployment and formulate the OCONUS Alteration Installation Team (AIT) plan. Continued procurement planning for forward deployed PC hardware. Hardware and software upgrade continued to be implemented based on results of operational assessment. GMS fielded on PC ships.  Continue to integrate a version of the Griffin missile with updated Operational Flight Software intended to improve performance against faster targets and in higher wind environments.  This Mod 1 update included achieving full SAASM compliance, incorporating an \"Indoctrination State\" into the Battle Management Software (BMS), addressing Mod 0 sensor Boresight alignment issues, performing a service life analysis of the Griffin missile and incorporation of the sensor into the Patrol Coastal's dry air system. A live fire test of the Mod 1 system is planned for July 2014 and final certification of the system (including safety, logistics, Information Assurance) is planned for late September prior to the expiration of the RDTE funds. Live Fire testing events for PC GMS will occur in March 2014 in U.S. 5th Fleet (C5F) Area Of Responsibility (AOR)."

In conjunction with Technology Refresh, a Next Generation CIWS effort (trade studies and initial requirements definition) is planned in order to define the follow-on CIWS system for future ships (and potentially backfit on newer fleet units) that can defeat the emerging anti-ship cruise missile threats at a lower overall life cycle cost.  Given the sheer number of CIWS system deployed across the fleet, and the amount of time it would take to upgrade existing installations to any Next Generation CIWS configuration, both Technology Refresh efforts and Next Generation CIWS efforts are required to be executed at same time in order to maintain existing CIWS capability while Next Generation CIWS is developed and begins fielding."
