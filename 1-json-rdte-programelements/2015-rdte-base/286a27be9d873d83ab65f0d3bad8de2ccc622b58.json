Air Battle Managers onboard the JSTARS use its wide area ground surveillance radar to build situational awareness and identify targets which are passed to strike assets or crossed cued with ISR platforms. The capability to perform this dual mission at the tactical edge both reduces the time to execute the kill chain and improves ISR collections across the range of military options.\n\nThis program element enhances the warfighter's ability to achieve the joint vision of combat operations. It develops advanced battle management aids and information fusion technologies to enable rapid decisions by automating tracking and addressing time-critical targets. Concept exploration, program definition\/risk reduction efforts, and studies support continuous improvements in development of BMC2 capabilities, network centric operational capabilities, and interoperability with joint service, allied, and coalition systems.\n\nCurrently this program element is comprised of the JSTARS Recap Program to include: (1) BMC2 System; (2) Sensor Systems; (3) Air Vehicle & Avionics Systems; (4) Data, Voice, & Advanced Communications Systems; and (5) Systems Engineering & Integration (SE&I). It may also include the furtherance of other related activities to include, but not be limited to, Open System Architecture (OSA) development and\/or refinement for sensor systems and BMC2.\n\nActivities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning\/execution and future program planning.\n\nJSTARS Recap:\n\nThe JSTARS Recap program was initiated to satisfy the JSTARS Mission Area capability gaps and life-cycle affordability challenges as defined in the Synthetic Aperture Radar\/Moving Target Indicator (SAR\/MTI); JSTARS Mission Area Analysis of Alternative (AoA) and the SAR\/MTI, BMC2 Initial Capabilities Document (ICD). The JSTARS Recap program consists of multiple efforts for the development and integration of all sub-systems necessary to satisfy the requirements documented in the ICD, AOA and, upon completion, the Capability Development Document (CDD). The efforts include, but are not limited to: BMC2 System; Sensor Systems; Air Vehicle & Avionics Systems; Data, Voice & Advanced Communications Systems; SE&I; as well as related OSA development or refinement activities to improve AF weapon system life-cycle affordability. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production. MDD is expected in FY14 with a MS B decision in FY16."

Concept exploration, program definition\/risk reduction efforts, and studies support continuous improvements in development of BMC2 capabilities, network centric operational capabilities, and interoperability with joint service, allied, and coalition systems.\n\nCurrently this program element is comprised of the JSTARS Recap Program to include: (1) BMC2 System; (2) Sensor Systems; (3) Air Vehicle & Avionics Systems; (4) Data, Voice, & Advanced Communications Systems; and (5) Systems Engineering & Integration (SE&I). It may also include the furtherance of other related activities to include, but not be limited to, Open System Architecture (OSA) development and\/or refinement for sensor systems and BMC2.\n\nActivities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning\/execution and future program planning.\n\nJSTARS Recap:\n\nThe JSTARS Recap program was initiated to satisfy the JSTARS Mission Area capability gaps and life-cycle affordability challenges as defined in the Synthetic Aperture Radar\/Moving Target Indicator (SAR\/MTI); JSTARS Mission Area Analysis of Alternative (AoA) and the SAR\/MTI, BMC2 Initial Capabilities Document (ICD). The JSTARS Recap program consists of multiple efforts for the development and integration of all sub-systems necessary to satisfy the requirements documented in the ICD, AOA and, upon completion, the Capability Development Document (CDD). The efforts include, but are not limited to: BMC2 System; Sensor Systems; Air Vehicle & Avionics Systems; Data, Voice & Advanced Communications Systems; SE&I; as well as related OSA development or refinement activities to improve AF weapon system life-cycle affordability. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production. MDD is expected in FY14 with a MS B decision in FY16."

The Acquisition Strategy will be designed to enable maximum competition for each major sub-system through the EMD phase. Each major sub-system has a capable industry base large enough to make competition an effective tool in achieving the goal of system affordability through development, procurement and sustainment.  The program will also leverage ongoing DoD and industry work on Open System Architectures and standard inferfaces to enhance competition and ease of upgrades throughout the program life cycle."
