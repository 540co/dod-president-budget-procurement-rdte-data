            "val": "a. The Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) project, under the Tactical Airborne Control System, funds development necessary to provide a Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable, high-fidelity simulator for the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), Combat Control Team (CCT) and Air Support Operations Center (ASOC).  JTC TRS is essential to future upgrade and continuation training and currency control requirements due to an increase in USAF JTAC numbers while current and future available air assets to accomplish training are decreasing.  Future JTAC control requirements will exceed the ability of live air to meet, and JTC TRS is the only future capability currently projected to allow USAF JTACs to achieve and maintain minimum required controls for both qualification and proficiency demands. The JTC TRS Project provides research and development to facilitate interoperability with joint and sister Service air-ground simulation using industry standards.   JTC TRS will allow JTAC and CCT to perform Close Air Support (CAS), Call-for-Fire (CFF) and Tactical Air Traffic Control (ATC) missions and allow ASOCs to perform Command and Control (C2) missions in a Live\/Virtual\/Constructive (LVC) environment.   Future JTC TRS development will provide the capability to network aircrew full mission trainers and training centers with other trainers including the Personnel Recovery training and rehearsal capability. This development effort will also integrate ASOCs with the Joint Theater Air to Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS) trainer for Joint Fires.  The PR capability is envisioned to be a \"plug and play\" module for the host JTC TRS. The PR capability will provide Para-rescue (PJ) personnel with an immersive LVC environment to plan, train, and rehearse their employment, rescue\/recovery, and combat trauma care skills.  JTC TRS will host the network connection to conduct distributed training and rehearsal with other Recovery Forces.  The simulator will supplement live field training and live tissue training to provide realistic introductory, proficiency, currency, and upgrade training in a simulated battlefield, disaster, or humanitarian relief environment for Air Force PJs.\n\nb. JTAGSS is a continuation of the ASOC simulation trainer initially funded in 2009 and complements the JTC TRS trainer by providing a total air-ground constructive simulation environment for integrated networked training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop JTAC\/CCT and ASOC\/SOF (Special Operations Forces) C2 (Command and Control) battle staff skills.  JTAGSS will provide the ASOC, SOF, and TACP (Tactical Air Control Party) with the vertical and horizontal C2 communications and coordination training and mission rehearsal required for mission effectiveness.   JTAGSS is required to train 400 ASOC personnel with limited to no live training opportunities to align with the AF move to using simulation for stand-alone and distributed training.  There are insufficient exercises and live training events available to meet mandated readiness requirements.  The system will include a secure network connection, a constructive simulation environment generator with sharable databases, computer work stations that have synthetic reflex agent applications for every ASOC\/SOF crew position, and an instructor\/operator station.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts for systems, both fielded or approved for full rate production, that have been fully validated through formal Operation Utility Evaluation (OUE) and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

JTC TRS will allow JTAC and CCT to perform Close Air Support (CAS), Call-for-Fire (CFF) and Tactical Air Traffic Control (ATC) missions and allow ASOCs to perform Command and Control (C2) missions in a Live\/Virtual\/Constructive (LVC) environment.   Future JTC TRS development will provide the capability to network aircrew full mission trainers and training centers with other trainers including the Personnel Recovery training and rehearsal capability. This development effort will also integrate ASOCs with the Joint Theater Air to Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS) trainer for Joint Fires.  The PR capability is envisioned to be a \"plug and play\" module for the host JTC TRS. The PR capability will provide Para-rescue (PJ) personnel with an immersive LVC environment to plan, train, and rehearse their employment, rescue\/recovery, and combat trauma care skills.  JTC TRS will host the network connection to conduct distributed training and rehearsal with other Recovery Forces.  The simulator will supplement live field training and live tissue training to provide realistic introductory, proficiency, currency, and upgrade training in a simulated battlefield, disaster, or humanitarian relief environment for Air Force PJs.\n\nb. JTAGSS is a continuation of the ASOC simulation trainer initially funded in 2009 and complements the JTC TRS trainer by providing a total air-ground constructive simulation environment for integrated networked training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop JTAC\/CCT and ASOC\/SOF (Special Operations Forces) C2 (Command and Control) battle staff skills.  JTAGSS will provide the ASOC, SOF, and TACP (Tactical Air Control Party) with the vertical and horizontal C2 communications and coordination training and mission rehearsal required for mission effectiveness.   JTAGSS is required to train 400 ASOC personnel with limited to no live training opportunities to align with the AF move to using simulation for stand-alone and distributed training.  There are insufficient exercises and live training events available to meet mandated readiness requirements.  The system will include a secure network connection, a constructive simulation environment generator with sharable databases, computer work stations that have synthetic reflex agent applications for every ASOC\/SOF crew position, and an instructor\/operator station.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts for systems, both fielded or approved for full rate production, that have been fully validated through formal Operation Utility Evaluation (OUE) and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
