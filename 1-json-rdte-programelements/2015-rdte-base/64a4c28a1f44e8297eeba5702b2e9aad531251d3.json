            "val": "Operational forces have an immediate need to survive, safely operate, and sustain operations in a Chemical and Biological (CB) threat environment across the continuum of global, contingency, special operations\/low intensity conflict, counternarcotics, and other high-risk missions.  Operating forces have a critical need for defense against worldwide proliferation of CB warfare capabilities and for medical treatment of CB casualties.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) CB Defense initiatives, both medical and non-medical.  This program element supports the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) of medical and physical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Projects within BA5 are structured to consolidate Joint and Service-unique tasks within four commodity areas: contamination avoidance, individual and collective force protection, decontamination, and medical countermeasures.  This consolidation provides for development and operational testing of equipment for Joint Service use and for Service-unique requirements.  \n\nContamination avoidance efforts under this system development program will provide U.S. forces with real-time hazard assessment capabilities.  They include multi-agent point and remote chemical detection for ground, aircraft, and shipboard applications; automated warning and reporting systems; integrated radiation detection and monitoring equipment; and enhanced battlefield reconnaissance capabilities.  Force protection efforts will increase protection levels while decreasing physical and psychological burdens imposed by protective equipment.  \n\nThe Secretary of Defense is responsible for research, development, acquisition, and deployment of medical countermeasure equipment and materiel to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces, in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens, encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats, because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and\/or operations, may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD, unlike those developed to support the U.S. population, must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasize prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this SDD, such as vaccines and chemical prophylaxis, conserves fighting strength, decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation, and satisfy the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available, efforts on this SDD support pre-hospitalization treatment, en-route care, hospital care, and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include CB diagnostics, and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic threats and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  \n\nThe Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  The Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process (\"One Portfolio\").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research, development, acquisition, and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces, it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research, development, and acquisition because of its unique facilities, testing capabilities, and trained and experienced personnel.  \n\nThe projects in this program element support efforts in the engineering and manufacturing phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 5."

                            "val": "This project supports System Development and Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production (SDD\/LRIP) of an array of reconnaissance, detection and identification equipment, and warning systems.  \n\nEfforts included in this project are: (1) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS); (2) Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS); (3) Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS); (4) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense Support; (5) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Detection Support; and (6) Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD).\n\nThe CBRN Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) consists of portable, commercial and government off-the-shelf equipment which provides personnel protection from current and emerging CBRN hazards through detection, identification, sample collection, decontamination, marking, and hazard reporting for CBRN threats.  The system supports Dismounted Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and CBRN Site Assessment missions which enable more detailed and near real-time CBRN information flow for the Warfighter.  The program will address emerging CBRN threat requirements in order to provide an enhanced capability for the future.  \n\nThe Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS) is a fully automated system that detects, warns, and provides presumptive identification and samples for follow-on confirmatory analysis.  It is an ACAT II program in Full Rate Production (FRP).  The Army platforms include the JBPDS on the Biological Integrated Detection System (BIDS) and the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV).  The Navy installs the JBPDS on several classes of ships such as Cruisers and Amphibious Transports.  Engineering Changes to refresh the technology of the JBPDS consists of two separate efforts (one funded by procurement and one RDT&E funded) that, when combined, will reduce lifecycle costs and address obsolescence concerns.  The existing computer hardware and operating system in the JBPDS will not meet Information Assurance standards due to obsolescence.  Under the existing production contract, an engineering effort is underway to address the computer and operating system obsolescence concerns.  The element being developed under RDT&E funding is a new detector technology that will significantly reduce false positives resulting in improved reliability, reduced consumable use, and reduction in operational and sustainment costs.\n\nThe Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) will integrate, test and produce the first lightweight (less than 37 lbs), low cost biological surveillance system that will detect, collect and identify biological warfare agent aerosols.  JBTDS will provide warning through the Joint Warning And Reporting Network (JWARN) and archive samples for follow-on analyses.  JBTDS will provide near real-time local audio and visual alarm for use by any Military Occupational Specialty (MOS).  JBTDS components will be man-portable, battery-operable and easy to employ.  JBTDS will be used organically at battalion level and below and provide notification of a hazard and enhanced battle space awareness to protect and preserve the force.  When networked, JBTDS will augment existing biological detection systems to provide a theater-wide seamless array capable of biological detection, identification and warning.  Units equipped with JBTDS will conduct biological surveillance missions to detect BWA aerosol clouds, collect a sample, and identify the agent to support time sensitive force protection decisions.  JBTDS will leverage potential common identification technology solutions to additional programs and will address modernization of NBCRV and other platforms.\n\nThe Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense program supports the on-going chemical and biological (CB) defense efforts as acquisition programs address emerging threat requirements across the full spectrum of conflict.  Dedicated initiatives and projects will transition information, technologies, and capability into acquisition strategies that account for the breadth and depth of emerging threats which span the full range of military missions.  By leveraging previous work done on NTAs (NTA DETECT) within the DoD, interagency cooperation, and international partnerships, the NTA Defense program will provide essential enablers such as threat understanding; operational impacts of performance trades; and comprehensive, integrated, and layered defense concepts against current CB threats.  The program will develop a balanced portfolio which will target capabilities to reduce risk from technology gaps inherent from emerging threats.  Additional efforts in conducting systems engineering analysis will occur in order to identify and consolidate capability knowledge gaps and prioritize required investments.\n\nThe Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Detect project will identify, evaluate and continue to transition advanced detection and identification system(s) through follow-on technology insertion efforts which enhance the Domestic Response Capability (DRC), Advanced Threat (AT) Box, CBRN DRS (Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets, Kits, and Outfits), and Next Generation Chemical Detector programs.  These efforts will ensure that specialized units will maintain situational awareness and have the ability to respond to emerging and escalating threats.  The systems provide a mid-term capability to detect emerging threat materials and afford the Warfighter the ability to support domestic response and force protection missions.  These systems will leverage common core technologies to detect and identify threats that can be exploited for lab deployable, fixed site and handheld applications.\n\nThe Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) is several detection system variants for multi phase of matter sampling, location of liquid solids on surfaces, and vapor and aerosol monitoring.  NGCD will detect and identify non-traditional agents, chemical warfare agents (CWAs), toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) in the air and on surfaces.  The NGCD will provide improved CWA\/TIC selectivity and sensitivity on multiple platforms as well as multiple environments.  This sensor will improve detection, consequence management and reconnaissance, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) interdiction capabilities.  The scope of the project includes detection of agent a few feet away from the detector as well as the sampling point of the detector."

This strategy employs an NDI acquisition concept to establish a simplified management framework to translate mission needs and emerging technology capabilities into a stable, affordable, and well-managed acquisition program.\n\nJOINT BIO POINT DETECTION SYSTEM (JBPDS)\n\nThe technology update for the detector focuses on the Rapid Agent Aerosol Detector (RAAD); being developed by MIT-LL with producibility and logistics support from Kansas City Plant (KCP).  This technology update will be used to support  the Joint US Forces Korea Portal and Integrated Threat Reduction (JUPITR) advanced technology demonstration (ATD).\n\nJOINT BIO TACTICAL DETECTION SYSTEM (JBTDS)\n\nThe JBTDS is being developed using an evolutionary acquisition strategy. JBTDS will maximize the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) technology.  The awards for the Technology Development (TD) phase utilized a best value approach via the competitive CBRNE mission support contract to three contractor teams.  Full and open competition will be utilized for the EMD contract with options for Low Rate Initial Production and Full Rate Production.  Coordination with other programs (Common Analytical Laboratory System and Next Generation Diagnostic System) is occurring to share information and leverage potential common identification technology solutions to the three programs.\n\nNEXT GENERATION CHEMICAL DETECTOR (NGCD)\n\nThe NGCD analysis of alternatives will be used to generate performance specifications that will support contracting for competitive prototype development.  The request for proposal was released July 2013.  The goal for the initial stage of development will be to award multiple contracts for each variant of the NGCD.  Full and open competition will be used to award one contract per variant at Milestone B.  Mature technology will be accelerated as appropriate.\n\nNON TRADITIONAL AGENT DEFENSE (NTA DEFENSE)\n\nThe Non-Traditional Agent Defense technology assessments, performance tradeoff analysis, and mission decomposition will provide acquisition information, technology, and evaluation testbeds to afford acquisition programs the ability to, more rapidly with less risk, develop capabilities for the Warfighter.  The ability to attain situational awareness and respond to any unknown and emerging threat hazard will be attained through these incremental transitions to acquisition programs.   By leveraging previous work done on NTAs within the DoD, the interagency, and internationally, the NTA Defense will provide essential enablers of a comprehensive, integrated, and layered defense against current CB threats and develop a balanced portfolio targeted at capabilities that preclude technological surprise from emerging threats.\n\nNON TRADITIONAL AGENT DETECTION (NTA DETECT)\n\nThe Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Detection technology assessments, performance tradeoff analyses, and mission decomposition transitioned a detection capability through incremental acquisition that afforded the Warfighter ability to attain situational awareness and respond to unknown and emerging hazards.  COTS\/GOTS assessments were used in order to lower program risks, reduce costs, and ensure a higher confidence in selected technologies.  The project will address next priority mission areas and threats underneath the NTA Defense profile."

Particular emphasis is placed on improving military-civilian interoperability in CBRN detection and response capabilities; providing tiered levels of CBRN protection and response capabilities to military installations; and tailored modular and integrated COTS solutions to consequence management units.  \n\nIncluded in this project are the following developmental efforts:\n\nThe Common Analytical Laboratory System capability (CALS) will be modular, scalable and adaptable to a variety of concept of operations (CONOPS) and environmental conditions.  Currently, fielded systems have been designed independently by various agencies with the intent of meeting a specific units requirements.  As a result, multiple mobile lab configurations exist with differing sustainment tails and lacking in commonality.  The analytical detection package fielded will be fitted to the specific mission and CONOPS of the gaining unit and be able to detect and identify Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs), Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs), Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) and Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs).  Users of the system will include the National Guard Bureau Civil Support Teams, the Army 20th Support Command, the Army Medical Laboratory, the Air Force, and the Navy. \n\nThe Special Purpose Units Chemical Biological Equipment program provides for the acquisition and ongoing assessment of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) detection, protection and decontamination equipment for these units.\n\nThe Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team Program supports the ongoing assessment and acquisition of COTS and GOTS hand held analytical detection, protection, decontamination and sampling equipment for survey in order to expand\/enhance the operational capabilities of the (57) WMD CST Teams.  This includes modernization of detection capabilities inside the Analytical Laboratory System to maintain system viability until the CALS is fielded."

CP systems can be installed on any type of platform, such as, hard and soft shelters, vehicles, ships, aircraft, and buildings.  CP systems provide spaces safe from the effects of CBR contamination.\n\nThe system included in this project is the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP).\n\nJECP provides the Joint Expeditionary Forces a CP capability which is lightweight, compact, modular, and affordable.  A family of systems is planned that will allow the application of CP to transportable soft-side shelters, enclosed spaces of opportunity, and in remote austere locations as a standalone resource.  JECP will be capable of protecting personnel groups of varying size, unencumbered by Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), from the effects of CB agents, Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs), radiological particles, heat, dust, and sand.  The employment of JECP is a strategic deterrence against enemy use of CBR agents or TIMs, and will reduce the need for personnel and equipment decontamination."

After MS B, awarded competitive cost plus incentive fee contract to Science Applications International Corporation  (now Leidos) in 2008 to build prototypes subjected to robust engineering developmental testing and Operational Assessment during the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase.  After MS C, awarded a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) option to Leidos in September 2013 for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) systems to support formal Developmental Testing (DT) and Multi-Service Operational Test & Evaluation (MOT&E).  In addition, a Fixed Price Incentive Successive Target (FPIS) option will be awarded to Leidos in 2QFY14 to perform non-recurring engineering (NRE) and logistic product development associated with the LRIP system configurations.  Following a successful Full Rate Production (FRP) decision, award a FFP option with five one-year ordering periods.  Full and open competition will be used with an updated SPS to award follow-on production contracts."

The CHRP is a body bag designed to contain chemical, biological, or radiological contaminated fluids and gasses from contaminated remains.  The CHRP will fulfill gaps as described in the Mortuary Affairs (MA) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) for safe intra-theater handling and transport of contaminated human remains (CHR).  The CHRP will provide protection by containing CHR during recovery and transport from the point of fatality to the MA Activity.  The CHRP will contain fluid and vapor CBRN hazards associated with the CHR to reduce the spread of contamination and reduce the hazard to personnel handling the CHR and the environment.  Successful development and procurement of the CHRP will provide Warfighters with the capability to safely handle, transport, and temporarily store or inter CHR in a theater of operations.\n\nThe Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) program facilitates the rapid transition of mature Science and Technology (S&T) research developments to existing Decontamination or Contamination Mitigation ICD Programs of Record and guides S&T community efforts toward meeting the needs of the Warfighter.  DFoS will develop a Family of Systems (FoS), to include equipment, to improve decontamination processes, and decontaminant solutions to meet the capability gaps for decontaminating Non-Traditional Agents (NTA) and chemical and biological (CB) warfare agents from personnel, equipment, vehicle interiors\/exteriors, terrain, and fixed facilities.  \n\nCIDAS will provide a contamination indicator\/decontamination assurance technology; it will consist of an indicator and an applicator, for which there will be three configurations.  The indicator will be sprayed on tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served and individual weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that may have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional chemical contamination.  CIDAS is a new capability for the Joint Forces that will reduce logistics burden of decontamination by indicating presence and location of traditional (Nerve and Blister) and non-traditional chemical agents on militarily relevant surfaces pre- and post-decontamination.\n\nGPD is a liquid decontaminant that will provide thorough decontamination capabilities for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served weapons, and individual\/personal weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional CB contamination. \n\nJSEW is a decontamination wipe that will provide immediate\/operational decontamination capabilities for sensitive and non-sensitive equipment in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical agents\/contamination and shall decontaminate Nerve and Blister agents from a starting liquid challenge of 10 g\/m2 to less than or equal to 1g\/m2 and non-traditional agents from a starting challenge of 5 g\/m2 to less than or equal to 1g\/m2.  In addition, the JSEW is intended to be a replacement for the Individual Equipment Decontamination Kit (M295).\n\nThe Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) Trail Boss provides a single access point to the full spectrum of CBRN expertise and support weapon system programs integration of CBRN Survivability into Department of Defense (DOD) programs designated as CBRN Mission Critical and those requiring CBRN capabilities.  MDAP projects across the FYDP promote consistency of CBRN defense capabilities and systems' architectures across Services.\n\nThe F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Decontamination System MDAP project will develop an integrated decontamination containment system and decontaminant delivery system to support the JSF Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E) to satisfy specific F-35 decontamination requirements through aircraft-unique interfaces and demonstrate the aircraft's ability to meet CB decontamination and survivability requirements."

CHRP will develop two Government designed systems to meet performance specifications and provide a fielded capability for safe intra-theater handling and transport of CHR. At MS C, an effective and suitable system will be chosen for entry into the Production and Deployment  Phase from two candidate systems based on testing results and a cost-benefit analysis.  Manufacturing and production will occur at Government facilities. Follow-on phases of CHRP development may include efforts to incorporate the CHRP into a system designed to provide a transport capability to return CHR to Continental United States (CONUS).\n\nThe Government design strategy will emphasize meeting Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) using design attributes not offered by the commercial sector and materials with existing test data to provide Services two options at different cost and performance points.  The CHRP will use EMD Phase testing to determine the capability of Government design candidates to meet the requirements outlined in the MA ICD and CHRP CDD, and the.  At MS C, an effective and suitable system will be chosen for entry into the Production and Deployment  Phase from two candidate systems based on testing results and a cost-benefit analysis with input from the user community.\n\nDECONTAMINATION FAMILY OF SYSTEMS (DFoS)\n\nThe DFoS is utilizing an incremental acquisition strategy to transition various developmental technology efforts (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS), and DoD technology efforts) to meet high priority Warfighter capability gaps.  DFoS will support Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) and Programs of Record by guiding S&T efforts and transitioning mature technologies to meet program requirements.\n\nDFoS CONTAMINATION INDICATOR DECONTAMINATION ASSURANCE SYSTEM (DFoS CIDAS)\n\nThe CIDAS program will follow an evolutionary acquisition strategy in consonance with the Joint Requirements Office (JRO)\/User developed capability documents.  Following MS A, collaborated with JSTO\/DTRA efforts, including the Hazard Mitigation, Materiel and Equipment Restoration (HaMMER) Advanced Technology Development Operational Demonstration and Extended User Evaluations, and conducted technology demonstrations on candidate indicator and applicator technologies to mitigate risk and identify affordable mature technologies that meet requirements.  Determined need for and initiated Government designed large scale applicator to meet specific User requirements.  Following MS B, use full and open competition to award a performance based contract with options for LRIP and FRP for indicator and small and mid scale applicator systems.  Integrate and test contractor and Government designs in DT and operational testing.\n\nDFoS GENERAL PURPOSE DECONTAMINANT (DFoS GPD)\n\nThe GPD program employed a Competitive Prototyping (CP) effort to facilitate the evaluation of COTs technologies.  Seven contracts were awarded for competing vendors to provide prototype GPDs in support of CP I. A down select occurred based on technical performance and cost and four contracts were awarded to vendors in support of CP II. As the GPD program enters the next acquisition phase, the program will continue following an evolutionary acquisition strategy; employing a verification\/validation effort to facilitate the identification and evaluation of mature technologies that can meet the GPD Capabilities Development Document (CPD) requirements satisfying Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) user needs.\n\nDFoS JOINT SENSITIVE EQUIPMENT WIPE (DFoS JSEW)\n\nJSEW program employed competitive prototyping to facilitate the evaluation of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Technologies during the Technology Development Phase.  Candidates were evaluated from competing vendor prototypes to determine optimal JSEW systems.  Four contracts were awarded to vendors in support of Competitive Prototyping Phase (CP) II.  As the JSEW enters the next acquisition phase, the program will continue following an evolutionary acquisition strategy; employing a verification\/validation effort to facilitate the identification and evaluation of mature technologies that can meet the JSEW Capabilities Development Document (CPD) requirements.  Follow-on increments of JSEW may include biological agent capability and use on skin.\n\nMAJOR DEFENSE ACQUISITION PROGRAM (MDAP)\n\nThe JSF Decontamination System effort will utilize sole source contracting to leverage and integrate commercially available technologies to provide a decontamination delivery system for the Joint Strike Fighter program office in support of the JSF Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E)."

                            "val": "This project provides Engineering & Manufacturing Development Phase and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD\/LRIP) for individual protection equipment, with the goal of providing equipment that allows the individual soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine to operate in a contaminated Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) environment with little or no degradation of his\/her performance.  \n\nIncluded in this program are: \n\n(1) The Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM) for Tactical (TA), Strategic (SA), and Rotary Wing (RW) aircraft are Acquisition Category (ACAT) III programs, incrementally developed with multiple variants for respiratory protection.  The JSAM will be a lightweight chemical and biological (CB) protective mask that will be worn as CB protection for most Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine fixed wing (FW) and RW aircrew members.  All JSAM variants will be compatible with most below-the-neck (BTN) CB protection ensembles and existing aircrew life support equipment (ALSE).  They will include a protective hood assembly, CB filter, blower assembly, and an intercom for ground communication.  They will also provide flame and thermal protection, demist\/emergency demist, and anti-drowning features.  The goal of the JSAM programs is to develop, manufacture, field, and sustain an aircrew respirator systems that, in conjunction with BTN clothing ensembles, will provide the capability for all aircrew to fly throughout their full operating envelope in an actual or perceived CB warfare environment.  \nThe JSAM TA and SA respirators are being developed for use in the majority of Department of Defense (DoD) FW aircraft except for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF).  The JSAM TA will provide CB and anti-G protection up to nine times the vertical force (Gz), for aircrew in high-performance aircraft.  The JSAM SA will be used in aircrew positions that do not require anti-G protection and provide CB protection for positions that only need pressure breathing for altitude.\nThe JSAM-JSF is a CB respirator being specifically designed to support the F-35.  It is designed to ensure that system integration and qualification of CB protection and survivability requirements are achieved as derived from the JSF operational requirements document.  Prior to FY15, this project was funded under the JSAM funding line.  When integrated with aircraft and pilot mounted equipment, the JSAM-JSF will provide combined CB, hypoxia and anti-G protection to all F-35 users, including the United States Air Force (USAF), Navy (USN), Marine Corps (USMC), and International Partners.  \n\nThe JSAM MPU-5 RW mask is being developed for use by pilots and aircrew in the majority of DoD RW aircraft in the United States Army (USA) except AH-64 users, USAF, USN, USMC, and United States Coast Guard (USCG).  The JSAM RW will integrate with most BTN CB ensembles, normal aircrew flight equipment, and rotary wing flight helmets.  The system contains a removable face plate, allowing the user to fly \"face free\" in MOPP 2.5 when the threat level dictates, thereby reducing physiological burden and improving field of view.  If threat level warrants, the user can install their face plate into an already donned hood and enter MOPP 4 without removing their flight helmet.  \n\n\n(2) The Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM) Advanced Respiratory Protection Initiative (ARPI) project funds the advanced component development and prototypes of an improved filtration and protection capability against highest priority Toxic Industrial Chemical (TIC) threats, addressing a current and significant capability gap to the operating force.  The effort is supported by the Capabilities Production Document for the JSGPM, which outlines the need for a robust TIC\/Toxic Industrial Material (TIM) protection capability.  It is expected that new capabilities demonstrated through the activities in this project will be leveraged and integrated into future increments of UIPE.\n\n(3) The Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble (UIPE).  The objective of UIPE is to fully integrate chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) and toxic industrial material (TIM) protection into an ensemble, identical in fit and form to the combat uniform (including mask-helmet integration and protective boots and gloves), thus negating the need for separate protective ensemble components.  This integrated protection approach will result in increased Warfighter operational performance in a CBRN environment.  The UIPE program will develop, integrate, test, procure and field incremental capability solutions that are modular in function and offer improvements in form and fit over current systems; the program will explore trade-space in areas such as protection level, heat stress, durability, antimicrobial properties, flame resistance, launderability, self-detoxification, and protection time in order to provide capabilities that afford maximum utility to the Warfighter.  Where appropriate modeling and simulation tools will be used to lower UIPE program risks, reduce costs, and ensure a high confidence in selected technologies.  UIPE Increment 1 is aimed specifically at providing enhanced individual protection capabilities to the Warfighter through reduction of physiological and psychological effects associated with CBRN protective garment thermal burden, weight, and bulk.  UIPE Increment 1 achieved MS C approval in June 2013 and is now in the Production and Deployment (P&D) phase.  The first increment of UIPE will provide CB protective equipment with improved operational capability to the U.S. Special Operations Command."

JSAM TA and SA must be compatible with current CB ensembles and provide flame protection and will replace all existing Pressure Breathing for Gravity (PBG) and non-PBG CB aircrew respirators.  Both solutions are being pursued via Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) and integration efforts applied to already fielded items.  The JSAM TA (A\/P22P-14A) utilizes a phased acquisition strategy to provide aircrew of all Services with individual head-eye-respiratory protection against Chemical-Biological (CB) warfare agents.  The JSAM TA effort will test the Pressure Breathing for Gravity (PBG) Mask to aircraft platforms.  The ECP will be accomplished through leveraging a Sole Source (SS)\/Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract and fielded via Competitive\/FFP contract.  The JSAM SA (Modified M53 (MM53)) effort will test and field a mask for aircrew positions not requiring PBG capabilities.  This contract was awarded via sole source to Avon Protection Systems, Cadillac, Michigan to modify and field a commercially available mask (M53).\n\nJS AIRCREW MASK JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER (JSAM JSF)\n\nJSAM-JSF is specifically designed for the F-35 (Joint Strike Fighter) to be incorporated within the JSF platform and fielded to US Services and international partners.  JSAM-JSF is being developed concurrently with other JSF equipment including life support and pilot flight equipment.  JSAM-JSF initially leveraged a JSAM-FW design and shared the same base contract with a Cost Plus Incentive Fee delivery order.\n\nJS AIRCREW MASK ROTARY WING (JSAM RW)\n\nJSAM RW is being developed under a competitive Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract, which is also used by JSAM Apache and Apache Block III.  A sole source J&A will be utilized to award LRIP to Avox Systems, with a small quantity FRP option, thereby verification of Technical Data prior to delivery to the Government.  Ultimately, a competitive solicitation will be made for Full Rate Production under Firm Fixed Price terms.\n\nJS GENERAL PURPOSE MASK (JSGPM)\n\nThe JSGPM ARPI effort is using the M61 filter contracts awarded to 3M and Avon to develop improved filters for the JSGPM.  There is a continual technology refreshment CLIN that allows for filter development tasks to be awarded under this contract.  The tasks can be competed between the two awardees.\n\nCBRN UNIFORM INTEGRATED PROTECTION ENSEMBLE (UIPE)\n\nThe UIPE Increment 2 will enhance fielded and emerging individual protective equipment as part of a Family of Systems that enables the Warfighter to operate in a contaminated Chemical and Biological (CB) environment with no or minimal degradation in performance.  UIPE is supported by an approved Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).  UIPE increment 2 will build on and enhance capabilities attained in Increment 1.  In addition, Increment 2 will seek to address the broader scope of ICD requirements to include the capability to protect warfighters from operationally relevant traditional, non-traditional, and advanced CBRN\/TIM threats likely to be encountered during joint force operations.  UIPE Increment 2 acquisition strategy will be defined to address material requirements identified in CDD utilizing both COTS and Government-owned design to attain increased capabilities."

Use of the \"IT Box\" acquisition approach increases flexibility and will expedite fielding of Information System products through a series of Build Decisions (BDs) versus less frequent traditional DoD Milestone B and C decisions.  Each program will use an Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) to describe the required operational capabilities for the development effort.  JEM's IS ICD was approved by the Joint Staff J8 Joint Requirements Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JRO-CBRND) in September 2013 and JWARN's IS ICD will be reviewed for approval in 2QFY14.  After the IS ICD is approved, more detailed requirements will be captured in Requirements Definition Packages (RDP) and will be approved at the Functional Capability Board (FCB) level.  In order to support an agile incremental approach, each program will ensure that the \"IT Box\" describes the entire IT program and not just a single increment.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  These limited fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities\/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.  As software-intensive systems both JEM and JWARN have no separately identifiable unit production components.  Both are designated ACAT III programs and unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost\/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC\/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable. \n \nJEM Increment 2, using IT Box Acquisition Strategy, adds capability to JEM Increment 1 including modeling of missile intercepts and improved modeling of hazard events in urban and littoral terrain.  It also includes improved architecture called Common CBRN Modeling Interface (CCMI).  Together, CCMI and IT Box enable more rapid and less costly integration of Science and Technology updates, aligning with the S&T provider to provide the most current capability to the warfighter.  Battlespace commanders and first responders must have a CBRN hazard prediction capability in order to make decisions that will minimize risks of CBRN contamination and enable them to continue mission operations.  JEM operates in an integrated fashion with operational and tactical Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and in a standalone mode.  JEM interfaces and communicates with the other programs such as JWARN, weather systems, intelligence systems, and various databases.  \n\nJWARN Increment 2 will provide an expansion of sensors that will connect to JWARN, increased automation of message handling, improved false alarm filtering, integration of route-planning calculator, and interoperability with additional Command and Control (C2), medical information and evolving Bio-Surveillance systems.  JWARN will be located in Command and Control Centers at the appropriate level and will be employed by CBRN defense specialists and other designated personnel to improve the efficiency of limited CBRN personnel assets.  This employment will transfer data automatically from existing sensors and to and from the future sensors to provide commanders with the capability to support operational decision making in a CBRN environment.  JWARN will integrate existing sensors into a sensor network or host C2 system, but does not provide the sensors that will be employed in the operating environment.  JWARN will transition from a Command and Control (C2) platform specific implementation to a Web-based Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) meeting the DoD's evolution to a more comprehensive Common Operating Environment (COE) and will operate as a standalone capability.  Activities include: logistical elements, support equipment, manuals and training required to operate and support the system.\n\nThe Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Integrated Architectures, Data Management\/Modeling, Information Assurance (IA), Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.  The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards.  The latest technologies\/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model.  These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users.  The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information."

The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being acquired through a Request for Proposal (RFP) to Industry under full and open competition. The program plans to award multiple development contracts in a competitive prototyping phase prior to downselecting a single JEM developer and integrator.\n\nJOINT WARNING & REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)\n\nJWARN Increment 2 acquisition will utilize the JROC's \"IT Box\" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP). The JWARN Program will procure a Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) (hardware materiel solution) in order to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).\n\nSOFTWARE SUPPORT ACTIVITY (SSA)\n\nThe SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  Phase 1a identifies CBDP programs that deal with data or software, and have an IT component.  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  (BA5 - System Development and Demonstration).   Phase 2 will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.

                            "val": "This project funds medical countermeasures, development of reagents, assays, diagnostic equipment, biosurveillance and supporting efforts.\n\nThe Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) capability (formerly the Medical Countermeasures Advanced Development and Manufacturing (MCMI) program) provides core and drug development services to include the establishment, commissioning, validation, and attainment of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP)\/Current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) for a MCM ADM capability for the Department of Defense (DoD).\n\nThe ADM effort is being executed in two phases.  Phase 1 is for the establishment, commissioning, and validation of the ADM capability.  This project funds the establishment of a capability to be located in Alachua, Florida.  Two ADM cGMP suites, capable of operating at Bio Surety Level (BSL) 3 will be established during the base contract period.  There are contract options to incrementally increase capacity.  Upon attainment of cGMP capability Phase 2 begins.  During Phase 2, the contractor team will support and maintain the capability in a state of readiness to support MCM development (to include cGMP manufacturing) and assist in training personnel in its use.  The second phase includes transition and integration of new technologies to support MCM FDA required development activities.  Phase 1 and 2 contract was awarded in March 2013 to Nanotherapeutics, Inc., Alachua, FL.  The ADM capability sustainment costs during Phase 2 will originate from Government MCM programs using this capability.\n\nThe Critical Reagents Program's (CRP) strategy establishes a core research and development capability by developing biological threat agent reference materials (strains, antigens, antibodies and nucleic acids) and detection\/diagnostic assays for biothreat agent detection.  These reagents\/assays are leveraged across multiple programs to meet the requirements of the Warfighter and Joint biological defense systems and support the biological defense community.  Through the Targeted Acquisition of Reference Materials Augmenting Capabilities (TARMAC) initiative, the CRP will use a systematic approach to the introduction of materials and information into MCM development.  \n\nBSV programs align the Biosurveillance efforts across the DoD and national strategies.  The BSV program will scope and influence BSV capabilities as products to meet Warfighter requirements through innovative management of key BSV initiative.  BSV will also support the Joint US Forces Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) ATD which will find, demonstrate, transition, and transfer the best operational concepts and technology solutions in support of a holistic approach to countering biological threats from laboratory to operational use.  Depending on the maturity, outputs will focus on providing component, CONOPS, and subsystem transition into programs of record (PORs) and\/or integration into existing PORs.  Technologies identified from the JUPITR ATD will be fielded in FY16 to Pacific Command (PACOM).  Future ATD developments will continue to bridge communication gaps between US Forces across other Combatant Command (COCOMs).\n\nThe Emerging Infectious Diseases Therapeutics (EID Tx, formerly called EID FLU) Acquisition Program is developing and will deliver a FDA-approved, broad-spectrum medical countermeasure to the Warfighter for protection against naturally occurring or biologically engineered viruses.  EID Tx is pursuing influenza indication, EID-Flu MCM, as the first step in the development of a broad spectrum antiviral drug due to a clear and established FDA regulatory approval pathway.  The drug in development is highly efficacious against multiple influenza viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, H5N1 avian influenza virus, the most recently identified H7N9 influenza virus from the outbreak in China, and drug resistant strains of influenza viruses.  This drug has also demonstrated efficacy against other viruses of concern to the DoD's biodefense program.  Ongoing EID Tx drug development will be leveraged to demonstrate additional broad-spectrum MCM's against naturally occurring and\/or engineered biowarfare threats.  Initial testing to support FY15 down-select for follow-on label extension programs has begun.  FDA approval for an influenza treatment is anticipated in FY16 following completion of the SDD phase. \n\nThe Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (HFV) Medical Countermeasure Acquisition Program develops medical countermeasures (MCMs), using high threat, extremely lethal Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) of the Filoviridae family agents (Ebola and Marburg) as model systems.  Medical countermeasures will be advanced through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure\/approval via the FDA 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s) when human testing is not ethically feasible.  HFV will also conduct animal model development and refinement as needed to support the pivotal animal efficacy testing required under the FDA 'Animal Rule'.  Completion of Phase I trials, animal model development, and manufacturing scale up are the focus of the ACD&P phase.  FDA approval for Filovirus therapeutics are expected in FY18 following completion of the SDD phase.  \n\nThe DoD funds the development of vaccines that are directed against validated biological warfare (BW) weapons to include bacteria, viruses, and toxins of biological origin.  Effective medical countermeasures to negate the threat of these BW agents are urgently needed.  Vaccines have been identified as the most efficient countermeasure against the validated threat of BW weapons.  Products under development in this budget item include Recombinant Botulinum A\/B and Plague vaccines.  Efforts to be conducted during the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase include the development of large scale manufacturing process and validation of that process, nonclinical studies, demonstration of manufacturing consistency, and expanded clinical human safety studies.  The results of these efforts, and those conducted during the EMD phase, will be used to submit a Biologic License Application (BLA) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for product licensure.  To evaluate vaccine effectiveness, pivotal animal studies will be conducted concurrently with the Phase 3 clinical trial to satisfy the requirements of the FDA's \"Animal Rule\".  The DoD anticipates that the FDA will approve these products using the Animal Rule, which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s).  Upon FDA licensure, the product will transition to full-scale licensed production.  \n\nThe DoD also has the mission to maintain Investigational New Drug (IND) vaccines in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) storage and to conduct the periodic potency and sterility testing of these materials to support submissions to the FDA.  These IND vaccines will be used to provide additional levels of protection to laboratory workers in the Special Immunizations Program (SIP) conducting research on these diseases."

                            "val": "ADVANCED DEVELOPMENT & MANUFACTURING  (ADM)\n\nThe ADM capability awarded a competitive ten (10) year [two base years with four 2 year options] Cost Plus Fixed fee (CPFF) contract to Nanotherapeutics, Inc., Alachua, FL.\n\nBIOSURVEILLANCE (BSV)\n\nBSV is the delivery of a set of capabilities to acquire, integrate, and analyze medical, environmental, and incident management data using existing and next generation systems, medical and non-medical sample collection tools and identifiers\/diagnostics; and transition hardware\/software tools and devices as residuals from the Biosurveillance Joint USFK Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  Lessons learned from the ATD will be transitioned to the programs of record associated with the CBDP.  The acquisition strategy will address the materiel solutions identified out of the multiple Biosurveillance (BSV) related Analysis of Alternatives (AoA's).\n\nCRITICAL REAGENTS PROGRAM (CRP)\n\nThe Critical Reagents Program's (CRP) strategy establishes a core research and development capability to develop biological threat agent, genomic reference materials (antigens, nucleic acids, and antibodies) and detection and diagnostic assays for biothreat agent detection that shall be horizontally inserted across multiple detection and diagnostic platforms.  In addition, this strategy will implement a formal, validated advanced development process to transition new assays into production and integration with the appropriate detection\/diagnostic platform.\n\nEMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES - THERAPUTIC (EID TX)\n\nThe goal of the EID Tx program is to develop a safe and effective MCM against biothreats of interest to the DoD. The first step of the acquisition strategy is to develop an MCM for influenza due to a clear and established FDA regulatory approval pathway.  The Phase 2 clinical trial is complete, demonstrating both safety and efficacy in humans.  Program was authorized by FDA to move forward at End of Phase 2 meeting on 3 SEP 13.  Phase 3 clinical trials for EID Tx against influenza began during 1QFY14.  Following successful FDA approval of the drug against influenza, EID Tx will utilize an incremental approach to label extensions of this broad spectrum therapeutic. The development strategy for additional label extensions of the antiviral drug consists of detailed characterization of antiviral activities of the broad-spectrum compound against multiple virus families using cell-based and animal model systems.  Using the results of the cell-based assays efficacy assessment of the drug against high-priority viruses of biodefense concern will be performed using small animal studies. The results of the small animal testing will determine the best candidate to move forward for the Label Extension starting in FY15.\n\nHEMORRHAGIC FEVER VIRUS (HFV)\n\nThe acquisition strategy uses a parallel evaluation of drug candidates against the lethal Ebola Zaire and Marburg viruses.  Following a successful Milestone B and entry into SDD phase, the program will conduct expanded human clinical safety studies, definitive animal efficacy, and toxicology studies, required for FDA approval.  The performer(s) will submit a New Drug Application(s) for the Ebola Zaire and Marburg therapeutics during the SDD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment phase, full rate manufacturing and stockpile production will be pursued.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, they will be conducted during Production and Deployment.\n\nBOTULINUM  VACCINE (VAC BOT)\n\nThe Prime System Contractor (Dynport Vaccine Company\/DVC LLC, Frederick MD) will function as the FDA regulatory sponsor and will perform all ancillary, regulatory, quality assurance, and data management as required by the FDA. The current budget supports development through FDA licensure of a recombinant bivalent (A and B) botulinum vaccine. Other serotypes will be developed through an evolutionary approach, as funding becomes available.  The Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) phase included the manufacture of candidate current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots, animal safety testing, and initial clinical trials.  During this phase, the vaccine was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a small human clinical trial (Phase 1).  During the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase, the prime contractor stabilized the vaccine formulation, validated the manufacturing process and testing protocols, optimized the delivery systems and manufactured consistency lots.  Phase 2 clinical trials were performed and provided additional safety data. The remaining efforts to be conducted during the SDD phase include the Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety in an expanded volunteer population and evaluation of efficacy in pivotal animal studies to satisfy FDA requirements for the  Animal Rule .  The Low rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision will be conducted after the manufacturing process has been validated and consistency lots have been produced. A Biologics License Application is submitted to the FDA will all clinical, nonclinical, and manufacturing data. The FDA grants licensure to products that are determined to be safe and efficacious.\n\nPLAGUE VACCINE (VAC PLG)\n\nThe Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) phase included the manufacture of candidate current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots, animal safety testing, and initial clinical trials.  During this phase, the vaccine was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a small human clinical trial (Phase 1). In order to reduce technical program risk in the Plague vaccine program, the program office conducted competitive prototyping between a US vaccine candidate and a United Kingdom vaccine candidate.  During the 2008 Resource Allocation Decision, the US Plague Vaccine candidate was selected for development through licensure under a Prime System Contract.  The Prime System Contractor (Dynport Vaccine Company\/DVC LLC, Frederick MD) currently functions as the FDA regulatory sponsor and performs all ancillary, regulatory, quality assurance, and data management as required by the FDA. A Project Arrangement is in place with the United Kingdom and Canada.  During the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase, the prime contractor stabilized the vaccine formulation, validated the manufacturing process and testing protocols, optimized the delivery systems and manufactured consistency lots. Phase 2 clinical trials were performed and provided additional safety data. The remaining efforts to be conducted during the EMD phase include the Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety in an expanded volunteer population and evaluation of efficacy and duration of protection in pivotal animal studies to satisfy FDA requirements for the  Animal Rule .  The Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision will be conducted after the manufacturing process has been validated and consistency lots have been produced. A Biologics License Application will be submitted to the FDA with all clinical, nonclinical, and manufacturing data. The FDA grants licensure to products that are determined to be safe and efficacious.\n\nSPECIAL IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM (VAC SIP)\n\nThe SIP effort is to store IND vaccines used to potentially provide additional protection to laboratory workers performing research on the infectious agents for Tularemia, Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE), Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE), and Q-Fever.  Efforts include Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) storage and periodic potency testing to support the FDA regulated Investigational New Drug (IND) reporting requirements.  This Department of Defense program supports the Federal interagency with this effort, as well as academic and industry partners."

The Bioscavenger program issued a Request For Proposal (RFP) to select the best value for the government for a prophylaxis to support an initial limited user group.  During the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase the program will continue to exercise management oversight with system integration support of a commercial partner to ensure that manufacturing of the product is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines.  The RFP for product manufacturing includes options for transition to the Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) capability.  Prior to FDA licensure, a commercial partner will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, definitive animal efficacy studies, and toxicology studies.  The system integrator will also develop and manufacture a product formulation and delivery system and will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval.  The SDD phase will culminate in FDA licensure of the Bioscavenger.  During the Production and Deployment phase, the Bioscavenger program, in conjunction with a commercial partner, will pursue full rate production and conduct any FDA-mandated post-marketing surveillance studies. Concurrently the Bioscavenger program will conduct an analysis of alternative manufacturing technologies, investigate additional product indications, and pursue an expanded force prophylaxis once alternate technologies have matured.\n\nIMPROVED NERVE AGENT TREATMENT SYSTEM (INATS)\n\nImproved Nerve Agent Treatment Systems (INATS) is an enhanced nerve agent treatment regimen designed to replace and provide improved product performance over the Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto-injector (ATNAA).  The components of the INATS program include: 1) development of a broad spectrum oxime that is effective against emerging threats to replace the fielded currently fielded oxime 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM); 2) product formulation enhancements to increase survival; and 3) expanded pretreatment indications for pyridostigmine bromide (PB).  During the Technology Development Phase, the system integrator will oversee conduct of formulation development efforts, nonclinical toxicology and efficacy studies, Phase 1 human clinical safety studies as well as nonclinical studies to obtain FDA approval for expanding the indications for PB.  Following a successful Milestone B and entry in to the Engineering and Manufacturing (EMD) Phase, the system integrator will continue to exercise management oversight with system integration support from a commercial partner or partners to ensure that the development and manufacture of the INATS is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines.  Prior to FDA licensure, the commercial partner(s) will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, nonclinical toxicology studies and definitive animal efficacy studies. The system integrator will also manufacture an improved oxime formulation and autoinjector delivery system that is stable under operationally relevant temperatures.  The system integrator will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval for the INATS product.  During the Production and Deployment Phase, the system integrator, in conjunction with a commercial partner, will pursue full rate and stockpile production and will conduct any FDA mandated post-marketing surveillance studies.  The system integrator will transfer contracting and logistical responsibilities to the Defense Logistics Agency during the Operations and Support Phase however, as the total life-cycle manager the system integrator will monitor program performance through disposal."
