In FY 2013 the LL Program supported these missions by conducting research and development in five core science and engineering disciplines and four technical initiatives:\n- Advanced Devices, with emphasis on development of materials, devices, and subsystems utilizing microelectronic, photonic, biological, and chemical technologies to enable new system approaches to Department of Defense (DoD) sensors.\n- Optical Systems and Technologies, including the development of focal planes, integrated imagers, imaging and spectroscopic detection systems.\n- RF Systems and Technologies, including the development of novel active and passive Radio Frequency (RF) sensors and development of electronic protection and electronics attack technologies and system concepts.\n- Information, Computation, and Exploitation, which seeks to develop novel architectures, tools, and techniques for the processing, fusion, interpretation, computation, and exploitation of multi-sensor, multi-intelligence data. \n- Cyber Security, includes developing technologies and new techniques for the protection of systems against cyber attack and exploitation.\n- Technical Initiatives, include biological sciences to aid the warfighter and develop tools for biological research; autonomous systems technologies with the objective of developing mobile, autonomous, robotic platforms that demonstrate key capabilities needed for a wide range of defense applications; quantum information sciences to develop basic technologies that support the storage, transport, and computation of quantum information; and novel and engineered materials that utilize nano-manufacturing techniques to create meta or other materials with unique physical and optical properties not readily found in nature.\n\nSupporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts entitled Technical Intelligence and Testbed for Comparative Analysis:\n- Technical Intelligence is working to develop a comprehensive understanding of technology emergence and advancement in a range of relevant scientific areas such as nanotechnology, directed energy, and propulsion.  Some details are classified, but one focus area is working to establish a broad horizon scanning and technology forecasting capability through a collaborative effort by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence Community.  This effort will develop insight into our relative position in science and technology around the world over time, as well as determine potential impacts on DoD capability development and future threat environments.  \n- The Testbed for Comparative Analysis will enable the evaluation of quantitative, horizon scanning and technology forecasting techniques for discovering disruptive technologies that may impact the DoD.  This effort will provide the DoD with objective ways to evaluate the accuracy of existing and future horizon scanning and technology forecasting efforts."
