Funding will provide additional work towards ongoing testing and analysis efforts within the Combat Systems Integration Testing (CSIT), formerly known as Warfare Systems Integration and Interoperability Testing (WSI2T), AEGIS Combat System Advanced Capability Build (ACB) 12, Antisubmarine Warfare Integrated Common Processor\/Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Insertion, the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mission Module development and other major acquisition programs.  In addition, funding will support the development of standards, specifications, and guidance to facilitate NAVSEA-affiliated programs' adoption of this TOC-reducing discipline and technology.\n\nThe ATRT project was previously funded on Program Element 0603582N under Project Unit 9B88: \"Automated Test and Retest (ATRT)\". Per Congressional direction, starting in FY14 and through the outyears, the ATRT project moves to Program Element 0603597N under Project Unit 9B88C: \"Automated Test and Re-Test - Congressional\"."
