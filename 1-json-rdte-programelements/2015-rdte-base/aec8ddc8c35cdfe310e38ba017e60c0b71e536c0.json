HMS is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) ID Program that encompasses specific requirements to support the Special Operations Command (SOCOM), US Army, US Marine Corps, US Air Force and the US Navy communication needs.\n\nHMS provides voice and data communications to the tactical edge\/most disadvantaged Warfighter with an on the move, at the halt, and stationary Line of Sight (LOS)\/ Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability for both dismounted personnel and platforms. HMS radios are software re-programmable, networkable multi-mode system (of systems) capable of simultaneous voice, data and video communications. The embedded Small Form Factor (SFF) versions of HMS will be used for Unmanned Vehicles and other platform applications.\n\nHMS is structured as a single program of record with two phases of development. Phase 1 developed the AN\/PRC-154 Rifleman Radio, SFF-A (one and two channel) and SFF-D radios for use in a sensitive but unclassified environment. Phase 2 developed the AN\/PRC-155 Manpack and embedded SFF-B, both of which are compliant for use in a classified environment. The AN\/PRC-154 Rifleman Radio was modified via an engineering change proposal (ECP) to leverage advances in technology to provide the AN-PRC-154A encrypted secret and below capable radio. Waveforms to be ported to HMS Manpack include: SRW, Single Channel Ground to Air Radio System (SINCGARS), Satellite Communications (SATCOM), and Mobile-User Objective System (MUOS).\n\nThe FY 2015 budget will provide funding that is necessary to execute the required full and open competition contract strategy for the Rifleman and Manpack products. Specifically, the funding is needed to conduct Qualification Tests for both radios and and the Rifleman Radio Operational Assessment of the candidate products to demonstrate compliance with program requirements; assess effectiveness, suitability, and survivability; and to obtain material release. The funding will also support safety, spectrum supportability, and other certifications necessary to prepare the products for fielding."

At the time of PB 2014, all programs associated with this line with the exception of JTRS HMS have been moved to their own PE lines. NED program has been moved to PE 0605030A along with the amount of $23.621 million, AMF program has been moved to PE 0605380A along with the amount of $30.719 million, MIDS program has been moved to PE 0205604N along with the amount of $1.236 million. JTRS HMS currently owns PE 0604280A and both associated Project Codes under it: 162 Network Enterprise Domain (NED) and DZ5 Handheld Manpack and Small Form Fit (HMS).  Starting in FY 2015, all future funding requests for JTRS HMS will be included in Project Code DZ5."

Following full and open competition, qualified NDI Rifleman and Manpack radios will require operationally-relevant testing to inform a FRP decision and to support fielding to Capability Set (CS) units. The contract will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP). The minimum set of waveforms to be supported on the HMS Manpack include: Satellite Communications (SATCOM), Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), and Single Channel Ground to Air Radio System (SINCGARS) waveforms."

Following full and open competition, qualified NDI Rifleman and Manpack radios will require operationally-relevant testing to inform a FRP decision and to support fielding to Capability Set (CS) units. The contract will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP). The minimum set of waveforms to be supported on the HMS Manpack include: Satellite Communications (SATCOM), Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), and Single Channel Ground to Air Radio System (SINCGARS) waveforms."
