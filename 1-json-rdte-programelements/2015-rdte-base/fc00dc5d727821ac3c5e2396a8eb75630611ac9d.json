            "val": "Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) is the Air Force program of record responsible for developing core technologies and sub-nodal analysis tools to horizontally and\/or vertically integrate network collaborative Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems within and across intelligence disciplines. Operational uses of core technologies would include, but are not be limited to, Signals Intelligence to Signals Intelligence (SIGINT-SIGINT) correlation and Ground Moving Target Indicator to Signals Intelligence (GMTI-SIGINT) correlation. Operational uses of sub-nodal analysis tools would include, but are not be limited to, determining which nodes of the adversary's Command,Control,Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects, and modeling execution plans to determine the need to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points in order to redirect activities based on changing battlefield conditions. NCCT software applications employ Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate sensor cross-cues and collection activities. NCCT correlation and fusion services ingest collection data to produce a single, composite track (geo-location and identification) for high-value targets. NCCT research and development funding supports evolutionary development of the NCCT message set and network management systems (Operations Interfaces, Network Controller, Fusion Engines, Data Guard, Interface to Command & Control, and Interface to Overhead Intelligence Operations), the migration of the NCCT technologies to emerging network centric technologies (Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and web services), and satisfying DoD standards and Information Assurance requirements.  \n\nNCCT Core Technology develops the hardware and software to horizontally integrate Joint and Coalition dissimilar Battle Management, Command & Control (BMC2), and ISR assets and systems into integrated target tracks shared across networked platforms. NCCT Core Technology includes, but is not limited to, network management software, operator interfaces, standard network messages and formats, correlation software and data rules of interaction, NCCT multi-level security hardware and software items, and platform specific Platform Interface Modules (PIMs). Current NCCT-enabled systems include, but are not limited to, the RC-135V\/W RIVET JOINT, EC-130H, COMPASS CALL, Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) SIGINT components, Falconer Aerospace Operations Centers (AOC), MC-12W Liberty Project Aircraft (LPA), Forward Processing\/Exploitation\/Dissemination (FPED), Gorgon Stare, Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar (VADER), and Overhead Intelligence Operations (OIO). Prospective Coalition, Joint or Service systems are required to fund their respective integration, unique core technology improvements\/upgrades to support system integration.\n\nInformation Operations Battle Management (IOBM) and the SUTER Program System (SPS) develop concepts, Tactics\/Techniques\/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network. SPS's planning, execution and assessment capability is implemented in a distributed operations architecture taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR, non-kinetic, and\/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets. Impacting these target sets can be achieved by \"attacking\" or influencing\/shaping links, nodes or end points in the network to include: RF and terrestrial links, switches, routers, hubs, servers, IP addresses, cell phones, antennas, radars, microwave relays, SATCOM receivers, transceivers, etc. The three main pieces of the SPS CONOPS include: first, the use of SPS's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second, the SPS's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs, JIOWC, etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third, via SPS's combined network Common Operating Picture (COP), all involved \"players\" monitor the plan's execution, provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities, provide continuous assessment\/updates of the execution of the plan, and, within authorities (Rules of Engagement\/ROEs), re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions. SPS is the technology that assists COCOMs and Components to exercise synchronized dynamic Command and Control (C2) of ISR, kinetic and non-kinetic Joint operations against conventional and terrorist threat networks. SPS provides decision makers and operators supporting airborne, ship-borne, cyber and land- based C2ISR platforms and at supporting locations continuous Predictive Battle-space Awareness (PBA) of the information superiority fight. It also incorporates the machine-to-machine capabilities that rapidly synchronize the employment of kinetic weapons, non-kinetic weapons and ISR assets to target challenging threat systems responsively. SPS depicts a dynamic, multi-security-level picture of current and predicted threat network status, capitalizing on data inputs from sources such as NCCT and Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS). SPS provides a COP that can be tailored to support the integration of ISR, kinetic, and non-kinetic composite target packages supporting COCOM and Component specified information superiority effects and objectives.\n\nThe NCCT program is categorized as Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) is the Air Force program of record responsible for developing core technologies and sub-nodal analysis tools to horizontally and\/or vertically integrate network collaborative Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems within and across intelligence disciplines. Operational uses of core technologies would include, but are not be limited to, Signals Intelligence to Signals Intelligence (SIGINT-SIGINT) correlation and Ground Moving Target Indicator to Signals Intelligence (GMTI-SIGINT) correlation. Operational uses of sub-nodal analysis tools would include, but are not be limited to, determining which nodes of the adversary's Command,Control,Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects, and modeling execution plans to determine the need to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points in order to redirect activities based on changing battlefield conditions. NCCT software applications employ Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate sensor cross-cues and collection activities. NCCT correlation and fusion services ingest collection data to produce a single, composite track (geo-location and identification) for high-value targets. NCCT research and development funding supports evolutionary development of the NCCT message set and network management systems (Operations Interfaces, Network Controller, Fusion Engines, Data Guard, Interface to Command & Control, and Interface to Overhead Intelligence Operations), the migration of the NCCT technologies to emerging network centric technologies (Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and web services), and satisfying DoD standards and Information Assurance requirements.  \n\nNCCT Core Technology develops the hardware and software to horizontally integrate Joint and Coalition dissimilar Battle Management, Command & Control (BMC2), and ISR assets and systems into integrated target tracks shared across networked platforms. NCCT Core Technology includes, but is not limited to, network management software, operator interfaces, standard network messages and formats, correlation software and data rules of interaction, NCCT multi-level security hardware and software items, and platform specific Platform Interface Modules (PIMs). Current NCCT-enabled systems include, but are not limited to, the RC-135V\/W RIVET JOINT, EC-130H, COMPASS CALL, Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) SIGINT components, Falconer Aerospace Operations Centers (AOC), MC-12W Liberty Project Aircraft (LPA), Forward Processing\/Exploitation\/Dissemination (FPED), Gorgon Stare, Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar (VADER), and Overhead Intelligence Operations (OIO). Prospective Coalition, Joint or Service systems are required to fund their respective integration, unique core technology improvements\/upgrades to support system integration.\n\nInformation Operations Battle Management (IOBM) and the SUTER Program System (SPS) develop concepts, Tactics\/Techniques\/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network. SPS's planning, execution and assessment capability is implemented in a distributed operations architecture taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR, non-kinetic, and\/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets. Impacting these target sets can be achieved by \"attacking\" or influencing\/shaping links, nodes or end points in the network to include: RF and terrestrial links, switches, routers, hubs, servers, IP addresses, cell phones, antennas, radars, microwave relays, SATCOM receivers, transceivers, etc. The three main pieces of the SPS CONOPS include: first, the use of SPS's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second, the SPS's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs, JIOWC, etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third, via SPS's combined network Common Operating Picture (COP), all involved \"players\" monitor the plan's execution, provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities, provide continuous assessment\/updates of the execution of the plan, and, within authorities (Rules of Engagement\/ROEs), re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions. SPS is the technology that assists COCOMs and Components to exercise synchronized dynamic Command and Control (C2) of ISR, kinetic and non-kinetic Joint operations against conventional and terrorist threat networks. SPS provides decision makers and operators supporting airborne, ship-borne, cyber and land- based C2ISR platforms and at supporting locations continuous Predictive Battle-space Awareness (PBA) of the information superiority fight. It also incorporates the machine-to-machine capabilities that rapidly synchronize the employment of kinetic weapons, non-kinetic weapons and ISR assets to target challenging threat systems responsively. SPS depicts a dynamic, multi-security-level picture of current and predicted threat network status, capitalizing on data inputs from sources such as NCCT and Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS). SPS provides a COP that can be tailored to support the integration of ISR, kinetic, and non-kinetic composite target packages supporting COCOM and Component specified information superiority effects and objectives.\n\nThe NCCT program is categorized as Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
