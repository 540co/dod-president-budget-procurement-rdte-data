The program will implement systems engineering processes to identify specific BMD performance requirements, investigate major navigation system error sources, define new functions, research new technologies, algorithms, and techniques to improve system performance, conduct analyses of alternatives, create preliminary and final design concepts, develop new hardware components and associated software, and conduct land based and shipboard testing.\n\nThe Navy's current INS is the AN\/WSN-7(V) Ring Laser Gyro Navigator (RLGN), a legacy 1980's design that was first installed in 1998 and is now obsolete.  This is a proprietary design.  Estimates to redesign obsolete components for new production systems for SCN platforms exceed current budgets.  The RLGN is reaching its limit with respect to providing the high-accuracy navigation solution required to meet known and emerging mission requirements.  Navigator of the Navy's Vision 2025 identifies emergent requirements with respect to improved navigation in a GPS denied environment, littoral warfare, mine countermeasures, and manned and unmanned vehicle operations that cannot be met with existing systems.  The RLGN employs an Inertial Measuring Unit (IMU) with three single-axis ring laser gyros that allow the system to provide continuous and automatic data outputs of the ship's geographic position (latitude, longitude), horizontal and vertical linear velocity (Ve, Vn, Vv), attitude (heading, roll, and pitch) and attitude rates.
