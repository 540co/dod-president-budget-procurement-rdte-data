The program also funds development and acquisition of Operational Test Command's (OTC) major field instrumentation.  Requirements for instrumentation are identified through a long range survey of project managers, Research Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs), and Battle Laboratories developing future weapon systems and the test programs that support these systems.  Army testing facilities are also surveyed to determine major testing capability shortfalls."

Funding upgrades and combats parts obsolescence of the radars, telemetry, optics, range safety, communications, command\/control and other equipment essential to meet requirements of the Services and DoD agencies and are crucial for investment protection of the sensor suite.  These upgrades are critical both to maintain a state of the art instrumentation suite and to the successful collection of data supporting test and evaluation assessments and operational decisions for the Army; Navy; Air Force; U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM); Missile Defense Agency (MDA); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); and other customers.  Reagan Test Site (RTS) located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Without the required I&M funding RTS will not be able to continue to meet customer objectives and sustain the required instrumentation suite."

Army Test and Evaluation Command's (ATEC) activities which include: Yuma Test Center (YTC), AZ; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), MD; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), AZ; White Sands Test Center (WSTC), NM; Redstone Test Center (RTC), AL. \n\nProjects are designated as a major test program based on their visibility, assessed relative technical risk (medium-high), schedule risk, cost (greater than $1.5 Million per year or $7.5 Million for the total project) and applicability to other mission areas or services.  These projects are technically demanding, state-of-the-art, unique instrumentation assets or suites to meet the technology shortfalls, and generally result from development programs managed by a professional project management team.  Systems Test and Integration Laboratory (STIL) is the development of a systems integration and test lab for use in developmental testing and integration engineering, including a virtual test environment to support integration testing of aviation electronic systems as a part of modernization of army aircraft.  Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP) will replace obsolete tracking radars at Redstone Test Center (RTC), Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) and Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) with modern instrumentation radars.  Common Range Integrated Instrumentation Systesm (CRIIS) Objective Program provides precision location instrumentation which will significantly increase the T&E ranges' capability to meet the test instrumentation needs of the tri-service range users.  Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) Electromagnetic Radiation Effects (EMRE) Systems Modernization will upgrade equipment at the WSMR EMRE site where E3 testing is performed to evaluate survivability and vulnerability of military systems.  Project will upgrade and replace signal transmitters, refurbish an anechoic test chamber, replace data acquisition equipment and install a new turntable to support test items.  Nuclear Effects Test Capability Modernization upgrades nuclear facilities at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR).  These upgrades include the Relativistic Electron Beam Accelerator (REBA), Fast Burn Reactor, Gamma Range Facility, Linear Electron Accelerator (LINAC), Electromagnetic Pulse and the Solar Furnace. Warrior Injury Assessment Manikin (WIAMan) Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) plans to develop and produce Warrior-representative ATDs that incorporate associated biomedically-validated injury assessment tools to better characterize dynamic events and injury risks measured in Live Fire Test & Evaluation (LFT&E) and vehicle development efforts."

RTCA enables testing under tactical conditions for small and large-scale operations while integrating network operations and effects in support of Army Equipment Modernization Plan.  RTCA also allows the U.S. Army to test all Current-to-Future, weapon systems in a realistic operational environment.  RTCA Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) develops performance enhancements and technology upgrades to the operational test command, control, and communications (C3) center, communications network, weapons system interfaces, vehicle and dismounted-troop kits and peripherals, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), encryption components, and integrates high-fidelity digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools.  These tools will collect, store and analyze data from the digital battlefield.  Improvements will enable the RTCA system to measure and record accrued damage, levels of exposure, effects of countermeasures, evasive action, and instrument threat vehicles.  This capability is required by the operational test community to integrate digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools into the Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) and other operational tests.  \n\nOperational Test Command (OTC) Advanced Simulation & Instrumentation Systems (OASIS) Enterprise Integration System (EIS) supports operational test simulation and test support capabilities and will transition to Advanced Test and Evaluation Enterprise Architecture (ATEA).  Operational testing of enterprise\/systems of systems (SoS) capabilities requires an integrated test technology tools enterprise: 1) Test Planning & Control systems\/networks, 2) Live-virtual-constructive (LVC) simulations, 3) Data Collection, Reduction, Analysis (DCRA), and visualization tools and 4) tactical systems and networks.  OASIS-EIS transition to Advanced Test and Evaluation Enterprise Architecture (ATEA) will support test tool integration in three major areas: 1) OT test technology integration with other acquisition efforts (RTCA, networks, data collection), 2) Joint Network Emulation (JNE) program management, and 3) Shared development and enhancement of key simulation (primarily gaming, virtual, and constructive), and LVC integration capabilities.  Initial focus for shared simulation\/LVC enablers addressed network, indirect fire and ISR simulations, and LVC architecture planning, engineering and integration tools. Current efforts include evolution to ATEA to improve interoperability, better address sustainment operations, and increase standardization across the operational test enterprise."
