This project also funds the Army's test capability at Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. \nThis project finances the overhead (institutional) test operating cost not appropriately billed to test customers, recurring test infrastructure\/capability sustainment requirements, replacement of test equipment, test operating procedures, and test revitalization\/upgrade projects to maintain current testing capabilities and improvements to safety, environmental protection, efficiency of test operations, and technological advances.  The test capabilities at these test ranges have been uniquely established, are in place to support test and evaluation (T&E) requirements of funded weapons programs, and are required to assure technical performance, adherence to safety requirements, reliability, logistics supportability, Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation, transportability, environmental effects, electromagnetic effects, and quality of materiel in development and in production.\nIn accordance with the FY03 NDAA, this project funds the indirect test costs associated with the rapid testing of systems and equipment needed in support of the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), such as individual soldier protection equipment and up-armoring the Army's wheeled vehicle fleet.  This project sustains the test & evaluation capability required to support Army as well as Joint Service or Other Service systems, materiel, and technologies.
