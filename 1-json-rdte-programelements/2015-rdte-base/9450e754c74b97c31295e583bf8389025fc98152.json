This sub-project supports both top-down and bottom-up approaches for USSOCOM Components, Theater Special Operations Commands and Special Operations Task Forces to articulate innovative technology recommendations.  Concepts, ideas, and needs will be submitted to HQ USSOCOM for review and\/or approval as appropriate.  Technical activities in these areas will provide new operational capabilities and will mature technologies to better shape future SOF procurements.\n\n  \u2022  Special Technology Experimentation Sub-Project.  This sub-project conducts a variety of tactical network test bed venues in collaboration with Department Of Defense (DoD) activities.\n\n  \u2022  Special Operations Special Technology Sub-Project.  This sub-project integrates emerging technologies and presents them in technology demonstrations, in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.\n\n  \u2022 Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (TTL) Technologies Sub-Project.  TTL funds SOF unique ATDs identified in the USSOCOM Capabilities Based Assessments.  TTL rapidly prototypes and expeditiously transitions projects from laboratory to acquisition Programs of Record\/operational use to address SOF capability deficiencies.\n\n  \u2022 National to Theater Transition Sub-Project.  Conduct additional testing required to transition items from national forces to theater forces. \n  \n  \u2022 Classified Sub-Project (provided under separate cover).\n\n \u2022 The Special Communications Field Segment-Enterprise program includes organizations, practices, processes, services, networks, systems and subsystems that manage and provide clandestine exchange of information between elements (field-to-field, field-to-base, base-to-field).\n\n  \u2022 Signature Management Technology Demonstrator (details provided under separate cover)."

Includes cyber capabilities that predict the best media channels to reach potential target audiences, data mining and information collections tools, propaganda and social behavior analytical tools, cultural analysis tool sets and emerging technologies that support the planning and analytical needs for the Military Information Support Operations (MISO) forces.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging\/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project integrates efforts and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events and performs market research on emerging technologies that support all phases of MISO.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs.  Seeks technologies that will transform current MISO capabilities through two major objectives: 1) Exploit technologies capable of disseminating products to reach target audiences across a variety of media to include audiences in denied areas.  2) Automate and improve MISO planning and analytical capability through technologies that are integrated into SOF planning systems (Cultural Analysis, Targeting, Theme Development, Media & Product Selection, Distribution & Dissemination, and Measures of Effectiveness).  Develops software applications that increases the efficiency and shortens the timeline to get MISO dissemination packages approved.  Develops hardware\/software tools that facilitate the collaboration and sharing of information and other critical data.  \n\nMISO Modernization.  This initiative will initiate and continue development of emergent technologies available in the marketplace to transform and modernize MISO planning, analysis, development, broadcast, distribution, dissemination, and feedback capabilities. This initiative will also continue development of appropriate emerging technologies initially identified by Advance Technology Demonstrations and Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations to transition to acquisition programs. Technologies include: multi-frequency broadcast systems; digital broadcast capabilities; remote controlled electronic paper; near-real-time command and control of unattended MISO systems, especially in denied areas; focused\/beam speaker sound technologies; visual projection technologies; advanced commercial broadcast technologies including amplitude modulation and frequency modulation radio transmitters and antenna; television transmitter and antenna systems; internet and telephony dissemination and broadcast systems; technologies Capable of long-loiter MISO broadcast and delivery in denied and permissive environment; and technologies that automate and improve MISO planning and analytical capability through integrated capabilities."
