AF\/A9 completed spiral one of two for a Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) Builder model to rapidly build a sourced TPFDD from a database containing a set of Air Force Unit Type Codes (UTCs).  The completed spiral provides an initial PC-based capability to allow campaign analysts to rapidly develop TPFDDs to support Air Force and Joint Service population of OSD Support for Strategic Analysis products. In the second thrust, AF\/A9 supported initial basic research into the building of an overaching Baysian Network framework to allow rapid tradeoffs amongst various ACAT I acquisition programs."
