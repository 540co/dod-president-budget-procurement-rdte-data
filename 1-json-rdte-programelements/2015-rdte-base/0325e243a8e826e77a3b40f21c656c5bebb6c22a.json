This energy conservation project, managed through NAVSEA 05T, will identify mature potential energy saving areas, by involvement with Fleet representatives, Life-Cycle Managers (LCMs), NAVSEA Technical Warrant Holders, In-Service Engineering Agents (ISEAs), PEOs, TMA\/TMI, Industry, and Academia. The project directly supports SECNAV and CNO goals to reduce energy consumption. Potential technology target areas will include: Power Generation and Storage systems, Hull Hydrodynamics, Underwater Hull Husbandry, Heating, Ventilation & Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems, Thermal Management, Man Propulsion Systems, Electrical Systems, Auxiliary Systems, and Energy Monitoring & Assessment."

Planning to install VSD\/CPS on a DDG 51 class hull by the end of FY13, pending ship availability.  Installed VSDs for PUF on LHD 1 for evaluation and activated Shipboard Energy Dashboard (SED) Proof of Concept (PoC) on six DDG Flight IIA hulls for evaluation. Energy performance data on the test ships is being captured for electric plant energy usage and a draft report was issued in April 13. Conducted gap analysis for SED applications for other classes of ships and identified DDG 51 Flight I and LPD 17 Classes as next to pursue. Continue to identify additional fuel saving technologies in Electrical Systems and prepare proposals and Business Case Analyses for promising technologies with potential to reduce fossil fuel consumption."

The information is required to: (a) develop, validate, and execute the test protocols necessary to approve fuels from non-petroleum feedstocks, (b) determine the extent to which unnecessarily restrictive specification features can be relaxed to reduce cost and increase availability worldwide, (c) provide guidance to fleet operators for the safe use of off-specification or commercial grade fuels when military specifications are unavailable or in short supply, (d) technically justify changes to fuel specifications to ensure fuel quality and avoid fleet operating problems while accommodating evolutionary changes in fuel supply, and (e) improve capability to provide fuel quality surveillance in the field. Continued volatility and rapid escalation of the cost of fuel have placed additional pressures on Navy budgets responsible for maintaining and sustaining the Navy tactical fleet both now and in the future. These pressures have placed an added emphasis on the potential use of lower cost commercial fuels and\/or fuels derived from non-petroleum sources as a potential means of stabilizing the current and anticipated price volatility. Recent problems with petroleum-based fuel quality have demonstrated the adverse effects that fuel-related problems can have on ship and aircraft system performance, reliability, and readiness. The program addresses readiness, additional maintenance costs, and the cost of lost equipment. The potential risk of fuel-related problems over the next decade, given the unknown supply, feedstocks, and the introduction of new theaters of operation, will continue to increase. \n\nThis project represents the Navy's only investment designed to maintain its capability to operate as a \"smart\" customer for fuels that cost over $4.0B per year for procurement, transport, storage, and consumption, and are essential to fleet operations. Additionally, it is the Navy's only investment in the approval of alternative fuels for tactical applications and directly supports the Navy's energy goals of increased energy security and environmental stewardship."

                            "val": "Legislation, Executive Orders (EO), and SECNAV Guidance direct DoN to reduce fossil fuel use and increase renewable energy use. This guidance includes the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which directs agencies to reduce energy intensity 30% by 2015, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2010, which directs DOD to source 25% of its energy from renewable sources by 2025, EO13514, which directs DOD to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, and SECNAV energy goals, which direct that 50% of DoN's energy come from alternative sources by 2020. Further, studies by the Defense Science Board and others have stressed the dangerous reliance of DOD on vulnerable grid power and unreliable imported oil. Currently, the Navy has limited options for producing energy from renewable sources. Private industry and other federal agencies are developing and testing new technologies. Renewable energy from the ocean such as wave, sea water air conditioning, tidal energy, outer continental shelf wind development, ammonia production and utilization, vortex induced vibration marine hydrokinetic, and compressed air storage for ocean energy, among other technologies have potential to alleviate current Navy island installation dependence on fossil fuel, at comparable costs to projected fossil energy sources. Also, advanced energy management systems have potential to increase installation energy security and enable broader use of renewable energy sources.\n\nThis Energy RDT&E Project will test, evaluate, and validate components as well as demonstrate cost-effective and technical viability of energy efficiency and renewable energy, energy storage and Alternative Fuel Vehicle prototypes. All efforts will be coordinated across DOD and with other agencies as appropriate. Specifically, this project aims to pursue three areas of development, testing and evaluation: (A) Renewable Energy to support feasibility evaluation, modeling and possible prototype testing of new energy sources for use at Naval installations with potential for widespread applicability to energy security and renewable energy requirements. Other renewable sources for evaluation, modeling and possible prototype testing may include energy storage (dead-ended fuel cell, zinc air battery, etc.), facility level concentrating solar power, next generation solar heat reflective film, plasma lighting for high wattage applications, micro-inverters for photo-voltaic storage, building level micro-grid, new generation waste heat capture, and other technologies; (B) It will support demonstration and validation of advanced electric grid management systems, known as \"Smart Grid\" and \"Micro Grid\" technology, for use at Naval installations to enable improved energy security; (C) Demonstration and Validation of Alternative Energy, Energy Efficiency, Sustainable Building Features, Alternative Fuel Vehicles, and Smart Energy Management Technology: This project will support the testing, demonstration, validation, and application of innovative facility energy efficiency and alternative energy technology."
