            "val": "The F-16 Fighting Falcon is the world's premier multi-mission fighter.  It is a fixed-wing, high performance, single-engine fighter aircraft.  In its 35-year history, the F-16 has proven itself in combat in a variety of air-to-air and air-to-surface missions such as offensive and defensive counter-air, close air support, forward air control, air interdiction (day\/night and all-weather) and suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD)\/destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD).  The F-16 remains the USAF's primary SEAD\/DEAD platform.  The aircraft has evolved in its capabilities by capitalizing upon advancements made in computers, avionics systems, engines, and structures technologies.  The F-16 has been selected by more than 20 air forces around the world and foreign military sales (FMS) production continues in the 21st century.  AFLCMC\/WWM (the F-16 System Program Office) develops, integrates, and qualifies systems to enhance the overall performance of the F-16 mission.  Enhancements that are being or will be developed during the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) include:  \n\na. Operational Flight Program (OFP) Development:  Block 40\/42\/50\/52 OFPs (M-series tapes) are updated continually to integrate new precision weapons, advanced targeting pods, improved avionics, and hardware (HW) and software (SW) mods to keep the F-16s, their respective training simulators, and other hardware Group B subsystems current.  To keep this legacy platform combat capable, OFPs are designed for release on a three-year cycle.  Generally, three major or minor tapes are under development\/testing at any one time.  Extensive ground and flight testing is required to field each M-series tape.  Advanced weapons integration includes Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM) and Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM, Laser JDAM), Small Diameter Bomb (SDB and SDB II), Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) AIM-120D, Sidewinder (AIM-9X\/AIM-9X Block II), and updates to existing weapons.  Weapons integration also includes tasks such as performing risk reduction activities on advanced weapon integration, developing and integrating advanced racks, pylons, adapters, and the universal armament interface (UAI), and ensuring continued nuclear surety, safety and compatibility with upgrades such as the integration of the B61-12.  Updates to electronic warfare systems allow for incorporation of the latest updates for changing threat environment, reducing war-fighter vulnerabilities.  Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) HW block upgrades provides the F-16s with a secure, jam resistant, high-capacity data communications link with other combat aircraft, airborne control aircraft, and ground control centers. The new major capabilities currently being integrated via M6.5\/M7+ include GPS inertial navigation set (GPS\/INS) updates to improve targeting accuracy and GPS security, AIM-120D, joint mission planning system (JMPS).  As part of the Source of Repair Assignment Process (SORAP) decision, the OFP development has transitioned from Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (LM Aero) to Ogden Air Logistics Complex (OO-ALC), 309th Software Maintenance Group (309 SMXG). LM Aero will produce the common USAF\/European Participating Air Forces (EPAF) core software tape for USAF M6.5+ that will serve as the baseline for the USAF M7+ OFP. The 309 SMXG has software development responsibility for the M7+ SW\/HW candidates for the USAF jets fielding in FY16.  M7.2+ Minor Tape is currently in early stages of program planning, candidate definition and test HW procurement to incorporate DoD mandates such as Airborne Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS B-Out) as well as other Combat Air Forces (CAF) candidates including color display and Advanced Defensive Electronic Warfare (EW) System coordination.  M8+ is in early stages of program planning for incorporating Modular Mission Computer (MMC) architecture. \n\n \nb. F-16 Block 40-52 Legacy Service Life Extension Program (SLEP): A two-phased RDT&E effort which includes Full Scale Durability Test (FSDT) and Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) to support structural modifications to Block 40\/42\/50\/52 F-16 aircraft to increase service life.  FSDT required preliminary structural analysis, construction of a test fixture, and modification of an aircraft to begin testing. FSDT is required to prove finite element models and to develop the airworthiness certification basis to extend the current Certified Service Life (CSL) from 8,000 Equivalent Flight Hours (EFH) to 10,000 EFH (Threshold), or 12,000 EFH (Objective).  In accordance with the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program and MIL-STD 1530C, testing will support Blk 40\/42\/50\/52 structural upgrade program that replaces or reworks known life-limited structure to preclude the onset of widespread fatigue damage, maintain safety of flight and enhance aircraft availability beyond 8,000 hours.  EMD is required to develop the engineering solutions necessary to resolve the life-limiting structural issues defined in FSDT and develop the airworthiness certification recommendation. The Government will receive a re-procurement technical data package to support production of kits and installs, maintenance Technical Orders, Time Compliance Technical Orders, manufacturing and installation tools, and all drawing packages necessary to sustain the SLEP modified aircraft through the extended certified service life.  \n\nc. Auto Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto GCAS):  Builds upon the Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) fighter risk reduction program (FRRP) demonstrated capability and results in the Auto GCAS capability being production ready for incorporation in the M6.2+ OFP (Minor Tape) fielding in FY14 with potential for nearly eliminating controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents, a leading cause of F-16 loss of pilots and aircraft.    \n\nd. EMD Hardware\/Advanced Capability Improvements:  EMD HW provides funding to develop, test, and qualify, weapon systems, aircraft subsystems replaced or modified due to requirements changes, pre-planned product improvements (P3I), diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) and parts obsolescence.  The approach to contracting varies by individual project.  These hardware improvements include but are not limited to flight systems, improved navigation, multiplex architecture, MMC advanced hi-speed digital data communication and throughput and memory upgrades within the aircraft systems. Updates are periodically made to improve performance of subsystems such as embedded GPS inertial navigation set (EGI), air-to-air interrogator (AAI), digital video recorder, advanced data transfer equipment (ADTE) and related data transfer and retrieval devices, displays and display generators, radio\/communication gear, and data link improvements.  Advanced capability improvements include software integration, sensor upgrades, radar updates and other self-protection\/electronic protection (EP) enhancements, 4th\/5th gen fighter network communications, lab and\/or on-aircraft evaluation of potential subsystem changes\/capability improvements.  These capability improvements also include integration of targeting pod updates and tech order changes  e.g., SNIPER targeting pod, High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) targeting system (HTS), low altitude infrared targeting and navigation LITENING tageting pod, etc.  Advanced capabilities also include integration of new replacement hardware for DMS crash survivable data recorder. \n\ne. Modular Mission Computer (MMC) \/ Display Generator Upgrade:  The MMC upgrade resolves short falls in mission computer memory and throughput brought on by the addition of incremental combat capability over the last three OFP cycles.  Funding includes non-recurring engineering (NRE), design, development, integration, and ground\/flight test for fielding with the M8+ OFP.  The addition of an Ethernet port facilitates future increments of combat capability (e.g., digital targeting pod video).  The Display Generator Upgrade allows a fully integrated Multi-Function Display System (MFDS) solution including Hands On Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) integration with Sensors of Interest (SOI), format swapping and high definition video on 4\"x4\" displays; provides improved display formats during dynamic maneuvers; resolves symbol freezing issues due to throughput constraints; and provides a sustainable approach to address growing DMS concerns with the current Programmable Display Processor (PDG).\n\nf. F-16 Training Simulators:  The F-16 simulators enable the USAF to exercise and train using the latest available F-16 Fighting Falcon capabilities available to all block configurations, while reducing the overall cost of training the Armed Forces, to include both aircrew and maintenance trainers.  In order to maintain concurrency with the aircraft OFP, this funding supports development, test, and integration of simulator upgrade efforts, such as OFP development.  Reductions in unit flying hour programs through the FYDP increase the need for high fidelity combat crew training devices that are capable of simulating the full range of anticipated combat and combat support missions.  \n\ng. The JASSM-ER (Extended Range):  This capability integrates JASSM-ER on F-16 Blk 40\/42\/50\/52 aircraft, and includes NRE, test assets, SEEK EAGLE, integration, and test.  This capability will be fielded in conjunction with a future OFP delivery.   \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                        "ProjectMissionDescription": {
                            "val": "The F-16 Fighting Falcon is the world's premier multi-mission fighter.  It is a fixed-wing, high performance, single-engine fighter aircraft.  In its 35-year history, the F-16 has proven itself in combat in a variety of air-to-air and air-to-surface missions such as offensive and defensive counter-air, close air support, forward air control, air interdiction (day\/night and all-weather) and suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD)\/destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD).  The F-16 remains the USAF's primary SEAD\/DEAD platform.  The aircraft has evolved in its capabilities by capitalizing upon advancements made in computers, avionics systems, engines, and structures technologies.  The F-16 has been selected by more than 20 air forces around the world and foreign military sales (FMS) production continues in the 21st century.  AFLCMC\/WWM (the F-16 System Program Office) develops, integrates, and qualifies systems to enhance the overall performance of the F-16 mission.  Enhancements that are being or will be developed during the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) include:  \n\na. Operational Flight Program (OFP) Development:  Block 40\/42\/50\/52 OFPs (M-series tapes) are updated continually to integrate new precision weapons, advanced targeting pods, improved avionics, and hardware (HW) and software (SW) mods to keep the F-16s, their respective training simulators, and other hardware Group B subsystems current.  To keep this legacy platform combat capable, OFPs are designed for release on a three-year cycle.  Generally, three major or minor tapes are under development\/testing at any one time.  Extensive ground and flight testing is required to field each M-series tape.  Advanced weapons integration includes Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM) and Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM, Laser JDAM), Small Diameter Bomb (SDB and SDB II), Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) AIM-120D, Sidewinder (AIM-9X\/AIM-9X Block II), and updates to existing weapons.  Weapons integration also includes tasks such as performing risk reduction activities on advanced weapon integration, developing and integrating advanced racks, pylons, adapters, and the universal armament interface (UAI), and ensuring continued nuclear surety, safety and compatibility with upgrades such as the integration of the B61-12.  Updates to electronic warfare systems allow for incorporation of the latest updates for changing threat environment, reducing war-fighter vulnerabilities.  Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) HW block upgrades provides the F-16s with a secure, jam resistant, high-capacity data communications link with other combat aircraft, airborne control aircraft, and ground control centers. The new major capabilities currently being integrated via M6.5\/M7+ include GPS inertial navigation set (GPS\/INS) updates to improve targeting accuracy and GPS security, AIM-120D, joint mission planning system (JMPS).  As part of the Source of Repair Assignment Process (SORAP) decision, the OFP development has transitioned from Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (LM Aero) to Ogden Air Logistics Complex (OO-ALC), 309th Software Maintenance Group (309 SMXG). LM Aero will produce the common USAF\/European Participating Air Forces (EPAF) core software tape for USAF M6.5+ that will serve as the baseline for the USAF M7+ OFP. The 309 SMXG has software development responsibility for the M7+ SW\/HW candidates for the USAF jets fielding in FY16.  M7.2+ Minor Tape is currently in early stages of program planning, candidate definition and test HW procurement to incorporate DoD mandates such as Airborne Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS B-Out) as well as other Combat Air Forces (CAF) candidates including color display and Advanced Defensive Electronic Warfare (EW) System coordination.  M8+ is in early stages of program planning for incorporating Modular Mission Computer (MMC) architecture. \n\n \nb. F-16 Block 40-52 Legacy Service Life Extension Program (SLEP): A two-phased RDT&E effort which includes Full Scale Durability Test (FSDT) and Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) to support structural modifications to Block 40\/42\/50\/52 F-16 aircraft to increase service life.  FSDT required preliminary structural analysis, construction of a test fixture, and modification of an aircraft to begin testing. FSDT is required to prove finite element models and to develop the airworthiness certification basis to extend the current Certified Service Life (CSL) from 8,000 Equivalent Flight Hours (EFH) to 10,000 EFH (Threshold), or 12,000 EFH (Objective).  In accordance with the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program and MIL-STD 1530C, testing will support Blk 40\/42\/50\/52 structural upgrade program that replaces or reworks known life-limited structure to preclude the onset of widespread fatigue damage, maintain safety of flight and enhance aircraft availability beyond 8,000 hours.  EMD is required to develop the engineering solutions necessary to resolve the life-limiting structural issues defined in FSDT and develop the airworthiness certification recommendation. The Government will receive a re-procurement technical data package to support production of kits and installs, maintenance Technical Orders, Time Compliance Technical Orders, manufacturing and installation tools, and all drawing packages necessary to sustain the SLEP modified aircraft through the extended certified service life.  \n\nc. Auto Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto GCAS):  Builds upon the Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) fighter risk reduction program (FRRP) demonstrated capability and results in the Auto GCAS capability being production ready for incorporation in the M6.2+ OFP (Minor Tape) fielding in FY14 with potential for nearly eliminating controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents, a leading cause of F-16 loss of pilots and aircraft.    \n\nd. EMD Hardware\/Advanced Capability Improvements:  EMD HW provides funding to develop, test, and qualify, weapon systems, aircraft subsystems replaced or modified due to requirements changes, pre-planned product improvements (P3I), diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) and parts obsolescence.  The approach to contracting varies by individual project.  These hardware improvements include but are not limited to flight systems, improved navigation, multiplex architecture, MMC advanced hi-speed digital data communication and throughput and memory upgrades within the aircraft systems. Updates are periodically made to improve performance of subsystems such as embedded GPS inertial navigation set (EGI), air-to-air interrogator (AAI), digital video recorder, advanced data transfer equipment (ADTE) and related data transfer and retrieval devices, displays and display generators, radio\/communication gear, and data link improvements.  Advanced capability improvements include software integration, sensor upgrades, radar updates and other self-protection\/electronic protection (EP) enhancements, 4th\/5th gen fighter network communications, lab and\/or on-aircraft evaluation of potential subsystem changes\/capability improvements.  These capability improvements also include integration of targeting pod updates and tech order changes  e.g., SNIPER targeting pod, High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) targeting system (HTS), low altitude infrared targeting and navigation LITENING tageting pod, etc.  Advanced capabilities also include integration of new replacement hardware for DMS crash survivable data recorder. \n\ne. Modular Mission Computer (MMC) \/ Display Generator Upgrade:  The MMC upgrade resolves short falls in mission computer memory and throughput brought on by the addition of incremental combat capability over the last three OFP cycles.  Funding includes non-recurring engineering (NRE), design, development, integration, and ground\/flight test for fielding with the M8+ OFP.  The addition of an Ethernet port facilitates future increments of combat capability (e.g., digital targeting pod video).  The Display Generator Upgrade allows a fully integrated Multi-Function Display System (MFDS) solution including Hands On Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) integration with Sensors of Interest (SOI), format swapping and high definition video on 4\"x4\" displays; provides improved display formats during dynamic maneuvers; resolves symbol freezing issues due to throughput constraints; and provides a sustainable approach to address growing DMS concerns with the current Programmable Display Processor (PDG).\n\nf. F-16 Training Simulators:  The F-16 simulators enable the USAF to exercise and train using the latest available F-16 Fighting Falcon capabilities available to all block configurations, while reducing the overall cost of training the Armed Forces, to include both aircrew and maintenance trainers.  In order to maintain concurrency with the aircraft OFP, this funding supports development, test, and integration of simulator upgrade efforts, such as OFP development.  Reductions in unit flying hour programs through the FYDP increase the need for high fidelity combat crew training devices that are capable of simulating the full range of anticipated combat and combat support missions.  \n\ng. The JASSM-ER (Extended Range):  This capability integrates JASSM-ER on F-16 Blk 40\/42\/50\/52 aircraft, and includes NRE, test assets, SEEK EAGLE, integration, and test.  This capability will be fielded in conjunction with a future OFP delivery.   \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

FSDT required preliminary structural analysis, construction of a test fixture, and modification of an aircraft to begin testing. The FSDT contract awarded Apr 11 and aircraft cycle testing began Dec 12. FSDT is required to prove finite element models and to develop the airworthiness certification basis to extend the current Certified Service Life (CSL) from 8,000 Equivalent Flight Hours (EFH) to 10,000 EFH (Threshold), or 12,000 EFH (Objective).  In accordance with the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program and MIL-STD 1530C, testing will support Blk 40-52 structural upgrade program that replaces or reworks known life-limited structure to preclude the onset of widespread fatigue damage, maintain safety of flight and enhance aircraft availability beyond 8,000 hours.  FSDT is projected to complete cycle testing in Nov 14, with final recommendation in Nov 15.  The Government will receive a re-procurement technical data package to support production and installs, maintenance Technical Orders, Time Compliance Technical Orders, manufacturing and installation tools, and all drawing packages necessary to sustain the SLEP modified aircraft through the extended certified service life.  Production contract is planned to award in FY17, with FRP in FY19."
