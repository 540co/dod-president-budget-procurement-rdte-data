Advanced C4ISR identifies, develops, and readies for transition in association with the Chief Architect and the Director of Engineering the technical solutions that meet BMDS shortfalls identified by the Combatant Commanders. Missile Defense Agency uses the Prioritized Capabilities List (PCL) and the Agency's Achievable Capabilities List (ACL) to prioritize technology investments including Advanced C4ISR. MDA's investments balance the pursuit of promising next generation technology with near-term solutions to enhance existing BMDS capability. \n\nAdvanced Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) develops and matures technology which enables rapid and exponential capability increases in our C2BMC and existing sensor networks.  We will develop and mature technology, software and algorithms which facilitate integration of the Service's command and control networks into the BMDS.  This focus area will invest in advanced C2BMC C4ISR technology that has the potential to increase battlespace for all BMDS interceptors including the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense and Ground-based Interceptors.\n\nThis Program Element includes support for the Discrimination Improvements for Homeland Defense (DIHD) effort. The goal of this effort is to develop and field an integrated set of Element capabilities to improve BMDS reliability, lethality, and discrimination.  The end result will be a deployed future BMDS architecture more capable of discriminating and destroying a reentry vehicle with a high degree of confidence that will improve Warfighter shot doctrine and preserve inventory.  This effort will encompass a DIHD Near-Term capability fielding and a DIHD Mid-Term capability fielding."

A sole source C2BMC follow-on contract to Lockheed Martin for Spiral Development, Operation and Sustainment, and Testing was awarded 1st quarter FY 2012 for an ordering period of 2nd quarter 2012 through 1st quarter 2017. Major team members to Lockheed are Northrop-Grumman, Boeing, Raytheon, and General Dynamics. They are charged with the development, testing, fielding, training, and operations and sustainment support of the C2BMC system. They perform development and testing of C2BMC products in Arlington, VA; Huntsville, AL; and Colorado Springs, CO; and provide worldwide on-site operations and maintenance support. Additionally, the Defense Information Systems Agency supports C2BMC worldwide long-haul communications. C2BMC Program Office government, Federally Funded Research and Development Center\/University Affiliated Research Center, and Contract Support Services personnel are also fully integrated as part of the Prime contractor`s team to function in an Integrated Product Team environment."

The advanced technology development will include development of target acquisition and discrimination algorithms and assessment of performance.  Performance assessment and transition risk reduction will use modeling, simulation, and online or offline assessment of live tracking opportunities. When ready, technology will transition to appropriate program elements for advanced component development and integration into Ballistic Missile Defense System X-Band Radars.\n\nAcquisition will follow the acquisition strategy for radar sustainment and development.  The Radar Sustainment Contract (RSC) will be used for both advanced technology development and for transition of technology to systems. The RSC was awarded in 2012 to sustain all the BMDS X-Band Radars. The contract provides sustainment of previously developed X-Band radar products, such as: 1) Software -maintenance of existing software developed to support the X-Band Radars; 2) Models & Simulation; (a) development, maintenance, and verification of high fidelity models, (b) support for war games and exercises, (c) support for performance assessment events; 3) Engineering Services -engineering support for deployed radars to facilitate maintenance efforts which may include but are not limited to hardware obsolescence studies, hardware redesign, technology insertion, and refurbishment efforts; 4) BMDS Test Planning, Execution, and Analysis -planning, execution and analysis of BMDS test requirements for previously developed hardware and software in accordance with the MDA Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP). The contract is an Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract. The contract scope will be assessed for future competitive awards."
