            "val": "The Lightweight Torpedo (LWT) program designs, integrates and tests the LWT, MK54. LWT provides performance improvements in shallow water, counter-measure environments. The Engineering Development Model (EDM) contract has delivered twenty-one EDM units to support the in-water test program. The EDM contract for the MK54 Mod 1 was awarded to Progeny Systems Corporation in September 2008. The High Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare Weapon Capability (HAAWC) development and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract was awarded to Boeing on April 2013. Initial Operating Capability (IOC) of the MK 54 Mod 0 was achieved in 2004. IOC of the MK 54 equipped VLA was achieved in 2010.\n\nBudget supports Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) program using an incremental developmental acquisition approach combining hardware and Advanced Processor Build (APB) software upgrades to enable rapid fielding of improvements to the fleet. The P3I program will focus on common LWT and Heavyweight Torpedo (HWT) hardware and software architecture enhancements that will provide re-architecture, broadband array improvements, Block Upgrade (BUG), and APB software improvements. Future APB software builds will utilize the common torpedo software to deliver software and tactics to both the MK 48 Advanced Capability (ADCAP) and MK 54 LWT. The P3I program will also support development of enhanced weapon delivery methods, including the high altitude launch of the MK 54 from Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) with the HAAWC."
