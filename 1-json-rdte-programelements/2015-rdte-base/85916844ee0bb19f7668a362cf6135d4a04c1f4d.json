Current weapon system demonstrations and technology development programs include high-speed and hypersonic air-breathing missiles, maneuvering reentry and boost-glide weapons, hypersonic gun-launched projectiles, and air-breathing space access vehicles.  These systems require development of conventional and high-speed turbine, ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle engines; high temperature materials; thermal protection systems (TPS); and thermal management systems.  \n  The High Speed Systems Test (HSST) project addresses test technology needs including propulsion, aerodynamic and aerothermal testing, so the test community has the technology to support the required test scenarios for concepts under development in the science and technology (S&T) community.  The technology developments within the HSST project align with the Department of Defense (DoD) S&T priority investments.  As such, the HSST project is developing, validating and transitioning advanced test and evaluation (T&E) technologies for ground test, open-air range flight test, and advanced computational tools, along with instrumentation and diagnostics systems for use in both ground tests and flight tests of high speed systems.\n  The HSST project develops technologies to enable robust, accurate, and timely T&E of these future weapon systems.  DoD acquisition regulations require weapon systems to undergo a thorough T&E process to detect deficiencies early and to ensure system suitability and survivability.  However, the extreme environments in which these weapons operate preclude accurate determination of their performance and operability with today\u2019s T&E assets.  Current national test capabilities have deficiencies in data accuracy, flight condition replication and simulation, test methods, productivity, modeling and simulation (M&S) fidelity, and range safety.\n  The HSST mission is to address these national test capability gaps by providing test technology solutions that will enable high-speed and hypersonic weapon systems to be successfully developed through accurate, robust, and efficient T&E."

Current production ground test facilities could only create the high temperature inlet conditions necessary for scramjet engine tests by burning fuel in the airflow prior to entering the engine.  As demonstrated by HSST FY 2011 tests, the resulting \u201cvitiated air\u201d had different gas properties than clean air and was not representative of what the vehicle would experience during flight.  This significantly affected the engine\u2019s performance and operability in the test environment resulting in erroneous flight performance predictions.  Variable Mach number capability is required to \u201cfly the mission\u201d and determine the critical transient operability effects throughout the flight envelope.  Incorporation of component technologies, previously developed by the T&E\/S&T program, were initiated into a small-scale, clean air, true temperature, variable Mach number 5-8 aero propulsion test facility.  Completion of this facility will demonstrate component technologies have reached Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, provide an on-going test asset to the DoD, and reduce risk for construction of a full-scale facility.  Significant progress was made this year in Phase I of the facility development including the completed installation of the clean air regenerative storage heater, associated support systems, instrumentation and controls required for facility operation.  Design efforts for subsequent phases progressed including the critical design of the air delivery system and preliminary design of a variable Mach number nozzle.  Another FY2013 effort examined the incorporation of advanced morphing ceramic materials into the design of common facility nozzle and ducting hardware to achieve a variable Mach number capability and variable inlet distortion patterns representative of flight-like inlet systems.  This capability reached critical design and promises to provide a significant advantage over current rigid, stationary facility hardware by providing a \u201cfirst-ever\u201d realistic variable Mach flight distortion simulation test capability, while reducing test cost and increasing productivity.\n  Ground test accomplishments included continued progress in determining the capability of existing ground test facilities and methodologies to evaluate and develop large-scale hypersonic propulsion systems.  Following the successful completion of the benchmark freejet test series utilizing an advanced hydrocarbon fueled missile scale scramjet in a larger facility, the semi-freejet and direct-connect test configurations were initiated in a smaller facility. The resulting analysis comparing tests between the larger and smaller facilities will allow the optimized utilization of existing facilities.  In addition this effort will help define the size and type of investments needed for future large-scale scramjet vehicle development and reduction of flight test and acquisition risks.  The hypersonic community\u2019s first rigorous assessment of data uncertainty was completed on the freejet test series per the US National Standard on measurement uncertainty, which will serve as a precedent for future high-speed propulsion system development. Another task was initiated to examine the unique and extensive set of ground and flight test data collected by the X-51 program so that it can be utilized in the development of state-of-the-art techniques for high speed engine design, development and testing. The HSST project initiated an effort to address critical arc heater technologies and flow quality gaps; this development will improve the service lives of the electrodes and improve nozzle flow quality.  Improved computational and numerical simulation models were completed involving magnetic field and arc column interactions with the air flow in the heater necessary to investigate advanced designs and allow for time\/memory efficient parallel computing of the simulations.\n  The autonomous flight safety technology was matured to TRL 6 and prototype units were designed and delivered for service certification onboard two Operationally Responsive Space Office flight tests.  Another flight test technology effort completed the successful development and programing of advanced parameter identification maneuvers into the flight computer of the fourth X-51 flight.  Subsequent analysis of these optimized test maneuvers demonstrated the ability to collect substantially more stability and control data per flight than is possible using traditional methods, thus reducing the number of flight tests and costs for future development systems.\n  Progress was also made in advanced high speed system ground and flight test instrumentation.  The initial phase was completed on a ground based, portable Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system to measure atmospheric conditions (density, temperature, pressure, wind speed\/direction, O2 content) along a hypersonic vehicle\u2019s flight path from altitudes of 60k to 250k feet.  This initial phase demonstrated the ability to measure these conditions using the LIDAR system at the GroundWinds facility in Mauna Loa, Hawaii at altitudes representative of hypersonic vehicle flight trajectories. This capability will be a significant advancement over current technologies, improving the accuracy of determining atmospheric conditions at high altitudes needed for assessing the performance and operability of air-breathing missiles and boost-glide vehicles during development.  A project was initiated to develop a force balance system with high stiffness and frequency response to make measurements in hypervelocity flows with test times of 1-2 milliseconds.  This will substantially increase the accuracy of high Mach force measurements that are required to evaluate and improve models of air chemistry in design and prediction codes. An advanced system to measure gas properties in high speed flows was constructed utilizing lasers operating in the mid-infrared spectrum.  This system, which significantly lowers gas property measurement uncertainty, was transitioned to a DoD ground test center and a DoD research laboratory.  A miniaturized, temperature-compensated wind tunnel balance for supersonic store separation testing was constructed and transitioned.  Design, fabrication and demonstration of a non-intrusive laser hygrometer and a non-intrusive optical mass flow measurement system were completed.  Testing of a fiber optic heat flux gauge and a high temperature shear stress sensor were also successfully completed.\n  Advances were achieved in the development of a state-of-the-art validated computational M&S tools.  An advanced three-dimensional boundary layer transition code and hypersonic nozzle Characteristics Based Grid Generation code have been developed and transitioned to the hypersonic community for beta testing.  Recent wind tunnel and flight tests have provided data demonstrating that a fully three-dimensional flow boundary layer stability and transition prediction code is an essential engineering tool needed to evaluate and predict boundary layer instability and transition on maneuverable boost-glide vehicles currently under development by the DoD. Computed tomography methods for optical absorption measurements were completed; these create two-dimensional spatial maps of exhaust gas properties from multi-line-of-sight Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) measurements for verifying computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code predictions and for determining combustion efficiency for turbine and scramjet engines.

A vast amount of data must be collected, transmitted, and analyzed, which requires a large amount of radio frequency (RF) spectrum resources.  However, the amount of RF spectrum designated to support test and evaluation (T&E) is decreasing, most notably due to reallocation of spectrum for commercial use.  The combination of decreasing RF spectrum and increasing data requirements results in an urgent need to create test technologies that maximize the use of spectrum resources for Department of Defense (DoD) T&E operations.\n  The L and S frequency bands are the traditional spectrum allotted for military use.  The explosive need for spectrum in the commercial sector has resulted in reallocation of portions of these bands to industry.  To compensate, DoD is now authorized to use the C-Band spectrum which offers numerous benefits, including a three-fold increase in available bandwidth, but C-Band comes with technical challenges.  Most notably, our current test infrastructure for telemetry is not designed to accommodate C-Band.  Technologies are required to implement innovative techniques that efficiently facilitate our use of C-Band without a major overhaul to our national test infrastructure.  For instance, commercial telemetry transmitters operate in C-Band but do not have the form factor (size and weight) or rugged packaging to survive airborne test applications.\n  Traditional telemetry applications employ streaming telemetry where data is moved one-way from the instrumented system under test to our test infrastructure.  Modern network based telemetry capabilities, like those being developed by the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry (iNET) effort, enable more robust, efficient bidirectional transfer of data.  DoD\u2019s strategy is to create technologies for streaming telemetry capability in C-Band while opening up legacy L- and S-Bands for networked telemetry.\n  The Spectrum Efficient Technology (SET) project is developing test technologies that enable more efficient use of legacy telemetry bands and expansion into non-traditional areas of the RF and optical spectra at DoD test ranges.  The technology development efforts within the SET project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments. As such, the SET project is focusing on growing data requirements of warfighting systems and the limited availability of spectrum for testing.  The SET project is structured to develop test technologies to advance range communications, networked telemetry capabilities, and enhanced management of spectrum at DoD test ranges."

Development of a multi-band transceiver operating in the L\/S\/C-Band spectrum employing multiple advanced waveforms continued.  \n  The SET project investigated techniques to expand telemetry operations into non-traditional spectrum bands by characterizing multipath effects in multiple range environments, specifically regarding missile test missions.  Additionally, the SET project continued efforts to develop the required hardware components (antenna, transmitter) required to conduct a missile test mission.  Testing of this hardware began to characterize the telemetry link performance of the C-Band spectrum versus the legacy S-Band spectrum. SET continued efforts to develop airborne phased array antenna technology to enable flexible scheduling of the T&E spectrum by incorporating both the traditional L\/S bands and recently permitted C-Band frequencies.  Some of these technologies will reduce the technical risk associated with beam steering in the C-Band frequencies, reduce the amount of infrastructure modifications needed to implement a C-Band telemetry capability, and provide over-the-horizon data connectivity to test large-footprint weapons, such as long range missiles.\n  The SET project completed the development of a three dimensional channel model tool for modeling and simulation of telemetry channels in various environments.

Our ability to counter such threats is essential to owning the airspace in theater.  Therefore, the ability to test missile warning systems (MWS), hostile fire indicators, IR countermeasures (IRCM), and advanced threat sensors is critical to our national defense.  Additionally, a new generation of enemy radio frequency (RF) missile seekers is both currently fielded and in further development, requiring a correspondingly new generation of test technologies to test the latest countermeasures.  The test and evaluation (T&E) community is required to test IRCM and RF countermeasure systems in a repeatable manner with ground-truth data before and after integration into warfighting systems.  Without new test technologies, the Department of Defense (DoD) will be unable to perform adequate T&E of advanced warning and countermeasure systems.\n  The technology development efforts within the EWT project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the EWT project is focusing on the test needs in both the electro-optic (EO), including IR, and the RF threat domains.  Additionally, development of core test technologies in this area can be leveraged to meet other EO and RF test requirements, such as in fire control systems, reconnaissance sensors, and missile seeker subsystems.\n  The EWT project develops test technologies to stimulate IRCM and RF system sensors through the high-fidelity simulation of scenes viewed by the sensors.  Stimulation can be as simple as testing to see if a system under test responds to an image or as complex as simulating complex battle space phenomena to measure the response of a system under test in a more relevant, cluttered scenario.  Simulations and stimulations are used at open air ranges and in installed system test facilities (ISTF), and in hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) test beds."

Instrumentation requirements for systems under test are increasing exponentially for new weapons systems.  Vehicle on-board and warfighter wearable instrumentation packages are required.  This instrumentation is for sensing and collecting critical performance data; determining accurate time, space, position information (TSPI)and attitude information; interfacing with command and control data links; monitoring and reporting system-wide communications; recording human operator performance; and storing and transmitting data.\n  The technology development efforts within the AIST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&T) priority investments, particularly in support of human systems, engineered resilient systems, and counter weapons of mass destruction.  The AIST project is focused on supporting technology developments for advanced TSPI instrumentation (especially with limited or no use of the Global Positioning System (GPS)), advanced sensors, advanced energy and power systems for instrumentation, non-intrusive instrumentation, mitigating range encroachment issues, and measuring warfighter cognitive performance.  \n  The AIST project addresses requirements for miniaturized, non-intrusive instrumentation suites with increased survivability in harsh environments.  Such instrumentation is an urgent need because minimal space is available to add instrumentation to new or existing weapon systems subsequent to their development; furthermore, additional weight and power draw for instrumentation can adversely affect weapon system signature and performance.  Instrumentation for humans-in-the-loop, such as dismounted soldiers, must not adversely affect soldier performance, induce artificiality in the test environment, nor create operational burden.  New technologies can be exploited to integrate small, non-intrusive instrumentation into emerging platforms during design and development, and, in some cases, into existing platforms.  This class of instrumentation will provide critical system performance data during test and continuous assessment throughout a system\u2019s lifecycle.  Technology developed under AIST can also benefit training and combat missions by enabling a continual feedback loop between the developer, training staff, operators and commanders."

Consequently, a continued major thrust for FY 2013 included the development of test technologies to support collection of TSPI for warfighter systems (manned or unmanned), particularly in GPS-denied or degraded environments, such as in urban canyons and tunnels.  Efforts to test systems that operate in a GPS-denied environment included technology that employs a layered system of sensors leveraging collaborative navigation, existing radio frequency (RF) ranging technology, and a Doppler velocimeter to achieve more precise TSPI under GPS-impaired conditions.  Preliminary testing in a realistic environment was successfully conducted in both open-air and RF-challenged environments achieving sub-meter tracking accuracies.  An inertial tracking system for dismounted warfighters continued in development; the system employs boot-mounted sensors to provide sub-meter geolocation over GPS-denied durations of greater than 2 hours.  System integration and performance testing were conducted; design improvements are ongoing.\n  To support testing of high-speed, high-acceleration systems, an ultra-high dynamics GPS receiver was developed.  The receiver performs significantly better than existing test instrumentation.  The AIST project gathered requirements for future test and evaluation GPS dependent TSPI activities, conducted analyses and mapped a way forward with respect to the development of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design architectures for next generation solutions.\n  In support of other instrumentation solutions, an electro-releasable attachment technology development effort continued.  This included investigation of new adhesive formulations that employ an electrically releasing foil patch to allow attachment of sensors to non-conductive, painted exterior surfaces of aircraft and other combat vehicles.  The goal is to provide immediate attachment for a test and significantly reduce the time to restore the system under test to its operational configuration.  \n  To support Electromagnetic Rail Gun (EMRG) developments, AIST continued development of a fiber-optic instrumentation suite to integrate into test projectiles to measure magnetic field strength in the harsh environment of an EMRG test firing.  Powered air gun testing was successfully conducted at 50,000G levels at the Army Research Lab\u2019s Adelphi site.  Preparations are underway to support full-up testing of an EMRG shot at the Naval Surface Warfare Center-Dahlgren Division.  \n  The AIST project developed algorithms and methods for automated detection and classification of marine mammal vocalizations from ocean floor range sensors (e.g., hydrophones) to improve testing at DoD undersea range complexes.  Testing has been successfully conducted at undersea ranges and a baseline classifier for 6 marine mammal species is currently running real-time, range-wide at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center, Pacific Range Missile Facility, and the Southern California Offshore Range.  This test technology allows the Navy to conduct critical test and evaluation (T&E) events without adversely impacting marine mammal populations, and to support the Navy\u2019s Integrated Comprehensive Monitoring Program (ICMP) ensuring adherence to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).\n  Several efforts were initiated to develop technologies to:  (1) measure position and attitude (six degrees of freedom) of high-velocity, spinning projectiles at accuracies that significantly exceed the system under test guidance system; (2) measure soldier\/soldier system indoor location (GPS-denied environment) at sub-meter accuracies using ambient AM radio broadcast signals; (3) provide seamless transition between outdoor and indoor environments to accurately track systems under test using modified GPS receivers, relayed GPS signals, and multi-lateration and multipath mitigation techniques; (4) use passive imaging to characterize munitions\/warhead fragment size, velocity, and distribution, and significantly reduce set-up times and data analysis costs of current warhead arena test techniques; (5) accurately provide dynamic measurements and display the warfighter body posture, head and weapon orientation using fiber optic shape sensing of fibers integrated into uniforms and equipment; and (6) assess warfighter cognitive states using algorithms and measurements of brain electrical activity and brain blood oxygen levels. \n  An effort was initiated to investigate mitigation of the impacts of wind energy system interference on test range radars.  \n  Efforts continued to assess and leverage microsystems technology under development at universities, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and government laboratories.  These efforts will provide significant advances to T&E of modern war fighting systems."

Additionally, AIST will continue to pursue test technologies for non-intrusive, advanced data acquisition and transformation that operate on reduced power along with the development of advanced power sources for test instrumentation.  The AIST project will complete its assessment of emerging microsystems technology and develop a roadmap for potentially leveraging microsystems technologies in instrumentation at DoD ranges.\n  The AIST project will complete: the development and testing of classifiers to identify specific sea mammals (e.g., various dolphins and whales species) found at undersea ranges; the development and testing of magnetic field sensors for the harsh environment of electromagnetic rail gun test firings; an attachment technology that does not require any solvents to restore test articles to operational condition; and several efforts for collecting TSPI on dismounted warfighters and related systems in GPS-denied or degraded environments such as those found in urban and subterranean operations."

A robust test capability to assess directed energy weapons is essential to understanding their effectiveness and limitations, including determining their effectiveness in performing counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) operations.  Such assessments will depend upon knowledge acquired through the test and evaluation (T&E) of directed energy technologies and testing of operational concepts.  Directed energy weapon technologies, primarily consisting of high energy lasers (HEL) and high powered microwaves (HPM), are outpacing available test capabilities.  Traditional test techniques for evaluating conventional munitions (with flight times ranging from seconds to minutes) are not sufficient for the T&E of directed energy weapons that place energy on target instantaneously.  Consequently, new test technology solutions are needed to ensure that adequate developmental, live-fire, and operational test capabilities are available when directed energy programs are ready to test.\n  Directed energy system and component testing requires three principal assessments:  (1) energy or power on target; (2) the effects on the target; and (3) the propagation of the directed energy to the target through the atmosphere.  In addition, the vulnerabilities of DoD systems to directed energy threats are required to be characterized in accordance with Military Standard (MIL-STD)-464C.  Equally as important, current test capabilities do not provide the detailed data required to understand U.S. directed energy system performance and effects.\n  The technology development efforts within the Directed Energy Test (DET) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the DET project is developing the technologies necessary for quantitative assessment of United States HEL and HPM performance, as well as the vulnerability of DoD weapon systems to enemy directed energy threats."

Regarding HEL atmospheric propagation, a multi-light detection and ranging system to measure important atmospheric profiles along a slant path adjacent to the HEL beam propagation path continued.  This technology simultaneously measured profiles for three parameters: optical turbulence, water vapor content, and aerosol attenuation.  Measuring these profiles will enable understanding of how atmospheric effects distort HEL beam propagation.  A maritime version of this technology was initiated.\n   Testing of electric field sensors continued in support of electromagnetic rail gun T&E and identified a prime source for indicating rail wear, a key issue for rail gun systems.  To better support HPM C-IED testing, DET completed a test technology development to measure soil electrical properties using a brass board sensor with three interchangeable heads to cover the required frequencies.  \n  A demonstration of HEL sensor technologies on an unmanned aerial vehicle was completed; the demonstration verified the ability of the sensors to measure HEL energy on target while the HEL illuminated the aircraft to disable its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems."

Technology development to automate the processes that analyze and evaluate multiple SoS in a joint cross-Service mission context were also initiated. Other efforts included technology development for planning a complex, multi-system, mission-level net-centric test in a distributed live-virtual-constructive (LVC) environment and controlling test execution through management of the mission scenario.  The NST project developed test planning technologies to address test integration and interoperability issues.  Machine reasoning capabilities were extended and integrated to automate test planning tasks.  The NST project continued development of a planning and visualization technology to support joint mission thread testing to better correlate test data to the effectiveness of mission operations.\n  The NST project advanced technologies to support the execution of distributed tests with active network control, enhanced the dynamic management of the test infrastructure, and improved the integration of Service laboratories and test ranges.  These technologies were transitioned and integrated into the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) that was used by the Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) Program and at test facilities and training ranges.  \n  The NST project developed predictive smart dead-reckoning technology to address the challenge to adequately synchronize the distributed test environment.  This effort provided the necessary distributed intelligence to manage time space position information (TSPI) updates in the net-centric test battlespace with a distributed LVC architecture.  The NST project built upon previously developed NST technologies to solve the test challenges of producing accurate TSPI predictions under all network conditions, to include both unpredictable network latency and missing information.  Since the predictive smart dead-reckoning technology is built on top of the policy-enabled agent, it will be able to provide fast response under complex test event conditions.  The CTEIP Joint Distributed Infrared Countermeasures Ground-Testing System (JDIGS) project tested and validated this NST project to further improve the error performance for JDIGS testing over the JMETC network.  \n  The NST project also developed technologies for the next generation of TENA middleware that supported a broad range of networks, including wireless networks, and provided native support for handheld and embedded computing platforms.  Global Positioning System and accelerometer test data were successfully transmitted over commercial cellular carriers using an encrypted virtual private network.  The NST project transitioned technology to the Edwards Air Force Base Instrumentation Group by successfully demonstrating TENA connectivity through wireless networks providing a live or file replay of flight line instrumentation data on wireless tablet devices with real-time synchronization."

The emergence of unmanned systems brings a host of revolutionary capabilities that will profoundly influence warfare.  The Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Test (UAST) project addresses current and emerging challenges associated with the test and evaluation (T&E) of these critical warfighting capabilities.  The technology development efforts within the UAST project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense (DoD) guidance on science and technology priority investments, particularly in assessing autonomy.  As such, the UAST project is developing test technologies to simulate, stimulate, instrument, measure, and assess autonomous systems\u2019 ability to perceive its environment, process information, adapt to dynamic conditions, make decisions, and effectively act on those decisions in the context of mission execution.\n  The UAST project will provide the test technologies to effectively measure performance and characterize risk, thereby increasing warfighter trust in autonomous systems.  Current DoD test capabilities and methodologies are insufficient to address the testing of increasingly autonomous units and teams of unmanned systems operating in unstructured, dynamic, battlespace environments.  Furthermore, advancements are being made in developing collaborating system-of-autonomous-systems, working in concert as a swarm or pack and in close proximity with humans.  New test technologies are needed to stress the collective set of autonomous systems under realistic conditions, predict emergent behavior of autonomous systems, emulate the complex environment, and assess mission performance of these highly coupled and intelligent systems."

The complexity of operational unmanned and autonomous systems, with all possible interactions occurring between sensing, perception, reasoning, mapping, decision making and action, resulted in an almost infinite set of potential interactions and correspondingly, an almost infinite set of test conditions.  An effort was initiated to employ evolutionary\/genetic algorithms in a software-in-the-loop environment to accurately predict the fault conditions of a complex, long-duration autonomous system.  Initially supporting testing of the Large Displacement \u2013 Unmanned Underwater Vehicle, this test technology was extended to improve the ability to predict fault conditions and focus test strategies for other types of unmanned vehicles. The UAST project effort initiated work to enhance safety of autonomous system testing to prevent unsafe UAS operations\/actions. Additionally, work began to develop methods to measure autonomous system reliability and performance by providing complex and interactive live, virtual, constructive (LVC) test environments to stimulate UASs so their response and performance can be observed, recorded, and compared to pre-test simulations.\n  In the area of autonomous system performance assessment, test technology development continued to enable automated autonomy architecture stress testing, with a focus on UAS software and the interfaces of the core components without requiring source code.  The approach was agnostic to the specific component interface.  This technology provided the tester with a perspective of system performance and a previously unavailable prediction of behavior.  Recent stress-testing of a representative ground-based UAS system identified vulnerability issues at the command interface layer of the system.  Additionally, in the area of autonomous system performance assessment, a virtual UAS proving ground was designed that used environmental data from external sources (to include imagery from operational areas of interest) and injected that data into simulations of a given UAS to predict the behavior of the system in the operational environment.  An initial demonstration of this test technology facilitated efficient testing in operationally representative environments at Savannah River Test Site and Aberdeen Test Center and allowed for safe operations at \u201cedge of the envelope\u201d performance parameters."

The UAST project will deliver a roadmap of potential test technology needs for testing autonomous systems at DoD ranges. The effort investigating the stress testing of autonomy architectures will be completed and the results transitioned to the test ranges.  The resulting autonomy architecture stressing technology will be transitioned initially to Army Test and Evaluation Command, Aberdeen Test Center, but is designed to be extensible, enabling widespread use across the Major Range and Test Facility Base.

The Cyberspace Test Technology (CTT) project will develop advanced technologies and methodologies to test and evaluate DoD capabilities and information networks to defend and conduct full-spectrum military operations across cyberspace.  Current cyberspace T&E capabilities are insufficient to support the continual experimental, contractor, developmental, operational, and live-fire testing requirements of warfighter systems operating in cyberspace.  Many of the test tools and infrastructure items required for systems in cyberspace will need advancement and maturation of various nascent test technologies.  The CTT project has been aligned with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&T) priorities, specifically in the area of Cyber S&T.  The CTT project will address test technology shortfalls in cyberspace testing, including planning cyberspace tests, creating representative cyberspace threats, and executing cyberspace tests."
