            "val": "The B-1B Lancer is a swing-wing, supersonic, long-range, conventional bomber.  It carries the largest payload of both guided and unguided weapons in the United States Air Force inventory.  The multi-mission B-1B is the backbone of America's long-range conventional bomber force and can rapidly deliver massive quantities of precision and non-precision weapons against any adversary, anywhere in the world, at any time. The current service life extends beyond 2040.\n\nThis effort provides funding for B-1B modernization programs.  These modernization programs alleviate aircraft obsolescence issues due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) while at the same time providing improved capabilities to the B-1B weapon system that require significant hardware and software development and testing. \n\nFunds address upgrades to the Secure Line of Sight (SLOS) \/ Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) \/ Air Radio Communication (ARC-210) voice capability.  The SLOS\/BLOS ARC 210 voice capability adds secure voice capabilities to the radio currently utilized only for secure data.  This will add much needed capability to our forces currently operating in forward locations.  This program is an Urgent Operational Need (UON).\n\nB-1B training systems upgrades(both flight and maintenance simulators\/trainers) are complementary to the aircraft Central Integrated Test System (CITS), Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL), and Vertical Situational Display Upgrade (VSDU) modernization programs.  These upgrades are required to bring the simulators up to the same configuration of the modernized aircraft.  The B-1B training system provides the war fighter fully integrated, cost effective, high fidelity training in flight operations, weapons employment, and maintenance of the B-1B weapon system.  \n\nAircraft RDT&E efforts include development of a Self-Contained Standby Attitude Indicator (SCAI).  This development activity will replace three standby flight indicators (attitude indicator, altimeter, and airspeed indicator) with a more reliable\/supportable commercial off-the-shelf display that combines all necessary flight information into one device.   If the primary flight instruments are lost, SCAI will continue to provide the primary flight information needed to fly the aircraft.  Standby instrumentation must be functional and reliable in the event of primary flight display failure, and is a Mission-Essential Subsystem List (MESL) item required for flight.  \n\nUpgrades to the B-1B flight test aircraft are included in the modernization programs to keep the test flight systems current.  RDT&E funded test jets are currently configured with Engineering, Manufacture, and Development (EMD) Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) for CITS, FIDL and VSDU.  Replacement of the EMD LRUs is required to bring two flight test aircraft to fleet representative configuration.  Maintenance and logistic support from the manufacturer is required until the Air Force supply chain is established.  Replacement of the LRUs will ensure maximum supportability, maintainability, and reliability for continued and future flight tests.  \n\nAdditionally, program funds cover engineering\/planning studies, related engineering efforts, and auxiliary equipment needed for development programs that have not yet fielded.  Cost includes Program Management Administrative (PMA) costs and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, including efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total ownership cost.  All B-1B development programs support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases. \n\t\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development; budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipated production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The SLOS\/BLOS ARC 210 voice capability adds secure voice capabilities to the radio currently utilized only for secure data.  This will add much needed capability to our forces currently operating in forward locations.  This program is an Urgent Operational Need (UON).\n\nB-1B training systems upgrades(both flight and maintenance simulators\/trainers) are complementary to the aircraft Central Integrated Test System (CITS), Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL), and Vertical Situational Display Upgrade (VSDU) modernization programs.  These upgrades are required to bring the simulators up to the same configuration of the modernized aircraft.  The B-1B training system provides the war fighter fully integrated, cost effective, high fidelity training in flight operations, weapons employment, and maintenance of the B-1B weapon system.  \n\nAircraft RDT&E efforts include development of a Self-Contained Standby Attitude Indicator (SCAI).  This development activity will replace three standby flight indicators (attitude indicator, altimeter, and airspeed indicator) with a more reliable\/supportable commercial off-the-shelf display that combines all necessary flight information into one device.   If the primary flight instruments are lost, SCAI will continue to provide the primary flight information needed to fly the aircraft.  Standby instrumentation must be functional and reliable in the event of primary flight display failure, and is a Mission-Essential Subsystem List (MESL) item required for flight.  \n\nUpgrades to the B-1B flight test aircraft are included in the modernization programs to keep the test flight systems current.  RDT&E funded test jets are currently configured with Engineering, Manufacture, and Development (EMD) Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) for CITS, FIDL and VSDU.  Replacement of the EMD LRUs is required to bring two flight test aircraft to fleet representative configuration.  Maintenance and logistic support from the manufacturer is required until the Air Force supply chain is established.  Replacement of the LRUs will ensure maximum supportability, maintainability, and reliability for continued and future flight tests.  \n\nAdditionally, program funds cover engineering\/planning studies, related engineering efforts, and auxiliary equipment needed for development programs that have not yet fielded.  Cost includes Program Management Administrative (PMA) costs and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, including efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total ownership cost.  All B-1B development programs support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases. \n\t\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development; budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipated production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
