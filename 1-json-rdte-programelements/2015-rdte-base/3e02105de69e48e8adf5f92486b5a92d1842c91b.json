            "val": "0954 - The Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) Block 1 provides enhanced Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities to existing and new ship combat systems to improve Anti Ship Missile Defense (ASMD), counter-targeting and counter surveillance capabilities, as well as improved situational awareness. The SEWIP Block 1 employs an evolutionary acquisition and incremental development strategy to upgrade surface EW capabilities via a series of block upgrades to the AN\/SLQ-32(V) system, and field EW improvements to counter the ASMD threat.  SEWIP Block 1 will provide required EW capabilities and will incorporate technology advances as they become available to provide incremental upgrades and improvements in performance. \n\n2190 - The Offboard Active Decoy (NULKA) is a joint cooperative program between the United States and Australia that developed an active offboard decoy that utilizes a broadband radio frequency repeater mounted atop a hovering rocket. NULKA is designed to counter a wide variety of present and future radar guided Anti-Ship Missiles (ASMs) by radiating a large radar cross section while flying a ship-like trajectory. The United States developed the electronic payload and fire control system, while Australia developed the hovering rocket.  Future efforts involve development of the capability for high value unit protection.\n\n3227 - SEWIP Block 2 is developing an upgraded antenna, receiver, and combat system interface for SLQ-32. The upgrades are necessary in order to pace the threat, improving detection, accuracy, and mitigation of Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). \n\n3316 - The Advanced Offboard EW (AOEW) program is for the development of long duration off-board decoys integrated with onboard systems for EW coordination to counter identified EW gaps (additional details classified) in response to an urgent operational need from the Fleet that has been approved by the CNO for execution. Currently no counter to the threat exists. The program consists of a Rapid Response Effort (RRE) to provide an initial, limited decoy capability to the Fleet by 2014 and a Decoy Development Effort (DDE) culminating in the delivery of a fully supported, full capability system. The RRE (FY12-FY14) consists of the evaluation and integration of commercially available decoys. The DDE (commenced in FY12) consists of the development and evaluation of a long duration, active electronic offboard decoy system (payload only) integrated on an existing flight vehicle and an onboard\/offboard EW coordinator fully able to counter the threat.\n\n3321 - SEWIP Block 3 will provide an Electronic Attack (EA) capability improvement required for the SLQ-32(V) system to keep pace with the threat.  SEWIP Block 3 will provide a common EA capability to all surface combatants (CVN, CG, DDG, LHD) outfitted with the active variant of the AN\/SLQ-32, mainly the (V)3 and (V)4, as well as select new-construction platforms.\n\n3362 - E-Nulka is an upgrade to the Nulka decoy to expand frequency coverage to counter an emerging class of Anti-Ship Missiles (ASMs) for which no active countermeasure currently exists. The Program supports the engineering development of the payload receiver, signal processor and transmitter, construction of complete payloads, integration of the completed payload with the Nulka vehicle, and subsequent technical and operational assessment. Due to changes in the security classification guidance, this program will transfer to a classified portion of the budget starting in FY15."

SEWIP Block 1 employs an evolutionary acquisition and incremental development strategy to upgrade surface EW capabilities via a series of block upgrades to the AN\/SLQ-32(V) system, and field EW improvements to counter the ASMD threat.  SEWIP Block 1 will provide required EW capabilities and will incorporate technology advances as they become available to provide incremental upgrades and improvements in performance. \n\nSEWIP Block 1 is segmented into Block 1A, and Block 1B, ALQ-210 integration, and EW Rapid Capability Insertion Process (RCIP). Block 1A upgrades the AN\/SLQ-32 pulse-processing computers and the display console allowing the system to more quickly identify threats and better display the information to the operator. Block 1A Electronic Surveillance Enhancements (ESE) pulse-processing computers and the Improved Control and Display (ICAD) Human System Interface (HSI) console partially open the electronic warfare system architecture to support subsequent EW capability upgrades. Block 1B adds adjunct sensors for special signal intercept, including Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), and High Gain High Sensitivity (HGHS) (Block 1B3), a critical improvement for threat correlation, situational awareness, and extending the battle space. ALQ-210 integration will develop capability to use and integrate Electronic Warfare Support (ES) controls and data between AN\/SLQ-32 and the ALQ-210 on the MH60R.  EW Rapid Capability Insertion Program (RCIP) identifies joint force ASM capability gaps by analyzing EW baseline and fleet requirements, prioritizes those gaps based on fleet input and critical technology maturity, and develops upgrades to the AN\/SLQ-32(V) product line for fielding to address those gaps.  EW RCIP will identify and select candidate technologies based on technical maturity and ability to meet the gaps within programmatic (lifecycle cost, schedule, risk) constraints."

NULKA is designed to counter a wide variety of present and future radar guided Anti-Ship Missiles (ASMs) by radiating a large radar cross section while flying a ship-like trajectory. The United States developed the electronic payload and fire control system, while Australia developed the hovering rocket. Future efforts involve development of the capability for high value unit protection."

Currently no counter to the threat exists. The program consists of a Rapid Response Effort (RRE) to provide an initial, limited decoy capability to the Fleet by 2014 and a Decoy Development Effort (DDE) culminating in the delivery of a fully supported, full capability system. The RRE (FY12-FY14) consists of the evaluation and integration of commercially available decoys. The DDE (commenced in FY12) consists of the development and evaluation of a long duration, active electronic offboard decoy system (payload only) integrated on an existing flight vehicle and an onboard\/offboard EW coordinator fully able to counter the threat.\n\nFY15 AOEW includes a government software development effort to integrate AOEW into the Softkill Coordinator (SKC) to gain maximum effectiveness from the AOEW decoy through coordination with on board systems."

SEWIP Block 3 will continue to expand the integrated shipboard combat system by providing a new integrated Electronic Attack (EA) transmitter, array, and associated EA techniques.  The program builds on the EW Support (ES) capability delivered by SEWIP Blocks 1 and 2.  SEWIP Block 3 includes a government software development effort for a SoftKill Coordinator (SKC) to manage EA engagements.\n\nSEWIP Block 3 includes development and initial, limited interim capability by 2014 of a focused application of the Naval Research Lab (NRL) Transportable EW Module (TEWM) system to support an urgent operational need.\nThe TEWM Speed to Fleet effort develops the TEWM system capability for engaging a wide range of anti-ship missile seekers to address the broader EW capability gap. This effort provides the resources to refine and accelerate the design, make it suitable for operational shipboard application, and implements a network command protocol to efficiently allow use on broad class of ships."
