All research areas are subject to long-range planning and technical review by both Air Force and tri-Service scientific planning groups. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. This program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research, because it funds scientific study and experimentation."

Major thrust areas being investigated in this project are complex electronics and fundamental quantum processes; plasma physics and high energy density non-equilibrium processes; and lasers and optics, electromagnetics, communication, and signal processing. Although the major thrust descriptions that follow are specific sub-areas of focus within this project, there is interest in exploring novel ideas that may bridge these major thrusts as well as those in the other projects within this program element."

Research stresses high-risk, far-term, game-changing capability breakthroughs essential for future leaps in warfighter system performance, functionality, reliability, and survivability while simultaneously reducing component and system power, size, mass, and life cycle costs. Major thrust areas being investigated in this project are information and complex networks, decision making, dynamical systems, optimization and control, and natural materials and systems. Although the major thrust descriptions that follow are specific sub-areas of focus within this project, there is interest in exploring novel ideas that may bridge these major thrusts as well as those in the other projects within this program element."
