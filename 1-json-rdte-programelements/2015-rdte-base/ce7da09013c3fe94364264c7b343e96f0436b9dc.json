The radar continues to be operational during the SLEP.\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory (MIT\/LL), a non-profit Federally-Funded Research & Development Center, performs the HUSIR effort under a master contract with the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, in conjunction with support from other agencies as required.  This effort is considered as applied research under that contract.  MIT\/LL transferred ownership of the radar to the Air Force but continues to operate it as part of its Lincoln Space Surveillance Complex per contract with the Air Force.  MIT\/LL will be responsible for operations and sustainment of the upgraded Haystack radar. The upgrade effort is post Milestone C and is scheduled to complete in FY14.\n\nThe GEODSS SLEP was awarded as an option on the SENSOR contract.  The GEODSS SLEP uses a phased development and deployment strategy to reduce risk. The system is in operation during the SLEP and is considered post-Milestone C."
