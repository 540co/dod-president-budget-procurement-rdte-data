This includes cyber capabilities that predict the best media channels to reach potential target audiences, data mining and information collections tools, propaganda and social behavior analytical tools, cultural analysis toolsets and emerging technologies that support the planning and analytical needs for the Military Information Support Operations (MISO) forces.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging\/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by Special Operations Forces (SOF) users.  This project integrates efforts and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events and performs market research on emerging technologies that support all phases of MISO.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs.  Seeks technologies that will transform current MISO capabilities through two major objectives: 1) Exploit technologies capable of disseminating products to reach target audiences across a variety of media to include audiences in denied areas.  2) Automate and improve MISO planning and analytical capability through technologies that are integrated into SOF planning systems (Cultural Analysis, Targeting, Theme Development, Media & Product Selection, Distribution & Dissemination, and Measures of Effectiveness).  Develops software applications that increase the efficiency and shorten the timeline to get MISO dissemination packages approved.  Develops hardware\/software tools that facilitate the collaboration and sharing of information and other critical data.  \n\nMISO Modernization.  This initiative will initiate and continue development of emergent technologies available in the marketplace to transform and modernize MISO planning, analysis, development, broadcast, distribution, dissemination, and feedback capabilities. This initiative will also continue development of appropriate emerging technologies initially identified by Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) and Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs) to transition to acquisition programs. Technologies include: multi-frequency broadcast systems; digital broadcast capabilities; remote controlled electronic paper; near-real-time command and control of unattended MISO systems, especially in denied areas; focused\/beam speaker sound technologies; visual projection technologies; advanced commercial broadcast technologies including amplitude modulation and frequency modulation radio transmitters and antenna; television transmitter and antenna systems; internet and telephony dissemination and broadcast systems; technologies capable of disseminating MISO products to reach target audiences across a wide variety of media into denied areas; technologies capable of unmanned, long-loiter MISO broadcast and delivery in denied and permissive environments; and technologies that automate in a collaborative environment accomplishing the seven phase MISO process (Planning, Targeting Audience Analysis, Series Development, Product Development and Design, Approval, Production\/Distribution\/Dissemination, and Measures of Effectiveness)  through integrated capabilities."
