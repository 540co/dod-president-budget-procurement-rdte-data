            "val": "Mission Description:  The Radiation Detection, Indication and Computation (RADIAC) Program is responsible for providing radiation monitoring instruments that detect and measure ionizing radiation.  These instruments are used on all Navy, Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command vessels, and at every Navy shore installation, in order to ensure the safety of personnel, continuity of operations in radiological contingencies, and protection of the environment.\n\nJustification:  Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20 (10CFR20) requires RADIAC instruments be used to ensure the safety of personnel who work with or are exposed to radioactive materials in their work.  Additionally, the Navy's mission requires personnel and ships to have the ability to operate in radiological environments and the ability to identify and interdict radiological Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  Navy programs that require RADIAC instruments for Occupational Safety & Health (OSH) reasons under the provisions of 10CFR20 include Naval Nuclear Propulsion, Nuclear Weapons, Medical, and Radiological Affairs Support.  Non-OSH programs include Radiological Defense, Consequence Management, Training, Technical (RADIAC calibration, shielding evaluation, research, etc.) and Radiological Search (maritime interdiction and radiological search missions to locate or intercept WMD).\n\nThis budget item develops new, highly reliable, more easily calibrated, easy to care and maintain, light weight and modern RADIAC instruments in order to improve the effectiveness of radiation safety, to make instruments simpler to use, and to reduce life cycle costs.  The ultimate goal is to replace old, bulky, costly to maintain and repair, unreliable and obsolete instrumentation with multifunction equipment that can be automatically calibrated at greatly reduced cost.\n\nThis budget item also provides for improvement to nuclear weapons intrinsic radiation (gamma and neutron) shielding calculations, mixed field (neutron and gamma) dosimetry, and in neutron measurement.  The objective is to develop less costly and more effective integral shielding for better personnel protection and safety.  Improvement in personnel dosimetry and neutron measurement is also a major emphasis."

The expensive infrastructure and investments by the Navy in its dosimetry program is evidence of the importance attributed by the Navy to the health and safety of the Navy's military and civilian personnel, and that of the general public.  As new and improved technologies appear, it is important to evaluate them for their potential to improve performance while reducing total operating costs.  Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) is a relatively new technology where the benefits appear to be significant but have yet to be fully evaluated.  This project's objective is to make modest investments with the labor of a Navy Health Physicist to explore, in collaboration with a U.S. Army colleague interested in the same technology for Army use, the potential of the joint military application for OSL dosimetry."

An interim replacement has been fielded while OPNAV finalizes updating the Cold War requirements under which the AN\/PDR-65 was designed in order to include radiological (terrorist dirty bomb) threats.  The interim replacement is the IM-265 Survey Meter, which is already in the Navy inventory, but it was not designed for this requirement and cannot measure radiation external to the ship and is therefore not suitable as the permanent replacement.  In light of Operation Tomodachi this requirement has taken on more significance."

Such a sensitive mission requires leading edge technology and capabilities to ensure success.  The AN\/PDX-1 RADIAC Set was fielded in response to a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement to meet this requirement.  It contains several instruments that serve different purposes, including the search detector, isotope identifier, and personal dosimeter.  Current technology dictates that the sensitivity of the detector is directly proportional to the size of the detector element; i.e., the larger the detector, the more sensitive and capable it is.  However, in VBSS there must be a tradeoff between size\/weight and capability, since it is difficult and hazardous for boarding parties to carry a backpack-sized detector, along with their weapons and other gear, up a rope ladder to board a vessel on the high seas.  This will be a continuing and growing effort to find smaller, lighter instruments with enhanced sensitivity, reach-back capability, and other enhancements to provide the Navy the best and most cost effective equipment possible for this critical mission."

Essentially they consist of a high energy radiological source (Cs-137) in a shielded container that is located in a specially constructed room, or \"range.\"  A technician places the instrument to be calibrated at a specific calibration point in the range and remotely operates the calibrator by raising the source out of its container so that it irradiates the object instrument.  The instrument's response to the radiation is measured so that it can be calibrated to specific tolerances.  The current suite of AN\/UDM-1B calibrators is over 20 years old and the natural decay of the strength of the radioactive source over time restricts calibration effectiveness by limiting the scale of calibration points below American National Standards Institute (ANSI) requirements that are followed in accordance with Navy policy.  Also due to the age of the calibrators, there are several parts no longer supported by the manufacturer, and a malfunctioning calibrator poses a very high safety risk.  COTS equipment will be surveyed to find the best solution with which to equip the Navy's seven RADIAC Calibration Laboratories with modern calibrators."
