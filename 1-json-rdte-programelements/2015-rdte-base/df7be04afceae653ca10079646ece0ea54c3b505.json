Tasks include development of the following: Large Area Training Range (LATR) improvements and Tactical Training Range(TTR) infrastructure improvements to include:  the Joint Display Subsystem (JDS), Radar Acquistion Display Subsystem, Electronic Warfare (EW) server, Link 16 interface, TTR shipboard rotary platform technology improvements and the Radiant Mercury (RM) Cross Domain Solution (CDS).  \n\n1427 - Surface Tactical Team Trainer (STTT) develops modifications during sustainment of Battle Force Tactical Training (BFTT) system.   This is required to maintain capabilities and interfaces to provide realistic combat system coordinated team, unit and Fleet Synthetic Training (FST) collective Group\/Force level training events.   In addition, BFTT supports the embedded trainer \"family of systems\" approach for the development of a Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC).  Specific improvements include improved integration with the Navy Continuous Training Environment (NCTE) and development of a High Level Architecture (HLA) capable, integrated shipboard network to meet increasing Commander Naval Surface Forces (CNSF) and United States Fleet Forces Command (USFFC) FST requirements. The need for transforming training is documented within the DoD Training Transformation Plan, the Chief of Naval Operations Fleet Response Plan and Commander United States Fleet Forces Command Fleet Readiness Training Plan.  \n\n2124 - The Air Warfare Training Development (AWTD) program provides transition of operational systems technologies and risk mitigation for aviation training systems, including mission preview\/rehearsal simulation technologies, Live-Virtual Constructive (LVC) and the Aviation Training Technology Integration Facility (ATTIF).  The ATTIF provides for incremental development, prototype evaluation, technology readiness level assessment and final fleet Test and Evaluation prior to technology transition.  \n\n3093 - The Tactical Combat Training System (TCTS) will provide the Navy a replacement for the Tactical Aircrew Combat Training System and LATR systems.  TCTS will also provide fleet deployable training for at-sea training and tactics development.  By providing a rangeless capability, the system will greatly increase the area where live instrumented training can be conducted.  Fielding of a pod system is complete at TACTS sites.  The program incorporates an evolutionary development (incremental) towards an encrypted system capable of supporting a broad spectrum of naval platforms through weapons simulations, participant sensor stimulation, open architecture and an encrypted\/long range secure data link. \n\n3356- Funds FCA, high fidelity Aegis Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) individual and team trainers for all Advanced Capability Build (ACB) and below Aegis baselines. This line also provides funds for development of a CIWS 1B Baseline 2 Trainer upgrade.\n\n\nJUSTIFICATON FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY:\nThis program is funded under Operational Systems Development because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Products from this effort are directly tied to the Navy Aviation Simulation Master Plan (NASMP), NASMP technology upgrades, MH-60R\/S master plan, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) master plan, UAS Common Control Station (CCS), Live Virtual Constructive (LVC), component technologies, F\/A-18C-F Requirements Procurement Plan (RPP), open architecture implementation, multiple platform technology refresh efforts and the Multi-Mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA\/P-8) programs.  These efforts will support the development and design of future naval aviation training\/preview\/mission rehearsal systems (fixed, deployed, and unmanned).  Tasks include:  Advanced training systems specification development to provide for common, modular, High Level Architecture (HLA) compliant, high fidelity Distributed Mission Training (DMT) and mission rehearsal capabilites ashore and afloat.  Technologies to be developed and integrated include:  intelligent semi-automated forces (SAF) technologies, automated performance measurement technology, advanced net-ready weapons simulation, Air to Air\/Air to Ground (AA\/AG), visual\/sensor enhancement, sensor\/weather server, common Mission Training Station (MTS) technologies, tablet mission preview technology, advanced visual-sensor technology, high resolution helmet mounted, and\/or flat panel displays, 20-20 visual acuity image generation, NAVAIR Portable Source Initiative (NSPI) improvements, common correlated data set technologies, common link, common software\/database reuse technologies, advanced environmental effects modeling, fused radar\/infra-red\/electro-optic and acoustic sensor simulations, aerodynamic modeling, physics-based infra-red simulations, comms degradation modeling and final T&E within the Aviation Training Technology Integration Facility (ATTIF), NAWCAD, which is a man-in-the loop test bed for the integration of software, hardware and operational equipment.  This Manned-Flight Simulator (MFS) capability provides a window to fleet aviators for critical comment, evaluation and fine tuning of new, interoperable, and innovative technologies such as Training System Common Environment (TRACE) components, before final transition to the fleet.  MTS, debrief\/After Action Review (AAR) and intelligent training tools for the virtual environment are focused on human performance enhancements for fleet readiness and distributed mission training at all levels.  \nMetrics:  These technology transitions seek to lower Total Ownership Costs (TOC) of the training systems and life cycle costs, including: increasing software re-use, reduced instructor manning profiles, software-based fidelity enhancements and increased fleet readiness by enhancing overall system fidelity to the projected operating environments.  NASMP readiness improvements are conservatively forecasted at 12-35% Training and Readiness (T+R) improvement via synthetic environment upgrades and associated technology upgrades to stand-alone and networked simulators.  Individual technology transition investments have routinely exceeded 300+% financial Return On Investment (ROI).  Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), Training and Readiness, fleet readiness, and financial metrics are used."

TCTS will also provide fleet deployable training for at-sea training and tactics development.  By providing a rangeless capability, the system will greatly increase the area where live instrumented training can be conducted.  Fielding of a pod system is complete at TACTS sites.  The program incorporates an evolutionary development (incremental) towards an encrypted system capable of supporting a broad spectrum of naval platforms through weapons simulations, participant sensor stimulation, open architecture and an encrypted\/long range secure data link."
