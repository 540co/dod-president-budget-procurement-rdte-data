Analysis includes operations research methodologies such as statistical analysis, multi-objective decision methods, optimization, cost analysis, and a wide range of computer-based models and combat simulations. OAD analysts often develop novel tools and solution methodologies to accomplish the mission.  Recent innovations in analysis of amphibious operations, Irregular Warfare (IW), and Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED) serve as examples of OAD expanding the state-of-the-art in operations research methods.  These tools are employed to assist the Commanding General (CG), Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) in his mission of creating and maintaining combat-ready Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTFs). OAD is also the Marine Corps authority on previous analytical work done throughout the Joint Analytical Community, and leverages emerging methods and findings to solve problems facing the Corps.  The division's primary mission is to support decisions pertaining to weapon systems, strategic personnel and training management decisions, equipment acquisition, and resource allocation."

Marine Corps warfare enhancements ensure STORM is representative of full-spectrum capabilities of joint force meeting the collaboration and integration goals of the Department of Defense (DoD) Modeling & Simulation (M&S) Strategic Vision.\n\n*  Continued: Force Mobility Analysis Support Tool (FMAST III):  Commandant chartered a Force Structure Review Group (FSRG) that examined organization, training, and equipping issues associated with task force organization in global security arena.  Measures end-strength, training cycle, and dwell-time impacts on the Marine Corps manpower, operations, and support functions.\n\n*  Continued: Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR) & Shaping Operations Study:  Investigated potential improvement to the organizational structure and the command relationships of U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance forces for future Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) access, entry, and enabling operations across the range of military operations.\n\n*  Continued: 59XX Occupational Field Command and Control Electronics Maintenance Manpower and Personnel Study:  Reviewed options to mitigate any manpower shortfalls through:  changes in structure; re-alignment of tasks; and provided recommendations for compensated or uncompensated structure changes.  Evaluated, reviewed and allocated current tables of organization (T\/O) structure with proposed Avation Command and Control (AC2) Family of Systems (FoS) approved acquisition objectives (AAO).  Identified any differences in the equipment-to-personnel association when compared to the new equipment requirements by conducting job task and workload analysis and determine the maximum capacity [AAO] current structure can support. \n\n*  Continued: Joint Irregular Warfare Analytic Baseline (JIWAB) Support to Irregular Warfare Executive Steering Committee (IW ESC):  JIWAB study began in August 2010 as a way forward on addressing Irregular Warfare (IW) analysis at the strategic level and provided analytic support to the Irregular Warfare Executive Steering Committee (IW ESC) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  This effort replaced products developed in previous stages of the Joint Irregular Warfare Analytic Baseline (JIWAB) study and used them to conduct a scenario-based assessment of IW-related capabilities.  Analysts used the JIWAB scenario to 1) produce an integrated DoD and interagency (IA) CONOPS in response to the scenario; 2) assessed the effectiveness of the integrated CONOPS through a war game; and 3) assessed the IW capability implications from the war game results. \n\n*  Continued: The Contribution of Depot - Level Maintenance in Enabling Marine Corps Warfighting Capability Study:  The Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Maintenance Policy and Programs (DASD (MPP)) issued specific guidance for POM FY14-18 that required Services to provide an explanation of the linkage of depot-level maintenance requirements and funding to warfighting capability.  Study developed a standard scientific and quantifiable methodology that can be applied periodically via a modeling tool to collect and analyze depot maintenance requirements, production and cost data and assess the benefits of depot maintenance within the context of deployable operational force modules that are directly relatable to Marine Corps Title X and Marine Corps Service Campaign Plan (MCSCP) requirements. \n\n*  Continued: Assessing the Impact of the Marine Expeditionary Equipment Shortfalls on Mission Performance Phase II:   Continued existing work on the development of the MAGTF Equipment Structural Assessment (MESA) tool, an automated system designed to assess the impact of Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) equipment shortfalls on mission performance by: (1) extending the tool developed in Phases 1 and 2 of this project to accommodate two additional mission types; and (2) test the tool at the Marine Corps Expeditionary Warfare School (EWS) at Quantico, Virginia.\n\n*  Continued: Cannon Cluster Munition Capability Gap and Requirements Analysis Study:  The M483A1 155mm Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) and the M864 155mm Extended-Range DPICM projectiles contain submunitions which have an unexploded ordnance (UXO) rate greater than one percent and which therefore do not meet the UXO criteria established by DoD Policy Memorandum dated 19 June 2008 (DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians); as a result these projectiles will no longer be authorized for use after 2018.  Study confirmed that a capability gap exists from the resulting loss of the M483A1\/M864 projectiles and provided data analysis\/rationale to support requirements outlined in the Capabilities Production Document (CPD) for a replacement capability.\n\n*  Continued: Facilities Sustainment and Facility Service Life Study:  Obtained information for testing and setting coefficients in sustainment models.  These planning factors are used in the development of Marine Corps Installations and Logistics (I&L's) Installations, Program Execution Budget (PEB), Base Operating Support levels, and the Marine Corps' infrastructure management program to support maintenance and operations readiness.\n\n*  Continued: COMBAT XXI Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) Modeling, Virtual Environments, and Simulation (MOVES) Institute Support:  MOVES provided \"on call\" support to Operations Analysis Division (OAD) to assist in finding solutions to problems encountered using COMBATXXI.

COMBAT XXI is a high-resolution combat simulation currently under development at TRAC White Sands Missile Range intended to support modern modeling needs with a flexible, object-oriented implementation\n\n*  Continued: The Multi-Functional Operations Center (MFOC) Study Phase II:  Focused on recovering and organizing the existing architecture diagrams and concepts of operations (CONOPs) for Marine Air Command and Control Systems (MACCS) agencies produced by the Deputy Commandant for Aviation (DC[A]).  Provided data in a navigable, searchable, understandable archive that identified gaps in the documentation with the goal comparing current doctrine\/CONOPs and Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) requirements, and identifying any significant gaps and\/or inconsistencies with regard to content, format, vernacular, and methodology.  The results used by DC Aviation and the Aviation Expeditionary Enablers, Headquarters Marine Corps, Aviation (APX) staff to help inform decisions regarding the merger of the Marine Air Control Squadron (MACS) and Marine Air Support Squadron (MASS) into a multi-functional air command and control node.\n\n*  Continued: Marine Corps Expeditionary Energy Modeling and Simulation and Utility Enhancement:  On 13 Aug 2009, the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) declared energy a top priority.  The USMC Expeditionary Energy Office (E2O) was created in October of that year to \"analyze, develop, and direct the Marine Corps' energy strategy in order to optimize expeditionary capabilities across the war fighting functions.\"  The E2O also has a responsibility to \"advise the Marine Requirements Oversight Council (MROC) on all energy and resource related requirements, acquisitions, and programmatic decisions.\"  To that end, in September 2010 E2O initiated a study under the guidance of the Operations Analysis Division, MCCDC (OAD), to assess the impact of more efficient Energy Conservation Units (ECUs) on energy consumption within a theater.  The study led to the development of a prototype model, the MAGTF Power and Energy Model (MPEM), a transparent and repeatable process for measuring, evaluating and presenting the energy-related performance of current Marine Forces.  OAD selected the Analytical Framework for USMC Expeditionary Energy Investment Study to establish confidence in USMC Performance\/Pricing Models, via Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A) and use this as a prerequisite to using the data\/output in POM development.\n\n*  Completed: \nImprovised Explosive Device (IED) Detection and Prevention Tool (IDAPT): Developed a multi-attribute decision model that evaluated mixes of infantry anti-armor weapons for both state-on-state warfare (typified by a significant armored threat) and hybrid conflicts (typified by a negligible armored threat).\n\n*  Completed: \nPrepositioning Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA): Conducted a prepositioning CBA to develop a balanced prepositioning strategy that integrated maritime, ashore, CONUS, and OCONUS prepositioning capabilities for deployment and employment of scalable Naval Forces in support of projected Combatant Commander Requirement.\n\n*  Completed: \nCombat Logistics Force (CLF) Logistics Support to Afloat USMC Units: Linked challenges facing the Marine Corps through increased Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU) mission requirements while at the same time realizing potential amphibious fleet reductions over the midterm.  Study provided specific recommendations on range and depth of materiel for stocking aboard CLF ships as well as standardized processes for replenishment support to embarked MEU units.\n\n*  Completed:\nMarine Corps Information Operation Center (MCOIC) Marine Information Operations (IO), Military Information Support Operations (MISO) Development Inventory Study:  Study utilized Navy Computer Adaptive Personality Scales (NCAPS) to create an inventory for IO and MISO Marine development.  This inventory is an integral part of the IO and MISO development process for potential Officer and Enlisted Marines serving as IO and MISO positions across the Marine Corps, along with current cognitive tests already in place.  Study focused on developing an Information Operations and MISO Marine profile encompassing both cognitive and non-cognitive factors and incorporated into a model for assessment and development.  Profile allows the Marine Corps to identify those Marines who are likely to be successful in Information Operations and MISO related fields, those who need a greater depth of screening and training, and those who are likely to succeed elsewhere."

The primary purpose of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) is to provide information to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) regarding the Operational Effectiveness (OE) and Operational Suitability (OS) of the system addressed at a decision point. MCOTEA must ensure that the Marines in the Operating Forces receive the very best possible equipment and support. MCOTEA must also ensure each system proposed for acquisition is tested adequately, evaluated objectively and reported independently.\n\nMarine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) is the only unit that provides the Marine Corps with required operational test and evaluation (OT&E) capability, ensuring the Marine Corps is compliant with laws and regulations, and ensuring that training and equipment are operationally effective, relevant, and suitable.  Additionally, MCOTEA's early involvement, coordination, and oversight in developmental testing and evaluation of new combat and combat support systems ensures that our Marines are the best trained, and have the best equipment, with the lowest test costs for taxpayers. Finally, MCOTEA's support of rapid acquisitions ensures that Marines in the fight are supported with the newest and most advanced equipment and that the Marine Corps is compliant with regulations."

FIRS meets the mission requirements for the detection; mass casualty decontamination; force protection; responder inter-agency interoperability; Command, Control, Communications, Computers & Intelligence (C4I); urban search and rescue; medical and general support requirements needed by these forces to mitigate the effects of a CBRNE terrorist attack. FIRS relies primarily on Commercial Off-The-Shelf\/Non-Developmental Items (COTS\/NDI) equipment and systems that meet the particular mission requirements of Consequence Management (CM). Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) systems are adopted if they meet the CM mission requirements. FIRS Research & Development effort allows the program to keep abreast of emerging technologies in the commercial sector and address operational capability gaps that cannot be met by commercial items."

The process supports Commanding General (CG), MCCDC and Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command (COMMARCORSYSCOM) by providing funding to priority programs, thus allowing for the examination of concepts and alternatives to support an orderly transition from requirements to initiatives and initiatives to funded programs.  This will permit the POM process to focus on activities of evaluating, prioritizing and integrating rather than defining and resolving raw, immature requirements.  \n\nPhase A activities \"jump start\" high priority programs of the acquisition process. Furthermore, since 70% of a program's life cycle cost is determined during Phase A, this initiative puts resources to work where the return on investment is the greatest. Typical studies conducted on Phase A activities include, but are not limited to Market Surveys, Business Case Analysis (BCA), Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV) analysis, Life Cycle Cost Estimates, Cost Comparison Analysis, Acquisition Strategies, and Trade-off Analysis in lieu of an Analysis of Alternatives."
