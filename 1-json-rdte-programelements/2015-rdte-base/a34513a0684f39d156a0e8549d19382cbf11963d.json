            "val": "This program supports a range of activities including technology planning, development, demonstrations and prototyping, as well as modeling, simulations and exercises to support development of tactics and procedures in the Space Control mission area.  The types of Space Control activities accomplished are Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Defensive Counterspace (DCS), Offensive Counterspace (OCS) and Command and Control (C2) and Battle Management.  For use in the Space Control mission area, SSA includes monitoring, detecting, identifying, tracking, assessing, verifying, categorizing, and characterizing, objects and events in space and includes terrestrial based space capabilities.  DCS includes defensive activities to protect U.S. and friendly space-systems assets, resources, and operations from enemy attempts to negate or interfere and prevention activities that limit or eliminate an adversary's ability to use U.S. space systems and services for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.  OCS activities disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy space systems, or the information and the technology they provide, which may be used for purposes hostile to U.S. national security interests.  Command & Control efforts include identifying technology solutions to enable fusion of data for use in multi-level security environments, and near-real-time data delivery and decision support to war fighter needs.  This program supports the development of Rapid Reaction Capabilities in response to immediate warfighter needs, including Urgent Operational Needs (UONs) and Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONs), in the Space Control mission area.  \n\nFunding also supports the development of the technology and infrastructure for space control elements in a live signal environment of the Space Test and Training Range (STTR).  This includes development and demonstration of first-ever test assets, special test equipment, capabilities and systems required to test, validate, and verify performance of integrated space control systems.  Additionally, this program supports the development of test range assets required to support developmental and operational test, exercises, training, and tactics development for space control systems in the face of an emerging threat.  A collaborative command & control capability will be integrated into several range systems to provide real time communications during test event scenarios to enable operators to be better prepared prior to deploying into the AOR.\n\nThese projects are in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

This includes development, demonstration and delivery of test assets, special test equipment, capabilities and systems required to test, validate, and verify performance of integrated space control systems.  The objective of the STTR is to provide a safe, secure, controllable and repeatable environment for the testing and training of Space Control mission systems and operators that is both realistic and relevant.  Additionally, this program supports the development of test range assets required to support developmental and operational test, exercises, training, and tactics development for Air Force and Joint-service space control systems\/units.  Included are both the fixed node Space Range Operation Center (SROC) at Schriever AFB and a deployable capability to support complex Joint and AF exercises.  A space range Family of Systems (FoS) called Big Top is being developed to accomplish the STTR mission.  The Big Top objective is integration into a Distributed Mission Architecture, tying into both the Information Operations (IO) and Air ranges for increased realism and complexity.  This technology will allow for the first-ever use of a realistic signal environment to increase the realism and efficiency of space control squadron training.\nSatellite bandwidth is leased in this program for use in support of live testing and training events."
