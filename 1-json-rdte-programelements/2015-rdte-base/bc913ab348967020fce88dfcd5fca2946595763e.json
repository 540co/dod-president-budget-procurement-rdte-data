The development is through a full and open competition for two cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contracts to deliver NGCM Engineering Development Models (EDMs) to the Navy.  The NGCM development contracts were awarded in 1Q-FY11.  NGCM contractor's subsystem testing will occur starting in FY14 through FY18 and Navy DT will be in FY17-19, with OT in FY19.
