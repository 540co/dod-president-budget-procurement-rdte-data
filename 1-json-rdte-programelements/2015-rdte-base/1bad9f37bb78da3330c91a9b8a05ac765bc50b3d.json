MRRS and GWLR (Ground Weapons Locating Radar) merged into a single requirement\/capability (G\/ATOR) and will replace an aging fleet of single mission legacy radar systems. G\/ATOR will support air defense, air surveillance, counter-battery\/target acquisition, aviation radar tactical enhancements and the final evolution will also support the Air Traffic Control mission.  This project was funded under Program Element 0206313M Project C3099 prior to FY2010 and Program Element 0206313M Project 9C89 in FY2011-2012.  It was moved to Program Element 0204460M in FY2013."

The G\/ATOR replaces the AN\/TPS-63 and complements the AN\/TPS-59 long range radar and will provide mobile, multi-functional, three-dimensional surveillance of air breathing targets, detection of cruise missiles and UAS, and the cueing of air defense weapons.  The G\/ATOR contributes to the extension of Sea Shield\/Sea Strike by surveillance and detection of enemy air threats not seen by Navy sensors in the littorals by participating in a cooperative engagement network of sensors and shooters.  G\/ATOR enables Integrated Fire Control (IFC) and provides engage\/fire on remote capability.  G\/ATOR surveillance coverage with IFC will provide unprecedented reach, volume, and precision in the execution of Operational Maneuver From The Sea, allowing Naval forces to project and sustain power deep inland.

The AD\/AS (GB1) development effort was competitively awarded in 2007 and completed Milestone C in FY14.  Development of the Counterfire\/Targeting (GB2) capability was initiated in FY10 with a RFI to industry, followed by a Business Case Analysis (BCA) to select the most cost effective procurement strategy.  The results of the BCA indicated that a sole source contract to NGSC was the most cost effective solution. Thus, development award is planned for the 3rd Qtr FY15. In FY13, a BCA was performed to determine the optimum strategy for development of the Air Traffic Control (GB4) mission with a potential development contract to be awarded in FY16.  Funding in FY14 and FY15 supports systems engineering activities prior to contract award, including integration studies with ATNAVICS, the Navy provided Air Traffic Control C2 systems."
