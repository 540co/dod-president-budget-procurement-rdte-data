            "val": "This project explores innovative concepts pursuant to Public Law 106-554 (Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000) and Public Law 107-50 (Small Business Technology Transfer Program Reauthorization Act of 2001), which mandates a two-phase competition for small businesses with innovative technology that can be commercialized. The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technology for possible future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS) needs. Dual-use means that the technology will be judged on the potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new MDA BMDS technology, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products. MDA will conduct the competition, award, and manage the contracts. \n\nThe Missile Defense Agency`s SBIR\/STTR investments are divided into 14 Research Areas from 5 MDA Elements:\n-Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD): A hybrid program office (MDA\/Navy) that builds BMD Capability for use in multi-mission ships and in Aegis Ashore.\n-Command, Control, Communication, Computer Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR): Defines, develops and deploys an integrated Sensor and Command and Control (C2) capability for Missile Defense\n-Program and Integration: Supervises the Acquisition Category ID ACAT 1D Ballistic Missile Defense System Program portfolio including element design, development, system integration, and test.\n-Test: Characterizes ballistic missile defense capability and supports fielding of an integrated and effective capability to the Warfighter.\n-Advanced Technology: Develops cost and operationally effective capability; explores and develops technology to counter future threats. \n\nSmall Business Innovation Research topic areas for FY 2013 included: \n-Intelligent adaptive needs characterization for modeling & simulation (M&S)Systems Engineering\n-Radio Frequency (RF) transparent composite airdrop platform for MDA airborne target applications\n-Real-time Ladar scene rendering and projection component technology\n-Development of high-fidelity techniques to model impact flash and post-impact thermal signature prediction and support kill assessment\n-Hypervelocity intercept modeling with first-principle, physics-based tools\n-Improved manufacturing processes for propulsion technology\n-Debris assessment from spectrally diverse sensors and air sample to aid post-intercept weapons typing\n-Interceptor avionics\n-Space component miniaturization\n-Global missile defense battle management\n-Tin Whisker mitigation technology for SN-based surface finishes on electronic assemblies and microelectronic devices\n-Improved packaging and thermal management for high power electronics and solid state lasers\n-Advanced Divert and Attitude Control\n-Advanced synergistic structures for interceptor kill vehicles\n-Photonic multi-beam receive arrays\n-Large format space focal plane array technology\n-Resource optimization for battle management\n-Direct electrically pumped high energy flowing media laser technology\n-Develop and demonstrate high performance infrared focal plane arrays with advanced quantum structures\n-Smart infrared focal plane arrays and advanced electronics\n-Interceptor seekers and passive sensors\n-Methodologies for accurate scene generation of complex target plume characteristics\n-Methodologies for developing extremely large infrared (IR) scene projectors\n-Acquisition, tracking and pointing technology\n-Development of line-narrowed diode pumps sources for Diode Pumped Alkali Laser (DPAL) systems\n-Development of optical quality thin-film coatings for DPAL windows\n-Innovative signature exploitation for long range object discrimination\n-Sensor resource management\n-Light weight Divert and Attitude Control Systems for missile defense interceptors\n-Anti-Tamper technology for missile defense\n-Composite structures for lightweight missile components\n-Hot gas components for lightweight missile components\n-Advanced power storage systems for interceptors\n-Innovative propulsion technology for missile defense interceptors\n-Characterization and Incorporation of Vernier engines within the Plume Modeling Process\n-Advanced particle treatment in modeling rocket exhaust plumes\n-Improved techniques for optimistic modeling\n-Mitigation of the effects of the ionosphere on Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR)\n-Methodology for accurate assessment of target characteristics\n-Telemetry impact reduction for target objects\n-Techniques for anchoring debris models\n-Dual S & C-band telemetry transmitter system for missile testing\n-Novel planning algorithms for hybrid land and sea platform sensor coordination\n-Asset pairing for battle management\n-Radio Frequency (RF)- Infrared (IR) data fusion for track and data correlation\n-Techniques for performing warhead characterization\n-Innovative tests and techniques for modeling detonation probability and debris characterization of high explosive submunition warheads\n-RF material property characterization\n-Advanced techniques for lossless compression of target vehicle telemetry\n-Modular hypergolic leak detector\n-Acquisition, tracking and pointing technology for high energy laser applications\n-Optics and coatings for high energy laser applications\n-Atmospheric characterization for Directed Energy applications\n-Light weight rubidium-metal vapor circulating system\n-Lightweight communication equipment for interceptor communications\n-Miniature extendable nozzles or actuating nozzles for improved specific impulse (Isp) of Divert Attitude Control System (DACS) thrusters\n-Powdered propellant rocket motor\n-Waste heat recovery of rocket motors for reduction of battery weight\n-Origin marking of components for avoidance of counterfeit parts\n-Thermal isolation of nozzle exit cone insulators\n-Anchoring post-intercept debris prediction tools\n-Innovative designs for reliable electro-explosive ordinance devices\n-Cost effective, reliable service life extension testing of Ordinance Devices\n-Correlation identification and evaluation of new technology or methodology to accurately measure inertial movement in a stressing flight environment"

The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technology for possible future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS) needs. Dual-use means that the technology will be judged on the potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new MDA BMDS technology, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products. MDA will conduct the competition, award, and manage the contracts. \n\nThe Missile Defense Agency`s SBIR\/STTR investments are divided into 14 Research Areas from 5 MDA Elements:\n-Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD): A hybrid program office (MDA\/Navy) that builds BMD Capability for use in multi-mission ships and in Aegis Ashore.\n-Command, Control, Communication, Computer Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR): Defines, develops and deploys an integrated Sensor and Command and Control (C2) capability for Missile Defense\n-Program and Integration: Supervises the Acquisition Category ID ACAT 1D Ballistic Missile Defense System Program portfolio including element design, development, system integration, and test.\n-Test: Characterizes ballistic missile defense capability and supports fielding of an integrated and effective capability to the Warfighter.\n-Advanced Technology: Develops cost and operationally effective capability; explores and develops technology to counter future threats."
