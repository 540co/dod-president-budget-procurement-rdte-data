            "val": "With the AF decision to begin the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) Recapitalization Program in FY15, and inclusion of funding for the program included in the FY15 President's Budget, no Modernization funds were requested for the legacy E-8C JSTARS program in FY 2015 and beyond. \n\nThe JSTARS is the world's premier airborne ground surveillance platform, meeting joint combat capability requirements.  The 707-based E-8C JSTARS aircraft provides all-weather radar-derived Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) and targeting information on moving and stationary ground\/surface targets to include dismounts, slow moving rotary and fixed wing aircraft, and rotating antennas.  JSTARS provides target information for matching direct attack aircraft, standoff weapons, and ground-based attack assets against selected targets.  It can be cued by other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and target acquisition systems.  This capability enables air and ground regional\/geographic commanders to effectively make and execute battlefield decisions at the component commander's level to battlefield forces.  It contributes to predictive battle space awareness.    \n\nThis program element enhances the warfighter's ability to achieve the joint vision of combat operations.  It develops advanced battle management aids and information fusion technologies to enable rapid decisions in tracking and killing time-critical targets.  Concept exploration, program definition\/risk reduction efforts, and studies support continuous improvements in C2ISR, network centric operational capabilities, and interoperability with joint service, allied, and coalition systems.\n\nThis program element currently comprises one development program, JSTARS Modernization, and the supporting Test and Infrastructure. Development efforts for the Prime Mission Equipment-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (PME-DMS) and Communications and Networking Upgrades (CNU) developmental programs were completed in FY 2013.  \n\nActivities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution as well as support to Urgent Operational Needs (UONs).  \n\nI. JSTARS Modernization:\n\nThe JSTARS modernization program consists of multiple efforts to develop and integrate platform wide system improvements.  \n\nAdditional Modernization efforts could include interoperability with manned and unmanned platforms; space data links; advanced Battle-Management Command and Control (BMC2) concepts; 8.33\/25 kHz VHF Radio with Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) voice and data communication; ISR Constellation; Air Moving Target Indicator (AMTI); Advanced Radar Modes (ARM); Aided Target Recognition (ATR); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\/Enhanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ESAR); Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT); Multi-Agency Communication Capability (MACC); CENTRIX; Public Key Infrastructure (PKI); and Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Network Architecture Upgrades (BNAU).\n\nTraining and support systems upgrade efforts include, but are not limited to: Weapon Systems Trainer (WST); Navigator Training System (NTS); and Mission Crew Trainers to include a Mission Maintenance Trainer (MMT), Prime Mission Equipment-Maintenance Training Device (PME-MTD) and the Mission System Trainer (MST).\n\nII. Test and Infrastructure: \n\nThe test infrastructure includes the JSTARS Extended Test Support (JETS), JSTARS Test Force (JTF), and C2 Enterprise Integration Facility (CEIF). All JSTARS efforts rely on the components of this test infrastructure to carry out RDT&E activities. The infrastructure includes a T-3 test aircraft, laboratories, support facilities, protection level (PL-2) security, Information Assurance (IA), and range support. All of the developmental programs have been completed. The Joint STARS test infrastructure continues to provide retrofit support to production programs and Urgent Operational Needs (UONs) as required. In FY 2014, the program began the transfer of test infrastructure assets to Robins AFB. \n\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development. This budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "With the AF decision to begin the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) Recapitalization Program in FY15, and inclusion of funding for the program included in the FY15 President's Budget, no Modernization funds were requested for the legacy E-8C JSTARS program in FY 2015 and beyond. \n\nThe JSTARS is the world's premier airborne ground surveillance platform, meeting joint combat capability requirements.  The 707-based E-8C JSTARS aircraft provides all-weather radar-derived Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) and targeting information on moving and stationary ground\/surface targets to include dismounts, slow moving rotary and fixed wing aircraft, and rotating antennas.  JSTARS provides target information for matching direct attack aircraft, standoff weapons, and ground-based attack assets against selected targets.  It can be cued by other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and target acquisition systems.  This capability enables air and ground regional\/geographic commanders to effectively make and execute battlefield decisions at the component commander's level to battlefield forces.  It contributes to predictive battle space awareness.    \n\nThis program element enhances the warfighter's ability to achieve the joint vision of combat operations.  It develops advanced battle management aids and information fusion technologies to enable rapid decisions in tracking and killing time-critical targets.  Concept exploration, program definition\/risk reduction efforts, and studies support continuous improvements in C2ISR, network centric operational capabilities, and interoperability with joint service, allied, and coalition systems.\n\nThis program element currently comprises one development program, JSTARS Modernization, and the supporting Test and Infrastructure. Development efforts for the Prime Mission Equipment-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (PME-DMS) and Communications and Networking Upgrades (CNU) developmental programs were completed in FY 2013.  \n\nActivities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution as well as support to Urgent Operational Needs (UONs).  \n\nI. JSTARS Modernization:\n\nThe JSTARS modernization program consists of multiple efforts to develop and integrate platform wide system improvements.  \n\nAdditional Modernization efforts could include interoperability with manned and unmanned platforms; space data links; advanced Battle-Management Command and Control (BMC2) concepts; 8.33\/25 kHz VHF Radio with Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) voice and data communication; ISR Constellation; Air Moving Target Indicator (AMTI); Advanced Radar Modes (ARM); Aided Target Recognition (ATR); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\/Enhanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ESAR); Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT); Multi-Agency Communication Capability (MACC); CENTRIX; Public Key Infrastructure (PKI); and Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Network Architecture Upgrades (BNAU).\n\nTraining and support systems upgrade efforts include, but are not limited to: Weapon Systems Trainer (WST); Navigator Training System (NTS); and Mission Crew Trainers to include a Mission Maintenance Trainer (MMT), Prime Mission Equipment-Maintenance Training Device (PME-MTD) and the Mission System Trainer (MST).\n\nII. Test and Infrastructure: \n\nThe test infrastructure includes the JSTARS Extended Test Support (JETS), JSTARS Test Force (JTF), and C2 Enterprise Integration Facility (CEIF). All JSTARS efforts rely on the components of this test infrastructure to carry out RDT&E activities. The infrastructure includes a T-3 test aircraft, laboratories, support facilities, protection level (PL-2) security, Information Assurance (IA), and range support. All of the developmental programs have been completed. The Joint STARS test infrastructure continues to provide retrofit support to production programs and Urgent Operational Needs (UONs) as required. In FY 2014, the program began the transfer of test infrastructure assets to Robins AFB. \n\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development. This budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
