            "val": "There are three developmental efforts that are being executed concurrently: Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) (project code EF6); Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (Increment 2) (project code EF7); and Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) (Increment 1) (project code EF8).\n\nJoint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) software provides joint fire support management, and common operational picture (COP) capabilities.  JADOCS complements the Mission Command architecture with joint and collaborative capabilities that can be employed and tailored based on the unit mission and operational situation.  JADOCS software provides integration between multiple joint command and control (C2) systems of the uniformed services involved in the targeting process at US Air Force (USAF), US Navy (USN), and US Marine Corps (USMC) Air Operations Centers (AOCs), Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEFs), Fleet Maritime Operations Centers (MOCs), and staff sections at the regional Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Special Operations Command (SOCOM), and Army Battlefield Coordination Detachments (BCDs), Army Service Component Commands (ASCC), Corps and Divisions. Project EF6 funds development of JADOCS Version 2.0 which is the final version of JADOCS to be developed with new functionality.  JADOCS V2.0 is required to incorporate critical Joint requirements into JADOCS.  These requirements include modification and updates for joint interfaces, updates to databases, and creation of non kinetic fires targeting.  JADOCS V2.0 development is slated to be developed by a government agency with work beginning in FY2014.\n\nThe Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) Increment 2 will be a software only application that operates on the existing Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD).  It will provide the dismounted Forward Observer (FO) and Fire Support Teams (FISTs) the capability and functionality to accurately and rapidly locate ground targets and enable the Nett Warrior Ensemble to digitally process a Call For Fire; linking the sensor to the shooter with an efficient integration of multiple acquisition programs. PFED Increment 2 aligns with the Army's Fires and Effects Concept of Operation and describes how fires and effects contribute to Networked Fires as part of the combined arms teams in Army, Special Operations Forces (SOF), and Joint operations.  PFED Increment 2 answers the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment requirement that all handheld applications reside on the Nett Warrior End User Device. PFED Increment 2 will provide Category 1 target mensuration via Precision Fires Imagery enabling the effective use of new precision munitions.  Project code EF7 funds the evolutionary software development of this handheld Fires Command and Control (C2) system.\n\nAFATDS Increment 1 provides Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications and functions as the land component's automated Fire Support Command and Control (FSC2) system.  AFATDS is used in the Fires Warfighting Function to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal fires within the overall Mission Command and Control (MC2) enterprise. The system interoperates and integrates with: over 80 different battlefield systems from Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support command and control systems.  AFATDS fuses the essential situational awareness data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities and to safely execute against friendly situational picture.  AFATDS pairs targets to weapons to provide optimum use of fire support assets and timely execution of fire missions.  AFATDS automates the planning, coordinating, and controlling of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).  AFATDS automatically implements detailed commander's guidance in the automation of operational planning, movement control, targeting, target value analysis, and fire support planning. AFATDS is being used in operations in Afghanistan.  Project EF8 funds development of AFATDS Version 6.8.1. AFATDS 6.8.1 fires capabilities are being enhanced to meet JADOCS ground fires requirements in order to remove JADOCS from the ground forces inventory. With the completion of AFATDS Version 6.8.1, the program office will complete the AFATDS Increment 1 development and will start the Increment 2 development in 4Q FY2014.  Final engineering reviews will be conducted and Government Confidence Testing, Information Assurance testing, and Certification testing will be completed.  Full materiel release of the software will be completed in 3Q FY2015 and universal fielding and training of the software will be conducted."

The Vice Chief of Staff of the Army approved JADOCS for acquisition program status under the Capabilities Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) process. The approved JADOCS Capability Production Document (CPD) dated 16 April 2012, documents the current JADOCS threshold capabilities that are in the field today. As the lead agency for managing JADOCS capabilities within the Department of Defense, the Fires Center of Excellence, tailored the JADOCS CPD to incorporate Field Artillery tasks not included in the currently fielded version (v 1.0.5.1) of the software. JADOCS retirement will occur when system capabilities are individually or collectively incorporated into Army, Service, or Joint programs or are no longer needed as determined by its multi-Service users. \n\nJADOCS Inc 1 is a software only development effort that will produce JADOCS v2.0 software, which will resolve technical requirements generated by the Joint Services that align with the CPD capabilities. JADOCS v2.0 will be the last major version of JADOCS software and will be the follow-on version to the development and fielding of the JADOCS 1.0.5.2 software versions. JADOCS v2.0 will be interoperable with AFATDS Increments 1 and 2.\n\nThe current fielded version of JADOCS software is 1.0.5.1. The targeting and fires functionality of this version are being incorporated into the AFATDS v6.8.1 software baseline. The fielding of the AFATDS v6.8.1 software (planned for Fiscal Year (FY) 15) will represent the initial merge of the JADOCS\/AFATDS capabilities. This software will be provided to users to evaluate AFATDS software's ability to adequately perform the functions provided by the JADOCS software. Any changes, improvements, or further enhancements identified by the Services will be made to the AFATDS software. The JADOCS Joint fires and targeting features will continue to be incorporated into the AFATDS software and will be provided to users with the initial fielding of AFATDS Inc II, v7.0 software (planned to start in FY18 timeframe). JADOCS v2.0 software (planned for fielding in the 4QFY17 timeframe). Users will continue to use JADOCS v2.0 until AFATDS v7.0 meets the total Joint Users requirements (expected with the full fielding of AFATDS v7.0 in FY18). \n\nProgram Executive Officer, Command, Control, Communications -Tactical (PEO C3T) signed the JADOCS Milestone C Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 2 December 2013. The ADM approved MS C and authorized entrance into the Production and Deployment phase. The ADM also approved the acquisition strategy, APB and established the MS C exit criteria."

Upon a successful Milestone B, this software application will be transitioned to PM Mission Command, the assigned project manager, to conduct all Army developmental and operational test and evaluation requirements.  Upon approval for Software Materiel Release, PM Mission Command will work together with PM Soldier Warrior to integrate the software application on Nett Warrior End User Devices (EUDs) and field to units based on the Nett Warrior fielding schedule.  Training on the PFED Increment 2 software will be conducted by PM Mission Command as units are fielded the capability.  Sustainment of the fielded software is the responsibility of PM Mission Command.\n\nThe PFED Increment 2 CPD was approved as an \"Information Technology (IT) Box\" requirement. As such, evolutionary development of the software will continue in order to meet emerging requirements that fall within the bounds of the approved IT Box.  PM Mission Command will continue to manage this aspect of software development, to be conducted by a Government organization. PM Mission Command will continue to work in tandem with PM Soldier Warrior to field and train future versions of the software, as described above.  Likewise, sustainment of future software versions will continue to be managed by PM Mission Command."

They are Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) and Network Assisted Global Positioning System (GPS) for Precision Fires.  \n\nAFATDS Increment 1 provides Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications and functions as the land component's automated Fire Support Command and Control (FSC2) system.  AFATDS is used in the Fires Warfighting Function to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal fires within the overall Mission Command and Control (MC2) enterprise. The system interoperates and integrates with: over 80 different battlefield systems from Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force; and Coalition Forces fire support command and control systems.  AFATDS fuses the essential situational awareness data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities and to safely execute against friendly situational picture.  AFATDS pairs targets to weapons to provide optimum use of fire support assets and timely execution of fire missions.  AFATDS automates the planning, coordinating, and controlling of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).  AFATDS automatically implements detailed commander's guidance in the automation of operational planning, movement control, targeting, target value analysis, and fire support planning. AFATDS is being used in operations in Afghanistan. Project 322 funds development of AFATDS Version 6.8.1. AFATDS 6.8.1 fires capabilities are being enhanced to meet JADOCS ground fires requirements in order to remove JADOCS from the ground forces inventory. With the completion of AFATDS Version 6.8.1, the program office will complete the AFATDS Increment 1 development and will start the Increment 2 development in 4Q FY2014.  Final engineering reviews will be conducted and Government Confidence Testing, Information Assurance testing, and Certification testing will be completed.  Full materiel release of the software will be completed in 3Q FY2015 and universal fielding and training of the software will be conducted. \n\nNetwork Assisted GPS for Precision Fires is a developmental effort to improve performance of GPS-guided munitions.  It requires pre-launch loading of target location and sufficient GPS satellite-related data at the weapon platform level to enable flight path and delivery of precision capable fires.  This hot start capability allows for rapid post-launch time-to-first-fix of GPS signal and maximum utilization of Precision Guided Munition (PGM) maneuver authority to ensure required target engagement performance. This is especially critical for short flight times and steer-early solutions such as mortar and cannon based PGMs. Local GPS Satellite visibility challenges due to vertical terrain\/complex environment issues during normal combat operations can prohibit precision capable fires when using GPS Satellite data generated exclusively at the firing weapon platform. A system-of-systems Network Assisted GPS capability will be developed, integrated, and validated to overcome local GPS Satellite masking problems through the sharing of sufficient timely required GPS Satellite data via Wide-Area Network (WAN) and Local-Area Network (LAN) based materiel solutions that effectively and efficiently leverage mature technologies and taxpayer investments of existing acquisition programs."
