PROF is a risk analysis software package owned and distributed by the United States Air Force. PROF is used by Air Force structural engineers to predict the probability of failure of a weapon system under specified usages. PROF provides for the ability to set inspection\/maintenance schedules before failure occurs, without creating excess\/unnecessary inspections that would impair mission readiness. \n\nThe Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS) Program efforts modify the ETIMS system to support Nuclear Weapons Related Material (NWRM) technical data requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
