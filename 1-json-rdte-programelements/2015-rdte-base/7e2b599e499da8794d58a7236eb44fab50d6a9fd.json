            "val": "The mission of the Joint Department of Defense (DoD)\/Department of Energy (DOE) Munitions Technology Development Program (JMP) is to develop new and innovative warhead, explosive, fuzing, and lifecycle technologies and modeling tools to enable major improvements in conventional munitions.  The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment to this effort.  The DoD funds budgeted in this justification are matched dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD\u2019s relatively small annual investment leverages DOE\u2019s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services\u2019 needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.\n\nThe JMP seeks to develop:  improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions design and evaluation, including evaluation of vulnerability (for example: design of insensitive munitions (IM)); novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation and materials characterizations; higher power and safer energetic materials (EMs)(e.g., explosives and propellants); miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors; design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons\u2014such as penetrators\u2014that are hardened against high impact loads; and tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.\n\nThe JMP is aligned with Department strategic plans and policies such as:\n\n\u2022\tAdvancing munitions for contingency operations, particularly for the reduction of unintended collateral effects.\n\u2022\tReducing time and cost for acquisition of munitions.\n\u2022\tRapidly transitioning science and technology (S&T) to support the warfighter in today\u2019s conflicts.\n\u2022\tEstablishing future core capabilities and maintaining our national S&T capabilities through joint investment and interagency cooperation and teaming.\n\u2022\tAiding in recruiting and retaining high-caliber scientists and engineers at DoD S&T organizations.\n\u2022\tDeveloping advanced munitions technologies to support the increased role of conventional weapons to deter and respond to non-nuclear attack, as described in the Nuclear Posture Review report.\n\u2022\tDeveloping safer munitions that are compliant with IM standards to meet statutory and Department policy requirements.\n\nThe JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers. This community develops technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of over 25 senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCGs conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCGs to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD needs.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.\n\nThe JMP has a long history of successful transitions and significant Return on Investment (ROI).\n\n\u2022\tThe JMP is the primary provider of high performance, physics-based, structural mechanics computer codes used by DoD.  The Department expects this heavy reliance on DOE codes to grow for several reasons including: preference for using DOE codes because they are export-controlled; DOE codes are scalable, incorporate multiphysics modules, run on massively parallel computer systems, and the Department can obtain source codes to modify the tools for individual Service needs.  According to the FY 2014 High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) Requirements Analysis Report, the DOE computer codes are used for over 82 percent of all (classified and unclassified) structural mechanics simulations and for virtually all of the classified calculations run by DoD on HPCMP platforms.  The CPU (central processing unit) hours for CTH alone grew by eight fold between FY12 to FY14 (from 63 million CPU hours to 584 CPU hours).\n\u2022\tA significant number of defense industrial contractors also use the DOE structural mechanics computer codes.\n\u2022\tCheetah, a standalone thermochemical computer code, is the most widely used code by DoD and defense contractors for predicting performance of energetic materials.\n\u2022\tThe Army Research & Engineering Development Center (ARDEC) has stated that the DOE computer codes are now routinely used to design all new warheads.  The use of these tools has reduced the number of validation tests required for each new warhead from about five to one with concomitant cost and time savings.  For example, DOE codes were used to analyze the fusible plug for Excalibur, saving the department close to $2 million dollars.\n\u2022\tThe Army Research Laboratory has used DOE computer codes to develop and deploy new armor solutions to Iraq and Afghanistan with unprecedented speed.\n\u2022\tNew munitions\u2019 case material and explosive fill technologies provide the warfighter with a lethal and low collateral damage capability.  These technologies have been transitioned to the Focused Lethality Munition variant of the Small Diameter Bomb, which is currently fielded.  The technologies are also the basis for a new GBU 129 weapon that is currently under rapid development to meet a Joint Urgent Operational Need requirement for a low-collateral Mk-82 class weapon.\n\u2022\tThe Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has supported applications of JMP technologies, including:  new compact, lightweight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) efforts; pre-deployment training of military personnel by DOE explosive experts on how to recognize feed stocks and processes for homemade explosives; and use of massively parallel, multiphysics computer codes to understand how explosive blast waves cause brain injury and how to mitigate these injuries.\n\u2022\tAn erosive initiator technology developed under the JMP has been transitioned to the Services for use in selectable output weapons and self-destruct capabilities.\n\u2022\tA novel approach to controlling the sensitivity and therefore the initiability of explosives using microwave energy, as well two new, insensitive energetic materials have transitioned to development projects in the Joint IM Technology and Joint Fuze Technology Programs.\n\u2022\tReliability analysis tools were used by Army Missile Command to assess Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM), Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM), and Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire command data-linked guided Missile (TOW).\n\u2022\tRobotic demilitarization processing systems were installed at several locations, including a system at Hawthorne Army Depot, to recover copper shape charge liners, Comp A5, and grenade bodies.\n\nThe JMP works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Warheads and Energetics Consortium (NWEC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors. In addition to the computer codes mentioned earlier, the JMP has transitioned case technology for low-collateral weapons, low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology for smaller, less expensive fuze electronic components, and erosive initiator technology for selectable effects weapons to defense industrial suppliers.\n\nThe integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions\u2019 technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process. The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers. Executive and technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments. The highly challenging technical objectives of the approximately 35 JMP projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.\n\nThe JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas: Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling; Energetic Materials; Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors; Warhead and Penetration Technology; and Munitions Lifecycle Technologies."

The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.\n\nThe JMP has a long history of successful transitions and significant Return on Investment (ROI).\n\n\u2013 The JMP is the primary provider of high performance structural mechanics computer codes used by DoD.  According to the FY 2010 High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) Requirements Analysis Report, the DOE computer codes are used for over 70 percent of all (classified and unclassified) structural mechanics simulations and for virtually all of the classified calculations run by DoD on HPCMP platforms.  The Department expects this heavy reliance on DOE codes to grow for several reasons including: preference for using DOE codes because they are export-controlled; DOE codes are scalable, incorporate multiphysics, and run on massively parallel computer systems; and the Department can obtain source codes to modify for individual Service needs.\n\u2013 A significant number of defense industrial contractors also use the DOE structural mechanics computer codes.\n\u2013 CHEETAH, a standalone thermochemical computer code, is the most widely used code by DoD and defense contractors for predicting performance of energetic materials.\n\u2013 The Army Armament Research, Development & Engineering Center (ARDEC) has stated that the DOE computer codes are now routinely used to design all new warheads. The use of these tools has reduced the number of validation tests required for each new warhead from about five to one with concomitant cost and time savings.\n\u2013 The Army Research Laboratory has used DOE computer codes to develop and deploy new armor solutions to Iraq and Afghanistan with unprecedented speed.\n\u2013 New munitions\u2019 case material and explosive fill technologies provide the warfighter with a lethal and low collateral damage capability.  These technologies have been transitioned to the Focused Lethality Munition variant of the Small Diameter Bomb, which is currently fielded.  The technologies are also the basis for a new GBU 129 weapon that is currently under rapid development to meet a Joint Urgent Operational Need requirement for a low-collateral Mk-82 class weapon.\n\u2013 The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has supported applications of JMP technologies, including: compact synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) efforts; pre-deployment training of military personnel by DOE explosive experts on how to recognize feed stocks and processes for homemade explosives; and use of massively parallel, multiphysics computer codes to understand how explosive blast waves cause brain injury and how to mitigate these injuries.\n\u2013 An erosive initiator technology developed under the JMP has been transitioned to the Services for use in selectable output weapons and self-destruct capabilities.\n\u2013 A novel approach to controlling the sensitivity and therefore the initiability of explosives using microwave energy, as well two new, insensitive energetic materials have transitioned to development projects in the Joint IM Technology and Joint Fuze Technology Programs.\n\u2013 Reliability analysis tools were used by Army Missile Command to assess Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM), Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM), and Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire command data-linked guided Missile (TOW).\n\u2013 Robotic demilitarization processing systems were installed at several locations, including a system at Hawthorne Army Depot to recover copper shape charge liners, Comp A5, and grenade bodies. \n\nThe JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Armaments Consortium (NAC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors.  In addition to the computer codes mentioned earlier, the JMP has transitioned case technology for low-collateral weapons, low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology for smaller, less expensive fuze electronic components, and erosive initiator technology for selectable effects weapons to defense industrial suppliers.\n\nThe integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions\u2019 technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the approximately 35 JMP projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.\n\nThe JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling; Energetic Materials; Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors; Warhead and Penetration Technology; and Munitions Lifecycle Technologies."

                                        "val": "The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new energetic materials (EMs) and supporting technologies to satisfy the competing requirements for smaller, more lethal, and safer munitions.  Work is primarily focused on explosives, gun and rocket propellants, and, to a lesser extent, pyrotechnics.  The projects include development of: new EMs, including new molecules in a range of particle sizes and morphologies; new EM formulations; a fundamental understanding of energetic properties and performance; and computational tools for analysis of performance and sensitivity.  New materials and formulations are developed with the recognition that costs must be reasonable, chemical feed stocks reliable, and manufacturing processes suitable for scale-up to production levels.\n\nBoth Federal statute and Department policy direct the development of safer, less sensitive munitions.  Making munitions less sensitive while maintaining explosive or propellant performance is a difficult challenge.  This goal is best attained through a combination of new EM development, EM characterization, and more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  It is cost prohibitive to qualify weapons for compliance with insensitive munitions requirements through testing alone.  A better, and in many cases, the only means to qualify these weapons is with the combination of analysis based on validated computational tools and a few well-designed tests.\n\nThe Department also needs munitions that provide selectable effects.  To achieve these effects, weapons designers need to thoroughly understand the performance of EMs used in both the main weapon fill and the initiation systems.  Distributed fuzing systems can provide selectable effects as well as safer munitions, but such complex, small-scale systems require more complete knowledge of EM detonation physics and in some cases, new EMs designed for this application.\n\nThe desire for smaller and lighter munitions is driven in large part by the increasing dependence on unmanned weapons platforms and to some extent by the need to reduce logistical burden, especially energy consumption.  New EMs are needed to meet the munitions weight and size requirements while maintaining lethality and safety.\n\nThe Department is working to increase the range and velocity of weapons and to develop weapons against hardened targets.  These applications subject EMs to high accelerations and shock loads.  To support the development of these new systems, we need to improve our ability to model EM under higher impact loads and to characterize relevant properties to determine their ability to survive in these aggressive environments.  We may also need to develop new, more robust EMs that survive impact loads while maintaining lethality and initiability.\n\nThe specific projects in the energetic materials technical focus area are:\n-  Synthesis, properties, and scale-up of new energetic compounds.\n-  Insensitive munitions and surety.\n-  New energetic materials formulation and characterization.\n-  Cheetah thermochemical code development and experiments.\n-  Micro- and nano-energetics synthesis and initiation.\n-  Hazards analysis of energetic materials.\n-  Reaction processes of energetic materials.\n-  Microfluidic reactor synthesis of sensitive explosives.\n-  Energetics chemistry and properties.\n-  Microstructural and kinetic effects on energetic materials behavior.\n-  Microwave sensitization and initiation of energetic materials."

Initiators, fuzes, and sensors must work reliably together to prevent unintended detonation, to correctly detect intended targets, and to initiate detonation when required.   Projects in this focus area support the Department\u2019s needs to miniaturize fuzing systems.  Smaller systems are required for several reasons including: compatibility with smaller and lighter weapons systems; trading volume in munitions for other components such as additional explosives, higher energy and power density power sources, or enhanced guidance systems; increasing reliability through redundancy (use of two or more smaller initiating systems); and upgrading existing sub-munitions with smarter and more reliable fuzing systems. \n\nThe miniaturization of fuzing systems requires new material and components, new power systems, new diagnostic techniques, and improved modeling tools for microdetonics.  The Department also needs weapons systems with selectable effects and these effects may be achieved with multi-point initiation systems.  Such systems are inherently more complex and require improved characterization of initiator materials and components, as well as more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  To attain greater precision and to avoid unintended collateral effects when weapons are used in the complex environment of counter-insurgency or counter-terrorist operations, target sensors must be reliable and provide high-fidelity discrimination.  Projects in this focus area are developing technologies to achieve this level of performance in compact packages.\n\nThe specific projects in the initiators, fuzes, and sensors technical focus area are:\n\n-  Firing systems technology: FireMod firing set code model development and validation, 1.6 hazard classification detonator development, and initiation and detonation physics on the millimeter scale.\n-  Safe, Arm, Fuze and Fire Technology: Initiation & Detonation; Advanced Firing System Components.\n-  Advanced initiation systems: diagnostics development, microdetonics, miniature initiation systems, and detonators for enhanced safety.\n-  Thermal Battery Performance Modeling.\n-  MESASAR synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors.\n-  Vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) sensors for proximity fuzing."

The Department\u2019s requirement to achieve more precise weapon effects with minimum collateral damage is supported by work on controlled fragmentation, non-fragmenting warhead cases, and multiphase blast explosives (MBX).
