This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis program develops and demonstrates advanced technologies, including Electromagnetic (EM) Rail Gun for naval weapon systems.  \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This activity includes support to the following FNC Enabling Capabilities (ECs): Advanced Naval Fires Technology, Hostile Fire Detection and Response, Dynamic Target Engagement & Enhanced Sensor Capabilities, and Discriminate and Provide Terminal Guidance for Weapons Targeted at Moving Targets.\n\nFY13 to FY 2014 reduction is due to the Solid State Laser (SSL) program completing efforts in 0603114N.  Solid State Laser program funding continues in PE 0602114N for FY 2015. \n\nThe SSL-QRC program was initiated during FY13 and is planned to complete during FY 2015.  The reduction of funding from FY 2014 to FY 2015 is due to the completion of procurement and design activities during FY 2014."
