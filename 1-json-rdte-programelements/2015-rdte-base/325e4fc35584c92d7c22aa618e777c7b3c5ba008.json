            "val": "Minuteman (MM) Squadrons development efforts will ensure the extension of the operational life of the MM III ICBM weapon system through 2030.  \n\nThe MM III Ground and Comm Equipment program replaces obsolete\/unsupportable ground-based weapon system equipment located at Launch Control Centers (LCCs) and Launch Facilities (LFs) necessary to continue MM III operations through 2030.  Current efforts include development, qualification, integration, and testing of replacement equipment such as the LCC Block Upgrades, ASU, and UHF Receiver. As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program.\n\nMM III Baseline Support program replaces or upgrades obsolete\/unsupportable flight test unique equipment installed on the missile during flight test, used to test MM III systems on the ground, or located at test facilities to collect, process and analyze test data.  Flight test equipment supports test and evaluation of newly developed or modified MM III capabilities and to conduct MM III Force Development Evaluations (FDEs) determining ICBM force readiness, reliability and capability shortfalls.  Current efforts include development, qualification, integration and testing of replacement equipment such as the MMIWRP, MMODS and Ground Test Upgrades.  As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program.  Baseline support also provides for other MM III unique government costs, studies of system performance, contract closeout costs, cost trades and acquisition planning activities, up to and including proposal preparation, for future capabilities.\n\nMM Support Equipment program designs, develops, and tests replacement of obsolete\/non-serviceable weapon system support equipment.  Current efforts include design, development, and testing of support equipment such as RFSE, CSM, STACS, TERP and RSERP.\n\nMM Crypto Mods executes USSTRATCOM, Air Force Global Strike Command, and Nuclear Weapon Safety Center requirements by implementing the KS-60 capabilities of remote key\/code change and irreversible transformation as mandated in the approved Capabilities Development Document (dated 4 Jan 05) and addresses Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group Operational Safety Review requirements 98-2, 00-1 and 02-2.  It also incorporates continuous signal lockout capabilities to prevent the widespread loss of status monitoring.  These features will greatly increase security during code changes by reducing the frequency of open sites 75 days annually and will reduce associated resource costs for 450 Launch Facilities and 45 Launch Control Centers.\n\nMM Operational Equipment program designs, develops, and tests replacement of weapon system equipment including the Guidance Modernization effort and SRM Modernization effort.  Beginning in FY15, the Guidance Modernization effort will provide modifcations or replacements for the current MM III guidance subsystem necessary to ensure operations through 2030 and to support future Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) requirements.  Beginning in FY15, the SRM Modernization effort will provide modifcations or replacements for the current MM III propulsion subsystem necessary to ensure operations through 2030 and to support future GBSD requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes developmental efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal years."

Segment #1, responsible for providing software to accept National Security Agency (NSA) codes, Operations Plan (OPLAN) changes and software updates on compact disk (CD), has been completed. Segment #2 will provide software and hardware necessary to import all other data on CD and produce Wing Codes Processing System products on CD. Segment #2 will also replace the Cartridge Transfer Unit (CTU) with the Data Transfer Unit (DTU).  CSM effectively supports the replacement of aging media required to transport and handle mission essential codes and data throughout the ICBM weapon system.  The shelf life of the current stock of DC300 tape cartridges and 9-track tapes begin to expire in 2015.  CSM delivers the capability to load codes\/software on Minuteman III ICBMs through 2030 and is critical to code change activities.
