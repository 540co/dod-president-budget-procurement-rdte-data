            "val": "AFATDS Increment 2 is the automated Command and Control (C2) system (0203728A) for the ground Fires Warfighting Function. AFATDS Increment 2 will permit the management and targeting analysis of the collective and coordinated target acquisition data, effective selection of munitions-target pairing from indirect fire weapons (land and sea based), as well as fixed and rotary wing aircraft against targets located throughout an area of operations.  AFATDS Increment 2 will develop a new software architecture by providing three distinct applications to support role-based functionality: Fire Support, Fire Control, and Fire Direction. It leverages the Common Operating Environment (COE) and Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) products and capabilities. AFATDS Increment 2 provides a less complicated AFATDS software package to the Warfighter and is fully compliant with the Joint Command and Control Common User Interface (JC2 CUI) architectures. \n\nProject DU5 funds development of AFATDS Increment 2. Decomposition of the baseline software (AFATDS version 6.8.1) will be required prior to development of the code for AFATDS Increment 2 (version 7.0). A software development contract will be awarded to develop the Fires Common Core, the foundation upon which the three functional applications will operate. Contracting actions will be completed in FY2015 to award multiple software development contracts for the primary functions of the software: Fire Control; Fire Direction; and Fire Support. A contract for software integration may also be necessary, subject to the completion of the analysis for the development of the contracting strategy. The Fires Common Core software development activity will begin in FY2015, in order to allow developers of the other three applications to subsequently initiate their development."

They are Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System Increment 1 (AFATDS Inc 1)203728A and Network Assisted Global Positioning System (GPS) for Precision Fires.  \n\nAFATDS Increment 1 provides Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications and functions as the land component's automated Fire Support Command and Control (FSC2) system.  AFATDS is used in the Fires Warfighting Function to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal fires within the overall Mission Command and Control (MC2) enterprise. The system interoperates and integrates with: over 80 different battlefield systems from Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support command and control systems.AFATDS fuses the essential situational awareness data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities and to safely execute against friendly situational picture.  AFATDS pairs targets to weapons to provide optimum use of fire support assets and timely execution of fire missions.  AFATDS automates the planning, coordinating, and controlling of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).  AFATDS automatically implements detailed commander's guidance in the automation of operational planning, movement control, targeting, target value analysis, and fire support planning. AFATDS is being used in operations in Afghanistan. Project 322 funds development of AFATDS Version 6.8.1. AFATDS 6.8.1 fires capabilities are being enhanced to meet JADOCS ground fires requirements in order to remove JADOCS from the ground forces inventory. With the completion of AFATDS Version 6.8.1, the program office will complete the AFATDS Increment 1 development and will start the Increment 2 development in 4Q FY2014.  Final engineering reviews will be conducted and Government Confidence Testing, Information Assurance testing, and Certification testing will be completed.   \n\nNetwork Assisted GPS for Precision Fires is a developmental effort to improve performance of GPS-guided munitions (0203728A).  It requires pre-launch loading of target location and sufficient GPS satellite-related data at the weapon platform level to enable flight path and delivery of precision capable fires.  This hot start capability allows for rapid post-launch time-to-first-fix of GPS signal and maximum utilization of Precision Guided Munition (PGM) maneuver authority to ensure required target engagement performance.  This is especially critical for short flight times and steer-early solutions such as mortar and cannon based PGMs.  Local GPS Satellite visibility challenges due to vertical terrain\/complex environment issues during normal combat operations can prohibit precision capable fires when using GPS Satellite data generated exclusively at the firing weapon platform (0203728A).  A system-of-systems Network Assisted GPS capability will be developed, integrated, and validated to overcome local GPS Satellite masking problems through the sharing of sufficient timely required GPS Satellite data via Wide-Area Network (WAN) and Local-Area Network (LAN) based materiel solutions that effectively and efficiently leverage mature technologies and taxpayer investments of existing acquisition programs."

AFATDS Increment 2 will permit the management and targeting analysis of the collective and coordinated target acquisition data, effective selection of munitions-target pairing from indirect fire weapons (land and sea based), as well as fixed and rotary wing aircraft against targets located throughout an area of operations.  AFATDS Increment 2 will develop a new software architecture by providing three distinct applications to support role-based functionality: Fire Support, Fire Control, and Fire Direction.  It leverages the Common Operating Environment (COE) and Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) products and capabilities.  AFATDS Increment 2 provides a less complicated AFATDS software package to the Warfighter and is fully compliant with the Joint Command and Control Common User Interface (JC2 CUI) architectures.  \n\nAFATDS Increment 2 will provide three distinct applications\u2013Fire Support, Fire Control, and Fire Direction\u2013that communicate with other systems via the Army's Lower Tactical Internet and Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) communications network.  AFATDS Increment 2 will leverage the Command Post Computing Environment's common core database and core system functions\/management that resides on the battle command server.  Using the web-based tools, the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) commander and his Fires staff can access other command centers via search wizards over WIN-T and internet gateways to the Global Information Grid (GIG). AFATDS Increment 2 will meet the operational need to provide Fires data to a central database repository within the BCT.  That repository will be accessible using web services or web-enabled search wizards to locate information within a BCT, adjacent BCTs or higher headquarters, thus supporting unified battle command.  AFATDS Increment 2 will be used to actively plan offensive operations and exploit electronic attack weapon systems through the use of planning tools for lethal and non-lethal effects and the status and readiness of the systems that can best support the commander's intent.  AFATDS Increment 2 will provide the supported maneuver commander the capability to plan, coordinate, rehearse, and execute integrated networked fires.  Networked fires include lethal and non-lethal platforms.  Net-centricity will enable the BCT commander to view targets that adjacent BCTs have encountered or engaged in their area of operations.  This capability enables the commander to:  exploit under-tasked air support assets; view\/task weapons platforms based on coordinated command-supported relationships; and search target data files and repositories for enemy patterns that can be used in targeting and planning.\n\nProject DU5 funds development of AFATDS Increment 2. Initial AFATDS Inc 2 (version 7.0) development entails decomposing the AFATDS Increment 1 (v6.8.1) baseline."

The Vice Chief of Staff of the Army approved JADOCS for acquisition program status under the Capabilities Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) process. The approved JADOCS Capability Production Document (CPD) dated 16 April 2012, documents the current JADOCS threshold capabilities that are in the field today. As the lead agency for managing JADOCS capabilities within the Department of Defense, the Fires Center of Excellence, tailored the JADOCS CPD to incorporate Field Artillery tasks not included in the currently fielded version (v 1.0.5.1) of the software. JADOCS retirement will occur when system capabilities are individually or collectively incorporated into Army, Service, or Joint programs or are no longer needed as determined by its multi-Service users. \n\nJADOCS Inc 1 is a software only development effort that will produce JADOCS v2.0 software, which will resolve technical requirements generated by the Joint Services that align with the CPD capabilities. JADOCS v2.0 will be the last major version of JADOCS software and will be the follow-on version to the development and fielding of the JADOCS 1.0.5.2 software versions. JADOCS v2.0 will be interoperable with AFATDS Increments 1 and 2.\n\nThe current fielded version of JADOCS software is 1.0.5.1. The targeting and fires functionality of this version are being incorporated into the AFATDS v6.8.1 software baseline. The fielding of the AFATDS v6.8.1 software (planned for Fiscal Year (FY) 15) will represent the initial merge of the JADOCS\/AFATDS capabilities. This software will be provided to users to evaluate AFATDS software's ability to adequately perform the functions provided by the JADOCS software. Any changes, improvements, or further enhancements identified by the Services will be made to the AFATDS software. The JADOCS Joint fires and targeting features will continue to be incorporated into the AFATDS software and will be provided to users with the initial fielding of AFATDS Inc 2, v7.0 software (planned to start in FY18 timeframe). JADOCS v2.0 software (planned for fielding in the 4QFY17 timeframe). Users will continue to use JADOCS v2.0 until AFATDS v7.0 meets the total Joint Users requirements (expected with the full fielding of AFATDS v7.0 in FY18). \n\nProgram Executive Officer, Command, Control, Communications -Tactical (PEO C3T) signed the JADOCS Milestone C Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 2 December 2013. The ADM approved MS C and authorized entrance into the Production and Deployment phase. The ADM also approved the acquisition strategy, APB and established the MS C exit criteria."
