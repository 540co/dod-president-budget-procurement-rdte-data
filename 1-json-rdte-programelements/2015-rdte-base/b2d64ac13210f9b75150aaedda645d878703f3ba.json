Capability development of an automated risk management framework to assess and mitigate cyber and other threats to Air Force information technology and mission assets.

Additionally, this capability promotes efficiency and sound resource allocation by enabling commanders to make better decisions when selecting risk reduction counter measures. Other development activities for Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) are directly aligned with GCSS-AF's service oriented framework and the movement of infrastructure and services to a Common Computing Environment (CCE). Continued test and evaluation is critical to avoid technical obsolescence of this critical infrastructure and includes studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
