HSPD-12 requires rapid electronic authentication for all Government employees, uniformed individuals and contractors. The Defense Enrollment and Eligibility System will provide Enterprise capability for the cardholder data repository, common Access interface to multiple types of Access control hardware, common Access software, the ability to control Access to multiple facilities through one authoritative data source, and provide the standards and data to\/form and power efficient gates. Implement Enterprise Access control data for the DoD while providing standards and reducing redundancy. RDT&E funding will be expended to develop the secure interfaces necessary to work with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and first responders for Enterprise authentication. Many systems support different aspects of electronic authentication across the Department. RDT&E will allow for the pursuit of a potential solution that will interface disparate applications\/systems. This will increase Government efficiency by rapidly verifying electronically the identity of an individual and can be used by many applications, reduce identity fraud, protect privacy by limiting information stored, and increase privacy processes to maintain Access controls, thereby facilitating identification of first responders"
