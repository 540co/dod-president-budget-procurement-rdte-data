            "val": "Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration.  The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning and targeting capability.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, and the Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (ICITE).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed and Mobile configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested, a continuing series of software releases will be integrated into Army Common\/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process.\n\nThe Army Acquisition Executive designated to PEO IEW&S and DCGS-A as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead.  As such, DCGS-A is defining the architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3\/5\/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.\n\nDCGS-A consolidates, enhances, and modernizes the Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities formerly found in nine Army intelligence programs of record (Common Ground Station (CGS), Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS), Counterintelligence & Interrogator Operations Workstation (CI&I OPS WS), All Source Analysis System (ASAS), Enhanced TracWolf (ETW), Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS), Integrated Meteorological System (IMETS), Tactical Exploitation System (TES), and Prophet Control) and two Quick Reaction Capabilities (Joint Intelligence Operations Center \u2013 Iraq (JIOC-I) and Imagery Work Station(IWS)).  DCGS-A provides these technologically advanced PED capabilities in tailored and scalable mobile and fixed configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  The program develops software packages to be embedded in mission command and other select systems to provide required ISR\/analytic capabilities.  DCGS-A is a critical Army priority.\n\nDCGS-A software is tailored by echelon and scalable to each unit's mission.  DCGS-A provides commanders and staffs the ability to maintain an accurate and up to date understanding of the operational environment.  The DCGS-A contribution to commanders' visualization and situational awareness, rapid planning, and the synchronization of all warfighting functions, enable Army units to operate within the enemy's decision cycle.  This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from humanitarian to major combat operations.\n\nThe DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a sanctuary based processing environment.  The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment\/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers, where the data is stored.  This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems.  Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12\/Full Deployment Decision in 1QFY13, the program is deploying DCGS-A Increment 1 Release 1 Software Baseline capability throughout the Army.\n\nFY15 Base funding in the amount of $9.270 million for 956, will be used for the continued development and testing of the DCGS-A Increment 1 Software Releases as well as the continued development and testing of the of the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) as it fits into the Army's overarching Common Operating Environment (COE) construct.   The COE has been directed by the ASA(ALT) and concurred by the Army G3\/5\/7 as a priority effort to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE vision.  Funds used for efforts associated with the development of the CPCE\/COE will include the continued merger\/collapse of capabilities across multiple Battlefield Functional Areas (BFAs) and the consolidation of hardware used across the BFAs.  Funds used for efforts associated with the development of the software will include continued advancements in the Standard Sharable Geospatial Foundation to support the Tactical Common Operating Picture, as well as further investment into capabilities and widget development supporting All Source Intelligence, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), and emerging architectural and infrastructure enhancements.  Furthermore, the program will update the commercial technologies to the latest version(s) to enable industry developed enhanced features. Testing activities requiring these funds will include Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) for Release 3; Participation in Network Integration Evaluation and Exercises such as: Empire Challenge, ULCHI Freedom Guardian, and Joint Interoperability Certification test(s) for each software release. The result of these activities all serve to prove out the capabilities in Increment 1 Release 3 and COE Version 3 (COE V3).\n\nFY15 Base funding in the amount of $10.885 million for D07, will continue the iterative DCGS-A software releases that will increase the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability our Army requires.  Increment 2 of the DCGS-A program will continue critical updates to the All Source Intelligence and the overarching Intelligence Processing capability to the Army through the Cloud Computing capability.  This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment, while maintaining the incremental software updates required to remain current."

                            "val": "The Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) program was created in response to the Department of Defense (DoD) Distributed Common Ground\/Surface System (DCGS) Mission Area Initial Capabilities Document (MA ICD) dated 13 Aug 2004, which captured the overarching requirements for an Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Family of Systems (FoS) that will contribute to Joint and combined Warfighter needs. That ICD was updated as the Distributed Common Ground\/Surface System (DCG\/SS) Enterprise ICD, and approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 27 Feb 2009. The Army requirements were refined in the DCGS-A Capabilities Development Document (CDD), and approved by the JROC 31 Oct 2005. The DCGS-A program is currently in the Production and Deployment phase and was designated as a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) in OSD (AT&L) Memorandum, 29 Mar 2010. \n\nDCGS-A is following an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop and field system capabilities over time to satisfy the requirements of the DCGS-A Capability Development Document (CDD). Following this approach, the first increment was defined and a Capability Production Document (CPD) was created with full consideration of all of the preceding supporting documents and analysis. As part of its initial staffing, a Cost Benefit Analysis was completed in support of the DCGS-A CPD. This analysis projected a significant cost avoidance\/savings over the life cycle by not limiting the hardware configuration to a one size fits all unit types design but rather integrating the DCGS-A Software capabilities into common servers and other IT components fielded at that echelon. This approach was validated during the Milestone C and Full Deployment Decision process in FY2012 through the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) approval of the Economic Analysis.  This Economic Analysis validated the cost savings achieved utilizing the acquisition approach outlined above. \n\nThe DCGS-A System Engineering Plan (SEP) updated the current development plan and was approved by OASD (R&E) on 5 Dec 2011. The DCGS-A Revised Acquisition Strategy (AS) was approved by the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) on 8 Aug 2013. The DCGS-A Acquisition Program Baseline was approved on 26 Feb 2013. The DCGS-A program received a Milestone C decision on 29 Feb 2012 and an operational test was completed in Jun 2012. A successful Full Deployment Decision (FDD) for Release 1 Initial Minimum Capability was obtained December 2012.  \n\nPM DCGS-A has been designated as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead for PEO IEW&S. As such, DCGS-A is currently aligning it's architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This alignment is in accordance with the G-3\/5\/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision. Our acquisition strategy supports this initiative as we continue to collapse PORs and reduce footprint following our capability migration path and iterative development of software releases which continue to increase capabilities to satisfy the remaining CPD requirements beyond Initial Minimal Capability. As DCGS-A continues the path through Increment 1 and beyond, each release will focus on the COE and continually align the Command Post activities with DCGS-A Cloud and POR migration activities.  The program office expects to continue as the DCGS-A System Integrator for software development and hardware integration, and will continue to access multiple vendors by leveraging a variety of competitively awarded contracts."

The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning and targeting capability.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, compliant with standards providing the Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (ICITE).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed and Mobile configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested, a continuing series of software releases will be integrated into Army Common\/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process.\n\nThe Army Acquisition Executive designated to PEO IEW&S and DCGS-A as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead.  As such, DCGS-A is defining the architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3\/5\/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.\n\nThe DCGS-A acquisition strategy incrementally consolidates, enhances, and modernizes the Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities formerly found in nine Army intelligence programs of record (Common Ground Station (CGS), Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS), Counterintelligence & Interrogator Operations Workstation (CI&I OPS WS), All Source Analysis System (ASAS), Enhanced TracWolf (ETW), Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS), Integrated Meteorological System (IMETS), Tactical Exploitation System (TES), and Prophet Control) and two Quick Reaction Capabilities (Joint Intelligence Operations Center \u2013 Iraq (JIOC-I) and Imagery Work Station(IWS)).  DCGS-A provides these technologically advanced PED capabilities through iterative software releases delivered in tailored and scalable mobile and fixed configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  The program develops software packages to be embedded in mission command and other select systems to provide required ISR\/analytic capabilities.  DCGS-A is a critical Army priority.\n\nFY15 Base funding in the amount of $10.885 million will continue the iterative DCGS-A software releases that will increase the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability our Army requires.  Increment 2 of the DCGS-A program will continue critical updates to the All Source Intelligence and the overarching Intelligence Processing capability to the Army through the Cloud Computing capability.  This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment, while maintaining the incremental software updates required to remain current."

                            "val": "The Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) program was created in response to the Department of Defense (DoD) Distributed Common Ground\/Surface System (DCGS) Mission Area Initial Capabilities Document (MA ICD) dated 13 Aug 2004, which captured the overarching requirements for an Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Family of Systems (FoS) that will contribute to Joint and combined Warfighter needs. That ICD was updated as the Distributed Common Ground\/Surface System (DCG\/SS) Enterprise ICD, and approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 27 Feb 2009. The Army requirements were refined in the DCGS-A Capabilities Development Document (CDD), and approved by the JROC 31 Oct 2005. The DCGS-A program is currently in the Production and Deployment phase and was designated as a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) in OSD (AT&L) Memorandum, 29 Mar 2010.  The Information Systems Capability Development Document (ISCDD), currently in staffing, is an update to the 2005 CDD.\n\nDCGS-A is following an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop and field system capabilities over time to satisfy the requirements of the DCGS-A Capability Development Document (CDD). Following this approach, the first increment was defined and a Capability Production Document (CPD) was created with full consideration of all of the preceding supporting documents and analysis. As part of its initial staffing, a Cost Benefit Analysis was completed in support of the DCGS-A CPD. This analysis projected a significant cost avoidance\/savings over the life cycle by not limiting the hardware configuration to a one size fits all unit types design but rather integrating the DCGS-A Software capabilities into common servers and other IT components fielded at that echelon. This approach was validated during the Milestone C and Full Deployment Decision process in FY2012 through the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) approval of the Economic Analysis.  This Economic Analysis validated the cost savings achieved utilizing the acquisition approach outlined above. \n\nThe DCGS-A Increment 2 Acquisition Strategy will be a competitive contract to a single vendor for managing the development, integration, documentation, and test for the Increment 2 Releases.  Anticipate RFP release in 3QFY15 and contract award in 2QFY16.\n\nPM DCGS-A has been designated as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead for PEO IEW&S. As such, DCGS-A is currently aligning its architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This alignment is in accordance with the G-3\/5\/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision. Our acquisition strategy supports this initiative as we continue to collapse PORs and reduce footprint following our capability migration path and iterative development of software releases which continue to increase capabilities to satisfy the remaining CPD requirements beyond Initial Minimal Capability. As DCGS-A continues the path through Increment 2, each release will focus on the COE and continually align the Command Post activities with the DCGS-A platforms.  The program office expects to award a competitive contract for software development and hardware integration."
