            "val": "The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft, sensors, a ground control station (GCS), communications equipment, weapon kits, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data\/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system.  The system is designed to be modular and open-ended.  Mission-specific equipment is employed in a 'plug-and-play' mission kit concept allowing specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.  \n\nThe MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is a single-engine, turbo-prop Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) designed to operate over-the-horizon at medium-to-high altitude for long endurance sorties.  The aircraft is designed primarily to prosecute critical, emerging Time-Sensitive-Targets (TSTs) as a radar, Electro-optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR), and laser designator-based attack asset with on-board hard-kill capability (hunter-killer).  It also performs Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Target Acquisition (ISR TA).  In the hunter-killer role, the aircraft employs fused multi-spectral sensors to find, fix, and track ground targets using Automatic Target Cueing (ATC), high definition EO\/IR, metric sensor and other capabilities, and assesses post-strike results.  The MQ-9 system is continuing to develop field capability through incremental upgrades.  Future capabilities development activity includes airframe and airframe system improvements such as: increasing the maximum gross takeoff weight capability of the aircraft from 10,500 to 11,700lbs; increasing the operational range and endurance of the baseline MQ-9 aircraft (adding external fuel tanks and\/or airframe modifications such as wing extensions); incorporating an anti-ice\/de-ice capability to transit light icing conditions (will involve wing\/tail modifications as well as turbine inlet heating); propulsion system improvements; enhancing MQ-9 systems to include Automatic Takeoff and Landing Capability (ATLC); integrated redundant avionics; modifying the system to include provisions for a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) exportable version of the weapon system; Predator Primary Data Link (PPDL) communication system upgrades and communications upgrades to include data link encryption, IP networking, and Beyond Line-of-Sight comm upgrades; navigation system upgrades; electrical system upgrades; incorporation of Elevated Temperature Wet (ETW) materials; secure voice and data communications, including SATCOM upgrades; sensor\/stores management computer improvement; MIL-STD-1760 advanced weapons data bus; Universal Armament and Sensor Interface and Miniature Munitions\/Store Interface; advanced sensor and weapon payloads; improved human-machine interface (HMI); integrating precision weapons (e.g. AGM-114 Hellfire missile, GBU-12\/38\/49 guided bombs, and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) variants); hardware and software upgrades to the ground control station for MQ-9 operations; completing airworthiness certification; weapon system certification and accreditation; and producing applicable training devices that emulate weapon system functionality and capabilities.  The MQ-9 program will continue to support other payload and capability development activities funded in other program elements (e.g. SIGINT, communications, Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) leveraging Gorgon Stare Quick Reaction Capability, advanced Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED), Dismount Detection Radar (DDR), missile defense, hyperspectral, and other sensors and weapons) and address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues.  Activities also include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution, and studies supporting analysis and investment in future MQ-9 program planning.\n   \nThe GCS, common with the MQ-1 Predator, functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communications.  The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support Remote Split Operations (RSO).  The GCS has the capability to perform mission planning; provides a means for manual control; allows personnel to launch, recover, and monitor aircraft, payloads, and system communications status; incorporates secure data links to send aircraft and payload commands and receive system telemetry and payload data; monitors threats to the aircraft; displays the common operational picture; and provides support functions.  Launch and Recovery GCS (LRGCS) allows for servicing, systems checks, maintenance, launch and recovery of aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed facility GCS, and conducting operations within line-of-sight range of the LRGCS.  GCS upgrades will be developed and fielded in coordination with improvements to MQ-9 system capabilities and in response to evolving operational and information assurance\/certification and accreditation requirements.  Key efforts include GCS upgrades that add new LINUX processors, high definition monitors, ergonomic improvements, improved human-machine interfaces, open systems architecture, and improved crew habitability. In addition, the GCS upgrade effort also includes development\/integration of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Command and Control (C2) Initiative (UCI) government-owned standard to enable improved capabilities for situational awareness and multi-mission management monitoring and oversight in the GCS. This project will also increase interoperability among developed systems by developing common standard and tools.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft, sensors, a ground control station (GCS), communications equipment, weapon kits, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data\/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system.  The system is designed to be modular and open-ended.  Mission-specific equipment is employed in a 'plug-and-play' mission kit concept allowing specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.  \n\nThe MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is a single-engine, turbo-prop Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) designed to operate over-the-horizon at medium-to-high altitude for long endurance sorties.  The aircraft is designed primarily to prosecute critical, emerging Time-Sensitive-Targets (TSTs) as a radar, Electro-optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR), and laser designator-based attack asset with on-board hard-kill capability (hunter-killer).  It also performs Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Target Acquisition (ISR TA).  In the hunter-killer role, the aircraft employs fused multi-spectral sensors to find, fix, and track ground targets using Automatic Target Cueing (ATC), high definition EO\/IR, metric sensor and other capabilities, and assesses post-strike results.  The MQ-9 system is continuing to develop field capability through incremental upgrades.  Future capabilities development activity includes airframe and airframe system improvements such as: increasing the maximum gross takeoff weight capability of the aircraft from 10,500 to 11,700lbs; increasing the operational range and endurance of the baseline MQ-9 aircraft (adding external fuel tanks and\/or airframe modifications such as wing extensions); incorporating an anti-ice\/de-ice capability to transit light icing conditions (will involve wing\/tail modifications as well as turbine inlet heating); propulsion system improvements; enhancing MQ-9 systems to include Automatic Takeoff and Landing Capability (ATLC); integrated redundant avionics; modifying the system to include provisions for a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) exportable version of the weapon system; Predator Primary Data Link (PPDL) communication system upgrades and communications upgrades to include data link encryption, IP networking, and Beyond Line-of-Sight comm upgrades; navigation system upgrades; electrical system upgrades; incorporation of Elevated Temperature Wet (ETW) materials; secure voice and data communications, including SATCOM upgrades; sensor\/stores management computer improvement; MIL-STD-1760 advanced weapons data bus; Universal Armament and Sensor Interface and Miniature Munitions\/Store Interface; advanced sensor and weapon payloads; improved human-machine interface (HMI); integrating precision weapons (e.g. AGM-114 Hellfire missile, GBU-12\/38\/49 guided bombs, and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) variants); hardware and software upgrades to the ground control station for MQ-9 operations; completing airworthiness certification; weapon system certification and accreditation; and producing applicable training devices that emulate weapon system functionality and capabilities.  The MQ-9 program will continue to support other payload and capability development activities funded in other program elements (e.g. SIGINT, communications, Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) leveraging Gorgon Stare Quick Reaction Capability, advanced Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED), Dismount Detection Radar (DDR), missile defense, hyperspectral, and other sensors and weapons) and address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues.  Activities also include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution, and studies supporting analysis and investment in future MQ-9 program planning.\n   \nThe GCS, common with the MQ-1 Predator, functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communications.  The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support Remote Split Operations (RSO).  The GCS has the capability to perform mission planning; provides a means for manual control; allows personnel to launch, recover, and monitor aircraft, payloads, and system communications status; incorporates secure data links to send aircraft and payload commands and receive system telemetry and payload data; monitors threats to the aircraft; displays the common operational picture; and provides support functions.  Launch and Recovery GCS (LRGCS) allows for servicing, systems checks, maintenance, launch and recovery of aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed facility GCS, and conducting operations within line-of-sight range of the LRGCS.  GCS upgrades will be developed and fielded in coordination with improvements to MQ-9 system capabilities and in response to evolving operational and information assurance\/certification and accreditation requirements.  Key efforts include GCS upgrades that add new LINUX processors, high definition monitors, ergonomic improvements, improved human-machine interfaces, open systems architecture, and improved crew habitability. In addition, the GCS upgrade effort also includes development\/integration of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Command and Control (C2) Initiative (UCI) government-owned standard to enable improved capabilities for situational awareness and multi-mission management monitoring and oversight in the GCS. This project will also increase interoperability among developed systems by developing common standard and tools.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
