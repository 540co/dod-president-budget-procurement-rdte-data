The weapons and munitions include artillery, mortars, medium caliber, tank fired, and shoulder fired. Project 232 focuses on affordable delivery of scalable (lethal to non-lethal) effects.  Project L96 matures and integrates critical high energy laser subsystems into a mobile demonstrator to explore and validate system performance in relevant environments.   Project L97 demonstrates performance of advanced obscurants and delivery of mechanisms and conducts forensic analysis of explosives and hazardous materials to enable detection by Soldier and Small Units.  \n\nWork in this PE is related to, and fully coordinated with, PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602307A (Advanced Weapons Technology),  PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0602622A (Chemical, Smoke, and Equipment Defeating Technology), PE 0602624A (Weapons and Munitions Technology), PE 0602772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology), PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603008A (Electronic Warfare Advanced Technology), and PE 0603313A (Missile and Rocket Advanced Technology).\n  \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n  \nWork in this PE is performed by the Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ; Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC), Edgewood, MD; and the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Center (SMDC), Huntsville, AL."

The major effort under this project is the phased approach for mobile high power solid state laser (SSL) technology demonstrations that are traceable to the form, fit, and function requirements for a HEL weapon.  At entry level weapon power of around 10 kW, SSL technology has the potential to engage and defeat small caliber mortars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), surface mines, sensors, and optics.  At full weapon system power levels of around 100 kW, SSL technology has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM), UAVs, and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), as well as surface mines, sensors, and optics at tactically relevant ranges.  HELs are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to strategically, operationally, or tactically stockpile ordnance.  This effort utilizes a modular building block approach with open systems architecture to ensure growth, interoperability, and opportunity for technology insertions for maturation of laser, beam control, sensor\/radar, integration of power and thermal management subsystems, as well as Battle Management Command, Control, and Computers (BMC3). \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n \nWork is performed by the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/Army Forces Strategic Command, Technical Center, Huntsville, AL."
