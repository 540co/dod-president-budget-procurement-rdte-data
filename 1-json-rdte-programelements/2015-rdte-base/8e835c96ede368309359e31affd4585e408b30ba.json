            "val": "The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) safeguards America and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives) by providing capabilities to reduce, eliminate, counter the threat, and mitigate its effects.  The Basic Research Initiative program provides for the discovery and development of fundamental knowledge and understanding by research performers drawn primarily from academia and world-class research institutions in government and industry.  This leverages the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) $2 billion plus annual investment in basic research by ensuring a motivation within the scientific community to conduct research benefiting WMD-related defense missions and by improving Agency knowledge of other research efforts of potential benefit to DTRA nonproliferation, counter proliferation, and consequence management efforts.  \n\nThese efforts are closely coordinated with the Chem-Bio Technology portfolio, which executes a basic research program under the joint Chem-Bio Defense Program.  Agency research interests are coordinated with those of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Service basic research programs through the Defense Basic Research Advisory Group.  DTRA reviews research interests annually to focus on technology areas not clearly addressed by other basic research efforts.\n\nThe DTRA\u2019s Basic Research portfolio supports several National and Department initiatives directly related to countering WMD including: Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Nuclear Defense Research and Development Roadmap, FY2013-2017; Defense Budget Priorities and Choices for FY14 (2013); Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Science and Technology Priority Steering Council Roadmap (2012); National Military Strategy (2011); and the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review.  In general, these documents direct capability enhancements, projects and S&T that support countering WMD and reducing global nuclear dangers. Specifically they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological\/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential foes, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based or inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements.  Basic research supporting all of these needs is included in this program element under Project RU-Fundamental Research for Combating WMD. Details are provided in the R-2a exhibit."

DTRA reviews research interests annually to focus on technology areas not clearly addressed by other basic research efforts.\n\nThe DTRA\u2019s Basic Research Initiative program element Project RU (Fundamental Research for Combating WMD) supports several National and Department initiatives directly related to countering WMD including: Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Nuclear Defense Research and Development Roadmap, FY2013-2017; Defense Budget Priorities and Choices for FY14 (2013); Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Science and Technology Priority Steering Council Roadmap (2012); National Military Strategy (2011); and the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review.  In general, these documents direct capability enhancements, projects, and Science &Technology (S&T) that support countering WMD and reducing global nuclear dangers.  Specifically they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological\/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; enhancing nuclear forensics; securing vulnerable materials; developing new verification technologies; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are individuals, networks, or states; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based and inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements. Specific activities for Project RU can be described as follows: Sensing and Recognition \u2013 Generation of information that provides knowledge of the presence, identity, and\/or quantity of material or energy in the environment that may be significant; Network Sciences \u2013 Enhance fundamental knowledge of theory, representations, and mapping to improve the WMD-related robustness, resiliency, recovery of, and informational and operational utility associated with and derived from, complex disparate but interdependent networks; Protection Sciences \u2013 Advance knowledge for protection of personnel, resources, sensitive systems and infrastructure from WMD; Sciences to Defeat WMD \u2013 Phenomena that improves success of defeat actions (use of weapons) including explosives, accessing and defeating target WMDs such as bio agents and weapons modeling; Sciences to Secure WMD \u2013 Improve understanding of phenomena for verification and compliance with treaties, including test detection. Discover revolutionary control methods to monitor and secure components, materials, and weapons, as well as disrupt proliferation pathways; and Cooperative Research with Global Partners \u2013 Research to reduce the global threat of WMD in collaboration with a broad range of international partners. Finally, this project supports and administers the Cooperative Biological Engagement Program for academic engagements, which has the core goals to secure dangerous pathogens, promote open and active disease reporting and response, advance transparent research to understand pathogens, and develop potential countermeasures.\n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the relative net impact of Congressional reductions in FY 2013 and increased investment in Fundamental Research in FY 2014 to maintain zero real growth in funding per the Defense Planning Guidance for activities related to the discovery and development of fundamental knowledge for the benefit of Counter WMD-related defense missions.  The decrease from FY 2014 to FY 2015 reflects a reduced effort in combating WMD basic research resulting in reductions to the number of active basic research awards."
