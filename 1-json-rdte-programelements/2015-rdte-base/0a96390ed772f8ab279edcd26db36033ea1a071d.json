The system will automatically nominate potential hazards on the move and at standoff distance, and then let route clearance teams decide whether to perform more detailed examinations and identification of those hazards using additional tools within the FREHD suite.   FREHD will also provide threat visualization and control capabilities that enable route clearance and allow Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and related mission personnel to remotely view video feeds of the hazard and remotely control the apparatus.  The increased rate of advance will improve route clearance time, while the increased standoff improves force protection."
