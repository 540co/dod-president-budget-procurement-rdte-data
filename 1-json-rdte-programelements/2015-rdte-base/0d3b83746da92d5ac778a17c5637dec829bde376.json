Cost-effective land-based defense will be demonstrated by closing the fire control loop between existing sensors and prototype ground-launched Railgun projectiles. To facilitate this, LBRG will integrate the Railgun launcher, power, projectile, and sensor so that projectiles may be command guided during a series of flight tests. These tests will verify performance and lethality results from modeling and simulation. Testing will conclude by demonstrating projectile fly-out and control, sensor tracking of projectiles, communication from sensor to projectile, integrated guidance, navigation and control, culminating in an FY2015 live-fire, closed-loop, command-guided launch from a 20 mega-joule Railgun.\n\nThis is a new PE for FY 2014 that contains OSD land-based Railgun investments to accelerate fire control loop closure. In FY 2011 and FY 2012, ramp investments were provided from alternate RDT&E PEs to enable the following accomplishments:\n\u2022 Initiated development of high fidelity models and simulations for gun launched guided projectile engagements.\n\u2022 Anchored projectile models with wind tunnel and flight test data in collaboration with the Navy\u2019s Office of Naval Research (ONR).\n\u2022 Analyzed several effective sensor architectures using existing sensors to support gun launched guided projectile engagements.\n\u2022 Selected sensors to support FY 2014 flight tests of prototype projectile airframes.\n\u2022 Conducted several projectile airframe flight tests in the first quarter\u2014a quarter ahead of schedule\u2014in collaboration with ONR.\n\u2022 Installed tracker hardware and successfully tracked a projectile flight with tactically relevant measurement accuracies in the first quarter in collaboration with ONR and the Army\u2019s Armament Research Development and Engineering Center."
