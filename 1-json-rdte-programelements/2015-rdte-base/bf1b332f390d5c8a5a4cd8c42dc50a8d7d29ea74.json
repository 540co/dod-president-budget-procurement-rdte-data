EW is an integral warfighting effect supporting AF Global Strike, Global Persistent Attack and Global Mobility operations as well as Joint-Coalition operations.  EW systems influence, deceive, disrupt, degrade, deny, and destroy threats to air operations throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. This PE supports Electronic Support (ES), Electronic Protection (EP), and Electronic Attack (EA).  ES programs support the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information related to the detection, geo-location, characterization, and identification of threats to air operations.  EP Programs preserve the electromagnetic spectrum for use by friendly forces.  EA programs provide self-protection through active and passive measures that deceive threats to air operations using kinetic and non-kinetic means to defeat threats that rely on the electromagnetic spectrum (Radio Frequency (RF), Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR)).  \n\nThis program is in budget activity 5 - System Development and Demonstration of common EW systems to meet user requirements."
