DDTE allows robust integration of modeling and simulation T&E capabilities across Joint DCGS events without introducing vulnerabilities to operational Command and Control networks and has enabled improvements in systems engineering, instrumentation and T&E throughout all phases of the DCGS life cycle. \n\nDCGS PoRs and Coalition partners use the DDTE network, which supports the net-centric maturity assessment of the DCGS Enterprise under the DCGS Governance, to integrate architecture, standards, and capabilities for implementation of the DCGS Integration Backbone and support the migration to net-centricity, including DCGS Enterprise services for the Military Departments, DCGS-Special Operations Forces and the DCGS Intelligence Community.

At the end of each year, assessment results are consolidated into the T&E FT Enterprise Assessment Report.  The T&E FT also provides input to the DCGS Enterprise Focus Team\u2019s State of the Enterprise (SoE) Report, which includes the EMM.  A comparison of multi-year SoE Reports shows measurable DCGS Enterprise net-centric maturity progress over time. \n\nThe T&E FT also leverages Joint Interoperability Certification testing to support the evaluation of DCGS Enterprise maturity.  In FY 2013,Of the six DCGS PoR systems, three hold current Joint Staff (JS), Command, Control, Communications, & Computers\/Cyber (J6) Interoperability (IOP) Certifications and continue to conduct IOP testing on emerging releases.  The remaining three PoRs are not JS J6 certified,  the T&E FT leverages data collected while these programs perform periodic IOP assessments.  Due to increased automation for data collection and reduction, in addition to advances in PoR and Enterprise maturity, the T&E FT increases the cumulative number of net-centric capability evaluations each year and this trend is expected to continue in FY14 and FY15.  This effort provides the basis for the DCGS Enterprise Assessment, allowing the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) to measure the level of maturity of the DCGS Enterprise supported by the DCGS Governance."
