Not limited to major ports, the JHSV will be able to operate in austere port environments.   The Joint High Speed Vessel is one of three programs in the Department's \"Capital Account Pilot Program.\"\n\nThe primary objective of the T&E program is to ensure the JHSV is effective and suitable for its intended mission.  The focus will be on reducing test time and cost through an appropriate combination of DT and OT events in order to achieve compatible objectives.  \n\nDT&E efforts include modeling and simulation (M&S), design analysis, inspection, component testing, system level testing, demonstration, ship trials, and PDT&T events.  The JHSV T&E Program will coordinate DT&E and OT&E to bring the lead ship to Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in the most efficient and timely manner possible.\n\nOperational testing will include an Operational Assessment (OA), Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E).  JHSV OT&E will be conducted as Multi-service OT&E events. \n\nThe objective of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E) is to provide a timely and reasonable assessment of the survivability of the system as it progresses through its development and prior to full-rate production.  The program will utilize existing commercial and military technologies to modify commercial high-speed ferry designs for military use. LFT&E is included in OT&E."
