            "val": "The Air Force operates a variety of combat aircraft that carry numerous and varied stores (munitions, missiles, fuel tanks, targeting pods, range pods, electronic countermeasures pods, etc.). Stores are carried in countless different loading combinations determined by operational and training scenarios, missions, tactics, and weapon development programs. Aircraft stores combinations change as operational plans and tactics change and as new stores are developed and fielded. Before operational, training, or test use, the Air Force must certify these configurations for safe loading, carriage, and separation (jettison and normal release), as well as verify ballistics accuracy under the user-certified carriage and employment parameters. The Air Force SEEK EAGLE program completes certification recommendations and recommended flight clearances through any combination of engineering analysis, wind tunnel testing, modeling and simulation, and ground\/flight test and evaluation. The SEEK EAGLE effort encompasses eight disciplines: Fit and Function, Flutter, Loads, Stability and Control, Electromagnetic Compatibility\/Interference (EMC\/EMI), Separations, Ballistics, and Safe Escape.\n\nIn support of certification, the program recommends about 1000 aircraft\/store combinations for flight each year with analysis and testing, requiring from weeks to years depending on the complexity. Integrated solutions for combat aircrew weapon delivery planning problems are developed and provided to combat forces via Combat Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS) and Joint Safe Escape Analysis Solution (JSEAS).  SEEK EAGLE works in coordination with the Air Force Safety Center to provide Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) analysis and certification recommendations of ordnance systems containing electro-explosive devices. The program is also responsible for inserting new and emerging technologies into the SEEK EAGLE process as well as providing resources for the sustainment of a viable Air Force aircraft\/store certification capability.\n\nSEEK EAGLE funds are currently budgeted to support certification testing and analysis for new and inventory stores including, but not limited to: Small Diameter Bomb I & II (SDB), Laser Joint Direct Attack Munitions (LJDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Air Intercept Missile (AIM-9X), Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AIM-120D), Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD), BRU-57 (Smart Bomb Rack), BRU-61 (SDB Bomb Rack), Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD), Sniper Targeting Pod with video data link, LITENING Targeting Pod with video data link, laser guided bombs, F-22 supersonic tank, B61 (Mod 12), penetrator warhead upgrades (BLU-111\/BLU-117), practice bomb and aircraft instrumentation pod modifications.  SEEK EAGLE funds are also used to support certification of other inventory stores on Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Special Operations Command (SOCOM) aircraft, assist the F-35 JPO with subject matter expertise in the System Development and Demonstration phase (e.g., development of organic store certifications capability to support F-35 in the Production, Sustainment, and Follow-on Development phases), sustain organic F-22 store certifications capability, and to obtain non-inventory stores and store data for post-integration certification requirements.    \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or which have approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent year."

Integrated solutions for combat aircrew weapon delivery planning problems are developed and provided to combat forces via Combat Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS) and Joint Safe Escape Analysis Solution (JSEAS).  SEEK EAGLE works in coordination with the Air Force Safety Center to provide Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) analysis and certification recommendations of ordnance systems containing electro-explosive devices. The program is also responsible for inserting new and emerging technologies into the SEEK EAGLE process as well as providing resources for the sustainment of a viable Air Force aircraft\/store certification capability.\n\nSEEK EAGLE funds are currently budgeted to support certification testing and analysis for new and inventory stores including, but not limited to: Small Diameter Bomb I & II (SDB), Laser Joint Direct Attack Munitions (LJDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Air Intercept Missile (AIM-9X), Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AIM-120D), Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD), BRU-57 (Smart Bomb Rack), BRU-61 (SDB Bomb Rack), Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD), Sniper Targeting Pod with video data link, LITENING Targeting Pod with video data link, laser guided bombs, F-22 supersonic tank, B61 (Mod 12), penetrator warhead upgrades (BLU-111\/BLU-117), practice bomb and aircraft instrumentation pod modifications.  SEEK EAGLE funds are also used to support certification of other inventory stores on Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Special Operations Command (SOCOM) aircraft, assist the F-35 JPO with subject matter expertise in the System Development and Demonstration phase (e.g., development of organic store certifications capability to support F-35 in the Production, Sustainment, and Follow-on Development phases), sustain organic F-22 store certifications capability, and to obtain non-inventory stores and store data for post-integration certification requirements.    \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or which have approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent year."
