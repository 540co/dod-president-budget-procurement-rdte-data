                            "val": "This Project provides for the upgrade and modernization of fielded Information Systems including the Joint Effects Model (JEM) and the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN).  This project also provides for the Software Support Activity (SSA).\n\nEfforts included in this project are: (1) Joint Effects Model (JEM) IT Box; (2) the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) IT Box; and (3) Software Support Activity (SSA).\n\nJEM and JWARN will utilize the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual prescribed Agile Information Technology Box \"IT Box\" construct for managing requirements for the follow-on increments of capability development.  Use of the \"IT Box\" acquisition approach increases flexibility and will expedite fielding of Information System products through a series of Build Decisions (BDs) versus less frequent traditional DoD Milestone B and C decisions.  Each program will use an Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) to describe the required operational capabilities for the development effort.  JEM's IS ICD was approved by the Joint Staff J8 Joint Requirements Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JRO-CBRND) in September 2013 and JWARN's IS ICD will be reviewed for approval in 2QFY14.  After the IS ICD is approved, more detailed requirements will be captured in Requirements Definition Packages (RDP) and will be approved at the Functional Capability Board (FCB) level.  In order to support an agile incremental approach, each program will ensure that the \"IT Box\" describes the entire IT program and not just a single increment.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  These limited fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities\/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.  As software-intensive systems both JEM and JWARN have no separately identifiable unit production components.  Both are designated ACAT III programs and unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost\/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC\/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable. \n \nThe Joint Effects Model (JEM) is the DoD's only accredited model that has been operationally tested and deemed effective for predicting hazards associated with the release of contaminants into the environment.  JEM is a software-only, ACAT III program that was originally developed as an increment 1 and is continuing development using the agile \"IT Box\" process described above.  JEM is currently capable of modeling hazards in a variety of scenarios including: counterforce, passive defense, accident and\/or incidents; high altitude releases, incident source prediction to include Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) events, urban CBRN\/Toxic Industrial Hazard environments, human inhalation, contagious\/infectious disease, population movements, efficacy of medical countermeasures, industrial transport; building interiors, and human performance degradation.  Battlespace commanders and first responders must have a CBRN hazard prediction capability in order to make decisions that will minimize risks of CBRN contamination and enable them to continue mission operations.  JEM operates in an integrated fashion with operational and tactical Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and in a standalone mode.  JEM interfaces and communicates with the other programs such as JWARN, weather systems, intelligence systems, and various databases.  JEM IT Box adds capability to JEM Increment 1 including modeling of missile intercepts and improved modeling of hazard events in urban and littoral terrain.  The IT Box version of JEM also includes improved architecture called Common CBRN Modeling Interface (CCMI).  Together, CCMI and IT Box enable more rapid and less costly integration of Science and Technology updates, aligning with the S&T provider to provide the most current capability to the warfighter.\n\nJEM Increment 2, using IT Box Acquisition Strategy, adds capability to JEM Increment 1 including modeling of missile intercepts and improved modeling of hazard events in urban and littoral terrain.  It also includes improved architecture called Common CBRN Modeling Interface (CCMI).  Together, CCMI and IT Box enable more rapid and less costly integration of Science and Technology updates, aligning with the S&T provider to provide the most current capability to the warfighter.  Battlespace commanders and first responders must have a CBRN hazard prediction capability in order to make decisions that will minimize risks of CBRN contamination and enable them to continue mission operations.  JEM operates in an integrated fashion with operational and tactical Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and in a standalone mode.  JEM interfaces and communicates with the other programs such as JWARN, weather systems, intelligence systems, and various databases.\n\nThe Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) provides the Joint Forces with a comprehensive Early Warning (EW) analysis and response capability to minimize the effects of hostile Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) attacks, incidents and accidents.  It provides the operational capability to employ CBRN warning technology which will collect, analyze, identify, locate, report, and disseminate CBRN warnings.  JWARN will transition from a Command and Control (C2) platform specific implementation to a Web-based Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) meeting the DoD's evolution to a more comprehensive Common Operating Environment (COE).  JWARN Increment 2 will provide an expansion of sensors that will connect to JWARN, increased automation of message handling, improved false alarm filtering, integration of route-planning calculator, and interoperability with additional Command and Control (C2), medical information and evolving Bio-Surveillance systems.  JWARN will be located in Command and Control Centers at the appropriate level and will be employed by CBRN defense specialists and other designated personnel to improve the efficiency of limited CBRN personnel assets.  This employment will transfer data automatically from existing sensors and to and from the future sensors to provide commanders with the capability to support operational decision making in a CBRN environment.  JWARN will integrate existing sensors into a sensor network or host C2 system, but does not provide the sensors that will be employed in the operating environment.  JWARN will be compatible and integrated with Joint Services Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems and will operate as a standalone capability in the next increment of development.  Activities include: logistical elements, support equipment, manuals and training required to operate and support the system.\n\nThe Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Integrated Architectures, Data Management\/Modeling, Information Assurance (IA), Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.  The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards.  The latest technologies\/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model.  These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users.  The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information."

The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being acquired through a Request for Proposal (RFP) to Industry under full and open competition. The program plans to award multiple development contracts in a competitive prototyping phase prior to downselecting a single JEM developer and integrator.\n\nJOINT WARNING & REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)\n\nJWARN Increment 2 acquisition will utilize the JROC's \"IT Box\" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP). The JWARN Program will procure a Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) (hardware materiel solution) in order to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).\n\nSOFTWARE SUPPORT ACTIVITY (SSA)\n\nThe SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  Phase 1a identifies CBDP programs that deal with data or software, and have an IT component.  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  (BA5 - System Development and Demonstration).   Phase 2 will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.

                            "val": "This Project provides for the upgrade and modernization of fielded Medical Biological defense equipment\/systems including the Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS).  \n\nJBAIDS is a commercial off-the-shelf development\/production effort started in August 2003 that focused on rapid development and fielding efforts to deliver a critical capability to identify bacterial and viral agents in environmental surveillance and clinical specimen sample types.  By 2005, 16 biological warfare (BW) agent surveillance detection kits were fielded along with the first JBAIDS in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  JBAIDS currently has seven IVD kits cleared by the FDA, JBAIDS achieved full operational capability (340 systems delivered all Services) in July 2011.  JBAIDS efforts in 2012-2015 will focus on adding surveillance food and water pathogen detection assays.  Also, the development team will focus on completing Pre-Emergency Use Authorization (Pre-EUA's) packages annually for FDA review.  The operational development RDT&E funds will be used to oversee the configuration management of the system to include the conduct of annual software security information assurance (IA) updates on fielded software and monitor analyzer\/laptop parts obsolescence.\n\nThe NGDS is envisioned to be an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System.  The mission of the NGDS is to provide CBRN warfare threat identification and FDA-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment, CBRN situational awareness, and disease surveillance.  NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component will significantly improve diagnostic capabilities for deployable combat health support units (role 3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability.  The term \"Role\" is used to describe the stratification of the four tiers in which medical support is organized, on a progressive basis, to conduct treatment, evacuation, resupply, and functions essential to the maintenance of the health of the force.  Role 3 support is normally provided at Division or Service equivalent level and includes specialist laboratory resources.  The NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component is intended to replace the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17.  The NGDS Increment 1 Service Laboratory Component is intended to provide high throughput Biological threat identification, characterization and diagnostics to fixed site CONUS and OCONUS laboratories operated by the Army, Navy and Air Force in coordination with the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center.  NGDS Increment 2 is intended to provide advanced diagnostics for biological pathogens and toxins, diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures and to provide capability to lower echelons of care."

The program plans to conduct the annual JBAIDS Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) software compliance certification in addition to any logistics sustainment issues associated with parts obsolescence.  Additionally, the JBAIDS program office continues to partner with the US Army Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), other DoD and US Government laboratories to develop FDA Pre-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) packages for biological warfare agents (BWA's) that could be used as biological warfare threats to DoD military forces.\n\nNEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)\n\nThe Next Generation Diagnostics System (NGDS) will develop and field a family of enhanced CBRN analytical and diagnostic systems to the Joint force through an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component will develop FDA cleared Biological Warfare Agent (BWA) in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays for an existing Commercial diagnostic device with a well established FDA regulatory history and a pipeline of commercial non-BWA infectious disease diagnostic tests.  Additional DoD-unique BWA diagnostic and environmental surveillance capabilities will be added to the downselected instrument after MS C.  BA4 funds are used for NGDS Incr 1 throughout the FY12-15 Technology Development phase in accordance with the streamlined MS A to MS C acquisition strategy.  Specifically, NGDS Incr 1 BA4 funds are used to conduct competitive prototyping, early operational assessments, development of 6 BWA IVD assays (Anthrax, Ebola, Marburg, Plague, Tularemia and Q-Fever), 22 BWA surveillance assays and multiservice operational test prior to MS C.\n\nNGDS Increment 2 will use BA4 funds FY14-16 to conduct technology development prior to MS B.  The acquisition strategy and capability to be developed will be determined by the results of the Analysis of Alternatives to be completed 2QFY14.  NGDS Incr 2 is intended to be complementary to NGDS Incr 1 to expand the breath of diagnostics to CBRN threats, pre-symptomatic diagnostics and far forward echelons of care."
