The Air SS addresses capability gaps identified during combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan including the effects of weight and bulk, limited situational awareness, and lack of functionally integrated aircrew member life support equipment. The Air SS follows an evolutionary acquisition approach that integrates mature technologies to build to the full capability. Air SS reduces overall weight and bulk of aircrew equipment, increases situational awareness, and enhances aircrew mobility. This funding provides advanced development for the Air SS in technology areas supporting improved environmental cooling, integrated power, wireless personal area networks, lightweight protective clothing, and miniaturized communication devices."

The adapter will accommodate shock tube that is cut in the field. The adapter will be the primary interface between Remote Activation Munitions System (RAMS) or similar firing device receivers and current shock tube used by U.S forces. The adapter must not possess any stored energy when emplace or enabled and be a reusable device. The adapter will provides the EOD technician means of rapidly emplacing demo to neutralize Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and deliberate explosive devices reducing soldiers' time on target, and combat load.\n\nThe Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED) Blast Overpressure Tool (VBOT) will be a factory loaded explosive tool used by EOD units to defeat suspected VBIEDs while reducing likelihood of collateral damage caused by fire.  The program will modify a government-off-the-shelf design to meet current requirements and qualify that system for fielding. This Program was directed by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army via the Capability Development for Rapid Transition process as a follow on to the urgently fielded capability called the VBIED Modular Disruption System (VMODS).  VMODS was urgently fielded to replace a previous urgent fielding of MAXI-CANDLE which was no longer producible due to obsolete materials.\n\nThe Gunshot Detection System (GDS) was identified by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army for insertion into the Capabilities Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) process.  A Capabilities Production Document (CPD) was approved on 13 Feb 2009.  The Active Protection System (APS)\/Hostile Fire Detection (HFD) program intends to build off the Gunshot Detection System capabilities, and include additional vehicle threats and countermeasures.\n\nThe FY 2015 Base funding in the amount of $0.845 million will be in support of the Spark Gap (SG)-Shock Tube Initiator program and the VBOT (Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED) Blast Overpressure Tool)programs."

Small arms systems include weapons ranging up to 40 millimeter in caliber. Current and future efforts focus on improvements designed to enhance lethality, target acquisition and tracking, fire control, training effectiveness and reliability of weapons to include ammunition when developing and\/or evaluating standard and non-standard weapons. Focus areas include the maturing of technology through testing and evaluation of sub-system or system prototypes which demonstrates light weight materials, wear resistant\/protective\/anti-reflective coatings, observation\/situational awareness improvements and equipment enhancements.  Benefits include continuous improvements to small arms weapons, fire control equipment, optics, gun barrels, training devices, suppressors, component mounts, weapon mounts, and weapon\/ammunition interface."
