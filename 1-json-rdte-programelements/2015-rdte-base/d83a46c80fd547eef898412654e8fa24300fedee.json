The PE also supports the application of proven industry models, tools and methodologies to Navy MPTE problems where GOTS solutions are non-existent.  One goal of this PE is to transition 90% of successful S&T products to production and eventual use within the Navy.  An acceptable metric will be to successfully transition 80% of the products.  The second goal of the PE is to successfully implement 90% of the industry-standard tools that are attempted to be used in Navy applications."
