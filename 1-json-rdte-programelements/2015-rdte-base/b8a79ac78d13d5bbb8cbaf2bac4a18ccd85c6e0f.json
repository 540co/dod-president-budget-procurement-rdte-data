            "val": "The Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program was initiated on the basis of an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) that was approved 10 December 2009. An Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was signed 17 August 2011 and it granted the Army approval to enter a 24 month Technology Development (TD) phase. Two contracts were awarded: one contract was awarded to BAE Systems Land & Armaments, Limited Partnership (L.P.) and one was awarded to General Dynamics Land Systems Inc. Revisions to the GCV strategy were approved via an ADM that was signed on 16 January 2013. The Army's exploration of the capabilities trade-space prior to finalizing requirements led to a modified set of requirements that required additional preliminary design effort. The ADM directed the TD phase to be extended by six months (for a total of 30 months) and envisioned a MS B in late FY2014. The GCV Project Manager took steps to incorporate these decisions into the program by issuing Undefinitized Change Orders to both contractors in April, 2013. The following funding requirements\/justifications reflect these decisions.\n\nFiscal constraints and competing demands during budget uncertainty forced the Army to make hard choices between near-term readiness and modernizing current systems to meet near term capability gaps and developing the GCV.  Given fiscal constraints and where we are in current technology, the Army concludes this is not the right time to develop the GCV and will end the program following the Technology Development phase.  We have benefitted from our investment in GCV and will use the insights gained to inform technology maturation efforts in support of a strategy for the Army's future Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) modernization program.\n\nThe funding in FY2015 will support continuing advanced concept development, trade studies, technology maturation, technical \/ operational \/ affordability analyses, and perhaps limited prototyping to assess future designs that integrate emerging S&T technologies."

The GCV IPTs continued to oversee the technical development efforts of each separate contractor in order to monitor and track technical progress related to the development of the various subsystems. This included review and acceptance of all formal contract deliverables for the two contractor teams. The government management team also continued to oversee each separate contractor as they performed systems engineering, requirements analysis, functional analysis, configuration management, risk management, interface management, data management, technical reviews, trade studies, modeling and simulation, specialty engineering, software engineering, test and training.  An emphasis for the Government team in FY2013 was on supporting each contractor's Preliminary Design Review (PDR), completed 4QFY2013 for the BAE team and completed 1QFY2014 for the GDLS team. Approximately 35 contract deliverables were associated with each PDR and they were reviewed and approved by the Government team prior to the reviews. Information generated from the three-pronged strategy was used to complete an updated performance specification for inclusion in both the TD contracts and the EMD Request for Proposal (RFP), which was planned for release in 1QFY2014. The final reports for both the non developmental vehicle assessment and the Dynamic AoA Update were completed. Drafts of approximately 40 documents to support the originally planned Milestone B were completed."

                            "val": "An Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was signed 17 August 2011. It granted the Project Management Office approval to enter a 24 month Technology Development (TD) phase. Two contracts were awarded on 18 August 2011. One contract was awarded to BAE Systems Land & Armaments, L.P. and one was awarded to General Dynamics Land Systems Inc. Due to a protest, stop work orders were issued on 29 August 2011. The Government Accountability Office denied the protest on 5 December 2011, and work resumed 6 December 2011. \n \nFor the ongoing TD phase, the Army has been maturing its requirements by using key program imperatives to shape trade space and to ensure convergence on an affordable and achievable set of requirements. The TD phase contracts have allowed contractors to trade selected capability to support the path to an affordable set of requirements and to reduce program cost and risk. In addition to the effort related to the TD contracts, PM GCV has conducted assessments of selected non-developmental vehicles and supported a dynamic update to the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). This \"three pronged effort\" (TD contracts, vehicle assessments, and dynamic AoA update) generated data necessary to ensure a well informed Milestone B.\n\nRevisions to the GCV strategy were approved via an Acquisition Decision Memorandum signed on 16 January 2013.It recognized that the Army's exploration of the capabilities trade-space and full range of alternatives prior to finalizing requirements has led to a modified set of requirements that require additional preliminary design effort. It likewise acknowledged that the results of the three pronged development effort were considered in revising the GCV strategy. Decisions included in the ADM were: 1) The TD phase is to be extended by six months,  2) A full and open competition for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase will be conducted and contract award will be to a single vendor,  3)  Planned procurement of long lead items for EMD prototypes is not authorized,  4) The Milestone C decision shall be planned for FY2019, and  5) Milestone B will be conducted in late FY2014, following a pre-EMD Defense Acquisition Board first quarter FY2014 (which must occur prior to releasing the EMD Request for Proposal). The GCV Project Manager is took steps to incorporate these decisions into the program.\n\nFiscal constraints and competing demands during budget uncertainty forced the Army to make hard choices between near-term readiness and modernizing current systems to meet near term capability gaps and developing the GCV.  Given fiscal constraints and where we are in current technology, the Army concludes this is not the right time to develop the GCV and will end the program following the Technology Development phase.  We have benefitted from our investment in GCV and will use the insights gained to inform technology maturation efforts in support of a strategy for the Army's future Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) modernization program. \n \nFor the FY2015 Budget, the Army will complete the ongoing Technology Development (TD) phase and not transition into EMD. Continuing combat vehicle concept development and synchronization with planned Government S&T investments will eventually form the foundation for a future fighting vehicle program. The Project Management Office is assessing the full impact of this decision and has not yet formalized a revised acquisition strategy."
