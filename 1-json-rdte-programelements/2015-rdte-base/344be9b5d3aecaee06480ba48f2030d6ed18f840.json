MEECN includes the Emergency Action Message dissemination systems and those systems used for integrated Tactical Warning\/Attack Assessment, presidential decision-making conferencing, force report back, re-targeting, force management, and requests for permission to use nuclear weapons. Efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense, military forces, and an informed decision-making linkage between the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Combatant Commands. MEECN ensures our national leadership has proper command and control of our forces during times of national emergency, up to and including nuclear war."

Systems Analysis supports long range planning and vulnerability assessments to ensure the NC3 System is adequate under all conditions of stress or war and recommends investment strategies to evolve the Nuclear Command and Control System to achieve desired capabilities. Operational Assessments of fielded systems and weapon platforms provides the sole means for verification of NC3 systems\u2019 performance in support of plans and procedures, operation orders, training, equipment, and end-to-end system configuration. Assessments provide strategic and theater level C3 interfaces into the NC3 System. Supporting efforts assure positive control of nuclear forces and connectivity between the Secretary of Defense and strategic and theater forces. Systems Engineering provides the Senior Leadership C3 System with technical and management advice, planning and engineering support, and Test & Evaluation. Leading Edge Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence technology is assessed for all communication platforms supporting executive travelers and senior leaders to include the interoperability of hardware and operational procedures. These technology elements support the President's and other DoD command centers and aircraft (e.g., Air Force One and the National Airborne Operations Center)."

Assessment results are used by the Joint Staff to direct changes in system engineering and integration, programmatic execution, and training.  \n\nSpecific performance metrics include the following:\nProvide engineering products in all task areas that satisfy DoD\/CIO and Joint Staff needs within allocated resources 90% of the time.\n\nConduct assessments of the NC3 system and the SLC3S that provide actionable results and recommendations for the Joint Staff and DoD\/CIO to pursue improvements to these capabilities 90% of the time.\n\nDuring FY 2013 MEECN meet these two specific performance metrics by achieving a sucess rate of 100%."
