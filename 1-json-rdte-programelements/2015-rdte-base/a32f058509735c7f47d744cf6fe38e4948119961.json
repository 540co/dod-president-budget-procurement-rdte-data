Tools are uniquely suited for consideration of both civilian generics and military specific purposes.  These software tools will enable the LE\/CI community to increase the probability of data recovery that would otherwise remain undetected.  The On-Scene Triage Tool (OTT) provides special agents with the ability to obtain information immediately from a live computer at a crime scene in order to determine media relevancy to an investigation.  The TrueCrypt Detect tool  is a special purpose tool for 1st responders to rapidly search thousands of files from suspected media embedded in MP4 or MOV videos using the program TCSteg."
