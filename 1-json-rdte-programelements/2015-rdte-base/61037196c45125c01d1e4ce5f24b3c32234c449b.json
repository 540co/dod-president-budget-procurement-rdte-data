            "val": "This budget activity funds operational development necessary to acquire, sustain, and enhance segments of the Air Force Weather Weapon System (AFWWS).  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. Program Management Administration costs include Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, and Advisory and Assistance Service.  AFWWS provides timely, accurate, consistent and relevant space and terrestrial weather information for global battlespace situational awareness. AFWWS supports worldwide operations of Air Force and Army warfighters, Special Operation Forces, and other government agencies with weather observing and forecasting capabilities at home station and deployed locations as well as centralized, reach-back centers.  AFWWS activities align under four capability areas:  Weather Data Collection, Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination, Weather Forecasting, and Product Tailoring\/Warfighter Applications.  This alignment ensures an integrated and systems-oriented approach to program management decisions.\n  \nWeather Data Collection provides automated terrestrial and space environmental sensing capabilities at fixed and deployed locations worldwide. Projects include Next Generation Radar and Upper Air Observing Follow-On.  FY15 funding will enhance computations based on dual-polarization technology for improved severe weather detection and rainfall amount forecasting and will begin operationalizing new upper air sounding capability using laser technology. \n \nWeather Data Analysis and Dissemination provides a net-centric infrastructure that assimilates worldwide sources of terrestrial and space weather data and produces decision-quality information for warfighters.  Improved analysis of real-time weather information supports DoD's Warfighting and Enterprise Information Environment Mission Areas as well as DoD's role in transformation of the National Airspace System through the Next Generation Air Transportation System and, finally, enhances Air Force energy security plans. In FY15 Air Force Weather-Web Services (AFW-WEBS) moves into this capability area from Weather Forecasting to better align its function of integration of net-centric capabilities. FY15 funding will continue development of incremental software enhancements and integration of improved analysis capabilities including processing of data from new environmental sensing satellite sources for DoD Data Center 14866.\n\nWeather Forecasting provides advanced scientific numerical weather prediction capabilities for automated, high resolution forecast products for mission execution, rehearsal, and planning. Weather Forecasting includes projects for Numerical Weather Modeling, Environmental Data Cube Support System, and the Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System.  FY15 funding will continue development of software to integrate advanced terrestrial and space weather forecast capabilities to improve models for warfighter operations.  Additionally, Weather Forecasting capabilities will be expanded to integrate and exploit data from new environmental sensing satellite sources for DoD Data Center 14866. \n \nProduct Tailoring\/Warfighter Applications provides timely, local and regional target-scale weather information to operational commanders for a given Area of Responsibility, and at tactical levels provides front-line weather information to warfighters, including weather forces, in conduct of combat operations.  Supports the 'train as you fight' concept by assuring fixed and deployable systems have an equivalent operator look and feel via the Joint Environmental Toolkit.  FY15 funding will continue development of software for warfighter tailoring and exploitation products and integration of regional and tactical weather systems with warfighter Command and Control (C2) systems within DoD Data Centers 14866, 14861, 17037, and 17038.  These efforts will enhance the availability and integration of weather information in multiple Wings, Squadrons, Air and Space Operations Centers, Army decision processes, Air Traffic Control operations, and exploitation of weather at global, regional, and tactical levels.\n  \nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Improved analysis of real-time weather information supports DoD's Warfighting and Enterprise Information Environment Mission Areas as well as DoD's role in transformation of the National Airspace System through the Next Generation Air Transportation System and, finally, enhances Air Force energy security plans. In FY15 Air Force Weather-Web Services (AFW-WEBS) moves into this capability area from Weather Forecasting to better align its function of integration of net-centric capabilities. FY15 funding will continue development of incremental software enhancements and integration of improved analysis capabilities including processing of data from new environmental sensing satellite sources for DoD Data Center 14866.\n\nWeather Forecasting provides advanced scientific numerical weather prediction capabilities for automated, high resolution forecast products for mission execution, rehearsal, and planning. Weather Forecasting includes projects for Numerical Weather Modeling, Environmental Data Cube Support System, and the Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System.  FY15 funding will continue development of software to integrate advanced terrestrial and space weather forecast capabilities to improve models for warfighter operations.  Additionally, Weather Forecasting capabilities will be expanded to integrate and exploit data from new environmental sensing satellite sources for DoD Data Center 14866. \n \nProduct Tailoring\/Warfighter Applications provides timely, local and regional target-scale weather information to operational commanders for a given Area of Responsibility, and at tactical levels provides front-line weather information to warfighters, including weather forces, in conduct of combat operations.  Supports the 'train as you fight' concept by assuring fixed and deployable systems have an equivalent operator look and feel via the Joint Environmental Toolkit.  FY15 funding will continue development of software for warfighter tailoring and exploitation products and integration of regional and tactical weather systems with warfighter Command and Control (C2) systems within DoD Data Centers 14866, 14861, 17037, and 17038.  These efforts will enhance the availability and integration of weather information in multiple Wings, Squadrons, Air and Space Operations Centers, Army decision processes, Air Traffic Control operations, and exploitation of weather at global, regional, and tactical levels.\n  \nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
