            "val": "This Program Element consists of three programs:  Live Fire Test and Evaluation, Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), and Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME).  Starting in FY 2013 the JASP and JTCG\/ME programs were realigned from the Operational Test Activities and Analyses program element (0605814OTE) to the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program element (0605131OTE).  The JASP focuses on survivability improvements supporting aircraft acquisition and JTCG\/ME focuses on the lethality of currently fielded weapons systems; therefore, the two programs are more appropriately budgeted within the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program element.\n\nThis Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E).  The primary objective of LFT&E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.\n\nThis Program Element also supports DoD\u2019s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&E related initiatives.  JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.\n\nThe Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD\u2019s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.

Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.

The oversight list is developed and published annually.\n\nJLF Programs and LFT&E Initiatives  \n\nConducted tests of fielded systems not previously tested under Air, Land, or Sea Joint Live Fire programs to support DOT&E and operator needs.  The need for these tests results from systems being exposed to new threats, used in new unanticipated tactics, or being operated in new combat environments, and the subsequent need for an assessment of their performance.  Continued efforts in support of Personnel Protection Equipment, including testing protocols for combat helmets and body armor.  Addressed urgent requests from theater that directly supported deployed Joint Combat Assessment Team investigation and report to operators. \n\nPerformed JLF projects to provide survivability data on currently fielded U.S. systems.  JLF Air projects tested the vulnerability of PT6 turboprop engines and evaluated the effects of internal configuration on helicopter crew compartment fires, as well as technologies\/techniques to reduce generic vulnerabilities to all aircraft, such as to MANPADS, small arms, and the performance of self-sealing fuel tanks using bio-fuels.  New projects investigated the effect of yawed projectiles and missile debris on aircraft vulnerability, the lethality of advanced projectile lethality, and a performed a comparison of commonly used test threats.  JLF Land projects continued to investigate the vulnerability of vehicles to underbody blast and the lethality of U.S. weapons against typical in-theater targets, and improved modeling and simulation tools by providing validation data.  New projects studied the use and validity of manikins, helmets, and improvements to material characteristics used in modeling and simulation.  JLF Sea projects continued to investigate ship vulnerabilities in the areas of commercial standards, equipment and component damage, and investigated vulnerabilities of designs and components for new ships.  New projects evaluated fire damage to ship components, including bulkheads, insulation, and reconfigurable spaces, investigated asymmetric boat threats, and began work on developing small boat vulnerability models.\n\nJoint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP) \n\nIn FY 2013 the JASP continued work on 33 multi-year RDT&E projects and initiated 19 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD\/DOT&E.  In the area of susceptibility reduction, the JASP addressed improving the effectiveness and reducing the space, weight and power required for directed energy infrared countermeasures, electronic countermeasures technology and techniques, integrated aircraft survivability equipment, and aircrew situational awareness.  In the area of vulnerability reduction, the JASP continued to address requirements for lighter and more effective vulnerability reduction technology (e.g., armor, fuel containment, fire suppression, and aircrew and passenger protection).  In aircraft survivability Modeling and Simulation (M&S), the JASP continued to improve survivability M&S credibility, address operator requirements for survivability data, integrate DIA threat missile models into threat engagement codes, improve the assessment of aircrew and passenger injuries, and address M&S requirements identified by the joint aircraft survivability community.  The JASP completed 38 reports documenting efforts accomplished in FY 2013.\n\nThe JCAT continued to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities.  The JASP continued supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors.\n\nJoint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME)\n\nJTCG\/ME Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual Weaponeering System (JWS) v2.1.1 software and JTCG\/ME generated Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3160.01 Collateral Effects Radii (CER) tables were used for operational weaponeering and collateral damage estimation calls in direct support of operations in the AFRICOM and CENTCOM Areas of Responsibilities.  To provide continued support to operational commanders, DoD targeteers, weaponeers, and planners, the JTCG\/ME developed various analytical and operational methodologies and target geometric models.  Additionally JTCG\/ME\u2019s air-to-air and surface-to-air planning model, the Joint-Anti-air Combat Effectiveness System (J-ACE) v5.2 was released in September 2013 to provide aircraft survivability data.\n\nThe fielded JWS v2.1.1 contains the Fast Integrated Structural Tool (FIST).  FIST is the JMEM operational-level methodology that incorporates the integral modules from the Building Analysis Module (BAM) and Hardened Target Module (HTM) to create a merged tool that generates weapon effectiveness and damage assessments against infrastructure targets to include buildings, bunkers, and tunnels.   JWS v2.1.1 also contains approximately 180 new\/updated targets, 15 new\/updated munitions, new Explosive Equivalent Weights based on blast testing, and an improved 3-D viewer.  In addition, JWS v2.2 development is on-going to support coalition partners.  The JTCG\/ME in conjunction with the JWS Configuration Control Board and the JMEM Production Contractor (JPC) are implementing a re-marking effort in order to facilitate the documentary release of JWS.\n\nJ-ACE v5.2 simulates air-to-air and surface-to-air engagements.  Blue, Red, and Gray air-to-air missile (AAM) models; and, Red and Gray surface-to-air missile (SAM) flyout models are included.  J-ACE v5.2 provides updated Joint Anti-Air Model (JAAM) missile fly out model including hundreds of weapon target pairings and JAAM-Enhanced Surface-to-Air Missile Simulation (ESAMS) countermeasures interface.  J-ACE v5.2 also provides the new \u201cEndgame Manager (EM)\u201d software and data sets.  The EM is a new application which adds missile lethality and target vulnerability.  EM allows explicit evaluation of weapon miss distance, fuse performance, weapon lethality and target vulnerability.  EM provides the Probability of kill given an intercept (Pk\/i).  \n    \nTo more effectively support operational mission planning, particularly at USSTRATCOM, the J-ACE v5.2 release also provides a direct interface to force level simulations.  The fidelity is adequate for studying tactics, training evaluation, relative missile performance and scenario planning. \n\nIn support of the Combatant Commands and the CJCSI 3160.01, JTCG\/ME provided updates for CER values for newly fielded\/updated systems (e.g., M1130 Projectile, AGM-65-E2\/L and AGM-176-3\/2M).  In addition, the JTCG\/ME supported the Digital Precision Strike Suite (DPSS) Collateral Damage Estimation (DCiDE) tool for operational use.  This tool displays accredited Collateral Damage Estimate Level 1-5 A-C series effective radii reference tables.  Additionally, JTCG\/ME trained nearly 250 users at 10 different Commands to support Collateral Damage Estimation decisions.\n\nThe JTCG\/ME assessed fielded and emerging Information Operations (IO) systems as part of early efforts to create an Effects Based Operations (EBO) evaluation capability set.  The scope includes weapon characterization, coordinating test and target data development and providing operational tools for the IO elements of Computer Network Attack, Computer Network Defense, Military Information Support Operations (MISO) and Electronic Warfare.  This weapon effectiveness and associated confidence level data are critical enablers for application of these weapons as it will provide senior leaders and warfighters with information to develop policy and concepts of operations for their use."

The JASP will initiate, continue and complete other projects as approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD\/DOT&E.\n\nJoint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME)\n\nIn support of operational commanders, DoD targeteers, weaponeers, and planners, the JTCG\/ME will release JMEM Weaponeering System (JWS) v2.2 and the Joint-Anti-air Combat Effectiveness System (J-ACE) Air Superiority (AS) v5.3 in FY 2014.  \n\nJWS v2.2 will add approximately two hundred calculated and surrogated targets; approximately thirteen Air-to-Surface Weapons and Warhead; three Surface-to-Surface Direct Fire Weapons; and ten Surface-to-Surface Indirect Fire Platforms, Weapons and Warheads; Fast Integrated Structural Tool (FIST) v1.1; Ship Weaponeering Estimation Tool (SWET) v2.0.1; Digital Precision Strike Suite (DPSS) Collateral Damage Estimation (DCiDE) Tool Version 1.1 linkage; and an enhanced viewer.  Based on the current guidance and direction from Joint Staff, this JWS version will be released to several key coalition partners in support of current operations at International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), Combined Air Operations Centers and Other Joint Commands.\n\nJ-ACE v5.3 will provide extended and updated data sets for missile and aircraft target aero-performance, anti-air missile lethality and air target vulnerability.  In particular, a total of 15 new or updated Air-to-Air (AA) or Surface-to-Air (SA) Government furnished missile or weapon fly out models will be integrated.  Additionally, advanced pseudo six DoF BlueMax6 and Hercules aircraft aero performance models will be provided.  BlueMax6 and Hercules provide a large library of BLUE and RED aircraft models developed by the acquisition and intelligence communities.  Electronic Counter-Measure (ECM) will be developed and tested for an aircraft\u2019s ECM system jamming coverage.  Initially, dynamic visualization of an aircraft\u2019s ECM systems zones of coverage will allow pilots, while developing threat engagement or evasive maneuvers, to consider ECM protection with respect to the threat position.  \n\nIn support of Combatant Commands and the CJCSI 3160.01, JTCG\/ME will accredit the Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) Collateral Effects Radii (CER) xml file for use in Digital Precision Strike Suite CDE (DCiDE) Operational Tool. In accordance with the Office of Secretary of Defense Chief Information Officer Memorandum, JTCG\/ME will also prepare a memorandum that grants an Authorization to Operate (ATO) and Authorization to Connect (ATC) for the DCiDE Tool Version 1.1.  JTCG\/ME will continue to monitor the DCiDE tool configuration management process to ensure that subsequent versions of DCiDE accurately reflect the latest JTCG\/ME accredited tables; Combatant Command specified population density factors and associated user input.  The DCiDE tool will evolve to be the foundation for collateral damage estimation on JWS.\n\nJTCG\/ME will develop JMEM data for most critical Combatant Commander identified systems and also reduce DVD-ROM update cycles through incremental updates.  Accreditation of tri-Service JMEM operational tools will continue as well as expanding existing databases to incorporate newly fielded weapons (i.e., Air-to-Surface, Surface-to-Surface Direct\/Indirect Fire, and Anti-air).  Finally providing connectivity to real time planning systems assessing time sensitive targets will be addressed."
