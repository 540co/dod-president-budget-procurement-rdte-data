            "val": "The Department of Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) is a DoD-wide Field Activity chartered to support the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD (P&R)).  This PE includes application of R&D to expedite prototype development and mission support efforts to sustain and\/or modernize operations required for general RDT&E.\n\nProject 1:  DoD Enlistment Processing and Testing. The project administers testing programs, which enable the Armed Services to select highly qualified military recruits. The DoD uses a single test, the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), to determine eligibility of military applicants and to report recruit quality data to Congress. High quality recruits are obtained from administering the ASVAB annually to approximately 600,000 applicants for Military Service as part of the DoD Enlistment Testing program, and to 1 million students in the DoD Student Testing program. Each Service also uses ASVAB test forms developed in this program as part of their in-service testing programs. New ASVAB test forms and related support materials are implemented approximately every four years. This allows DoD to make measurement improvements as well as decrease the likelihood of test compromise. Ongoing RDT&E efforts include development and evaluation of procedures which (1) reduce or eliminate threats to the validity of the ASVAB test scores generated; (2) improve the efficiency of the test development, calibration, and validation process; and (3) improve selection and classification decisions made by each Service through more effective use of test score information. In addition, periodic assessments are required to provide DoD manpower planners and Congress with information on aptitude trends in the population from which recruits are drawn.\n\nProject 2:   Federal Voting Assistance Program.  Phase I of Internet Voting Competition Challenge:  In the first phase submissions will focus on defining security, reliability, usability, and accountability requirements for internet voting systems. Submissions will be open to the public, and will be open to public critique. FVAP will review those submissions and critiques, and then consolidate them into a single set of requirements for Phase II. \n\no  Phase II of Internet Voting Competition Challenge:  In this phase, submission will provide high level designs and detailed hardware and software architectures, along with procedures necessary for secure operation. Submissions will be sufficiently detailed so that a reasonably skilled information technologist could implement the system to allow for broader peer review.  However, many details such as user interfaces and database layouts will be likely be undefined. As with the first phase, submissions will be open for critique. In this phase critiques will focus on identifying areas where designs do not meet the requirements defined in the first phase. The result may be modification of architectures to incorporate ideas from several teams. At the conclusion of this phase, the Department will narrow down the set of acceptable architectures. \n\no  RDT&E funding for the internet voting program is discontinued in FY 2014 until the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have established the measurements and standards against which internet voting can be evaluated.  \n\nProject 3:The Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service (DCPAS), a DHRA component, manages and operates a number of major DoD programs, including the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS). DCPDS is the Department's enterprise civilian human resources information system. It ensures a coherent, standardized, and cost-effective system for the entire Department. DCPDS is built using a commercial off-the-shelf product customized for Federal and Defense requirements. The system is web-enabled and provides flexibility to respond to changes in the Department's civilian human resources (HR) operational requirements.\n\nDCPDS supports HR operations and improved business processes with continuous implementation of improved technology, meeting cost, schedule, and performance goals.  Network and system operations span worldwide, with 24\/7 operations that support 19 Regional Service Centers and over 300 Customer Support Units.  DCPDS will complete its upgrade to the Hewlett Packard Blade architecture for all database servers in 2014. Economic analyses have validated the original estimate of approximately $200M annual savings. The current focus of DCPDS is the expansion of these efficiencies through the consolidation of DCPDS operations to a single data center, where DCPDS enterprise operations and all DoD customer regional operations will be located at the Lockheed Martin Denver Data Center by October 2014.  (Army and Air Force will relocate in FY14 to complete DCPDS Consolidation.)\n\nOther DCPAS programs supporting the civilian workforce include minimizing involuntary separations, assisting laid-off workers, maintaining workforce balance, and reducing the costs of DoD's workers and  unemployment compensation. DHRA\/DCPAS supports the development, issuance and maintenance of uniform DoD-wide civilian personnel policy; provides program guidance and technical interpretation for both appropriated and non-appropriated funded civilian HR programs ; manages DoD's Civilian Assistance and Re-Employment (CARE) program, including the Priority Placement Program (PPP); investigates and mediates discrimination complaints; conducts grievance investigations; and manages the operation of the enterprise civilian HR information system, DCPDS. These programs are supported by an aggressive data automation program, to include a communications capability, computing equipment, and an automation software link to standardize these divergent functions. These funds continue to support these processes.\n\nProject 4: :  Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) acts as the authoritative source for identity and personnel information for the DoD Net Centric Enterprise Computing vision of the Department of Defense\u2019s Global Information Grid (GIG 2.0). Based on the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) identities, DMDC provides the key attribute service for the Department of Defense (DoD) Identity and Access Management (IdAM) Capability. The Enterprise Identity Attribute Service (EIAS) supports IdAM through the distribution of DoD person and personnel attributes to applications and services in a controlled, consistent, and secure manner to support ABAC decisions. The controlled, authoritative information provided via EIAS can be used to confirm an individual\u2019s identity, affiliation to the DoD, clearance, pay grade\/rank, organization and occupation series for an authorization decision. A key attribute for decision makers is organization. The Global Force Management Data Initiative (GFM_DI) provides the  organization unique identifiers (OUID) in the EIAS payload. To meet the DoD demand for the OUID, DMDC working with J8 and the Service\/Agencies has to 1) establish the linkage between a person (EDI_PI) and the OUID, 2) provide the OUID attribute in the EIAS payload for access decisions, and 3) standardize the organizational attributes required to make access decisions\n\nProject 5: The Neo Tracking System (NTS) \/ Emergency Tracking Accountability System (ETAS) is a certified and accredited DoD automated system that accounts for, and sustains visibility of noncombatant evacuees during a NEO under the authority of DODD 1000.25, DoD Personnel Identity Protection (PIP) Program. NTS is currently being used in the USAFRICOM, USCENTCOM, USEUCOM, USSOUTHCOM, and USPACOM Area of Responsibility. The ETAS component is the CONUS domestic version of NTS and is for use by USNORTHCOM during disasters in the CONUS whether natural, accidental, or acts of terrorism. The primary purpose of the NTS\/ETAS is to provide individual accountability of the evacuee by creating and maintaining a database of evacuees assembled during an evacuation operation and subsequently tracking the evacuees' movement throughout the evacuation process.\n\nProject 6: The Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker Enterprise Suite (SPOT-ES) is the Department of Defense (DoD) system of record for accountability and visibility of contracts and contractor personnel authorized to operate in a contingency operation.  SPOT-ES provides web based tracking and visibility into contract services, personnel and equipment locations; provides a common operational picture for Combatant Commanders; enhances the analytical tools to accurately plan for the quantity of contracted support required for future contingency operations; and collects accurate data for the Office of Management and Budget-directed quarterly census of all contractors supporting contingency operations."

For example, in August 2011, during a working group meeting with computer technology scientists and representatives of EAC and NIST, the idea of conducting iterative public competitions of internet voting systems, akin to a weapon system \u201cfly-off,\u201d was adopted, and which provides the Department potential significant cost and time savings in deploying an internet voting system.  But its discovery near the end of FY2011 also makes it very difficult to fit such program development into the rigid requirements of the budget cycle and the even more rigid requirements of State election cycles.\n\nCongressional mandates also charge the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) (and through the Technical Guideline Development Committee, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)), with developing guidelines for the Department on such electronic absentee voting systems.  FVAP, EAC and NIST are jointly developing these guidelines, supported by full public engagement with the computer science, military and overseas voting advocacy, and voting system development communities.  This public outreach is crucial to designing electronic absentee voting systems which will be accepted as providing the same level of ballot access, security, privacy, and accountability as the current absentee voting systems provided military and overseas voters.  \n\nOriginal FY 2013 FVAP budget estimates assumed a 2012 or 2014 deployment of the electronic absentee voting system demonstration project.  However, system and guideline development does not support demonstration project deployment prior to 2016 or 2018."

However, current plans are to initiate the first two phases of the internet voting demonstration competition challenge:\n\no  Phase I of Internet Voting Competition Challenge:  In the first phase submissions will focus on defining security, reliability, usability, and accountability requirements for internet voting systems. Submissions will be open to the public, and will be open to public critique. FVAP will review those submissions and critiques, and then consolidate them into a single set of requirements for Phase II. \n\no  Phase II of Internet Voting Competition Challenge:  In this phase, submission will provide high level designs and detailed hardware and software architectures, along with procedures necessary for secure operation. Submissions will be sufficiently detailed so that a reasonably skilled information technologist could implement the system to allow for broader peer review.  However, many details such as user interfaces and database layouts will be likely be undefined. As with the first phase, submissions will be open for critique. In this phase critiques will focus on identifying areas where designs do not meet the requirements defined in the first phase. The result may be modification of architectures to incorporate ideas from several teams. At the conclusion of this phase, the Department will narrow down the set of acceptable architectures. \n\no  Conformance Testing to EAC Pilot Program Requirements for Kiosk Systems Used in a 2014 Election: To support the testing of internet voting systems from monitored kiosk test platform (where the ballots of record are printed out and delivered to jurisdictions like other absentee ballots, but the same ballot is delivered electronically to the election jurisdiction for comparison to the paper ballot of record), the Department will test conformance of selected systems to the EAC Pilot Program Testing Requirements.  \n\nFY 2014 plans, as stated above, plans for RDT&E funding beyond FY 2013 depend on the NIST and EAC establishing the measurements for standards against which internet voting can be evaluated."

The Enterprise Identity Attribute Service (EIAS) supports IdAM through the distribution of DoD person and personnel attributes to applications and services in a controlled, consistent, and secure manner to support ABAC decisions. The controlled, authoritative information provided via EIAS can be used to confirm an individual\u2019s identity, affiliation to the DoD, clearance, pay grade\/rank, organization and occupation series for an authorization decision. A key attribute for decision makers is organization. The Global Force Management Data Initiative (GFM_DI) provides the unique organization identifier (OUID) in the EIAS payload. To meet the DoD demand for the OUID, DMDC working with J8 and the Service\/Agencies has to 1) establish the linkage between a person (EDI_PI) and the OUID, 2) provide the OUID attribute in the EIAS payload for access decisions, and 3) standardize the organizational attributes required to make access decisions."
