This project also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to respond to emergent requirements.  These submersibles, systems, and equipment are used by Special Operations Forces (SOF) in the conduct of infiltration\/extraction, hydrographic\/inland reconnaissance, beach obstacle clearance, underwater ship attack, and other missions.  The capabilities of the submersible systems and unique equipment provides small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct clandestine operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  Sub-projects include:   \n\n\u2022   Combat Submersibles:  Includes incorporating obsolescence solutions and conducting product improvement efforts for the in-service SEAL Delivery Vehicle MK 8 and conducting technology development and engineering and manufacturing development for the follow-on combat submersibles such as the various types of shallow water combat submersibles.  The Shallow Water Combat Submersibles (SWCS) use an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop a family of submersibles, to include a new wet submersible capable of operating from existing Dry Deck Shelters (DDS), and more capable wet and\/or dry submersibles that will operate from future large submarine shelters\/systems and\/or surface ships.  The combat submersible sub-project leverages existing SEAL Delivery Vehicle components, develops new state-of-the-art components where appropriate, and leases or purchases commercial components and vehicles for test and evaluation and operational assessment.  \n\n\u2022   SWCS (Block 1):  This project provides for the engineering, manufacturing, and development of one Engineering Development Model (EDM) to replace the SEAL Delivery System, (SDV).  The EDM is being developed due to obsolescence of the SDV system.  This project will utilize mature technologies, which include electric propulsion along with upgraded navigation, communication, and sensor suites.  It also provides for integration efforts with the current DDS and other diving technologies to meet SOF requirements.  \n\n\u2022   Dry Combat Submersible (DCS):  This project provides for the advanced engineering, manufacturing, and qualification efforts for a SOF DCS System.  Current efforts are using commercial dry submersible technology to assess submersible capabilities and reduce risk in a future DCS program.  The DCS is planned to operate from surface ships and potentially a future large submarine shelter.  User Operational Evaluations of two commercially built dry submersible prototypes are being manufactured and tested, as well as evaluation of a third leased vehicle.  Significant risk reduction initiatives were added in FY 2013 which will allow for validation of test processes and commercial classification processes, as well as test and integration concepts for improved power and energy sources and emergent technologies.  Technologies include, but are not limited to Safe Li-Ion batteries, Silver Zinc batteries, Improved Sonar Systems, advanced battery management system, and a three-dimensional Electro Optical Infrared (EO\/IR) Periscope. \n\n\u2022   Dry Deck Shelter (DDS):  This project provides for an analysis of alternatives for Undersea Clandestine Insertion (UCI) of SOF forces for next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements, testing, and integration of specialized underwater systems to meet the unique requirements of SOF, and compatibility with the submarine fleet.  The current DDS is a certified diving system which attaches to modified host submarines that provides for insertion of SOF forces and platforms.  Future needs may include conducting product improvement efforts for the current DDS, as well as associated diver equipment for in-service submarine support systems, unmanned underwater vehicles, and diver equipment and follow on development effort for next generation system."

This project also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to quickly respond to new requirements for surface craft and equipment. The craft capabilities and unique equipment provide small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct clandestine operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  Sub-projects include: \n\nThe Combatant Craft Medium (CCM) replaces the current rigid inflatable boat (RIB) and the MKV (Retired in FY12). This craft will be a reconfigurable, multi-mission surface tactical mobility craft with a primary mission of insertion and extraction of SOF in a medium threat environment.  It will incorporate additional performance capabilities above current platform capabilities such as shock mitigation, low observability, improved maneuverability and SOF warfighting capabilities required to operate in future threat environments.  \n\nThe Combatant Craft Heavy (CCH) sub-project represents a family of solutions that will provide engineering support for design and specification of a development combatant craft for movement and maneuver of SOF personnel.  Requirements include maneuverability, reduced detectability with enhanced shock mitigation, and human systems integration. The current solution for Combatant Craft Heavy is the Sea, Air, and Land Insertion, Observation and Neutralization (SEALION) that was developed as an advanced technology demonstrator by the United States Navy and has been modified and tested for transition to SOF operations. The CCH will provide medium range insertion capability for SOF personnel in a low to high threat environment. Additional studies may be performed to support analysis of SOF-peculiar needs for an Afloat Forward Staging Base to command, control, sustain, launch and recover Joint SOF.\n\nThe Next Generation Combat Craft Forward Looking Infrared Radar (CCFLIR) Program provides SOF with day\/night, high resolution, and additional spectrum imaging capabilities to augment existing optical and radar sensors.  Technology insertion is needed to enhance the detection, recognition, identification, and tracking of small and near surface targets and ships.\n\nThe Next Generation Surface Systems (NGSRF) sub-project provides a rapid response capability to support SOF Combatant Craft Systems and subsystems.  The NGSRF will explore solutions to support emerging requirements in support of SOF exercises and training for future missions.  It provides technology refresh efforts to correct system deficiencies, improve asset life, and enhance mission capability through the means of feasibility studies, analyses of alternatives, pre-developmental risk reduction, and engineering analyses.  Demonstrations and modifications may be made to support emerging capability enhancements such as but not limited to, Maritime Craft Air Deliverable System BLOCK II, weapons mounts, sensors, enhanced communications and navigation subsystems, and other minor modifications to craft in support of future missions.  Solutions may be Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions, other agency solutions or new solutions."

Phase II will select a single vendor to provide a fully integrated baseline craft system for test and evaluation with options for production, engineering support and contractor logistic support.  Acquisition strategies for other craft may be based on the rapid acquisition of available non-developmental COTS\/Government-Off-The-Shelf craft.   \n\nCCH acquisition strategy is to transition the two advanced technology craft from Navy to SOF operations. SOF modifications are being performed and operational testing will be completed before fielding the SEALION craft in FY 2014. These efforts will be performed in-house with some support from other government agencies for engineering experts. Feasibility studies will continue in-house with support from other government agencies or existing contract services to pursue SOF-peculiar requirements for other CCH variants. \n\nSole source contract was awarded with original equipment manufacturer for developmental modification to SEALION. Developing long term sustainment strategy to and procure additional craft in future years. \n\nNext Generation CCFLIR acquisition strategy will conduct full and open competition for next generation systems to support the Combatant Craft Assault, CCM and CCH systems. \n\nNGSRF will provide for efforts of technology insertion and upgrades of craft systems, subsystems, and future craft acquisition planning.  This effort will consider all acquisition strategies available while applying Better Buying Power practices."
