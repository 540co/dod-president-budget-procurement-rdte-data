            "val": "Historically, the Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) Program has worked primarily with the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) and Services to identify DoD priorities and accelerated the development and demonstration of technical solutions.  However, with the end of current conflicts there has been a strategic shift to a more balanced approach that will continue to address COCOM needs in conjunction with initiating broader, longer-term JCTDs to address DoD\u2019s strategic initiatives to mitigate emergent threats, address affordability and interoperability of defense systems.  The JCTD Program will begin to employ developmental and operational prototypes to address these longer-term DoD priorities.\n\nThe shift in the JCTD Program will also result in a shift in Program metrics.  JCTDs supporting the DoD\u2019s strategic initiatives will tend to be longer and larger, with less focus on transition and partner funding.  Overall, we envision initiating fewer yet more impactful JCTD projects. \n\nIn FY 2015, Disruptive Demonstrations (Project P264) funding will be transferred from Program Element (PE) 0603648D8Z (Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD)) to PE 0603289D8Z (Advanced Innovative Analysis & Concepts)."

        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "The JCTD Program directly addresses DoD, multi-Service and COCOMs\u2019 priorities through partnering and cost sharing with solution providers and resource sponsors.  The value and impact of the JCTD Program is to cost-effectively address the COCOMs\u2019 priorities and the Department\u2019s strategic initiatives to mitigate emergent threats, address affordability and interoperability of defense systems through developmental and operational prototyping.  JCTDs provide key partnerships with the Department, Services, and other government agencies, select allies, and industry that allow for expedited development, deployment, and evaluation of capability solutions with the potential to close validated warfighting capability gaps.  The JCTD Program typically demonstrates solutions in two - four years and has a transition rate to the warfighter greater than 80 percent.  At least 57 JCTD projects supported Operation Enduring Freedom, 74 projects supported Operation Iraqi Freedom, and over 30 percent of JCTD projects involved partner nations.  These JCTD partnerships also enable interdepartmental cooperation and joint capability development (e.g. Departments of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Justice).  In FY 2013, the JCTD Program successfully demonstrated and transitioned several key warfighter capabilities that address operational warfighting needs of the Department, providing affordable and sustainable solutions.\n\nKey values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:\n\u2022 The JCTD Program has a long history of providing enduring capabilities.  See \u201cSection D.  Acquisition Strategy\u201d for more details on transition.\n\u2022 The JCTD Program delivers capabilities rapidly and projects execute far quicker than the traditional DoD Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process.  The result is that 74 JCTD projects delivered capabilities used in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and 57 projects delivered capabilities to Operation Enduring Freedom.  Most of those capabilities would not have been delivered \u2013 or would have been significantly delayed \u2013 if not for the JCTD program.  Recent examples include: \n1. A robust \u201cdetect and track\u201d capability of \"dark\" (i.e. non-emitting) maritime targets.  This is accomplished through automated data fusion of an existing suite of sensors supporting the Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) function.  This capability was successfully transitioned into the Sealink Advanced Analysis system at Office of Naval Intelligence and is now used by multiple agencies to provide a MDA capability.\n2. An operational, internet-based, open-access, Arctic-focused, environmental research and decision-support system that enables local, regional, and international cooperation and coordination on long-term environmental planning and near-term actions in response to climatic and environmental changes occurring in the Arctic Region.\n3. A vastly improved capability for U.S., NATO, and Coalition naval forces boarding operations, data collection, and sharing of time-critical boarding and biometrics information during an international operational assessment in April 2013.\n\u2022 The JCTD Program enables coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources; approximately one-third of JCTD projects involve some degree of coalition partner participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations, the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the Republic of Korea. \n\u2022 The JCTD Program enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects, such as projects with the Department of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  \n\u2022 The JCTD Program enables rapid response to new DoD priorities before Service PPBE cycles can respond.  For example, the DoD has established priorities for Anti-Access\/Area-Denial, Building Partner Capacity, understanding human terrain, and nuclear forensics.  The JCTD Program quickly responded to the new priorities and is providing initial capabilities that are transitioning to the warfighter today.\n\nMEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  \n\u2022 Capabilities delivered and technologies transitioned have been key metrics:\n1. JCTDs typically transition capability within 24 - 36 months with initial spiral products and deliverables in less than 24 months. \n 2. The JCTD program has been achieving transition rates of over 80 percent, well in excess of the DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D, Performance Measure 3.5.1-2D, goal of 40 percent.  The JCTD Program defines transition as all, or components of the demonstrated JCTD, going to a new or existing Program(s) of Record, providing fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater, or commodity-type capabilities entered onto GSA schedule for procurement by DoD users.  In FY 2013, 12 of 12 completed JCTDs successfully transitioned."

Overall, we envision initiating fewer yet more impactful JCTD projects. \n\nIn FY 2015, funds will be transferred from the JCTD Program Element (PE) to establish a new PE 0603289D8Z (Advanced Innovative Analysis & Concepts)."

                            "val": "The JCTD Program directly addresses DoD, multi-Service and COCOMs\u2019 priorities through partnering and cost sharing with solution providers and resource sponsors.  The value and impact of the JCTD program is to cost-effectively address the COCOMs\u2019 priorities and the Department\u2019s strategic initiatives to mitigate emergent threats, address affordability and interoperability of defense systems through developmental and operational prototyping.  JCTDs provide key partnerships with the Department, Services, and other government agencies, select allies, and industry that allow for expedited development, deployment, and evaluation of capability solutions with the potential to close validated warfighting capability gaps.  The JCTD Program typically demonstrates solutions in two - four years and has a transition rate to the warfighter greater than 80 percent.  At least 57 JCTD projects supported Operation Enduring Freedom, 74 projects supported Operation Iraqi Freedom, and over 30 percent of JCTD projects involved partner nations.  These JCTD partnerships also enable interdepartmental cooperation and joint capability development (e.g. Departments of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Justice).  In FY 2013, the JCTD Program successfully demonstrated and transitioned several key warfighter capabilities that address operational warfighting needs of the Department, providing affordable and sustainable solutions.\n\nKey values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:\n\u2022 The JCTD Program has a long history of providing enduring capabilities.  See \u201cSection D.  Acquisition Strategy\u201d for more details on transition.\n\u2022 The JCTD Program delivers capabilities rapidly and projects execute far quicker than the traditional DoD Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process.  The result is that 74 JCTD projects delivered capabilities used in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and 57 projects delivered capabilities to Operation Enduring Freedom.  Most of those capabilities would not have been delivered \u2013 or would have been significantly delayed \u2013 if not for the JCTD program.  Recent examples include: \n1. A robust \u201cdetect and track\u201d capability of \"dark\" (i.e. non-emitting) maritime targets.  This is accomplished through automated data fusion of an existing suite of sensors supporting the Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) function.  This capability was successfully transitioned into the Sealink Advanced Analysis system at Office of Naval Intelligence and is now used by multiple agencies to provide a MDA capability.\n2. An operational, internet-based, open-access, Arctic-focused, environmental research and decision-support system that enables local, regional, and international cooperation and coordination on long-term environmental planning and near-term actions in response to climatic and environmental changes occurring in the Arctic Region.\n3. A vastly improved capability for U.S., NATO, and Coalition naval forces boarding operations, data collection, and sharing of time-critical boarding and biometrics information during an international operational assessment in April 2013.\n\u2022 The JCTD Program enables coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources; approximately one-third of JCTD projects involve some degree of coalition partner participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations, the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the Republic of Korea. \n\u2022 The JCTD Program enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects, such as projects with the Department of Homeland Security, State, Transportation, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  \n\u2022 The JCTD Program enables rapid response to new DoD priorities before Service PPBE cycles can respond.  For example, the DoD has established priorities for Anti-Access\/Area-Denial, Building Partner Capacity, understanding human terrain, and nuclear forensics.  The JCTD Program quickly responded to the new priorities and is providing initial capabilities that are transitioning to the warfighter today.\n\nMEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  \n\u2022 Capabilities delivered and technologies transitioned have been key metrics:\n1. JCTDs typically transition capability within 24 - 36 months with initial spiral products and deliverables in less than 24 months. \n2. The JCTD program has been achieving transition rates of over 80 percent, well in excess of the DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D, Performance Measure 3.5.1-2D, goal of 40 percent.  The JCTD Program defines transition as all, or components of the demonstrated JCTD, going to a new or existing Program(s) of Record, providing fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater, or commodity-type capabilities entered onto GSA schedule for procurement by DoD users.  In FY 2013, 12 of 12 completed JCTDs successfully transitioned."

Key benefits include enhanced situational awareness to understand the impact of network events on critical operations and network distributed policy collaboration and management capabilities used to communicate authoritative direction over tactical network resources.  Concept of Operations (CONOPS) is developed to ensure a Joint procedural construct is established, and proposed Joint Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (JTTPs) will be identified during initial prototype fielding at United States Pacific Command (USPACOM).

The Director, JCTD Program, maintains and provides overall programmatic oversight for the JCTD program, to include the individual JCTD projects.  The JCTD performance metrics center on how fast relevant joint and\/or transformational technologies can be demonstrated and provided to the joint warfighter.  These metrics are driven by the overall business process which includes six parts:  (1) selection focus; (2) ability to spin-off spiral technologies; (3) time necessary to complete a final demonstration; (4) adequately resourced projects with appropriate oversight; (5) capability to complete an independent assessment of the technology; and (6) the number of successful capabilities that are actually transitioned to the warfighter.  \n\nMEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  Metrics include:  all JCTDs will deliver products within 12 months to enable assessment for project continuation; 50 percent of JCTDs will provide an operationally-relevant prototype within 12 months and 75 percent will complete final demonstration within 24 months of Implementation Directive signature.  JCTDs will spiral products and deliverables during the demonstration.  At least 75 percent of JCTD projects will transition products to Programs of Record (POR), sustained residual operations, or availability for procurement from the General Services Administration Schedule.\n\nTransition Achievement:  The JCTD program has been achieving actual transition rates of over 80 percent, well in excess of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) stated goal of 40 percent.  The JCTD Program defines transition as all or components of the demonstrated JCTD going to a new or existing POR, providing fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations, or commodity-type capabilities entered onto GSA schedule for procurement by Department users.  In FY 2013, 12 of 12 completions successfully transitioned."
