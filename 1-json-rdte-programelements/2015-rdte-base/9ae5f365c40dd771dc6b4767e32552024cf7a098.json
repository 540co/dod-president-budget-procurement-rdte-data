            "val": "The Advanced Electronics Technologies program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it seeks to design and demonstrate state-of-the-art manufacturing and processing technologies for the production of various electronics and microelectronic devices, sensor systems, actuators and gear drives that have military applications and potential commercial utility.  Introduction of advanced product design capability and flexible, scalable manufacturing techniques will enable the commercial sector to rapidly and cost-effectively satisfy military requirements.\n\nThe MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Integrated Microsystems Technology project is a broad, cross-disciplinary initiative to merge computation and power generation with sensing and actuation to realize a new technology for both perceiving and controlling weapons systems and battlefield environments.  MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems to address issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements.  The project will also address thermal management, navigation and positioning technology challenges.\n\nThe goal of the Mixed Technology Integration project is to leverage advanced microelectronics manufacturing infrastructure and DARPA component technologies developed in other projects to produce mixed-technology microsystems.  These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness and security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms.  The chip assembly and packaging processes currently in use produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system.  This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'.  The ability to integrate mixed technologies onto a single substrate will increase performance and reliability, while driving down size, weight, volume and cost."

The Micro-PNT program is developing miniature high performance gyroscopes, accelerometers, and clocks, based on both solid state and atomic technologies.  Advanced micro-fabrication techniques under development will enable the fabrication of a single package containing all the necessary devices in a volume the size of a sugar cube.  The small SWaP+C of these technologies will enable ubiquitous guidance and navigation on all platforms, including guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and individual soldiers.\n\nThe successful realization of Micro-PN&T requires the development of new microfabrication processes and novel material systems for fundamentally different sensing modalities, understanding of the error sources at the micro-scale, and development of micro-scale systems for sensors based on atomic physics techniques.  Innovative 3-D microfabrication techniques under development will allow co-fabrication of dissimilar devices on a single chip, such that clocks, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and calibration stages can be integrated into a small, low power architecture. The program is developing miniature atomic clocks, based on laser-cooled neutral atoms and trapped ions as well as inertial sensors based on atomic interferometry and nuclear magnetic resonance.

Blast-related injuries have emerged as the signature wounds of recent conflicts.  To better understand the level of blast exposure received by warfighters, which is critical for developing and providing better treatment, low-cost personal sensors to record such critical signatures as blast overpressure had to be developed.  DARPA rapidly developed and fielded the Blast Gauge to better understand the combat exposures responsible for these injuries by properly capturing relevant data at the time of injury.  The gauges have been effective at capturing such events during operations in Afghanistan, achieving a number of milestones from the first recording during an IED attack to the first use of sensor data in medical evaluation of a service member with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).  Unexpectedly, gauge recordings have shown that potentially hazardous exposures may also occur in noncombat situations.  Typically these happen during training using weapon systems.  As the Blast Gauge is being deployed, military services require additional tools to begin properly using the device.  The Blast Exposure Accelerated Sensor Transfer (BEAST) program is a 1-year effort to provide additional tools for users and complete transition to military service sustainment."

These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness, security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms.  At the present time, systems are fabricated by assembling a number of mixed-technology components: microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microphotonics, microfluidics and millimeterwave\/microwave.  Each technology usually requires a different level of integration, occupies a separate silicon chip and requires off-chip wiring, and requires fastening and packaging to form a module.  The chip assembly and packaging processes produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system.  This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'.\n\nThe field of microelectronics incorporates micrometer\/nanometer scale integration and is the most highly integrated, low-cost and high-impact technology to date.  Microelectronics technology has produced the microcomputer-chip that enabled or supported the revolutions in computers, networking and communication.  This program extends the microelectronics paradigm to include the integration of heterogeneous or mixed technologies.  This new paradigm will create a new class of 'matchbook-size', highly integrated device and microsystem architectures.  Examples of component-microsystems include low-power, small-volume, lightweight, microsensors, microrobots and microcommunication systems that will improve and expand the performance of the warfighter, military platforms, munitions and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs).\n\nThe program includes the integration of mixed materials on generic substrates including glass, polymers and silicon.  The program is design and process intensive, using 'standard' processes and developing new semiconductor-like processes and technologies that support the integration of mixed-technologies at the micrometer\/nanometer scale.  The program includes the development of micrometer\/nanometer scale isolation, contacts, interconnects and 'multiple-chip-scale' packaging for electronic, mechanical, fluidic, photonic and rf\/mmwave\/microwave technologies.  For example, a mixed-technology microsystem using integrated microfluidics, MEMS, microphotonics, microelectronics and microwave components could provide a highly integrated, portable analytical instrument to monitor the battlefield environment, the physical condition of a warfighter, the identity of warfighters (friend or foe) or the combat readiness of equipment.  The ability to integrate mixed technologies onto a single substrate will drive down the size, weight, volume, and cost of weapon systems while increasing their performance and reliability."

Such a wide bandwidth, high fidelity receiver will have applications in electronic warfare and signals intelligence systems with the potential to drastically reduce the cost, size and weight of these systems.\n\nThe DISARMER program will design, fabricate, and test a hybrid photonic-electronic ADC packaged in a standard form factor.

Frequency control is the enabling technology for radar, satellite and terrestrial communications, and position-sensing and navigation technology, among many other core DoD capabilities.  To date, however, optical frequency synthesis has been limited to laboratory environments due to the large size, relative fragility, and high cost of optical comb-based synthesizers.  Recent developments on the DARPA Quantum Assisted Sensing and Readout (QuASAR) and in Ultrafast Laser Science and Engineering (PULSE) programs have demonstrated the possibility of generating self-referenced combs in microscale resonators.  Combined with technology and fabrication techniques developed in the Photonically Optimized Embedded Microprocessor (POEM) and Diverse & Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) programs, it is now possible to develop a chip-scale integrated optical frequency synthesizer.  Ubiquitous low-cost robust optical frequency synthesis is expected to create a similar disruptive capability in optical technology as microwave frequency synthesis did in the 1940s, enabling high-bandwidth coherent optical communications, coherent synthesized-aperture LiDAR, portable high-accuracy atomic clocks, high-resolution standoff gas\/toxin detection, and intrusion detection, among other applications.\n\nThe Direct On-chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) program will create a microscale, high-accuracy optical frequency synthesizer, in a compact, robust package, suitable for deployment in a wide variety of mission-critical DoD applications."

In addition, this program has provided a cost effective manufacturing technology for low volume nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) and nanophotonic devices within the DoD.  Transition will be achieved by installing maskless lithography tools into the Trusted Foundry and in commercial foundries, which will enable affordable incorporation of state-of-the-art semiconductor devices in new military systems, and allow for the cost-effective upgrade of legacy military systems."

                                        "val": "The Excalibur program developed high-power electronically-steerable optical arrays, with each array element powered by a fiber laser amplifier.  These fiber-laser arrays are sufficiently lightweight, compact, and electrically efficient to be fielded on a variety of platforms with minimal impact on the platform's original mission capabilities.  Each array element possesses an adaptive-optic capability to minimize beam divergence in the presence of atmospheric turbulence, together with wide-field-of-view beam steering for target tracking.  With each Excalibur array element powered by high power fiber laser amplifiers (at up to 3 kilowatts (kW) per amplifier), high power air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements have been enabled that were previously infeasible because of laser system size and weight.  In addition, this program developed kilowatt-class arrays of diode lasers which provided an alternate route to efficiently reaching mission-relevant power levels, and they tested the ultimate scalability of the optical phased array architecture.  Excalibur arrays are conformal to aircraft surfaces and scalable in size and power by adding additional elements to the array.  Excalibur provided the technology foundation for defense of next generation airborne platforms, including all aircraft flying at altitudes below 50,000 ft, against proliferated, deployed, and next-generation man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) and more capable air-to-air missiles converted for use as ground-to-air missiles.  Excalibur technology will enable these platforms to fly at lower altitude and conduct truly persistent, all-weather ground missions, such as reconnaissance despite low-lying cloud cover.  Further capabilities may include multichannel laser communications, target identification, tracking, designation, precision defeat with minimal collateral effects as well as other applications.\n\nThe Excalibur program also developed efficient high-power laser amplifier arrays based on coherent or spectral beam-combining.  The potential of these arrays to scale to tactical power levels (100 kilowatt class) was also investigated.  These laser amplifier arrays were designed to work in tandem with the core laser components developed under the Excalibur program in PE 0602702E, Project TT-06.  In addition a conceptual design and CONOPS development for a High Energy Laser Counter Measure (HELCM) system were developed to enable a near-term capability for low-altitude self-defense against MANPADS.  This technology will transition via industry, and will be incorporated into the Endurance program discussed earlier in this project (MT-15)."
