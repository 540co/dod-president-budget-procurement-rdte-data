            "val": "This program element (PE) maturates and demonstrates advanced medical technologies including drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, and developing medical practices and procedures to effectively protect and improve the survivability of U.S. Forces across the entire spectrum of military operations. Tri-Service coordination and cooperative efforts are focused in four principal medical areas: Combat Casualty Care, Military Operational Medicine, Militarily Relevant Infectious Diseases, and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine. \n \nPromising medical technologies are refined and validated through extensive testing, which is closely monitored by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as part of their processes for licensing new medical products. The FDA requires medical products to undergo extensive preclinical testing in animals and\/or other models to obtain preliminary effectiveness and safety information before they can be tested in human clinical trials. Clinical trials are conducted in three phases to prove the safety of a drug, vaccine, or device for the targeted disease or medical condition, starting in Phase 1 with a small number of healthy volunteers. Following Phase 1, Phase 2 clinical trials to provide expanded safety data and evaluate the effectiveness of a drug, vaccine, or medical device in a larger population of patients having the targeted disease or medical condition. Each successive phase includes larger numbers of human subjects and requires FDA cognizance prior to proceeding. Work conducted in this PE primarily focuses on late stages of technology maturation activities required to conduct Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Some high-risk technologies may require additional maturation with FDA guidance prior to initiating these clinical trials. Such things as proof of product stability and purity are necessary to meet FDA standards before entering later stages of testing and prior to transitioning into a formal acquisition program where large Phase 3 pivotal trials will be conducted for licensure. Activities in this PE may include completion of preclinical animal studies and Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies involving human subjects according to FDA and EPA requirements. Promising medical technologies that are not regulated by the FDA are modeled, prototyped, and tested in relevant environments.\n\nBlast research and research into maturing field rations in this PE are fully coordinated with the United States Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center.  This coordination enables improved body armor design and rations for Soldiers. Additionally, the activities funded in this PE are externally peer reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee. The ASBREM Committee serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses biomedical research and development community, as well as its associated enabling research areas.\n\nProject 810 maturates and demonstrates FDA-regulated medical countermeasures such as drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic systems to naturally occurring infectious diseases and wound infections of military importance, as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis.  The project also supports testing of personal protective measures such as repellents and insecticides regulated by the EPA. This project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.\n\nProject 840 validates studies on safety and effectiveness of drugs, biologics (products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and medical procedures intended to minimize immediate and long-term effects from battlefield injuries; advanced technology development and clinical studies for treatment of ocular and visual system traumatic injury; and restoration of function and appearance by regenerating skin, muscle, and bone tissue in battle-injured casualties. Additionally, this project develops and realistically tests improved occupant protection systems through medical research to characterize mechanisms of injuries sustained by occupants of ground-combat vehicles subjected to underbody blast events, determine human tolerance limits to underbody blast forces, and develop tools to predict injuries to ground-combat vehicle occupants exposed to underbody blast forces.\n\nProject FH4 maturates, validates, and supports enhanced Force Health Protection of Soldiers against threats in military operations and training. Health-monitoring tools are matured to rapidly identify deployment stressors that affect the health of Joint Forces. These databases and systems enhance the DoDs ability to monitor and protect against adverse changes in health, especially mental health effects caused by changes in brain function. Force Health Protection work is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The program is maturing the development of global health monitoring (e.g., development of neuropsychological evaluation methodologies), validating clinical signs and symptoms correlating to medical records, diagnosed diseases, and mortality rates. The key databases supporting this program are the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow for the examination of interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.\n\nProject MM3 supports the Medical and Survivability technology areas with laboratory validation studies and field demonstrations of biomedical products designed to counteract myriad environmental and physiological stressors, as well as materiel hazards encountered in training and operational environments to protect, sustain, and enhance Soldier performance. The key efforts are to demonstrate and transition technologies, as well as validate tools associated with Soldier survivability, injury assessment and prediction, assessments for post-concussive syndrome, and enhancing performance during continuous operations. The three main thrust areas are (1) Physiological Health and Environmental Protection, (2) Injury Prevention and Reduction, and (3) Psychological Health and Resilience. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services.\n\nWork funded in this project PE is fully coordinated with efforts undertaken in PE 0602787A and the Defense Health Program.     \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.   \n\nWork in this PE is performed by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD; U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Ft Detrick, MD; U.S. Army Research Institute of Environ. Med. (USARIEM), Natick, MA; U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research, Ft Sam Houston, TX; U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), Ft Rucker, AL; the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD; U.S. Army Dental Trauma Research Detachment (USADTRD), Ft.

The focus of the program is on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that can adversely impact military mobilization, deployment, and operational effectiveness. Prior to licensure of a new drug or vaccine to treat or prevent disease, the FDA requires testing in human subjects. Studies are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage (amount to be administered) in a small study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. All test results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use. This project supports the studies for safety and effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to the next phase of development for completion of expanded safety and initial studies for effectiveness in larger populations. If success is achieved for a product in this project, the effort will transition into Advanced Development. The project also supports testing of personal protective measures that can reduce disease transmission from biting insects and other vectors to include products such as repellents and insecticides, which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \n \nResearch conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas: \n(1) Drugs to Prevent\/Treat Parasitic (organism living in or on another organism) Diseases\n(2) Vaccines for Prevention of Malaria\n(3) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)\n(4) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)\n(5) Diagnostics and Disease Transmission Control \n \nResearch is conducted in compliance with FDA regulations for medical products for human use and EPA regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides).\n\nWork is managed by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and the U.S. Army Medical Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID) and coordinated with NMRC.  The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.    \n\nPromising medical countermeasures identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603807A, project 808.\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.    \n  \nWork in this project is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories; USAMRIID, Fort Detrick, MD; and the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories. Significant work is conducted under a cooperative agreement with the Henry M. Jackson Foundation, Bethesda, MD.\n\nEfforts in this project support the Soldier portfolio and the principal area of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases."

Force Health Protection work is conducted in close coordination with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The program is maturing the development of global health monitoring (e.g., development of neuropsychological evaluation methodologies) and validating clinical signs and symptoms correlating to medical records, diagnosed diseases, and mortality rates. The key databases supporting this program are the Millennium Cohort Study and the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database. These databases allow for the examination of interactions of psychological stress and other deployment and occupational stressors that affect Warfighter health behaviors.  \n\nThis project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments and includes direct participation by other Services.
