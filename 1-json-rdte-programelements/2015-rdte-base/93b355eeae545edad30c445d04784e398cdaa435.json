This entails architecture studies, system integration, testing, certification, and accreditation of COMSEC systems and equipment.  COMSEC technology ensures total signal and data security for all Army information systems to include any operational enhancement and specialized Army configurations.  The program also assesses, develops, and integrates COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure posts, camp or station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nInformation Assurance Development funding supports the technical assessment and specifications documentation of cryptographic, key management and Information Assurance (IA) technologies developed under the direction of the National Security Agency (NSA), the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Joint Services, and commercial developers to secure National Security Systems (NSS) and National Security Information (NSI).  Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to identify fundamental building blocks for Army IA solutions. \n\nThe Army Key Management System (AKMS) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program automating the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) key management, control, and distribution, thereby limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems. NSA's legacy EKMS infrastructure began its transition to the Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) in FY2012. The transition is set to be completed by the EKMS sunset date of December 2017 and will require a minimum of 528 Management Client Nodes (MGCs) to transition the existing Army COMSEC accounts from Local COMSEC Management System (LCMS) to KMI. \n\nKey Management Infrastructure (KMI) provides an integrated, operational environment that will bring essential key management personnel and functions in-band. KMI achieves an over the network key (OTNK) management solution to support emerging cryptographically modernized systems. The KMI client nodes are the Army's subset of the National Security Agency's (NSA's) KMI Program supporting DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives and supports emerging requirements transitioned from the Army Key Management System (AKMS).  The Mission Planning\/Mission Support System (MP\/MSS) Interface for KMI will create a secure and highly automated interface to enable transparent provisioning of KMI products. The interface shall facilitate transparent communications between MP\/MSS and KMI to achieve integration by bridging the gap between provisioning services and the communications net plan of the Warfighter.\n\nThe Crypto Modernization program supports the implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies into the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the National Network Enterprise in as transparent a manner as possible."

The transition is set to be completed by the EKMS sunset date of December 2017 and will require a minimum of 528 Management Client Nodes (MGCs) to transition the existing Army COMSEC accounts from Local COMSEC Management System (LCMS) to KMI. \n\nAKMS supports the Mission Planning\/Mission Support System (MP\/MSS), a critical component of the transition to the Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI). MP\/MSS creates a secure, highly automated interface enabling transparent provisioning of KMI products. MP\/MSS is developed by NSA. Each service is responsible for integration efforts specific to their infrastructure requirements. Updates to the MP\/MSS Interface Specification and additional capabilities for the base interface will be completed in FY2014. \n\nThe KOV 21 card, previously in production through NSA for use in the Simple Key Loader (SKL) and the Secure DTD 2000 System (SDS), is nearing the end of life due to unavailability of parts. Redesigning and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL devices are currently underway. The redesign of the current KOV 21 card has been dubbed the KOV 21-A and is an extension of the KOV 21 card as a technology insertion. \n\nAKMS also supports the efforts of Over the Network Keying (OTNK) and Over the Air Rekeying (OTAR) for legacy devices including the Simple Key Loader (SKL). OTNK is a requirement in the Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) CPD and KMI CI-2 CPD. OTNK will allow KMI to extend Distribution Services to Type 1 devices over the network thus simplifying key change-over and task reorganization. OTAR is the method of updating and changing encryption keys in a two-way radio system over the radio channel. The use of OTAR drastically reduces the distribution of physical keying material and the physical process of loading cryptographic devices with key tapes. OTNK and OTAR developments are expected to begin in FY2016 and continue throughout the POM. Developing this capability in the SKL will allow the ~1.5M legacy End Crypto Units (ECUs) to be recognized on the KMI network until they can be upgraded to be KMI aware."

LCMS hardware refresh began 2QFY10. AKMS supports the transition from NSA's EKMS infrastructure to the Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). \n\nThe AKMS acquisition strategy to procure Simple Key Loaders (SKLs) was updated in an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) approved by the PEO C3T Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) 3QFY02. Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) began SKL Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS) efforts in 1QFY09. Software upgrades are released annually. SKL is currently operating on version 8.0 with version 9.0 expected in late FY 2014. In FY 2013, an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) was initiated to address hardware obsolescence issues that impact operational mission. \n\nThe Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) is currently undergoing a hardware refresh to be completed in FY 2014. ACES is currently operating on version 3.3. Continued enhancements and support of AKMS next generation software tools to meet emerging Army systems' requirements are also underway."

KMI achieves an over the network keying (OTNK) solution to support emerging cryptographically modernized systems. The Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is the Army's subset of the National Security Agency's (NSA's) KMI Program supporting Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives and supports emerging requirements transitioned from the Army Key Management System (AKMS).\n\nThe Mission Planning\/Mission Support System (MP\/MSS) for KMI creates a secure and highly automated interface to enable transparent provisioning of KMI products. The interface facilitates transparent communications between MP\/MSS and KMI to achieve integration by bridging the gap between provisioning services and the communications net plan of the WarFighter. The MP\/MSS Interface Specification defines the interface between the KMI Management Client Node (MGC) and the Mission Planning System operating on the Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET). This interface definition covers the key ordering, management, and distribution transactions that were decomposed based upon an Army Mission Planning System collaborating with KMI to fulfill mission requirements in a highly automated manner. The initial developmental efforts for MP\/MSS were carried in the AKMS line through FY 2014. Continuing support relative to KMI requirements and additional capabilities for the interface are scheduled to begin in FY2015. Activities include Application Programming Interface (API) requirements that are defined in the MGC Spiral II. Major capabilities include development of mission planning data fields, access control, signature validation, Tier 3 Accounting Data Exchange, MP\/MSS registration with KMI, and product request management. These interfaces are required for integration into the Army's existing Key Management Planner, Automated Communications Engineering Software\/Joint-Automated Communications Electronics Operating Instruction Systems (ACES\/JACS). \n\nAKMI also supports efforts of OTNK and Over the Air Rekeying (OTAR) for emerging devices including  the Simple Key Loader (SKL). OTNK is the KMI interface for providing net-centric services to the customers of KMI. OTNK is expected to allow KMI to extend Distribution Services to Type 1 devices. OTAR is the method of updating or changing encryption keys in a two-way radio system over the radio channel. The use of OTAR drastically reduces the distribution of physical keying material and the physical process of loading cryptographic devices with key tapes. OTNK and OTAR developments are expected to begin in FY2016 and continue throughout the POM.\n\nThe KOV 21 card, previously in production through NSA for use in the Simple Key Loader (SKL) and the Secure DTD 2000 System (SDS), is nearing the end of life due to unavailability of parts. Redesigning and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL and NGLD devices are currently underway. The redesign of the current KOV 21 card has been dubbed the KOV 21-A and is an extension of the KOV 21 card as a technology insertion. The KOV 21-A will also address requirements codified in the NGLD CPD and the KMI CPD that were technologically unachievable with the KOV 21 card. Through insertion of the KOV-21A into a technologically enhanced SKL, NGLD Medium requirements and OTNK can be achieved to take full advantage of the KMI architecture."

KMI Clients purchased in FY2012 were Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Management Clients (MGCs). Deliveries of LRIPS began in FY 2013. KMI MGCs purchased in FY2013 were Full Rate Production (FRP) MGCs with deliveries beginning 12 months after FRP contract award which occurred in 4QFY13. RDTE efforts are underway to provide communication within the KMI architecture for legacy devices. Current sunset for Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) is scheduled for December 2017. The Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Capability Production Document (CPD) was signed 03 September 2013 and anticipated procurements of NGLD Small and NGLD Medium devices were slated to begin in FY14 but are delayed due to the Bipartisan Budget Act decrements.  Modifications to the existing Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) will be made to support planning requirements and key distribution for KMI."
