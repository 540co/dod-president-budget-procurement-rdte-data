The CMS Program increase is to expand the pilot program to close out services for cost-type contracts, and a portion is to be used to sustain existing AbilityOne closeout support teams. This funding plus up is not related to the Defense Electronic Procurement dollars however the funds were placed here because AT&L\/DPAP does not own another RDT&E PE."
