These subcomponents required redesign and retest. Additionally, system performance issues were identified during the Jet Car Track Site (JCTS) Performance Test Readiness Review and these issues are hampering performance test progress. Execution of the test program and completion of the System Design and Development phase have been delayed.  Accordingly, the program was rebaselined driving out planned events and moving milestone C to 3rd quarter FY18.\n\nAircraft Launch & Recovery Equipment Modernization Improved Manually Operated Visual Landing Aid System - Due to  higher program and Navy priorities, the program's scheduled events, including production representative model procurement and milestones have slipped one year.\n\nAircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment Service Life Management program (SLMP) - Due to higher program and Navy priorities, SLMP scheduled events have been extended into 4th Quarter of FY19.\n\nAviation Data Management and Control System (ADMACS) - ADMACS scheduled events were adjusted due to the ADMACS Blk II program undergoing a Milestone Decision Authority directed rebaseline due to software deficiencies found during final Developmental Testing shipboard testing and the resultant need to defer Initial Operational Test and Evaluation.  \n\nTechnical:  Not Applicable."

This program includes the following systems under Project 2232, including the funding of production representative models for:\n\n(1) Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG): The AAG program will design, develop, test and field an aircraft arrestment system to replace the legacy Mark 7 arresting gear. AAG systems will be installed on all new construction aircraft carriers. AAG will provide the U.S. Navy with improved operational capability, while reducing operating and support costs.  The AAG system will recover all existing and projected carrier based tail hook-equipped air vehicles well into the 21st century.  The AAG Program's SDD phase test articles will consist of a land based, single wire configured aircraft arresting system, which includes associated hardware and software needed to conduct system integrated testing by arresting both dead-loads and aircraft.\n\n(2) Aviation Data Management and Control System (ADMACS): ADMACS is an integrated, network-centric, shipboard aviation operations information management system, which will provide data required for aircraft carriers aviation operations planning, execution and readiness assessment. ADMACS communicates aviation and command related data elements across the ADMACS Local Area Network and Integrated Shipboard Network System that electronically displays position and location of aircraft on the flight and hangar decks, status of aircraft, Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment, fuel, weapons types and quantity as well as a wide variety of other aviation related and ship information.  Shipboard Aviation Information Management System providing CVN Aviation Planning, Execution & Readiness Assessment.   \n\n(3) Compact Swaging Machine: Funded by ONR (OSD PE# 060051D8Z) in FY 2009. The current process of pouring zinc sockets to attach the arresting gear purchase cable will be replaced with a new swaged terminal design that will be pressed on by means of a high density, compact swaging machine.   \n\n(4) Aircraft Launch & Recovery Equipment (ALRE) Modernization: Improved Manually Operated Visual Landing Aid System (IMOVLAS): IMOVLAS will be the manual backup for Improved Fresnel Lens Optical Landing System (IFLOLS), which is the primary carrier Visual Landing Aid. IMOVLAS will be used in high sea states or if IFLOLS is inoperable, and will mirror current IFLOLS configuration in size & display.  Two production representative models will be procured in FY15; the models will be utilized for environmental and developmental testing. \n\n(5) Aircraft Launch & Recovery Equipment (ALRE) Service Life Management Program (SLMP): The ALRE SLMP for Launcher and Recovery is required to sustain carrier aviation operations of higher energy aircraft launch and recoveries that are increasing loads on the ALRE systems, and that are affecting availability, maintainability and cost.  This program will consist of service life assessment and extension initiatives and will establish the design foundation (structural, reliability, and maintainability analyses), permit appropriate assessment, track and focus design changes where most needed. Two SLMP Mark 7 prototypes will be procured in FY 2015."

In March 2009, the AAG program awarded a SDD contract modification to General Atomics for Transition to Production planning. \n\nAviation Data Management and Control System (ADMACS): The Navy continues to design and develop ADMACS using commercially available servers, switches, workstations and database and communications software. One Engineering Development Model and 2 Low Rate Initial Production systems have been procured from a directed 8(a) Alaskan Native Corporation source.\n\nCompact Swaging Machine: The Navy amended an existing Small Business Technology Transfer Phase III contract in order to build and test a prototype high density swaging machine which has been developed under Defense Acquisition Challenge Program funding (OSD PE 060051D8Z).\n\nAircraft Launch & Recovery Equipment Modernization:  \nImproved Manually Operated Visual Landing Aid System (IMOVLAS): The Navy will develop IMOVLAS using commercial equipment racks, processors and displays.\n\nAircraft Launch & Recovery Equipment Service Life Management Program (SLMP): This program will consist of Service Life Assessment and Extension initiatives and will establish the design foundation (structural, reliability and maintainability analyses), permit appropriate assessment, track and focus design changes where most needed. SLMP will develop a competitive procurement package to build and test the Mark 7 arresting gear prototypes."
