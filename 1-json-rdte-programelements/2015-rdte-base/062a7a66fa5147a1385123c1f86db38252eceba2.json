The ESB will be a middleware application which will  provide a single interface to and from DIMHRS from the Army Legacy Systems.  The ESB will provide the infrastructure for the integration of new and existing applications by allowing systems and applications to easily exchange information across different environments and platforms.  It will also form the information bridge between IPPS-A, the Army Legacy Systems, and external systems to create more streamlined systems in support of the military mission and personnel transformation goals. \n\n - GoArmy Ed is an Army continuing Education System (ACES) program that provides the virtual gateway to request Tuition Assistance (TA) online, anytime for classroom, distance learning, and online college courses.  GoArmy Ed is a dynamic online portal that automates many of the paper-based processes historically conducted in-person at Army Education Centers.  GoArmyEd includes automated registration tools that enforce TA policies and procedures.  GoArmyED is used by authorized users to pursue their post secondary educational goals: Army Education Counselors to provide educational guidance; and Colleges to deliver degree and course offerings and to report user progress.\n\nModernization initiatives address continued improvements related to the integration of new users and decreasing reliance on the help desk. GoArmyEd is the Army's enterprise education solution. GoArmyEd has integrated the Reserve Component (USAR and National Guard) and is actively integrating the Department of the Army Civilians. In addition, GoArmyEd is working to add a new data warehouse for HQ data retrieval and user self help tools. Education benefits are paramount to recruiting and retention of quality Soldiers, Civilians and Families."

Three modules support human resources business functions (In\/Out-Processing, Transition Processing, and Personnel Locator); the fourth module, Central Issue Facility (CIF) supports management of over 9 million combatant Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment inventory.  The web server architecture is fully internet protocol capable and allows soldiers ready access to their records and commanders and logisticians access to information affecting readiness of combat organizations. \n  \nCoalition Warfighter Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) is a mandated Joint program that requires participation by the US Army to explore near-term technologies that support Joint and Coalition Warfare Interoperability.  Funding is to facilitate Coalition Force interoperability research and development and to comply with CJCSI 6230.2 date 30 April 05.  \n\nArmy Behavioral Health Integrated Data Environment (ABHIDE) will be the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (CHPPM) Suicide Registry.  Data relating to suicides and suicides attempts are collected and stored in a in disparate, non-related databases that cross the domains of medical, personnel and law enforcement.   ABHIDE will provide the capability of integrating the non-related and dispersed data from the separate sources into a single comprehensive database to support both retrospective and predictive analysis.  The information obtained will be used to conduct epidemiological surveillance, identify trends in behavior patterns and identify potential indicators for suicidal tendencies supporting the mitigation of future suicide attempts across all phases of Army service.\n\nISM Core funding is essential for supporting demands to research and develop improved systems to provide for soldier safety and inventory reduction without risking readiness. Supports research and development to comply with Dept of Defense Instruction 8320.4 Serialized Item Management.  Applications to use commercial off the shelf wireless bar code equipment to ensure inventory accuracy throughout 154 warehouses in worldwide locations potentially reduces operating costs by $500.000 million. \n\nFunding for CWID will continue to facilitate Coalition Force interoperability research and development. Funding for ABHIDE will continue development of the system."

The MC4 System fulfills the requirements highlighted in United States Code: Title 10, Subtitle A, Part II, Chapter 55, Section 1074f, mandating the proper documentation of deployed service members' medical treatment to include pre- and post-deployment screening and its associated medical surveillance.  The MC4 System interfaces Force Health Protection and medical surveillance information with Army Mission Command information technology systems.  The MC4 System supports other soldier protection initiatives by providing data for analyses which can be used for identification and development of critical soldier support systems such as body armor, improved helmets, traumatic brain injury protection and trauma reduction.  Current MC4 Program efforts are focused on system engineering, testing, integration, and fielding automation infrastructure for Army users of the Theater Medical Information Program-Joint (TMIP-J) suite of software.  Effort has also been initiated to integrate MC4 with the Army CIO Network 2020 and Common Operating Environment (COE) and as a program of record in the Mobile\/Handheld Computing Environment Working Group.  Funding provides engineering, developmental testing, and integration of information management\/information technology to support Force Health Protection in accordance with the Army Equipment Modernization Plan.\n\nFY 2015 Base funding will be used for the engineering effort required to provide the Defense Health Information Management System (DHIMS) TMIP-J software on the Army platform, as well as the engineering effort for other Army unique capability.  Activities include:\n--Integration testing of DHIMS\/TMIP releases, other software systems on the MC4 baseline \n--All other testing to include operational, security, acceptance of TMIP and other software products\n--Research of technologies to integrate software into Army future information infrastructure, such as exploration of virtualization for MC4\n--Evaluation of hardware technology obsolescence and solutions\n--Interfaces with other systems, e.g. Nett Warrior"

The near and mid-term focus of the MC4 program is to engineer, design, integrate, test, acquire and field the Army automation infrastructure capabilities supporting fielding of the Theater Medical Information Program-Joint (TMIP-J) integrated software application suite and other Army requirements.  The MC4 hardware is procured as Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) components.  Since TMIP software is a major component of the MC4 System being developed in increments, the MC4 Program will deliver capabilities in increments, recognizing the need for future system updates and planned upgrades.  The MC4 Program continues to work with the user community to continually define and refine additional requirements and match them with available technologies to provide the user enhanced capabilities.  These enhanced capabilities will be provided to the user at the earliest possible date.  This approach yields the most operationally useful and supportable capability in the shortest time possible with Cost As an Independent Variable.  Moreover, this approach provides an initial capability with the explicit intent of delivering improved and updated capability in subsequent updates and planned upgrades.  This evolutionary development approach will be accomplished through a rapid prototyping process that will progress the system from its current functional capabilities to fully integrated objective capabilities.  Appropriate commercial technology enhancements (e.g. advances in operating systems, voice activated technology, etc) will be incorporated into MC4 products and systems as they become available.  Each MC4 System component will undergo a full range of developmental testing to include software unit testing, integration testing, interoperability testing and software qualification testing. The MC4 system updates and planned upgrades will continue to undergo follow-on testing."

The enterprise tools provided via PM AcqBusiness enable the reduction and eventual elimination of stovepipe and redundant tools that exist in the domain today. PM AcqBusiness provides an environment that will enable a standard capability to allow access to disparate Acquisition Domain data sources. PM AcqBusiness will provide role-based access to authoritative data sources and services. In addition, PM AcqBusiness provides a framework for information providers to publish their data and provide their services to authorized users."

PM AcqBusiness is using an evolutionary acquisition strategy, incorporating the use of COTS hardware and software, along with custom-developed software, in order to realize benefits early and reduce risk.  The AcqBusiness acquisition approach embraces the tenets of Subtitle III of Title 40, U.S.C. (formerly the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).\n\nPM AcqBusiness leverages existing DoD and Army enterprise capabilities to fulfill Acquisition Domain business needs whenever possible.  When no Army enterprise systems satisfy approved requirements, priority is given to existing acquisition business systems or services where they are scalable and in conformance with technical architecture standards.  In the event neither of these options is available to satisfy a business need, capabilities are acquired as commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products. PM AcqBusiness maximizes use of COTS technology by implementing an architecture and infrastructure based on services and virtualization.  If there are no available COTS solutions, PM AcqBusiness will develop the capability, leveraging an incremental approach to enable: (1) consistent and phased definition of requirements, (2) mature technologies, and (3) collaboration among user, tester and developer.  \n\nAs such, PM AcqBusiness is:\n\n- collaborating with the ASA(ALT) community to perform Business Process Reengineering in advance of development of AcqBusiness capabilities.  \n\n- encouraging the purchase of commercial products and innovations from private industry.\n\n- involving potential suppliers early in the requirements generation process. \n\n- employing outsourcing wherever possible, and\n\n- acquiring AcqBusiness capabilities in interoperable modules, minimizing the time required to deliver new capabilities to users."

It followed the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture which is aligned to the mandated Federal Enterprise Architecture. GFEBS was implemented to fulfill the needs and comply with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act, The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, and the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and to fulfill the stated mission of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller. GFEBS replaced, in full or in part, financial systems operating in excess of 40 years including the Standard Finance Systems and other costly feeder systems which do not allow the Department of Defense or the U.S. government to achieve an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements. GFEBS is used to administering the Army's General Fund. GFEBS was developed using a commercial off-the-shelf Enterprise Resource Planning system that is certified by the Chief, Financial Officer Council and provides six core financial functions. GFEBS allows tactical commanders to make informed decisions on a virtually real time system.\n\nOn 1 October 2008, GFEBS deployed to Wave 1 end users at Fort Jackson Garrison, Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) Indianapolis, Indiana and several other organizations. On 1 April 2009, GFEBS deployed to Wave 2 users at Fort Benning, Fort Stewart, DFAS Rome and several other organizations. Wave 3 deployed in October FY10, Wave 4 in January of FY11, Wave 5 in April 2011, Wave 6 in July 2011, Wave 7 in October 2011, Wave 8A in April 2012 and the final Wave 8B in July 2012. GFEBS is fielded to 53,000 trained end users. Each fielded release subsumes the previous release keeping all deployed sites executing under the same GFEBS release. The Full Deployment Decision was received by the Milestone Decision Authority on 24 June 2011 and Full Deployment was Full Deployment was achieved on 1 July 2012. Information Technology Development Project M05 provided GFEBS the ability to develop and build reports to meet auditability mandates and to accomplish efforts which enhance the GFEBS system with new reports and interfaces requiring technology development. It provided RDT&E funding to support evolutionary delivery of emerging capabilities."

                            "val": "US Military Entrance Processing Command Integrated Resource System (MIRS) provides automation and communications capability to meet peacetime, mobilization and wartime military manpower accession mission for the Armed Services.  MIRS interfaces with recruiting capabilities for the services, incorporating the concept of electronic data sharing using standard DoD data elements between USMEPCOM and all Armed Services recruiting commands.  This project includes Computerized Adaptive Testing-Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (CAT-ASVAB), automated Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is given to determine applicants' mental abilities. Data Services mission consists of automatic data processing in support of USMEPCOM, the Selective Service System (SSS) and other external agencies for both peacetime and mobilization requirements. MIRS directly supports mobilization in the event of a military draft, through electronic links with the SSS and its ability to process and ship. USMEPCOM\/MIRS is the only DoD organization legally authorized to collect civilian, medical and testing data for purposes of processing into military services and is the only DoD joint support system used to enforce congressional, DoD and Armed Forces qualification criteria for enlistment.  USMEPCOM has established interfaces with US Citizenship and Immigration Services to verify citizenship status for applicants of military service to screen out undesired or security threat and Federal Bureau of Investigation for background screening using digital fingerprints to eliminate people with criminal records from entering military service. USMEPCOM's IT sustainment effort will maintain MIRS and the associated network certification and accreditation until the end of system lifecycle.  MIRS was scheduled to be replaced by the Virtual Interactive Processing System (VIPS).   VIPS program cancellation has placed USMEPCOMs legacy IT infrastructure at high risk. The resultant system leaves a non-compliant and non-networthy accession system with processing gaps that need to be addressed for secure, compliant, sustainable, and reliable capabilities to meet DoD and Service requirements.  USMEPCOM must continue toward security and data integrity regulatory\/security compliance (PII and HIPAA) or lose Authority to Operate.\nCustomers\/beneficiaries of this investment include the Accessions Community of Interest (ACOI) including components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, USMEPCOM and OSD (P&R). \nStakeholders include: All Uniformed Services, Asst Sec of Defense (Health Affairs), Defense Transportation Mgmt Office, USD P&R, USD Intel, Defense Manpower Data Center and Department of Veterans Affairs.\nRequested funding would mitigate inefficient system sustainability and scalability through an update of the applications underlying database, operating system and middleware software.  The current legacy system requires time consuming and expensive efforts to make operational changes (even minor ones) to military accessions processing to meet DoD and individual Services requirements. MIRS operational processes exist in a system where business rules and workflow are hard coded throughout the system.  Any changes require extensive review and analysis of the code to see what is impacted before a change can be made, then extensive testing afterwards to make sure it works correctly throughout the accession process.  Currently there are over 600 Problem Reports (PR) and System Change Requests (SCRs) pending. \nRequested funding also provides for a follow-on acquisition plan that will be informed by the recent DCMO initiated Technical Demonstration. The acquisition will provide future enhancements and additional capabilities like those to be proven through the currently evolving Tech Demo.  These efforts will culminate in new USMEPCOM business process vision of an anytime, anywhere accession processing capability."

The Army's goal is to streamline Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L) end-to-end business processes; reduce operating, maintenance and support costs; minimize the number interfaces; support financial auditability; and promote and improve efficiencies when integrating with existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERPs) solutions. This is consistent with Undersecretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Memorandum; Department of Defense (DoD) Functional Contract Writing and Administration, dated 21 October 2011, which set goals that no new contracts should be entered in the DoD legacy Standard Procurement System (SPS) after 30 September 2015 and that all use of SPS would cease on 30 September 2017. Funds are to perform all requisite activities to concurrently develop pre-Milestone A documentation and perform pre-solicitation\/source selection activities expected of an ACAT III program in order to comply with the USD AT&L direction. \n\nAdapt\/improve\/install\/field government off the shelf (GOTS), commercial off the shelf (COTS), and new software to perform various tasks in a networked environment such as data warehousing, force management, personnel, installation and environmental databases and applications to support Business System Transformation and Installation Management, to include Commander's Risk Reduction Dashboard.\n\nThe Army Human Resources Command (HRC) has two efforts for which RDT&E will be applied.  One is to prepare those systems for subsumption into the Integrated Personnel and Pay System(IPPS-A).  The other is to disconnect and upgrade those systems not being subsumed by IPPS-A.  Many systems have delayed upgrade do to the planned release of DIMHRS.   Systems that will be targeted by HRC to prepare for IPPS-A subsumption or upgrade are the Automated Orders and resources System (AORS), Army Selection Board System (ASBS), Data Base Administration Suite of System (DBA), Enlisted Distribution and Assignment system (EDAS), Enlisted Promotion Model (EPM), Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), Human Resource Command Identity Management System (HIMS), Integrated Total Army Personnel Database (ITAPDB), Officer Selection Support System (OSSS), Reserve Statistics Accounting System\/Reserve Component Common Personnel Data System (RSAS\/RCCPDS), Senior Enlisted Promotions Model (SEPM), Single Evaluation Processing System (SEPS), Soldier Management System Webified Suite of System (SMSWEB), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Enlisted (TAPDB-AE), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Officer (TAPDB-AO), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Reserve (TAPDB-AR), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System (TOPMIS), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System II (TOPMIS II), Keystone Request\/Retain System, and the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS).\n     \nThe Program Planning Budget (PPB)- Business Operating System (BOS) will standardize and better integrate the transactional automated information systems used in the HQDA level programming and budgeting processes.  These systems are core to the PPBE business processes of the HQ for gathering programmatic requirements, balancing resources and delivering the Army's program budget to OSD.  This project is streamlining programming and budgeting processes and significantly improving strategic analysis capabilities.  The project is architecting, reengineering, streamlining and consolidating HQDA systems, feeder data base systems, and streamlining the associated processes.  These improvements will improve capability, eliminate redundancies and reduce overall cost of operations.  The PPB BOS project is complementary to the Army's General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) program.   It includes a new effort in FY14, the Army Contract Writing System, a replacement for the DoD Standard Procurement System (SPS).\n\nWill field the full operating capability of the Army Mapper system, which is the Army Geospatial data base of record and the HQDA repository for all Installation & Environment related geo-spatial data systems. \n\nThe Law Enforcement Advisory Program (LEAP), formerly known as the Criminal Information Management System (CIMS), is a collection of mission essential information technology (IT) systems within the Criminal Investigation Command (CIDC) and the Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG). USACIDC and OPMG has been tasked by the Army Health Promotion\/Risk Reduction (HP\/RR)task force to develop and integrate a unified, comprehensive enterprise program \/ system that shall house Classified and Unclassified - Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data which shall leverage existing and future Army LE enterprise information technology (IT) assets and other external data sources providing a full range of law enforcement functions to support business objectives and mission.  This new comprehensive enterprise system will be known as the Army Law Enforcement Reporting and Tracking System (ALERTS) and shall provide US Army LE stakeholders the enhanced capability to rapidly and efficiently manage a variety of LE and criminal intelligence (CrimIntel) functions; as well as a broader range of senior executive reporting requirements.  \n\nThe Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) is a web-based software system used at the Defense Forensics Science Center (DFSC), formerly known as the United States Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory (USACIL) at Fort Gillem, GA for the management of casework and tracking of all evidence received and processed.  The DFSC requires RDT&E funding to complete the configuration, installation and validation of additional LIMS modules in support of forensics (to include the Materials Management,Equipment Management, Proficiency Testing, Training and Crime Scene support); and, to support the development, configuration and implementation of an Expeditionary Forensics Laboratory Information Management System (eLIMS)  in theater.  The eLIMS is the conduit between the deployed labs and the laboratory located at Ft. Gillem.  The eLIMS would provide the forensic analysts with the ability to collect, track, store and analyze evidence collected from battlefield crime scenes at required competency levels of testing and calibration.  It will allow the results to be electronically maintained and transmitted to the permanent physical lab at Ft. Gillem, Ga.\nIn addition, the system would afford the analysts electronic access to shared case management and evidence databases at the LAB from their deployed positions.  At the current configuration of LIMS from CONUS locations, transmission of case related information can be processed in real time; however, transmission of case related information in theater takes approximately 1-2 hours.  If requirements are not funded, the DFSC will not be able to complete and implement the additional forensic modules for the core LIMS or develop and implement the eLIMS for the deployable labs. The stated objective will be delayed, resulting in a less than efficient process for handling of cases in theater and an inability to meet acceptable levels of turnaround time for casework."
