Capabilities of the F\/A-18 weapon system and ancillary equipment can be upgraded to accommodate and incorporate new or enhanced weapons as well as advances in technology to respond effectively to emerging future threats.  Continued F\/A-18 E\/F and EA-18G \"Flight Plan\" spiral capability development is critical to the baseline of the Super Hornet next generation mission system capability and maintaining tactical relevance in support of Navy Aviation Plan 2030.  Development continues for a platform solution to threat Advanced Electronic Attack and Counter-Electronic Attack (CEA).  F\/A-18 solutions to CEA include upgrades to existing sensors such as F\/A-18 Radar Upgrade, Infrared Search and Track Block I, and development of a fused picture between these sensors, such as Multi-Sensor Integration Phase III (the phases of Multi-Sensor Integration are being rolled up under the title of Multi-System Integration in FY15, programmatic name change only).  Additionally, continued advanced development engineering for improvements in reliability and maintainability are required to ensure maximum benefit is achieved through reduced cost of ownership and to provide enhanced availability.  \n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

H14 Fleet Release from 4Q18 to 4Q19. H10+ specific to IRST for 3Q16 release.  Also includes a naming convention change in regards to SCS builds 27, 29 & 31. Initially all \"X\" labeled builds to include Block I Super Hornets, now 27, 29, & 31 will no longer include Super Hornets thus going back to a \"C\" SCS label designation to include only legacy A-D aircraft.\n\nDelays in the schedule for IRST are due to technical challenges with the Fuel Tank which led to additional flight test requirements.\n\nMulti-Sensor Integration Phase II and Phase III testing efforts have been truncated to end in 4Q14, efforts continue in 1Q15 under Multi-System Integration. \n\nSmall Diameter Bomb Increment II \/ Joint Miniature Munitions Bomb Rack Unit software development refined to incorporate refined H12 schedules.  \n\n2065: The System Configuration Set (SCS) schedule has had multiple changes due to issues discovered during developmental and operational test requiring additional development time.

Additional capabilities are required for interoperability in a network-centric tactical environment. In order to respond effectively to emerging future threats, F\/A-18 aircraft capabilities are being expanded and upgraded to incorporate new\/enhanced weapons systems and avionics including Dual Mode Weapons, a Counter-Electronic Attack, Infra-red Search and Track integrated with the Active Electronically Scanned Array Radar to provide Narrow Band High Gain Electronic Attack, Distributed Targeting precision strike capability through a Distributed Targeting System, and Sensor Integration through Multi-Sensor Integration Phase I\/II\/III capability which is renamed beginning in FY15 as Multi-System Integration.  Continued advanced development engineering and analysis of hardware\/software is required to successfully optimize fleet F\/A-18 weapon systems for interoperability in a network centric tactical environment (such as Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air), to include: enhanced software capabilities, potential new hardware development, enhanced existing hardware, and enhanced network centric capabilities.   Additionally, continued effort is needed to perform technical evaluations, modeling and simulations, investigative flight testing, enhanced software modifications based on reported fleet deficiencies and beginning in FY14 the development and testing of design modifications to address obsolescence issues with the F\/A-18 weapon system and ancillary equipment.  Funding has been added starting in FY 2012 for the Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System\/Automated Terrain Avoidance and Warning System which will integrate currently implemented manual methodologies to provide not only aural and visual cues\/advisories but also automatic initiation of aircraft recovery and subsequent return of control to the pilot following recovery.  This funding line continues F\/A-18E\/F \"Flight Plan\" spiral capability development, to include Multi-Sensor Integration Phase II and Phase III capability (programmatic name change beginning in FY15 to Multi-System Integration) and further Flight Plan Engineering and System Configuration Set development and integration.  This budget continues funding for F\/A-18A-F Test Wing Maintenance support, funds development efforts needed for integration of air launched laser guided rockets on F\/A-18 A+\/C\/D and beginning in FY14 the development and testing required for the integration of the Small Diameter Bomb II and Joint Miniature Munitions-Bomb Rack Unit on the F\/A-18E\/F Super Hornet."

The major programs within the F\/A-18 Improvement project are based on six Weapon System Capabilities:  Distributed Targeting Air to Ground and Maritime, Distributed Targeting Air to Air, Net Centric Operations\/Battle Space Management, Sensor Integration, Air to Ground and Maritime Attack, and Air to Air Attack.  The major efforts included in this project are: Dual Mode Weapons integration; an Infra-Red Search and Track; Distributed Targeting capability through a Distributed Targeting System; Multi-Sensor Integration Phase I, Phase II and Phase III capability (programmatic name change to Multi-System Integration beginning in FY15); continued advanced development and F\/A-18E\/F Flight Plan engineering and analysis; continued enhanced software capabilities development; and engineering support to perform technical evaluations, modeling and simulations, and investigative flight testing.  \n- Infra-Red Search and Track (IRST).  The IRST Block I program is a Navy program in the Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase.  A Block I system will be developed by the Navy that will meet requirements for a Counter-Electronic Attack capability.  This capability will reach Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY 2017.\n- Distributed Targeting System (DTS).  DTS development is provided on a sole source cost plus incentive fee contract for EMD activities to Boeing.  The program was a new start ACAT III FY 2009 effort, with a post MS B entry and an IOC in FY 2013.  The program is leveraging previous Engineering Change Proposal efforts and is designated for Lot 26 and up domestic Super Hornets.  Updated acquisition plan is in accordance with Dr. Carter memorandum.  \n- Sensor Integration.  Sensor Integration development is provided on a sole source cost plus fixed fee contract on a Research and Development Basic Ordering Agreement to Raytheon and Boeing.\n- Integration of Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System\/Automated Terrain Avoidance and Warning System is envisioned to only require changes to the software System Configuration Set.  Studies and analyses are needed to identify the appropriate implementation method.\n- Integration of Small Diamter Bomb Increment II and the Joint Miniature Munitions Bomb Rack Unit is software driven with ground and flight test requirements."

The AESA system corrects operational test deficiencies noted in the AN\/APG-73.  It provides multi-target tracking, Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) imagery, SAR Target Location Error (TLE), and improved spotlight map resolution.  In addition, it provides greater lethality than previous F\/A-18 RADARs by allowing full tactical support of existing and planned air-to-air (A\/A) and air-to-ground (A\/G) weapons and it significantly increases A\/A and A\/G detection and tracking ranges.  The AESA system provides greater survivability through self-protection and standoff jamming capabilities, while its greater range allows for reduced detection by enemy RADAR. This budget continues spiral capability development of AESA with increased efforts to address Phase II Operational Requirements Document requirements such as Counter-Electronic Attack 1 (CEA 1) against multiple Radio Frequency Emitters, AESA Multi-Jammer Electronic Protection (EP), Precision TLE Improvement, Monopulse and 5th\/6th Channel development and Air Combat Maneuvering\/Short Range Search and Track development and includes upgrades to RADAR Instrumentation, test and evaluation assets and threat assets, and upgraded modeling and simulation of both clean and Electronic Attack threat environments.  Budget also supports development and testing of design modifications to address obsolescence issues with APG-65, APG-73 and APG-79 RADAR systems."
