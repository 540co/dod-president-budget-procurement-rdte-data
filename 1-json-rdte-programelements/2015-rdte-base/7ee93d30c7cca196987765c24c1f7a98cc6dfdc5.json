The Government also plans to fund the Letterkenny Army Depot (LEAD) for the development and testing of the MML.  The MML development schedule assumes use of this organic industrial base.\n\nNo new contracts are anticipated in support of the development of the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2-Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) Block I effort, unless determined to be necessary.  The Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) will further inform decisions on new contracts.  The Government will use existing contracts and work performed by other Government agencies.  The IFPC Inc 2-I Product Office will fund AMRDEC and LEAD to perform additional work.  The Government will use the following contracts:\n   \n   - No new contracts are anticipated to develop and integrate the IFPC suite of missiles to the Technical Fire Control (TFC) and IFPC Inc 2-I Block I Interceptor uplink.  The existing contract will also be used to procure test missiles to support Pre-Milestone B activities and the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.\n  \n   - The government anticipates using the Army's Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) contract to support development, test, and integration of the IFPC Inc 2-I Block I Interceptor with the IBCS and the MML. \n \n   - The government anticipates using the Army's Sentinel contract to incorporate sensor software upgrades to enhance detection of small radar cross section (RCS), slow-moving, and low-flying targets."
