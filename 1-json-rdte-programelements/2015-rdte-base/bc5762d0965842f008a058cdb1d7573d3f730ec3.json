            "val": "The Combat Identification (CID) Technology program element analyzes, develops, demonstrates and evaluates promising target identification technologies to facilitate platform transition decisions prior to Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).  The Joint Capability Document (JCD) for CID BFT (Blue Force Tracking), operational documents, lessons learned, and NATO requirements state the need for positive CID.  High confidence CID increases combat effectiveness, prevents fratricide, and reduces collateral damage.  It also enables combatant commanders to effectively command and control their forces in all weather, day or night.  This program element focuses on the cooperative and non-cooperative technologies that have the capability to positively identify surface and air targets in both air-to-surface and air-to-air engagements.  \n\nIn order to rapidly make available promising CID technologies for platform EMD decisions, the program element funds design studies, engineering analysis, and other efforts associated with demonstration of prototype CID related technologies and subsystems on platforms.  It also supports the development, testing, and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, Allied, and coalition interoperability.  \n\nNon-cooperative CID employs a number of sensing technologies and signal processing techniques.  The observations may be compared to a database of known objects to identify surface or air threats from air platforms.  These technologies include: (1) Laser Vision, an Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) imaging system that significantly increases ID ranges and includes exploiting synergies between non-cooperative and cooperative identification systems (radio, millimeter wave, infrared, and laser).\n\nCooperative CID employs technologies required to rapidly identify friendly platforms.  The program develops, integrates and evaluates technologies that provide AF platforms with a means of positively identifing an air or ground platform as a friendly, via active or passive cooperative ID capabilities.  Development funded by this program element ensures availability of Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) as well as Mode 5 IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) upgrade path for implementing ground and air platforms across the Air Force fleet.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

The Laser Vision Program is working on performance improvements, laser vibrometry development, 3-dimensional laser detection and ranging, laser radar, synthetic aperture laser (SAL) radar, hyper spectral phenomenology exploitation, aided\/automatic target recognition, image fusion and studies to support decisions on future EO\/IR technologies; (2) Radar Vision, an air-to-ground radar imaging technique to identify stationary and moving targets using their radar signatures; including passive techniques and electronic warfare identification technologies; (3) Hydra Vision, a balanced (robust) amalgamation of sensor data from multiple sources to provide warfighters with higher confidence CID results on surface or air targets potentially including fusion with intelligence sources,  identification of non-traditional targets, fusion to counter camouflage, concealment and deception (CCD), and multi-phenomenology features for sustainable databases; (4) Compact ATR (Aided Target Recognition) and Sustainable Environments (CASE), a CID approach that focuses on tailoring algorithms to utilize smaller, more efficient databases that are faster and less expensive to generate and maintain; and (5) X-Patch, a validated set of prediction codes and analysis tools that predicts realistic far-field radar signatures from 3-D (3 dimensional) target models in order to predict 1D and\/or 2D data.  X-Patch is vital for development of radar signatures of potential high-threat weapons systems; it is a critical capability of database production centers which support Joint Sensors Signature Database (JSSD) pathfinders. \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning."

The program develops, integrates and evaluates technologies that provide AF platforms with a means of positively identifying an air or ground platform as a friendly, via active or passive cooperative identification capabilities.  Development funded by this project ensures availability of a Mode 5 upgrade path for implementing ground and air platforms across the Air Force fleet.  \n\nWithin the air-to-air domain, programs funded to meet this intent include: \n\nMode 5 Technology Insertion Program (TIP): This project funds preliminary RDT&E for Mark XIIA, the next generation Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) standard for the DoD and NATO.  Mark XIIA represents a substantial enhancement to the Mark XII IFF system.  It is expected to achieve Joint Initial Operational Capability in 2014.  The \"A\" denotes the addition of Mode 5 (an encrypted challenge-and-reply mode) to the other Mark XII system modes (Modes 1, 2, 3\/A, C, S, and 4).  The Mode 5 secure IFF program is a DoD-wide, Navy-led development and acquisition program. The Mode 5 TIP specifically addresses implemention for air platforms by integrating Mode 5 into APX-119, APX-114, APX-113 and the UPX-40 transponder systems.  \n\nWithin the air-to-ground domain, development funded by this project ensures development, integration, test and evaluation of friendly identification systems focused on reducing air-to-ground fratricide.  CID efforts include investigation of radio based identification technologies; including the exploitation of state of the art digital radios and software defined radios and integration of cooperative and non-cooperative technologies for improved target recognition which could be incorporated into targeting pods or directly into the cockpit.  \n \nFund Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon Systems Identification Friend or Foe Mark XIIA System (AIMS)Program Office test engineers.  The DoD International AIMS PO has system level interoperability testing and certification responsibilities for the present Mark XII system, development and integration of Mark XIIA (Mode 5) and transition to Mark XIIA Mode S systems.  AIMS PO will continue to test and certify IFF equipment for the services now as long as IFF is used for combat identification."
