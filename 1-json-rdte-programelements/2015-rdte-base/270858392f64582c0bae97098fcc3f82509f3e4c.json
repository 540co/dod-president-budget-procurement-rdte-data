The C\/JFACC provides air, space and cyber support to the Combined\/Joint Forces Commander (C\/JFC) by coordinating, deconflicting and assessing the progress of various weapon systems to advance the C\/JFC's campaign.  The AOC WS develops operations strategy and planning documents.  The weapon system also disseminates tasking orders; executes day-to-day peacetime and combat air, space and cyber operations; and provides rapid reaction to immediate situations by exercising positive control of friendly forces.\n\nThe AOC WS Increment 10.2 program keeps the AOC interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through the integration, testing and fielding of new capabilities and sustainment upgrades to the AOC WS baseline.  The program supports mission requirements at Geographic and Functional AOCs, as well as Support and Manpower Augmentation units.  To keep the AOC current and interoperable with the COCOMs, cyber requirements, and fifth generation weapon system\/weapons, the AOC WS program plans to evolve the AOC through the integration and test of progressively improving capabilities.  These activities ensure a system of systems engineering perspective for the AOC WS, and include weapon system standardization activities as defined by AOC WS requirements documents.  The Modernization contractor, which was awarded the Modernization contract on 25 October 2011, conducted AOC 10.2 pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) activities, including a Systems Requirements Review (SRR), an Interim Design Review (IDR), and a delta-Preliminary Design Review (delta-PDR).  In accordance with AOC 10.2 Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) direction (23 June 2010), the AOC 10.2 Modernization program conducted prototyping and Limited Early Install (LEI) activities through an iterative build methodology prior to Milestone B (MS B) to reduce integration risk and improve user feedback in the acquisition process.  AOC Increment 10.2 received a Milestone B decision 11 October 2013.  AOC 10.2 EMD activities include the design (i.e., Critical Design Review), development, integration of 3rd party capabilities, testing (Contractor in-plant system testing, Developmental Test and Evaluation, Operational Test and Evaluation, Operational Assessment, Test Readiness Review, etc.) of the AOC 10.2 baseline, as well as build-up and fielding of the Help Desk (HD), Formal Training Unit (FTU), Combined Air Operations Center-eXperimental (CAOC-X) suite, and one geographic site.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning. \n\nThis program is going into Budget Activity 5, System Development & Demonstration (SDD) because the program passed Milestone B and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full fielding decision."

The C\/JFACC provides air, space and cyber support to the Combined\/Joint Forces Commander (C\/JFC) by coordinating, deconflicting and assessing the progress of various weapon systems to advance the C\/JFC's campaign.  The AOC WS develops operations strategy and planning documents.  The weapon system also disseminates tasking orders; executes day-to-day peacetime and combat air, space and cyber operations; and provides rapid reaction to immediate situations by exercising positive control of friendly forces.\n\nThe AOC WS Increment 10.2 program keeps the AOC interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through the integration, testing and fielding of new capabilities and sustainment upgrades to the AOC WS baseline.  The program supports mission requirements at Geographic and Functional AOCs, as well as Support and Manpower Augmentation units.  To keep the AOC current and interoperable with the COCOMs, cyber requirements, and fifth generation weapon system\/weapons, the AOC WS program plans to evolve the AOC through the integration and test of progressively improving capabilities.  These activities ensure a system of systems engineering perspective for the AOC WS, and include weapon system standardization activities as defined by AOC WS requirements documents.  The Modernization contractor, which was awarded the Modernization contract on 25 October 2011, conducted AOC 10.2 pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) activities, including a Systems Requirements Review (SRR), an Interim Design Review (IDR), and a delta-Preliminary Design Review (delta-PDR).  In accordance with AOC 10.2 Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) direction (23 June 2010), the AOC 10.2 Modernization program conducted prototyping and Limited Early Install (LEI) activities through an iterative build methodology prior to Milestone B (MS B) to reduce integration risk and improve user feedback in the acquisition process.  AOC Increment 10.2 received a Milestone B decision 11 October 2013.  AOC 10.2 EMD activities include the design (i.e., Critical Design Review), development, integration of 3rd party capabilities, testing (Contractor in-plant system testing, Developmental Test and Evaluation, Operational Test and Evaluation, Operational Assessment, Test Readiness Review, etc.) of the AOC 10.2 baseline, as well as build-up and fielding of the Help Desk (HD), Formal Training Unit (FTU), Combined Air Operations Center-eXperimental (CAOC-X) suite, and one geographic site.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning. \n\nThis program is going into Budget Activity 5, System Development & Demonstration (SDD) because the program passed Milestone B and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full fielding decision."

The second increment, Increment 10.1, upgraded these locations to an integrated baseline and fielded the baseline to additional operational and reserve units worldwide.  The latest increment is AOC 10.2. The AOC Modernization Contract was competitively awarded on 25 October 2011, but due to contract protests and associated delays, the actual start date was 20 December 2011. The Modernization contractor is using a system of systems perspective, and is following systems engineering rigor, to evolve AOC to a Net-Centric environment, compliant with DoD Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) standards."
