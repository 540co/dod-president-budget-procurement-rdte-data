            "val": "The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications.  It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, biological and materials sciences.\n\n     The Bio\/Info\/Micro Sciences project will explore and develop potential technological breakthroughs that exist at the intersection of biology, information technology and micro\/physical systems to exploit advances and leverage fundamental discoveries for the development of new technologies, techniques and systems of interest to the DoD.  Programs in this project will draw upon information and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple biological architectures and functions, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels. \n\n     The Math and Computer Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in new computational models and mechanisms for reasoning and communication in complex, interconnected systems. The project is exploring novel means of exploiting computer capabilities, including: practical, logical, heuristic, and automated reasoning by machines; development of enhanced human-to-computer and computer-to-computer interaction technologies; innovative approaches to the composition of software; innovative computer architectures; mathematical programs and their potential for defense applications; and new learning mechanisms for systematically upgrading and improving these capabilities.\n\n      The Cyber Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cybersecurity.  Networked computing systems control virtually everything, from power plants and energy distribution, transportation systems, food and water distribution, financial systems, to defense systems.  Protecting the infrastructure on which these systems rely is a national security issue.   The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD cyber-capabilities survive adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Basic research in cyber security is required to provide a basis for continuing progress in this area. Promising research results will transition to both technology development and system-level projects.\n\n     The Electronic Sciences project explores and demonstrates electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits and processing concepts that will provide: 1) new technical options for meeting the information gathering, transmission and processing required to maintain near-real time knowledge of the enemy and the ability to communicate decisions based on that knowledge to all forces in near-real time; and 2) provide new means for achieving substantial increases in performance and cost reduction of military systems providing these capabilities.\n\n     The Materials Sciences project provides the fundamental research that underpins the development of advanced nanoscale and bio-molecular materials, devices, and electronics for DoD applications that greatly enhance soldier awareness, capability, security, and survivability, such as materials with increased strength-to-weight ratio and ultra-low size, devices with ultra-low energy dissipation and power, and electronics with persistent intelligence and improved surveillance capabilities.\n\n     The Transformative Sciences project supports scientific research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in the areas of computing and the computing-reliant subareas of social sciences, life sciences, manufacturing, and commerce as a means of improving military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging converging trends."

An important focus of this program will be determining how information is stored and recalled in the brain and other DoD-relevant signals and developing predictive, quantitative models of learning, memory, and measurement.  Using this understanding, the program will develop powerful new symbolic computational capabilities for the DoD in a mathematical system that will provide the ability to understand complex and evolving signals and tasks while decreasing software and hardware requirements and other measurement resources.  This includes a comprehensive mathematical theory to extract and leverage information in signals at multiple acquisition levels, which would fundamentally generalize compressive sensing for multi-dimensional sources beyond domains typically used.  New insights related to signal priors, task priors, and adaptation will enable these advances.  This program will further exploit advances in the understanding and modeling of brain activity and organization to improve training of individuals and teams as well as identify new therapies for cognitive rehabilitation (e.g., TBI, PTSD).  Critical to success will be the ability to detect cellular and network-level changes produced in the brain during the formation of new, hierarchically organized memories and memory classes, and to correlate those changes with memory function of animals during performance of behavioral tasks."

The UPSIDE program will create a new generation of computing structures that will, in turn, enable revolutionary advances in ISR processing, particularly for DoD applications of embedded, real-time sensor data analysis.  Boolean data representations are inherently power-inefficient for many datasets, particularly those produced by noisy analog real-time sensors.  The UPSIDE program will establish an unconventional, non-Boolean, computing paradigm to enable new and needed capabilities in the area of sensor data analysis.\n\nUPSIDE intends to implement this new computing paradigm in the form of a specialized hardware component termed the inference module (IM).  The inference module will be first developed through simulation, and then implemented using mixed-signal complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, as well as using state of the art emerging (non-CMOS) devices.  Throughout the program, the inference module will be benchmarked using a DoD-relevant image processing pipeline, to verify gains in both computing throughput and power efficiency.  The result will be computing infrastructures and functional implementations that demonstrate three orders of magnitude improvement in processing speed and four orders of magnitude improvement in power efficiency.  These gains will constitute a disruptive new level of embedded computational efficiency for future real-time sensor systems."

The long-term goal for this program is to develop the next generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians in key disciplines who will focus a significant portion of their careers on DoD and National Security issues.  Beginning in 2013, YFA technical topic areas are more closely tied to programs currently underway at DARPA and to recently identified DoD and National Security needs.  The aim is for YFA recipients to receive deep interactions with DARPA program managers, programs, performers, and the user community.  Current activities include research in thirteen topic areas spanning from Quantum Science and Technology to Robotics and Supervised Autonomy, Mathematics, Computing, and the Interface of Engineering and Biology.  A key aspect of the YFA program is DARPA-sponsored military visits; all YFA Principal Investigators are expected to participate in one or more military site visits to help them better understand DoD needs."

In this paradigm, nodes represent people of interest and their relationships or interactions are edges; the result forms a network or graph.  Current analysis of social networks, however, is just in its infancy:  the composition of real-world networks is understood only at the most coarse and basic details (diameter, degree distribution).  In order to implement social network techniques efficiently and usefully, a better understanding of the finer mathematical structure of social networks is needed.  This includes the development of a comprehensive and minimal mathematical set that characterizes social networks of DoD interest, and a description of how these quantities vary in both space and time."

The key enabling technology is a new programming paradigm called probabilistic programming that facilitates the management of uncertain information.  In this approach, developers will use the power of a modern (probabilistic) programming language to quickly build a generative model of the phenomenon of interest as well as queries of interest, which a compiler will convert into an efficient application.  PPAML technologies will be designed for application to a wide range of military domains including ISR exploitation, robotic and autonomous system navigation and control, weather prediction, and medical diagnostics."

Mastering these domains requires the capability to create abstract yet predictive - ideally causal - models from massive volumes of diverse data generated by human actors, physical sensors, and networked devices.  Current modeling approaches are heavily reliant on human insight and expertise, but the complexity of these models is growing exponentially and has now, or will soon, exceed the capacity for human comprehension.  Big Mechanism will create technologies to extract and normalize information for incorporation in flexible knowledge bases readily adapted to novel problem scenarios; powerful reasoning engines that can infer general rules from a collection of observations, apply general rules to specific instances, and generate (and compute the likelihood of) the most plausible explanations for a sequence of events; and knowledge synthesis techniques to derive abstract principles and\/or create models of extreme complexity consistent with huge volumes of data.  Big Mechanism applications will accommodate an operator-in-the-loop by accepting questions posed in human natural language; providing drill-down to reveal the basis for an answer; taking user inputs to improve\/correct derived associations, weightings, and conclusions; and querying the operator to clarify ambiguities and reconcile detected inconsistencies.  Big Mechanism techniques will integrate burgeoning data into causal models and explore these models for precise interventions in critical areas such as cancer modeling, systems biology, epidemiology, cyber attribution, open-source intelligence, economic indications and warning, and human-social-cultural-behavioral modeling.

The scale and complexity of modern information systems obscures linkages between security-related events, the result being that detection of attacks and anomalies must rely on narrow contextual information rather than full knowledge of the event's provenance.  This shortcoming facilitates attacks such as masquerade (at the user level) and mimicry (at the machine code level).  Conversely, the space of security policies that can be enforced under the current operating paradigm is extremely narrow and restrictive; to the extent that users and administrators are required to make security decisions based on limited information, the default is often to just click through.  The Transparent Computing program will pursue several promising approaches to these problems, including active\/continuous testing via cooperating defenses, where protection components propagate security-relevant information and enable on-the-fly adaptation of the system security posture and usage controls, and behavior attestation techniques that ensure component interactions are consistent with established behavior profiles without exhaustive enumeration of all acceptable program states.  Transparent Computing technologies are particularly important for large integrated systems with diverse components such as distributed surveillance systems, autonomous systems, and enterprise information systems."

Tracking these exchanges will enable the computer to learn to send questions directly to the right subject matter experts in the future.  As knowledge is acquired, some computers will specialize and become subject matter experts themselves while other computers will become directories of experts that can provide guidance about where to find knowledge.  When enough computers have compiled enough knowledge, humans will start to access them by the same mechanism that the computers use: by asking questions.

However, there is a processing structure in nature, the mammalian neocortex, that efficiently captures spatial and temporal structure and routinely solves the most difficult recognition problems in real-time and is a general purpose structure for a range of sensor data processing and motor control execution.  The Cortical Processor program will leverage simplified models of known cortical operation to develop a new processor architecture that is optimized for running a family of algorithms known as Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), providing new levels of performance and capabilities to a broad range of data recognition problems.  HTM models map well to simple, massively parallel, signal processor arrays, and a cortical processor leveraging advances in dense memory structures on a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chip running at a few watts can perform orders of magnitude larger tasks than HTM systems simulated by commercial efforts on large data-center clusters.  And with certain specialized circuits, several orders of magnitude improvement in throughput and efficiency will be possible with the cortical processor, enabling a wide range of powerful, ultra-low power, embedded applications.\n\nThe Cortical Processor program includes basic scientific exploration into a variety of topics central to the development of this fundamentally new computing methodology.  The ultimate goal of the Cortical Processor program is to fabricate an accelerator\/coprocessor, in silicon, that contains thousands of reconfigurable, interconnected HTM modules.  HTM algorithm and data representation research will be conducted to determine optimal implementation to efficiently utilize the collective operation of the individual modules to achieve the unique features and functionality required by the cortical processor.  Each of the cortical processor modules will communicate with a large subset of other nodes requiring development of dense interconnect technology and research into a variety of on-chip network optimizations for the architecture to achieve the connectivity required.  Opportunities for significant improvements in power efficiency and speed will be achieved by leveraging recent advances in dense memory structures, such as multi-level floating gates, processors in memory, or 3D integration.  Applied research for the program is budgeted in PE 0602303E, Project IT-02."

SSIM will emphasize the foundational social skills necessary to achieve cultural understanding in any social setting and the skills necessary for successful interactions across different social groups.  These core skills do not require soldiers to have knowledge of a specific culture prior to contact but emphasizes skills for orienting toward and discovering patterns of meaningful social behavior.

Unfortunately, during the same period, cyber adversaries, which include nation-states, criminal\/terrorist groups, transnational actors, and lone miscreants, have grown rapidly in sophistication and number.  The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD resilience in the face of adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.

The MPD program will focus on development of fast, small, reliable, high carrier-density, micro-plasma switches capable of operating in extreme conditions, such as high-radiation and high-temperature environments.  Specific focus will be given to methods that provide efficient generation of ions that can perform robust signal processing of radio frequency (RF) through light electromagnetic energy over a range of gas pressures.  Applications for such devices are far reaching, including the construction of complete high-frequency plasma-based circuits, and microsystems with superior resistance to radiation and extreme temperature environments.  It is envisaged that both two- and multi-terminal devices consisting of various architectures will be developed and optimized under the scope of this program.  MPDs will be developed in various circuits and substrates to demonstrate the efficacy of different approaches.  MPD-based microsystems are demonstrated in DoD applications where electronic systems must survive in extreme environments.\n\nThe Basic Research part of this effort is focused on fundamental MPD research and will advance scientific knowledge based on the study of several key MPD design parameters.  These parameters include ultra-high pressure and high carrier density regimes.  MPD will focus on expanding the design space for plasma devices enabling revolutionary advances in micro-plasma device performance.  It is expected that MPD will develop innovative concepts and technologies that are clearly disruptive with respect to the current state of the art in terms of speed of operation and robustness in extreme environments.  Fundamental scientific knowledge derived from MPD is also expected to drive developments in commercialization of MPD technology developed and funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01."

Efforts under this program will remove the roadblocks to achieving performance needed for future sensing, communication, computing, and memory applications.  The program involves close collaboration between these experts and the academic base with industry providing 60% of program funding matched by 40% from DARPA.  For both industrial and government participants, leveraging shared research funding for high risk, pre-competitive technology explorations for shared technical hurdles is very attractive.\n\nResearch in STARNet is divided into a discovery thrust (ACCEL) and an integration thrust (NEXT) executed by virtual academic centers and focused on combining current or emerging technologies to provide new capabilities.  ACCEL seeks to discover new material systems, devices, and novel computing\/sensing architectures.  NEXT involves projects on advanced analog and mixed signal circuitry, complex system design tools, and alternative computing architectures.  As the projects in ACCEL mature, it is expected that they will replace the efforts in NEXT that are based on current standard technologies for integrated circuits.\n\nThe STARNet program is unique.  It creates a community where industry and government participate as co-sponsors to guide and learn from a large academic research base, with DoD shaping the goals to have direct impact on important long-range DoD problems."

Simultaneously, this effort will focus on the development of arrays which can quickly create different unique RF personalities\/capabilities on top of common digital hardware.

The Diverse & Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) program takes this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (for example, Gallium Nitride, Indium Phosphide, Gallium Arsenide, Antimonide-Based Compound Semiconductors), micro-electromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures.  This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true \"systems on a chip\" (SoCs) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions for a wide array of system applications.\n\nThe Basic Research part of this program focused on the development of new hetero-integration processes and capabilities that, if successful, will be demonstrated in application-specific circuits and transferred into the manufacturing flow.

Such X-ray sources enable new versatile imaging modalities based on phase contrast techniques which are 1000x more sensitive than the conventional absorption contrast imaging.  Such imaging modalities should enable design verification of integrated circuits to validate trustworthiness as well as Forward Surgical Team imaging of soft tissues and vascular injuries from blunt trauma without the injection of a contrast enhancing agent.

Examples of physical effects that have been investigated under this thrust include absorption thermodynamics in metal-hydride systems, and correlated electron effects such as superconductivity and magnetism.  This thrust has also included investigations of the phenomenology of various biological, physical, and social systems in order to abstract the common features that are responsible for their properties of self-organization, emergent behavior, and physical intelligence.  Current efforts are focused on developing stabilization and scale-up methods to fabricate high-pressure crystal structures within domains not previously possible.  This offers the promise to exploit the incredible properties of high-pressure phases (e.g., hardness for armor) using economically viable manufacturing approaches."

With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  However, the DoD's ability to harness this platform is rudimentary.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  The program will enable the rapid and scalable development of previously unattainable technologies and products (i.e. those that cannot be accessed using known, synthetic mechanisms) leveraging biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials (e.g. fluoropolymers, enzymes, lubricants, coatings and materials for harsh environments), novel functions (e.g. self-repairing and self-regenerating systems), biological reporting systems, and therapeutics to facilitate new solutions and enhancements to military needs and capabilities.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling distributed, adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value materials, devices and capabilities in the field or on base.  Such a capability will decrease the DoD's dependence on tenuous material supply chains that are vulnerable to political change, targeted attack, or environmental accident.\n\nIf successful, Living Foundries will do for biology what very-large-scale integration (VLSI) did for the semiconductor device industry: enable the design and engineering of increasingly complex systems to address and enhance military needs and capabilities.  Living Foundries will develop and apply an engineering framework to biology that decouples biological design from fabrication, develops and yields design rules and tools, and manages biological complexity through simplification, abstraction, and standardization of both processes and components.  The result will be rapid design, construction, implementation and testing of complex, higher-order genetic networks with programmable functionality and DoD applicability.  Research thrusts include developing the fundamental tools, capabilities and methodologies to accelerate the biological design-build-test cycle, thereby reducing the extensive cost and time it takes to engineer new systems and expanding the complexity and accuracy of designs that can be built.  Specific tools and capabilities include: interoperable tools for design and modeling; automated, modular and standardized fabrication and genome-scale engineering processes; modular regulatory elements, devices and circuits for hierarchical and scalable engineering; standardized test platforms and chassis; and novel approaches to process measurement, validation, and debugging.  Applied research for this program is budgeted in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02."

These tools will facilitate design and biological production of new chemicals and materials, sensing capabilities, therapeutics, and numerous other applications.  This rapidly developing technological capability opens the door to new national security applications that have heretofore been out of reach, and offers substantial potential advantages in terms of cost and novel functionality.  The ACE program will position the U.S. to be first in exploiting the powerful functional capabilities and applications that arise through being able to harness biological systems.\n\nA major impediment to engineering biology is that engineered organisms are often less fit than their precursors and are likely to be outcompeted by other organisms.  Fundamental work in this area will focus on engineering biological robustness to ensure that engineered organisms perform as designed over the long-term.  Research in this area may include developing methods to ensure genetic integrity of organisms, as well as engineering communities of microorganisms to perform useful tasks, ranging from the production of chemicals to the development of stable microbiomes to prevent and treat disease.\n."
