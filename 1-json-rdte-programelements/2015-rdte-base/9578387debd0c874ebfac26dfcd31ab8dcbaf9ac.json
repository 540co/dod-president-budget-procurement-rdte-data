Existing approaches to deactivating warfare agents  are difficult to implement in non- and semi-permissive environments or are too slow\/expensive to achieve over large permissive environments.  These limitations coupled with the emergence of new, low cost technologies for producing chemical weapons drive a need for countermeasures that are simple and fast to implement and improve U.S. strategic response to emerging chemical threats.   Approaches to be considered under the Unconventional Approaches to CWD program include creation of catalysts to accelerate the hydrolysis of chemical agents, development of approaches utilizing smart-chemistry to achieve stand-off demilitarization, construction of a small rapid remediation approach for use in semi-permissive environments, and identification of drugs or antidotes designed to protect those demilitarizing chemical agents in semi-permissive environments."

One goal of this program is to develop new sensors and sensing networks that can economically and reliably provide wide area monitoring of radionuclide signatures.  Another goal is to investigate new therapies and decontamination strategies that can mitigate both the long- and short-term biophysical health impacts of exposure to ionizing radiation."
