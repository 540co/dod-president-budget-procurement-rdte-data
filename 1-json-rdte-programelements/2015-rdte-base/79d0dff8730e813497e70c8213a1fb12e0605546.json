            "val": "The Requirements Analysis and Maturation (RAM) program funds early systems engineering and pre-acquisition planning and analysis activities. These activities include requirements analysis, capability decomposition and trade space characterization, concept development (system of systems, air, space, and cyber), cost analysis, modeling and simulation of representative or prototype systems, and costs associated with these activities to include analytical tools and travel. Outcomes of these\nactivities are fiscally and technologically informed requirements, mature concepts that are technically feasible, and areas for science and technology (S&T) investment to reduce technology risks. These activities provide the analytic basis for cost and capability trades to inform weapon systems requirements and acquisition milestones, decision points, and phases; for example, the Materiel Development Decision (MDD). A number of Department of Defense (DoD), Government Accountability Office(GAO), and independent industry studies point to a need for more disciplined, early phase systems engineering and pre-systems acquisition planning to produce decision-quality acquisition information that previously did not surface until after the initiation of a program. Early-phase systems engineering and technical planning activities funded by this program provide the foundation for informed investment decisions leading to successful acquisition programs. Specific efforts are determined each year based upon the highest Air Force priorities. This effort is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.\n\n\nFor FY 2014 and out Space and Non-Space RAM program activities were combined into a single Development Planning project, 45349\n\nIn FY 2015 and out, 645349, Development Planning, efforts were transferred to PE 0606017F, Requirements Analysis and Maturation, 666157, Development Planning, due to an internal DoD budget activity realignment."
