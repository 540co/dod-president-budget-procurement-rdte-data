            "val": "The Air Ocean Tactical Applications (AOTA) Program Element is aligned with the Navy's maritime strategy to enhance the future mission capabilities of the Navy-Marine Corps Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Team supporting naval warfighters worldwide. New state-of-the art government and commercial technologies are identified, transitioned, demonstrated and then integrated into Combat Systems and programs of record to provide capabilities that provide real-time and near-real-time operational effects of the physical environment on the performance of combat forces and their new and emerging platforms, sensors, systems and munitions. The AOTA program element focuses on sensing and characterizing and predicting the littoral and deep-strike battlespace in the context of regional conflicts and crisis response scenarios.  Projects in this program element transition state-of-the art sensing, assimilation, modeling and decision aid technologies from government and commercial sources. Unique project development efforts include atmospheric and oceanographic data assimilation techniques, forecast models, data base management systems and associated software for use in mainframe, desktop and laptop computers. Model data, products and services can be used by forward-deployed personnel or in a reach-back mode to optimize sensor placement and force allocation decisions. Global Geospatial Information and Services efforts within this program address the bathymetric needs of the Navy. Also developed are algorithms to process new satellite sensor data for integration into Navy and Marine Corps decision support systems and for display as part of the common operational and tactical pictures. In addition, the projects provide for demonstration and validation of specialized atmospheric and oceanographic instrumentation and measurement techniques, new sensors, communications and interfaces. Included are new capabilities to assess, predict and enhance the performance of current and emerging undersea warfare and mine warfare weapons systems. AOTA capabilities are designed to support the latest versions of the Global Command and Control System and specific unit-level combat systems. This program element develops technological upgrades for the U.S. Naval Observatory's Master Clock system to meet requirements of Department of Defense communications, cryptographic, intelligence, geolocation, and targeting systems; develops near-real-time earth orientation predictions; develops very precise determination of positions of both faint and bright stars; and supports satellite tracking and space debris studies.  \n\nMajor emphasis areas include the Naval Integrated Tactical Environmental System Next Generation (NITES-Next) and the METOC Future Mission Capabilities, the METOC Space-Based Sensing Capabilities, the Precise Timing and Astrometry, the Fleet Synthetic Training, the Tactical Oceanographic Capabilities for Under Sea Warfare, the Earth System Prediction Capability projects, and the Remote Sensing Capability Development."

New sensor technologies (including unmanned vehicles, tactical sensor exploitation, in-situ sensors) identified as the most promising candidates are transitioned from the government's and commercial industry's technology base.  These new sensor technologies are demonstrated, validated and integrated into operational programs for  warfighters.  These new sensor capabilities provide timely and accurate METOC data and products to operational and tactical commanders. METOC data requirements have likewise evolved as the emphasis on naval warfare has evolved from blue water operations to the littoral and deep strike battlespace.  The littoral and deep strike regions typically have dynamic and complex oceanographic and atmospheric conditions. The need to accurately characterize these conditions is more crucial than ever in planning and executing warfare operations and effectively allocating force weapon and sensor systems. Routinely available data sources, such as climatology, oceanographic and meteorological numerical models, and satellite remote sensing are necessary but not sufficient to support these warfare areas in the littoral and deep strike regions.  Operational sensors are deployed great distances from the target area of interest.  The challenge is to collect and disseminate METOC data in variable and dynamic littoral environmental conditions or in denied, remote or inaccessible areas over extended periods of time.  This project: 1) provides the means to rapidly and automatically acquire a broad array of METOC data using both off-board and on-board sensors; 2) provides an on-scene assessment capability for the tactical commander; 3) provides the tactical commander with real-time METOC data and products for operational use; 4) demonstrates and validates the use of tactical workstations and desktop computers for processing and display of METOC data and products;  5) demonstrates and validates techniques which employ data compression, connectivity and interface technologies to obtain, store, process, distribute and display these METOC data and products; 6) develops new charting and bathymetric survey techniques necessary to reduce the existing shortfall in coastal hydrographic survey requirements; 7) develops an expanded database for predictive METOC models in areas of interest; and 8) supports the development of radar weather using through-the-sensor techniques. \n\nMajor emphasis areas include the METOC Future Mission Capabilities (FMC) and the Tactical Oceanographic Capabilities project.\n\nFY 2015 request provides for continued advanced development of software and hardware component and prototype efforts associated with acquiring environmental data, and METOC data dissemination, storage, delivery, design, development efforts, and develop METOC network integration capability."

This project includes: 1) development, demonstration and validation of software associated with atmospheric and oceanographic data assimilation forecast models and database management systems for use in both mainframe and tactical scale computers.  Included are numerical oceanographic and atmospheric models for the Large Scale Computers at the Navy Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC), Monterey, CA and the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO), Stennis Space Center, MS.  These models, combined with a global communications network for data acquisition and distribution, form a prediction system which provides METOC data and products necessary to support naval operations worldwide in virtually every mission area; 2) other software models, which focus on ocean thermal structure and circulation, and surf and tide prediction; 3) software to process and manage satellite remotely-sensed environmental data at Oceanography Centers ashore and on ships equipped with the AN\/SMQ-11 satellite receiver\/recorder; 4) future METOC and environmental satellite data readiness and risk reduction preparations to develop hardware and software that will allow ground stations to receive, ingest and exploit satellite data including payload sensor data from the National Polar Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) Preparatory Project (NPP), the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Polar Systems' Meteorological Operational satellites A & B (METOP-A & B), Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS), and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). This software allows for the integration and tactical application of significant oceanographic and atmospheric data derived from satellite-borne sensors.  Satellite and unmanned sensor data, combined with manned platform data are foundational to a robust numerical weather and oceanographic modeling capability that predicts battlespace conditions impacting fleet and adversary weapon and sensor performance.  Included are software and algorithms for the processing of sensor measurements, conversion of raw signal data to geophysical information, analysis schemes encompassing Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems, and other satellite data applications and field validation of end products; and, 5) a family of acoustic system performance models beginning with active system models and databases in the low-, mid-, and high-frequency regimes and culminating with high fidelity simulation products.  As weapons and sensors become more sophisticated and complex, the marine environment has an increasingly significant impact on system performance.  Operational limitations induced by the ocean and atmosphere must be understood, and the resulting constraints on mission effectiveness and system employment minimized.  Hence, the operating forces require more accurate worldwide forecasts of METOC conditions with increased temporal and spatial resolution. An additional challenge is posed by the emergence of new satellite sensor data.  In order to fully exploit this dynamic and massive volume of data, modern Data Base Management Systems are required, and must be tailored for individual computer configurations at both FNMOC and NAVO.  Improved representation of smaller-scale phenomena, particularly in the littoral, is also an important consideration.  Intelligence Preparation of the Environment Sensor R&D to meet Chief of Naval Operations and Commander, Fleet Forces Command requirements for remote autonomous, clandestine, littoral battlespace sensing in near shore areas in support of Sea Shield & Sea Basing.\n \nMajor emphasis areas include the METOC Future Mission Capabilities (FMC), the METOC Space-Based Sensing Capabilities, and the Tactical Oceanographic Capabilities \/ Under Sea Warfare projects (TOC\/USW).\n\nFY 2015 request provides for continued advanced software component development and prototype efforts associated with advanced data assimilation into environmental prediction systems (to include development of tactical decision aids and asset allocation tools software), the continued development of advanced oceanographic and atmospheric prediction systems software and architectures to provide improved forecasts and estimates of product accuracies, continued development of improved data fusion techniques, data quality control technologies and accelerate the automation prediction processes, and the development of data assimilation and fusion software technologies for tactical radars, remote sensing and undersea sensor systems.  Begin research and development of data processing and data assimilation algorithms for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-R) launch.  Develop Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Decision Support & Predation Tools to improve Electromagnetic and Electro-optical (EM\/EO) system performance.\nThe Earth System Prediction Capability (ESPC) program provides a more accurate global ocean and atmospheric forecast system with longer skillful forecast times through integrating and coupling atmosphere, ocean, ice, land and near-space forecast models into a seamless prediction system that reduces errors in the current modeling suite. Additionally it will develop a national common modeling architecture to improve cross-agency collaboration, and a greatly more efficient computational architecture to allow for real-time operational prediction."

Data assimilation is expanded to include new in-situ and remotely-sensed data types, based on operational need.  Tasks are directed toward advanced software enabling assimilation of disparate sources on non-synoptic time scales.  Acoustic, atmospheric, and oceanographic model development, prototyping and transition is focused on improved model physics, increased resolution, and computational efficiency.  \n\nMetric:  Tasks will address no less than 75% of applicable capability gaps and requirements.\n------\nGoal (ESPC): Develop a more accurate global ocean, atmosphere, wave and sea ice forecast system with longer skillful forecast times from weeks to seasons through integrating and coupling atmosphere, ocean, ice, land and near-space forecast models into a seamless prediction system that reduces errors in the current modeling suite. Additionally develop a common modeling architecture to improve cross-Agency collaboration, and a greatly more efficient computational architecture to allow for real-time operational prediction. \n\nMetrics: Long term trends show a globally averaged gain of skill of 1 day per decade of RDT&E investment, i.e. today's 5-day forecast is as accurate as the 3-day forecast available in the early 1990's. This program will implement new technological approaches to improve 7-14 day predictions to the level of current 5-7 day forecasts and will seek to provide quantifiable skill above long term seasonal averages for 14-90 day lead times for mission planning."

This project identifies and transitions state-of-the-art decision support software technologies from the government's and commercial Industry's technology base and then demonstrates and validates these capabilities before fielding. These software decision support tools provide platform, sensor, communications, and weapon systems performance assessments for warfighters in terms of their littoral and deep-strike battlespace environments. These assessments allow mission planners and warfighters, from Unit to Theater level, to optimize their sensor employment on airborne, surface, and subsurface platforms in support of Naval Composite Warfare mission areas including Undersea Warfare (USW), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Mine Warfare, Amphibious Warfare (AMW), Anti-Surface Warfare (ASUW), Anti-Air Warfare (AAW), Strike Warfare (STW), and Naval Special Warfare (NSW). Performance assessments leading to improvements in operational and tactical control are conducted through a two-tiered approach: 1) METOC Decision Aids (MDAs) and, 2) Operational Effects Decision Aids (OEDAs). MDAs consist of a series of analysis tools which characterize the physical environment conditions of the battlespace based on the best set of physical environment data available at the time (i.e., some combination of historical and\/or real-time (or near real-time) in-situ, and numerically modeled forecast data). OEDAs then use the MDA information by fusing it with relevant, often-classified sensor and target data to predict how weapons and sensor systems will perform. Performance results are displayed in tabular and graphic formats integrated into net-centric visualization tools for use by mission planners and combat\/weapon system operators to develop localization plans, USW\/AAW\/ASUW screens, STW profiles, AMW ingress and egress points, and for other warfare considerations. MDAs and OEDAs typically use data derived from sensors developed in Project 2341 (METOC Data Acquisition) and assimilated by software produced by Project 2342 (METOC Data Assimilation and Modeling). MDAs and OEDAs also use data obtained through direct interfaces to Navy combat systems. A current emphasis area of the project is capabilities required to characterize and\/or predict sensor and weapons system performance in the highly complex littoral environments in support of regional conflict scenarios. It addresses multi-warfare areas, particularly shallow water ASW, NSW, and missile and air defense\/strike capabilities. \n\nThe major emphasis of this project is the software development within the Naval Integrated Tactical Environmental System Next Generation (NITES-Next) program of record. \n\nFY 2015 request provides for the achievement of NITES-Next Initial Operational Capability (IOC), the continuation of Fleet Capability Release (FCR)-2 software development efforts including extensive system architecture, and testing efforts and initiation of FCR-3."

The MC System and Time Transfer provides precise time for use in modern military and National Technical Means (NTM) navigation, guidance, positioning, and tracking systems. The Earth Orientation System provides precise Earth Orientation Parameters for use by the DoD and the national civilian infrastructure to establish the specific orientation of the Earth and to provide input to the terrestrial reference frame. The Astrometric Observation System provides the basic data needed to generate the celestial reference frame which is the standard for calibrating all inertial navigation systems, satellite orbits, and earth rotation determinations. Improvement to the MC System, Time Transfer, Earth Orientation, and Astrometric Observation Systems are needed to ensure that new and upgraded DoD and NTM capabilities meet their performance requirements. By DoD Directive (CJCSI 6130.01D, encl J, of 13 Apr 2007), the U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO), Washington, D.C., is responsible for coordinating Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) requirements and for maintaining a PTTI reference standard (astronomical and atomic) for use by all DoD, Federal agencies, and related scientific laboratories. The Navy is also responsible for providing astronomical data for military and NTM navigation, positioning, and guidance capabilities that are space-based. \n\nThe PTA research and development efforts are focused on several areas relating to timing and time transfer: (1)  Development of Rubidium Fountain Atomic Clocks and development of improved GPS Timing Receivers in order to meet the precise timing requirements for the GPS III system; (2) Research & development of the capability of distributing timing signals via Optical fiber lines, as an alternative and backup to GPS time distribution; and (3) Research & development into Optical Clock technology, which is expected to be required for future DoD systems. The PTA research and development effort is also focused on the following areas related to Earth Orientation Parameter (EOP) determination: (1) Upgrade of the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VBLI) data acquisition system \/ radio telescope at Kokee Park HI; (2) Development of a Software (SW) Correlator for processing of VLBI data, necessary for the generation of Earth Orientation Parameter (EOP) data; (3) Development of the capability for electronic transmission of the VLBI data from remote VLBI sites to the USNO correlator. The new SW Correlator and the eVLBI infrastructure upgrades are necessary in order to support daily updates of EOP data required by GPS III; (4) Development of an automated end-to-end EOP processing system, which combines input from multiple data sets (e.g. VLBI data, GPS orbit data, and laser ranging data, etc.). This process is currently very labor intensive and costly. Automation is necessary to meet future DoD and GPS requirements; and (5) Modifications to the EOP system for compatibility with the new international standard -'VLBI2010'. Starting in FY15, the PTA research and development for astrometry will focus on improvements to the USNO Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) at Flagstaff, AZ. It is necessary for maintenance of the Celestial Reference Frame (CRF). Four 1.8m telescopes will be added to the array in order to extend and expand the number of stars in the catalog to fainter stars of 9th magnitude.\n\nThe Critical Time Dissemination (CTD) aspect of the PTA program develops enhanced methods of distributing and verifying precise time back to the Master Clock, UTC (USNO). The development aspect of this project has four parts: (1) Development of a mobile time link; (2) Refinement of and modernization of the Hydrogem Maser and Auxilary Offset Generator (AOG); (3) Customize a timing system to develop a Site Verification System; and (4) Produce a fiber link system to transfer the Master Clock down long-haul fiber.\nIn response to these DoD requirements, this project transitions Research and Exploratory Development efforts, as well as developments in the civilian sector, into the operational capabilities of the USNO."

One Navy Rb Fountain has been completed and shipped to the Alternate Master Clock facility (December 2012).  One more Rb Fountain will be completed and sent to the AMC facility by July 2013.  Approximately 12 months are needed to verify the performance of the two Rb Fountains once they are in place at the AMC.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEarth Orientation:  Very Long Baseline Interferomtry System (VLBI) Software (SW) correlator design and development completed.  The new 15-station SW Correlator was procured (OPN-funded), delivered and installed in September 2012.  It will replace the Hardware (HW)  correlator.  The Initial Operation Capability (IOC) for the SW Correlator was completed on 7 February 2013.  The preliminary version of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been delivered.  The SW correlator is used for processing the daily National Radio Astronomy Observatory Earth Orientation Parameter (NRAO EOP) intensive series, from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) Mauna Kea, HI, and Pie Town, NM, antennas.  In addition, one of the International VLBI Service (IVS) EOP intensive experiments (using the Kokee Park, HI, and Wettzell, Germany, antennas) is correlated on both the SW and HW correlators for intercomparison.  Plans for replacement and upgrade of the VLBI radio telescope at Kokee Park HI are progressing.  The Kokee Park telescope replacement contract and the Kokee Park Telescope project manager contract is in preparation at Fleet Logistics Center (FLC), Philadelphia, and are expected to be awarded in July 2013."
