            "val": "The OSD HSCB Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need.  The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces\u2019 ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and select effective courses of action in the full range of military operations.  Program research will enhance population-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the increasingly complex global environment to address national strategic challenges such as instability, aggression, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and violent extremism.  In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable methods, technology, tools and prototypes.  Work under PE 0603670D8Z is focused on developing and demonstrating general-use, cross-domain tools in two areas: computational modeling; and sociocultural behavior data collection, management, and dissemination.  Research will result in more effective cultural understanding in existing intelligence, influence operations, and operations planning systems; modeling capabilities for forecasting reactions to U.S.\/coalition actions; demonstration of strategic decision making tools that highlight political, religious, cultural, and related factors; tools and technologies enabling more widespread and effective use of sociocultural behavior models in operations and mission rehearsal; and toolsets that can be used as strategic decision making tools to account for sociocultural factors."
