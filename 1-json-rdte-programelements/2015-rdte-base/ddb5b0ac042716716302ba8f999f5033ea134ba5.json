            "val": "This program element provides resources to develop advanced mine countermeasures equipment systems to counter known and projected mine threats.  The mine countermeasures systems provide mobile, quick reaction forces capable of land or sea-based minehunting and minesweeping operations worldwide.  Resources are for developing and deploying advanced mine-hunting and minesweeping systems and the intelligence and oceanographic capabilities that will enable mine warfare superiority.  Tactics and techniques used vary across a diversity of environments and threats, including both asymmetric and emerging.  Resources provide for systems and support of mine warfare systems, maritime systems, and expeditionary systems to allow for continuous operations of the Navy's warships and support vessels, other military vessels, and commercial vessels.  Core capabilities include forward presence, deterrence, sea control, power projection, maritime security, humanitarian assistance and disaster response to maintain freedom of the seas.  Capability improvements include conducting minefield reconnaissance (mine density and location) at high area search rates, improving detection capability, decreasing sensor false alarm rates, reducing or eliminating post-mission analysis detect, classify, identify, decide time, improving neutralization time, improving network communications, automatic target recognition, and achieving in-stride detect-to-engage capability.  Concept of operations includes development of cooperative, unmanned, modular systems; the establishment of capable networked command and control systems; and standing up an accurate and interactive environmental system with the ability to form and disseminate a Common Environmental Picture.  Other areas of importance include search and rescue; surface fire support; ASW operations; protection\/offense against small craft\/vehicles; air to air operations; very shallow water MCM; swimmer defense and torpedo defense.  Efforts benefit the MCM force by transforming the Navy from the platform-centered legacy set of systems to a capability-centered force that is distributed, networked, and able to provide unique maritime influence and access across the entire maritime domain.\n\n\nThe Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) programs will provide detection, classification, localization, identification, neutralization, and influence clearance capabilities.  The \"Next Generation\" AMCM systems will provide capabilities to the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mine Countermeasure Mission (MCM) Package.  This capability will be of critical importance in littoral zones, confined straits, choke points, and the Amphibious Objective Area (AOA)."

Research, development, test, and evaluation efforts are for increasing critical capacity, decreasing time required to conduct Mine Countermeasures (MCM) operations, ensuring low risk to naval and commercial vessels, and removing the man from the minefield. Increased capability includes conducting minefield reconnaissance (mine density and location) at high area search rates, improving detection capability, decreasing sensor false alarm rates, reducing or eliminating post-mission analysis detect, classify, identify, decide time, improving neutralization time, improving network communications, automatic target recognition, and achieving in-stride detect-to-engage capability.\n\nThe AN\/AQS-20A is a mine hunting and identification system with acoustic and optic sensors housed in an underwater towed body. The acoustic sensors are designed for the detection, classification and localization of bottom, close-tethered, and volume targets in a single pass. The Electro-Optic Identification Device (EOID) replaces the Volume Search Sonar (VSS) for identification of bottom targets.  The system will be deployed from the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) as part of the MCM Mission Package (MP). The AN\/WLD-1(V)2 Remote Minehunting System (RMS) Remote Multi-Mission Vehicle (RMMV) tows the AN\/AQS-20A.\n\nThe AN\/AQS-20A Block 1 is undergoing a Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) program to upgrade the Forward Looking Sonar (FLS) and Side-Looking Sonars(SLS) to improve Probability of Classifying a Mine-like object as a Mine, False Classification Rates, and Depth Localization performance to meet Block 2 performance. The Forward Looking Sonar will be replaced with a new High Frequency Wideband based design. The SLS will be replaced with a new Multi-function SLS with Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) capability, as well as, improved signal processing and Signal to Noise Ratio. The Block 1 P3I program began in FY12 and will complete in FY15. All Block 1 units will be upgraded to meet Block 2 capability. Award and management of the competitive contract for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP)\/Full Rate Production (FRP) units begins in FY14 and continues through FY18. The Block 2 P3I program begins in FY16 and continues beyond FY19.\n\nThe AN\/AQS-20A Block 2 will support LCS Mine Countermeasures Mission Package (MCM MP) Developmental Testing (DT) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) in FY15. Materiel Reliability and obsolescence Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) efforts begin in FY14 and continues through FY15 supporting AN\/AQS-20A Block 2 and LCS MCM MP FY15 Developmental Testing (DT) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E).\n \nThe AN\/AQS-24 Mine Hunting and Identification system is comprised of acoustic sensors housed in an underwater towed body. The AN\/AQS-24 Volume Search upgrade will be developed, tested, and integrated for use with multiple platforms including the MH-53E Helicopter. This capability is in support of an Urgent Operational Need (UON) and will improve the rapid detection and locaization of volume sea mines.  RDT&E funding ends after in FY14."

These systems will be deployed from the Littoral Combat Ship and will provide organic airborne mine neutralization capability as part of Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mine Warfare Mission Module.  This capability will be of critical importance in littoral zones, confined straits, choke points and the Amphibious Objective Area (AOA). Improved AMNS (iAMNS) provides an expendable, reacquisition, identification and neutralization capability against bottom, moored and Near Surface sea mines. iAMNS is deployed from both MH-60S multi mission helicopters and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV), or any craft of opportunity, using existing common communications, command & control and launching equipment.  \n\nAMNS (Seafox) will be deployed from the MH-53E helicopter; this effort converts a FY 2003 Rapid Deployment Capability (RDC) into a program of record. The development, testing and integration phases will be completed in FY14."

These efforts will provide reach back support as the OAMCM systems begin to be fielded; will develop modifications to environmental databases necessary to support OAMCM mission planning; will update the MIW Tactics Continuum to address OAMCM; and will update the gear and mine database for threats addressed by the OAMCM systems.\n\nNSAM will merge capabilities of OPMA and NAVO's Evironmental PMA (EPMA) capabilities into an Open Architecture framework.
