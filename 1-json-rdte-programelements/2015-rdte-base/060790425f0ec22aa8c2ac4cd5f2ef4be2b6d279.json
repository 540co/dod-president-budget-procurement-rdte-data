As with the FY 2013 programs, FY 2014 feasibility studies will define the required actions for implementing DEF and assess the potential costs of those actions.  OUSD (AT&L) will engage with program offices through the Military Departments, and serve as a liaison among the program offices, the Military Departments, and other Technology Security and Foreign Disclosure offices to facilitate the feasibility studies.  For pre-MS A systems, the DEF feasibility studies will be addressed in the Technology Development Strategy and the Program Protection Plan (PPP).  For the systems that are in the pre-MS B development stage, the DEF feasibility studies will be addressed in the Acquisition Strategy and the PPP.  For Post-MS B platforms, when there is already a contract in place, OUSD (AT&L) will work with the program managers and contracting officers to implement the necessary contractual modifications to ensure that the feasibility studies are executed.  Depending on the maturity of each program and where it is in the acquisition life cycle, the feasibility studies may be addressed in the Requests for Proposals (RFPs).      \n\nOUSD (AT&L) will conduct a follow-up industry round-table meeting to discuss the DEF concept, capture government and industry perspectives, and to identify further corresponding government and industry strategic choices. Government and industry participants will also identify mutual risks and challenges in implementing defense exportability features, and identify legislative, regulatory, or policy change proposals.  This will take place in the spring of 2014.\n\nOUSD (AT&L) will continue to develop recommended procedures and guidance to be incorporated in the DAG regarding incorporating DE business case analyses into contract and acquisition strategies, as well as procedures to cost share DEF implementation with industry and recoupment of these costs though foreign sales.  OUSD (AT&L) will also develop policies and processes to identify additional DoD funding sources for the next phases of DEF activities, as well as cost-sharing with contractors for the initial and follow-on research and development costs of DEF pilot programs, in accordance with Section 252 of the NDAA for FY 2012."
