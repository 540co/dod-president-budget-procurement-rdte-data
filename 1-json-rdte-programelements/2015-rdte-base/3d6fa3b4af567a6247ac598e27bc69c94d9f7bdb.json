The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.\n\nThis program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.
