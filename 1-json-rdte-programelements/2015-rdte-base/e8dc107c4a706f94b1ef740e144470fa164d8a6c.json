            "val": "Nuclear Deterrence Operations (NDO) is an Air Force Core Function.  Within this core function, Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) is the exercise of authority and direction by the President, as Commander in Chief, through established command lines, over nuclear weapon operations of military forces.  The President's authority and direction are exercised through the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS).  The NCCS is the designated combination of flexible and enduring elements including facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, personnel, and the structure in which these elements are integrated, all of which are essential for planning, directing, and controlling nuclear weapon operations.\n\nThe Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) portfolio modernizes the systems necessary to effectively provide assured communications connectivity between the President and the strategic deterrence forces in stressed environments. \n\nMEECN System Improvements (MSI) is a long-range planning process with users (Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), and the Navy) to develop positions for current and future requirements\/issues based on available technology. MSI is used to conduct technology testing, analyze technology strategies and build technology roadmaps as pro-active support to the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) community. \n\nGlobal Aircrew Strategic Network Terminal (Global ASNT) replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces, Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS), and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).  Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) and Force Management messages from NC2 nodes and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews.  Global ASNT will be fielded in separate capability increments; Increment 1 fields required EHF\/AEHF capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals.  Subsequent increments will deliver:  an Aircrew Alerting System (AAS) consisting of pagers and klaxons; High Frequency (HF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) capabilities; and a Very Low Frequency (VLF)\/Low Frequency (LF) receive capability.  Global ASNT will provide solutions to existing capability shortfalls for NC2 and is the last line of operational communications when all other peacetime links fail.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal years."

Global ASNT will be fielded in separate capability increments; Increment 1 fields required EHF\/AEHF capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals.  Subsequent increments will deliver:  an Aircrew Alerting System (AAS) consisting of pagers and klaxons; High Frequency (HF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) capabilities; and a Very Low Frequency (VLF)\/Low Frequency (LF) receive capability.  Global ASNT will provide solutions to existing capability shortfalls for NC2 and is the last line of operational communications when all other peacetime links fail.   \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal years."
