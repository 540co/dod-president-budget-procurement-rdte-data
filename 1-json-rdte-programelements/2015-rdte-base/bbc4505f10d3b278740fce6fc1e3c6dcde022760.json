Unpredictable and extended global distribution routes, limited visibility of sustainment requirements, force packaging limitations, lift constraints, anti-access\/aerial denial concerns, complex supply chains, as well as non-networked battlefield command and control, planning, and decision support tools impede timely customer logistical support.  To project unimpeded global power and influence, USTRANSCOM must have access to relevant, real-time information and invest in enabling capabilities that contribute to mission success.  Effective knowledge sharing and transparency across the joint logistics enterprise, facilitated by secure enterprise-wide visibility into logistical processes and the ability to effectively collaborate\/operate in a degraded cyberspace, is required to promote effective, efficient and responsive global management of force projection and sustainment resources."

Current planning, forecasting and collaboration capabilities do not permit full synchronization of people, processes and assets to execute planned operations.  Automated tools must be able to dynamically analyze\/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems.  Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by disparate systems, multiple data standards and insufficient interfaces.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro\/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct \"what -if\" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset\u2019s course, speed or departure\/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery\/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.
