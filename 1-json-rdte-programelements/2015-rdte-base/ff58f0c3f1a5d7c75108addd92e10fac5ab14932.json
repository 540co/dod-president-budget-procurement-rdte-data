This PE is managed by PMS-320, the Electric Ships Office, located organizationally within PEO SHIPS, with responsibility for developing Naval Power Systems that focus on energy efficiency, providing power to mission systems, and platform integration of those components and systems.  The mission of PMS 320 is to develop and provide smaller, simpler, more affordable and more capable electric power systems for all Navy platforms and focus Navy and industry investments.\n\nThis PE is the bridge between Science and Technology (S&T) and ship platform and mission systems acquisition programs by identifying prospective applications for S&T research, advanced development, and performing additional product development and qualification when necessary to meet platform or mission system requirements.\n\nIn October 2009, SECNAV outlined a set of specific objectives supporting U.S. Navy energy reform including several aimed at significantly reducing Fleet fuel consumption and improving our energy security posture. PMS-320 supports the DON Energy Goals by employing an integrated approach to develop and transition more affordable technologies that satisfy increasing shipboard power demands and high operational tempo while improving energy efficiency, reducing fuel consumption, and reducing Total Ownership Cost."

This project supports optimized integration of mission systems, appropriate component and system controls, integration of components and systems into future and current ships, and providing power system solution alternatives to new and existing platforms. \n\nProject developments are aligned with the Navy's 30 year shipbuilding plan via the Naval Power Systems Technology Development Roadmap, which outlines the way ahead for future developments and provides a basis for coordinated planning and investment by the Navy and private industry.  \n\nThis project develops and transitions products that increase energy efficiency (and thereby create fewer greenhouse gas emissions and reduce dependence upon foreign petroleum sources), provide additional power to mission systems, and integrates those components and systems into ship platforms.\n\nDON Energy Initiatives - Energy Storage Module (ESM) Increment 1, Advanced Power Generation Module (APGM), and Gas Turbine (GT) Efficiency Upgrades:  This project supports the DON Energy Initiative designed to reduce ship energy consumption and increase mission effectiveness through longer time on station.  The ESM will achieve fuel savings by de-risking single generator operations.   APGM will provide increased power to meet DDG51 Flight III  requirements for advanced sensors and future weapons with reduction in life cycle costs through increased fuel efficiency over legacy gas turbine generator sets.  GT Efficiency Upgrades will provide fuel efficiency improvements to existing gas turbine engines for both backfit and new construction ships.\n\nMission Power:  Designs, develops, tests and integrates shipboard power systems to incorporate advanced sensors, Directed Energy and other advanced weapons. Design and testing includes Modeling and Simulation, as well as land based testing, to reduce risk and demonstrate readiness for shipboard use.  AMDR PCM provides power conversion from ship's 4160 VAC distribution systems to 1000 VDC at 1.4MW to support ship installation of AMDR Radar."

Develop alternative power and propulsion solutions for future surface combatants and amphibious ships. Continue to improve baseline power system performance by performing analysis, modeling and simulation, life cycle cost analysis, producibility studies, module development, and ship integration studies and planning. Continue to analyze alternatives for supplying power to advanced radars, combat systems, and electric weapons power demands and potential interfaces to develop optimum alternative solutions. Continue assessments of Naval Power System alternate architectures to best meet emerging ship requirements. \n\nComplete bi-annual update of the Naval Power Systems Technology Development Roadmap.\n\nContinue Energy Magazine (EM), previously referred to as ESM Increment 3, specification development and begin acquisition documentation."
