            "val": "The Joint Experimentation (JE) Program Element provides funding for the Department\u2019s Joint Concept Development & Experimentation (JCD&E) effort, carried out by the JCD&E Community.  The JCD&E Community is comprised of the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Joint Staff, National Guard Bureau (NGB), United States Coast Guard (USCG) and several Defense agencies.  Intra-government agencies and coalition partners often participate in JCD&E processes and projects.  The Director for Joint Force Development (DJ-7) leads the joint force development efforts on behalf of the Chairman.  The J-7 staff coordinates all efforts with respect to the JCD&E Community.\n\nTo ensure the program focuses on needs of the warfighters, JCD&E initiatives originate from an annual call for nominations from CCMD's and Services, and from assessment of CCMDs identified critical warfighting capability gaps articulated in the Comprehensive Joint Assessment (CJA).  JCD&E project submissions undergo preliminary analysis by the JCD&E Community to confirm suitability for experimentation and, where feasible, to associate closely related subjects for economy of effort.  Preliminary analysis also confirms alignment to the Chairman\u2019s priorities for developing Joint Force 2020 and Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) strategic priority areas.  The resulting annual list of project submissions includes concepts for development and experimentation efforts eligible for design and execution.  These efforts are prioritized and approved by the CCMDs and Service members of the Synchronization Board and forwarded to the Joint Capabilities Board (JCB)\/Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) for approval.\n\nJCD&E activities examine potential solutions for CCMD operational needs emphasizing non-materiel solutions through targeted Doctrine, Organizational, Training, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOT-LPF-P) improvements.  JCD&E tackles joint concept and capability issues demanding sophisticated analysis, innovative design and complex execution.  JCD&E projects address topics that would prove difficult for individual combatant commands and Services to capture in the context of their immediate operational and force generation responsibilities.  In partnership with the CCMDs and Services, JCD&E mitigates operational risk by establishing procedural models to conduct emergent concepts that are not yet instantiated in conventional force generation.  The results are briefed to Functional Capability Boards (FCB) who integrate solutions into their functional investment plans.\n\nBased on leadership guidance, JS J7 shed themselves of the experimentation functions originally outlined in the Joint Experimentation R2.  While JS J7 divested this piece, the other portions such as concept development and wargaming were retained. The shift in focus aligns more closely with those functions under BA6 RDT&E Management Support.
