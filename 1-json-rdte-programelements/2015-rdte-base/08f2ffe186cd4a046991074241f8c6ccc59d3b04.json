            "val": "Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure and prevent positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations.  The term NAVWAR is sometimes equated with \"PNT Superiority\".  The Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) was established by DEPSECDEF Memo, 17 November 2004, as the DoD Center of Excellence, tasked to integrate and coordinate NAVWAR PNT capabilities across electronic spectrum, cyberspace, and space operations.  NAVWAR leverages various techniques and technologies from these mission areas to negate or prevent hostile use of PNT information and protect unimpeded use of PNT information by U.S., Allied, and Coalition Forces while not unduly disrupting peaceful use outside an area of operation. The JNWC develops and maintains the Department's premier collection of NAVWAR knowledge, and provides subject matter expertise support to warfighters, Department decision makers, the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure), and the Coalition.  NAVWAR expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs), modeling and simulation, analysis, and exercise and training support. In recent years, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has become one of the most critical enablers of modern advanced technology warfare. In an era where everything from advanced weapons systems and networks to basic goods and services are tracked, guided or disciplined by PNT systems such as GPS, NAVWAR is an ever increasing capability of interest and concern, especially if PNT systems are interrupted or lost. Likewise, as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) proliferate, it becomes necessary to consider not only denying adversary use of GPS but also negating adversary use of alternate GNSS systems for PNT.  Recent revisions to National Defense Strategy and Defense Planning Guidance require Combatant Commands to account for denied \/ degraded PNT environments in deliberate planning. Projecting force in the Asia-Pacific Region and other theaters of operation requires an understanding  of how evolving global asymmetric anti-access \/ area denial (A2\/AD) threats may affect joint warfighting functions.  JNWC-conducted POFAs are a key element in evaluating Coalition NAVWAR capabilities and vulnerabilities and adversary capabilities and vulnerabilities, both crucial to executing PNT superiority mission sets in potentially denied \/ degraded PNT environments.  JNWC helps develop defensive and offensive PNT capabilities by focusing on four Joint Mission Essential Tasks (JMETS):\n\n1. Enable Defensive PNT Operations: enable operations that will protect blue force PNT capabilities.\n2. Enable Offensive PNT Operations: enable PNT superiority capabilities that can take advantage of GNSS vulnerabilities. \n3. Establish and Maintain PNT Situational Awareness (SA): assess current and projected blue force and red force PNT related capabilities.\n4. Develop and Execute NAVWAR Operational Assessments and Analysis for Future NAVWAR Operations and conduct field assessments to evaluate blue force and red force capabilities and vulnerabilities.\n\nThe JNWC executes its assigned mission responsibilities through three lines of operation (LOO):\n\n1. Create Knowledge for PNT Superiority: PNT operational field assessments, studies and analysis, assessment and dissemination of PNT related intelligence, and managing the PNT Superiority data repository\n2. Operationalize PNT Superiority: Joint Force and Contingency Operations support to Combatant Commands, Services, and other customers through outreach; creating and demonstrating operational capability for PNT Superiority in the near term\n3. Institutionalize PNT Superiority: Acquisition, policy, doctrine, and coalition support; creating  the environment for robust PNT Superiority capability in the future\n\nRDT&E funds, reinstated beginning in FY14, will be used primarily to support JMET #4, Develop and Execute NAVWAR Operational Assessments and Analysis for Future NAVWAR Operations and LOO #1, Create NAVWAR Knowledge. GYPSY POFAs are large, often integrated Coalition, assessments conducted to address Combatant Command OPLAN and CONPLAN related PNT capabilities and vulnerabilities in their anticipated theater threat environment.  FORTUNE POFAs are smaller PNT capability and vulnerability assessments used as future GYPSY risk reduction events or as stand-alone PNT capability assessments.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

                            "val": "Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure and prevent positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations.  The term NAVWAR is sometimes equated with \"PNT Superiority\".  The Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) was established by DEPSECDEF Memo, 17 November 2004, as the DoD Center of Excellence, tasked to integrate and coordinate NAVWAR PNT capabilities across electronic spectrum, cyberspace, and space operations.  NAVWAR leverages various techniques and technologies from these mission areas to negate or prevent hostile use of PNT information and protect unimpeded use of PNT information by U.S., Allied, and Coalition Forces while not unduly disrupting peaceful use outside an area of operation. The JNWC develops and maintains the Department's premier collection of NAVWAR knowledge, and provides subject matter expertise support to warfighters, Department decision makers, the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure), and the Coalition.  NAVWAR expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs), modeling and simulation, analysis, and exercise and training support. In recent years, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has become one of the most critical enablers of modern advanced technology warfare. In an era where everything from advanced weapons systems and networks to basic goods and services are tracked, guided or disciplined by PNT systems such as GPS, NAVWAR is an ever increasing capability of interest and concern, especially if PNT systems are interrupted or lost. Likewise, as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) proliferate, it becomes necessary to consider not only denying adversary use of GPS but also negating adversary use of alternate GNSS systems for PNT.  Recent revisions to National Defense Strategy and Defense Planning Guidance require Combatant Commands to account for denied \/ degraded PNT environments in deliberate planning. Projecting force in the Asia-Pacific Region and other theaters of operation requires an understanding  of how evolving global asymmetric anti-access \/ area denial (A2\/AD) threats may affect joint warfighting functions.  JNWC-conducted POFAs are a key element in evaluating Coalition NAVWAR capabilities and vulnerabilities and adversary capabilities and vulnerabilities, both crucial to executing PNT superiority mission sets in potentially denied \/ degraded PNT environments.  JNWC helps develop defensive and offensive PNT capabilities by focusing on four Joint Mission Essential Tasks (JMETS):\n\n1. Enable Defensive PNT Operations: enable operations that will protect blue force PNT capabilities.\n2. Enable Offensive PNT Operations: enable PNT superiority capabilities that can take advantage of GNSS vulnerabilities. \n3. Establish and Maintain PNT Situational Awareness (SA): assess current and projected blue force and red force PNT related capabilities.\n4. Develop and Execute NAVWAR Operational Assessments and Analysis for Future NAVWAR Operations and conduct field assessments to evaluate blue force and red force capabilities and vulnerabilities.\n\nThe JNWC executes its assigned mission responsibilities through three lines of operation (LOO):\n\n1. Create Knowledge for PNT Superiority: PNT operational field assessments, studies and analysis, assessment and dissemination of PNT related intelligence, and managing the PNT Superiority data repository\n2. Operationalize PNT Superiority: Joint Force and Contingency Operations support to Combatant Commands, Services, and other customers through outreach; creating and demonstrating operational capability for PNT Superiority in the near term\n3. Institutionalize PNT Superiority: Acquisition, policy, doctrine, and coalition support; creating  the environment for robust PNT Superiority capability in the future\n\nRDT&E funds, reinstated beginning in FY14, will be used primarily to support JMET #4, Develop and Execute NAVWAR Operational Assessments and Analysis for Future NAVWAR Operations and LOO #1, Create NAVWAR Knowledge. GYPSY POFAs are large, often integrated Coalition, assessments conducted to address Combatant Command OPLAN and CONPLAN related PNT capabilities and vulnerabilities in their anticipated theater threat environment.  FORTUNE POFAs are smaller PNT capability and vulnerability assessments used as future GYPSY risk reduction events or as stand-alone PNT capability assessments.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."
