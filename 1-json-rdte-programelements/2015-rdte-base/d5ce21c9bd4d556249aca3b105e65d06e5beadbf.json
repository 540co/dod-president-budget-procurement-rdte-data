JLTV objectives include increased protection and performance over the current legacy HMWMV fleet, minimizing ownership costs by maximizing commonality, fuel efficiency, and reliability.  The commonality of components, maintenance procedures, training, etc., among vehicles is expected to be inherent in FoV solutions across mission variants to minimize total ownership cost.  Unique service requirements have been minimized.  \n\nMajor FY 2015 budget activities include the completion of three Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contracts, ballistic testing, completion of limited user testing (LUT), and analysis of live fire and operational test reports in preparation for Milestone C. FY 2015 also includes efforts associated with the contract award for live fire test assets, source selection evaluation activities, completion of Milestone C documentation in preparation for the Defense Acquisition Board, and program management support."

The U.S. Army is the JLTV service lead. In addition, the Navy anticipates procuring JLTV vehicles upon successful Full Rate Production (FRP) decision.\n\nThe program will use an evolutionary approach to deliver capabilities in increments based on program priorities.  All technologies entering the current Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase were Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or higher to achieve Capabilities Development Document (CDD) requirements.\n\nThe program revised the acquisition strategy in the first quarter of FY 2012, addressing better buying power initiatives, and reduced the program schedule by fifteen (15) months to enable a 33-month Non-Development Item approach for EMD, with Milestone B approved on 9 August 2012.  The program anticipates Milestone C decision in July 2015.\n\nThrough a full and open competition, the program awarded three fixed price contracts for EMD phase on 22 August 2012 to AM General, Lockheed Martin, and Oshkosh Corporations.\n   \nIncrement I will produce two Mission Role Variant (MRV) configurations (Combat Tactical Vehicle (CTV) and Combat Support Vehicle (CSV)) with mission packages (General Purpose, Heavy Guns Carrier, Close Combat Weapons Carrier, and Utility\/Shelter Carrier).  EMD vendors fabricated a total of 66 vehicles (22 test assets per vendor) representing mission packages for both MRVs, which the Government will fully test during EMD. \n\nVehicles were delivered in the fourth quarter of FY 2013 to begin the fourteen (14) month government performance and reliability testing, which will focus on demonstrating Key Performance Parameters\/Key System Attributes (KPP\/KSA) and safety requirements.  Test strategy represents a mix of vendor risk reduction testing and formal government testing. \n \nMarket research has not identified a qualified non-EMD vendor.  Unless subsequent market research identifies a qualified non-EMD vendor capable of delivering the required capabilities, there will be a down-select from among the EMD contractors for award of the Production and Deployment (PD) phase contract.  The down-select will result in awarding a single fixed-price contract in FY 2015 with R&D funded test vehicles, consisting of three years of procurement funded Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) with an option of five years of FRP starting in FY 2018.  The PD phase contract will also include interim contractor logistics support (ICLS) and one or more options for the procurement of the JLTV Technical Data Package (TDP)."
