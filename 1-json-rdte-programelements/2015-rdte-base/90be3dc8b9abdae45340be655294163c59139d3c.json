            "val": "The successful integration of space-based capabilities into the core of U.S. national security operations has resulted in dramatically increased demand for and dependence upon space capabilities. As a result, U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) identified three needs: 1) to rapidly augment existing space capabilities when needed to expand operational capability; 2) to rapidly reconstitute\/replenish critical space capabilities to preserve \"continuity of operations\" capability; 3) to rapidly exploit and infuse space technological or operational innovations to increase U.S. advantage.  Operationally Responsive Space projects were optimized for prioritized theater use and\/or surge, augmentation and replenishment of traditional space capabilities.  The ORS Concept of Operations (CONOPS) drives the need for satellites featuring high degrees of modularity, standard interface vehicles, and the use of plug and play payloads and buses.\n\nThe Air Force will continue to maintain ORS-1, launched 29 Jun 2011 to respond to U.S. Central Command's (USCENTCOM's) urgent need, validated by USSTRATCOM, to provide  intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) for theater warfighters.  The additional ORS Office efforts of maturing enabling elements will be descoped and the knowledge base will be transitioned as appropriate to other space programs including Global Positioning System, Advanced EHF Milsatcom, Space Based Infrared System, Space Control Technology, and the rest of the space architecture.\n\nORS projects provide a broad range of capabilities directly supporting warfighter needs. Potential missions include communications, data exfiltration; blue\/friendly-force situational awareness; maritime domain awareness; positioning, navigation, and timing; weather; and battlefield ISR.  The highest priorities of the ORS Office are the completion of the Modular Space Vehicle (MSV) Bus development, launch of the ORS-3 Enabler and ORS-4 Super Strypi missions, development of the $60M next generation ORS mission, and the low cost manufacturing initiative.  The remaining priorities for the ORS office are to satisfy the high priority needs for augmentation and reconstitution, such as Missile Warning, Wideband Protected Communication, Narrowband Communication, Space Situational Awareness, and Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) imagery.\n\nThe capabilities planned for Modular Payload mission kits were selected to systematically mature the ORS enabling elements to fully meet the USSTRATCOM specified responsiveness timelines and the 2007 NDAA cost targets. This includes the development of a modular open system architecture employing plug and play standards, such as a Rapid Response Space Works, a modular space vehicle (MSV) and integration with the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC).\n\nORS is working with the University of Hawaii's (U of H) Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory on the Super Strypi small launch vehicle to orbit the U of H's HiakaSat environmental monitoring satellite. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 04, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, because the efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes, and prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic environment."

Potential missions include communications, data exfiltration; blue\/friendly-force situational awareness; maritime domain awareness; positioning, navigation, and timing; weather; and battlefield ISR.  The highest priorities of the ORS Office are the completion of the Modular Space Vehicle (MSV) Bus development, launch of the ORS-3 Enabler and ORS-4 Super Strypi missions, development of the $60M next generation ORS mission, and the low cost manufacturing initiative.  The remaining priorities for the ORS office are to satisfy the high priority needs for augmentation and reconstitution, such as Missile Warning, Wideband Protected Communication, Narrowband Communication, Space Situational Awareness, and Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) imagery.\n\nThe capabilities planned for Modular Payload mission kits were selected to systematically mature the ORS enabling elements to fully meet the USSTRATCOM specified responsiveness timelines and the 2007 NDAA cost targets. This includes the development of a modular open system architecture employing plug and play standards, such as a Rapid Response Space Works, a modular space vehicle (MSV) and integration with the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC).\n\nORS is working with the University of Hawaii's (U of H) Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory on the Super Strypi small launch vehicle to orbit the U of H's HiakaSat environmental monitoring satellite. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 04, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, because the efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes, and prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic environment."
