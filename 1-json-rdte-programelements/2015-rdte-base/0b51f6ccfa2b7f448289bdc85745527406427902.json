Dual-frequency WGS satellites augment, then replace the DoD's Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) X-band service and augment one-way Global Broadcast Service Ka-band capabilities.  In addition, WGS provides a new high capacity two-way Ka-band service.\n\nAll WGS Block I (Satellites 1-3) and Block II (Satellites 4-6) have been launched and are operational.  With the operation of WGS-5, the constellation has global coverage and Full Operational Capability (FOC) in March 2014.  The FY15 Project 657107, WGS Space Systems Resiliency Upgrade, is a new start and will be an Acquisition Category III (ACAT III) effort.  The WGS resiliency upgrade will enable the WGS system to both locate and neutralize ground-based jamming threats.\n\nThe MILSATCOM Command and Control System-Consolidated (CCS-C) system provides integrated launch and on-orbit command and control (C2) functionality, and backup operations at Schriever AFB and Vandenberg AFB, for MILSATCOM satellites as the legacy capability provided by the Air Force Satellite Control Network (PE 0305110F) has phased out according to plan.  CCS-C uses modified commercial off the shelf hardware\/software to control emerging and legacy MILSATCOM systems including Milstar, DSCS, WGS and Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellites.  \n\nThe CCS-C project 657102 funds system architecture evolution to provide increased performance for additional satellites and to comply with DoD, Air Force, and AFSPC-directed standards for Information Assurance, Satellite Control Standardization, and Net-Readiness.  This continuing effort was previously funded in the FY14PB and prior as an ACAT II program.  With the 10 October 2013 FOC declaration, the program has transitioned to an ACAT III beginning FY2014.  The WGS and AEHF procurement program elements fund the mission unique software and databases for the WGS Block II Follow-On satellites and the AEHF 4-6 satellites, respectively.  \n\nBA-5 - This program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

This program was originally conceived to augment the near-term \"bandwidth gap\" in warfighter communications needs.  Dual-frequency WGS satellites augment, then replace the DoD's Defense Satellite Communications System X-band service and augment one-way Global Broadcast Service Ka-band capabilities.  In addition, WGS provides a high capacity two-way Ka-band service.\n\nAll WGS Block I (Satellites 1-3) and Block II (Satellites 4-6) have been launched and are operational.  With the operation of WGS-5, the constellation has global coverage and Full Operational Capability (FOC) in March 2014.  The FY15 Project 657107, WGS Space Systems Resiliency Upgrade, is a new start and will be an Acquisition Category III (ACAT III) effort.  The WGS resiliency upgrade will enable the WGS system to both locate and neutralize ground-based jamming threats."
