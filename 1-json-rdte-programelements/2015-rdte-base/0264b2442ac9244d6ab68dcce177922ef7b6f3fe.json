Target drones are essential for development testing\/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, F-15, etc., aircraft.

This program element funds development, improvements, and updates of full-scale\/subscale aerial targets and target control systems to ensure aerial targets represent enemy threat airborne systems.

The BQM-167A Air Force Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT) is a jet powered drone aircraft measuring approximately 20 feet long with a mission to simulate threat aircraft for testing and evaluation of surface-to-air, ship-to-air, or air-to-air missiles.  The target accomplishes this mission through the use of optional payloads including chaff and flare, electronic attack, and infrared devices.  Funding supports continued improvement of launch phase performance and overall performance enhancement efforts.  Funding supports development, improvements, and updates of target control systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements to include but not limited to missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. Electronic Attack (EA) pod upgrade provides new techniques and capabilities critical to subscales to realistically emulate foreign threat systems.  TCS provides a myriad of systems that together delivers the capability to control and track mission aerial targets (full scale and subscale) and to track a mix of other critical mission participants (to include relay platforms, shooters, and the missile system under test).  In this role, TCS ensures an optimum integrated aerial target environment that enhances both weapon system assessments and companion aircrew skills, all the while assuring the full safety of mission participants throughout the conduct and fulfillment of T&E objectives.  Funding supports continued improvement (modernization) of TCS capabilities to effectively meet the multi-service T&E demands of current and future warfighter weapon systems.\n\nThis program is in budget activity 7 - RDT&E Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

Aerial Targets support adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366, which requires major systems and munitions programs to conduct survivability and lethality testing before full-rate production.  The Aerial Targets program provides drones to satisfy \"Live Fire\/Lethality\" developmental\/operational test requirements.  Target drones are used to validate operational missile\/weapon system effectiveness and fighter operational flight program (OFP) updates.  Target drones are required for developmental\/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, F-15, etc., aircraft.   The United States Air Force's (USAF) Air Superiority Modernization\/Mission Area Plan has identified aerial targets as a capability shortfall; the QF-16 program will fulfill this requirement.  Funding supports continued development of the follow-on full-scale aerial target (QF-16) and simulators, development, improvements, and updates of target control systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements such as: missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems.  Electronic Attack (EA) pod upgrade provides new techniques and capabilities critical to QF-16s to realistically emulate foreign threat systems.\n\nThis program is in budget activity 7 - RDT&E Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.  It provides aerial targets, target payloads, and target control systems in support of operational and developmental testing."
