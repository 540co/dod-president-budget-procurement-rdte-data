            "val": "The mission of US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) is to establish and provide full-spectrum global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives, and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control Communications and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter.  This mission has been defined by the 2002 Unified Command Plan (UCP) changes 1 and 2.  To enable completion of these missions, USSTRATCOM is modernizing the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as Strategic War Planning System (SWPS)) and establishing a unified national architecture integrating disparate Missile Warning\/Missile Defense (MW\/MD) data into a single Internet Protocol (IP)-based system known as the Global Sensor Integrated Network (GSIN) to provide redundant and unambiguous MW\/MD data to national leadership.  When the ISPAN modernization is complete the system will support the warfighter in both deliberate and adaptive planning environments while allowing the National Command Authorities to employ the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons.  The ISPAN system will continue to evolve as weapon systems are matured, new systems are developed, and the threat changes, particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).   \n\nThe nation's strategic Command and Control (C2), sensors and other planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions, creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes.  GSIN establishes a unified national architecture integrating disparate MW\/MD systems into a single IP-based system that will provide redundant and unambiguous MW\/MD data to national leadership.  GSIN nets together all sensors, from tactical to strategic (including the Nation's most modern and capable assets) taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts.  GSIN will permit an IP-based User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) to augment voice conferencing and rapidly build a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time senior collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) and decision-making. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The planning system will continue to evolve as weapon systems are matured, new systems are developed, and the threat changes, particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).\n\nThe ISPAN modernization program includes initiation of Course of Action (COA) Development as a service to the DoD enterprise, workflow and decision support development, Combatant Commander (COCOM) Collaboration, User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP), conventional mission planning integration, and Mission Planning Analysis System (MPAS) maintenance and modernization. This includes software coding, integration of multiple internal and external planning applications, as well as developmental and early operational test activities. ISPAN also includes automated data processing equipment (ADPE), software, facilities support, manpower, and training to support the mission objectives of ISPAN, associated deployable and distributed data processing nodes, and subsidiary systems. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nISPAN Increment 2 developed the next increment of planning tools for ISPAN Collaborative Information Environment (CIE).  It built on capabilities delivered during Block 1 and developed advanced decision support capabilities for senior leader situational awareness through enhanced data analysis and visualization. ISPAN Increment 4 will modernize the Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS), that develops Joint Staff Level I through Level IV nuclear and conventional attack options for national and theater requirements.  Increment 4 will fulfill MPAS requirements by reducing Crisis Action Planning and Time Sensitive Planning timelines, integrating nuclear and conventional kinetic weapon capabilities with non-kinetic effects, providing the capability to integrate planning and analysis capabilities of future Global Strike weapons, updating the MPAS system to provide the ability to train users in significantly less time, and leveraging new technologies to lower sustainment costs.  ISPAN Inc 4 is an evolution of the Block 1 baseline system using proven technologies."

This mission has been defined by the 2002 Unified Command Plan (UCP) changes 1 and 2, the CJCS Plan ORD and the USSTRATCOM Plan ORD.  GSIN nets together selected systems and sensors, from tactical to strategic, including the Nation's most modern and capable assets, taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts.  GSIN will enable a User Defined Operating Picture (UDOP) to provide a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time senior collaboration for nuclear C2, improved senior leader situational awareness (SA), and decision-making.\n\nThe Nation's strategic C2, sensors and mission planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions, creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes.  GSIN establishes a unified schema integrating disparate Missile Warning\/Missile Defense (MW\/MD) data into a single exposed data set providing redundant and unambiguous MW\/MD data to national leadership.  GSIN enables existing sensors to provide data in net-centric formats consumable by other authorized systems and mission areas, thus reducing the need to acquire more sensors.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning."
