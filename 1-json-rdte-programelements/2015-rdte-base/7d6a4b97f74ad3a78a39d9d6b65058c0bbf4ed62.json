The program develops a corresponding susceptibility, vulnerability, and lethality database for directed energy weapons.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops and demonstrates technologies for existing system upgrades and\/or new system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs."
