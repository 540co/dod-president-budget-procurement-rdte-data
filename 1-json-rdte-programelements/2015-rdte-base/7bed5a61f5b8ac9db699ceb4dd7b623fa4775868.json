            "val": "On 15 March 2013, the Secretary of Defense announced steps to bolster protection of the homeland and stay ahead of long range ballistic missile threats.  These steps included adding Ground-Based Interceptors (GBI), restructuring the Standard Missile-3 Block IIB program and shifting resources to develop advanced kill vehicle technology to improve all ballistic missile defense interceptors that operate outside the earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe Agency is defining the concepts for the redesign of the Agency's Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicles (EKVs) with modular, open architecture and designed to common interfaces and standards, making upgrades easier and broadening our vendor and supplier base.  \n\nWith the recognition that the threat from our potential adversaries is growing in number and complexity, the Agency is taking a phased approach to common kill vehicle technology.  In Phase I, investments focus on mature technology and concept design to enable the replacement of EKVs in our current Ground-Based Interceptor force with a more capable, testable, reliable,  producible, scalable and cost effective kill vehicle.  \n\nPhase II evolves kill vehicle capabilities, relying on a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) architecture that balances performance across the sensor, Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) and kill vehicle elements, improving BMDS discrimination and potentially adding capability to destroy several objects within a threat complex with multiple kill vehicles.  The Agency anticipates deploying these capabilities across the interceptor fleet in the next decade to address the evolving threat.  In FY 2015, we will focus on maturing key technology and defining the system architecture necessary for the acquisition of multi-object kill vehicles."

In addition, includes Global Deployment personnel and support performing deployment site preparation and activation. Other costs included provide facility capabilities for MDA Executing Agent locations, such as physical and technical security, legal services, travel and agency training, office and equipment leases, utilities, data and unified communications support, supplies and maintenance, materiel and readiness and central property management of equipment, and similar operating expenses. Also includes legal settlements. In keeping with congressional intent, Program Wide Support is allocated on a pro-rata basis and therefore, fluctuates by year based on the total MDA budget."
