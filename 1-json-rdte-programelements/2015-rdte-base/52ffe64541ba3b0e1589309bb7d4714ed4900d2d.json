The Logistics R&D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that will provide a significantly higher level of support at lower costs, than would be otherwise attainable.  The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits.  One example is the Department of Defense (DOD) Electronic MALL (EMALL).  DOD EMALL was the first web based, distributed architecture on-line ordering capability.  It has been adopted by the Army, Navy and the Department of Homeland Security.  DLA\u2019s overall Log R&D program has demonstrated positive net present value and a positive return on investment."

The Medical On-line Business Analytics capability will be delayed depriving DLA of the ability to properly plan and monitor orders to critical medical customers.  The Supply Chain management project reductions means additional anti-counterfeiting technology will not be fully developed and implemented, increasing the risk that counterfeit parts will enter the DOD supply system. In addition, emerging additive manufacturing technology will not be available for low volume parts.  The Strategic Distribution and Reutilization reductions mean that DLA support to the COCOM\u2019s deployments will be more costly because they will not be able to access regional suppliers through the IBEX2 system.  Reductions to the Energy readiness program mean cost increases to the Services for fuel because fewer alternative fuel additives will be available.  Finally, the reductions to the Defense Logistics Information project means DLA will not be capable of taking advantage of major advancements in Computer Aided Design\/Computer Aided Manufacturing."

Plans include completing data collection and web design for three additional MILSPEC tents, complete modifications, and develop web-based training capability.  \n\nExtension of Supply Chain Simulation project:  This represents additional tasking for an existing project.
