As the DoD CDL Executive Agent (EA), the Air Force is responsible for cross-service application of CDL RDT&E Military Intelligence Program (MIP) funds facilitating compliance to Congressional and DoD mandates. The EA develops, modifies, distributes, and maintains specifications for the CDL waveform family; ensuring design configuration control, commonality, and interoperability among ISR platforms. Additionally, funds support managing resources allocated for development, maturation, and migration of CDL technologies. \n\nCDL enables compliance with OSD and Congressional mandates to effectively utilize spectrum, use approved cryptographic equipment, and provide direct support to current operations.  CDL is a vital link in DoD's existing and emerging communication architectures, providing flexibility to accommodate Command and Control (C2) data and myriad types of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), and Full-Motion Video (FMV) data.  The CDL specifications permit current and future ISR asset operations worldwide by providing sensor data directly via point-to-point broadcast to ground sites, airborne platforms and dismounted users.  Also, CDL provides the capability to relay data via air-to-air or compatible satellite links when the asset and ground site are not in line-of-sight. \n\nCDL's research and development activities support a broad swath of tactical, operational, and strategic ISR users and include achieving higher data rates, multi-access and multi-node network management, crypto modernization, advancements needed to operate in contested environments, terminal and antenna design enhancements, operations in other spectral bands, and improving spectrum efficiency.  Further, CDL development improves large area surveillance missions while supporting continuous improvements and implementation of line-of-sight platform and CDL terminal Command and Control (C2), plus increased ISR (C2ISR) capabilities.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support current and future requirements documentation, program planning and execution. CDL prototype terminal designs provide for future technology insertion and reduce non-recurring engineering and life-cycle costs to the user. \n\nIn addition, the Gigabit Encryption thrust enables CDL to develop a miniaturized gigabit rate Communication Security (COMSEC) device capable of managing CDL data.  The miniaturized COMSEC device will allow faster throughput while reducing Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Further, CDL development improves large area surveillance missions while supporting continuous improvements and implementation of line-of-sight platform and CDL terminal Command and Control (C2), plus increased ISR (C2ISR) capabilities.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support current and future requirements documentation, program planning and execution. CDL prototype terminal designs provide for future technology insertion and reduce non-recurring engineering and life-cycle costs to the user. \n\nIn addition, the Gigabit Encryption thrust enables CDL to develop a miniaturized gigabit rate Communication Security (COMSEC) device capable of managing CDL data.  The miniaturized COMSEC device will allow faster throughput while reducing Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
