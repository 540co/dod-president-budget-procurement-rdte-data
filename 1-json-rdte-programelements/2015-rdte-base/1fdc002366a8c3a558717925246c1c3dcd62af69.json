            "val": "The Advanced Combat System Technology line is to evolve the technical and business practices for programs to change to an open architecture construct. The program was constructed to mature both technical and business model integration for C5I systems programs of record in an open architecture environment. The priority was incorporating the principles of modular design and design disclosure, reusable application software, interoperability and secure information exchange, lifecycle affordability and encouraging competition and collaboration.\n\nProject Unit 0324: Funding is to maintain and update an information exchange environment to improve transparency of design disclosure and information exchange on past and current investments to support the principle of cross-program reuse, and to provide the tools and leadership for assisting programs through the transition to Naval Open Architecture (OA).  The other elements of the OA transformation effort are being realized as management efficiencies within programs.  Those elements include ensuring that all naval systems, families of systems, and programs move to modular OA in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.1 dated 12 May 2003 which mandates that all DoD programs utilize open systems architectures to rapidly field affordable and interoperable systems.  By direction of the Navy Service Acquisition Executive (SAE), PEO IWS was assigned overall responsibility and authority to direct the Navy's OA effort until that duty transferred to DASN (RDTE) in 2011. The Core OA funding line has remained with PEO IWS.  That policy established a need to coordinate acquisition strategies, develop guidance and tools, and develop analysis of alternatives to determine OA software reuse practices within and across the Navy Communities of Interest (COI - Surface, Subsurface, Air, Space, C4I, USMC, and ONR).  This project facilitates a strategic shift in the acquisition business process to facilitate cooperative competition in cross-domain\/COI business relationships.  This improves innovation and economies of scale throughout the Navy and Marine Corps.  This leadership effort has identified the business case and potential return on investment for moving the Navy towards an open systems approach, supported the development of open systems technologies, and integrated best business and technical practices for open systems development within Naval acquisition.  Naval OA ensures Navy-wide system architectures become extensible and scalable in function, capacity, and workload to meet Joint warfighting requirements.  This also includes the identification and development of common software components, functions, reuse methodologies, and extensible product lines.  In summary, this funding supports the management of a reuse repository and reuse information exchange portal, and the evolving business, systems engineering, and cultural changes required across all Naval programs as they migrate to function in a Joint, net-centric warfare environment."

The strategy was further refined in the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (DCNO) requirement of 23 December 2005 (N6\/7) with guidance for this effort to assist the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), program managers, and resource sponsors in assessing enterprise program assets where appropriate. Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) has directed this program to provide objective, measurable, performance based assessments as Business Case Analysis (BCA) baselines for future system changes and spiral developments."
