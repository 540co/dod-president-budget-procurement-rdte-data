            "val": "Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR): (Note: Beginning in FY15, this effort will transfer to PE 0604522N) The AMDR suite is being developed to fulfill Integrated Air and Missile Defense requirements for multiple ship classes. This suite consists of an S-Band radar (AMDR-S), an X-band radar and a Radar Suite Controller (RSC).  Funding will develop AMDR-S and RSC, and integrate these components with an available X band radar.  AMDR will provide multi-mission capabilities, simultaneously supporting both long range, exoatmospheric detection, tracking and discrimination of ballistic missiles, as well as Area and Self Defense against air and surface threats. For the Ballistic Missile Defense capability, increased radar sensitivity and bandwidth over current radar systems are needed to detect, track and support engagements of advanced ballistic missile threats at the required ranges, concurrent with Area and Self Defense against Air and Surface threats. For the Area Air Defense and Self Defense capability, increased sensitivity and clutter capability is needed to detect, react to, and engage stressing Very Low Observable\/Very Low Flyer (VLO\/VLF) threats in the presence of heavy land, sea, and rain clutter. This effort provides for the development of an active phased array radar with the required capabilities to address the evolving threat. The AMDR suite will obtain performance and technology enhancements throughout its service life based upon an approach that includes modularity of hardware and software, a scalable design and Open Architecture (OA) compliance.\n\nPeriscope Detection:  The CVN Periscope Detection Radar program, AN\/SPS-74(V), develops and delivers the capability which provides automated detection and discrimination of submarine periscopes using advanced algorithms.  This enables discrimination of periscopes from surface contacts, buoys, small boats, floating mines, etc.  This effort was initially based on an Advanced Development Model (ADM), developed in PE 0603553N, Surface Antisubmarine Warfare.  VCNO Memorandum Ser N09\/12U100544 dtd 17 Dec, 2012 directs cancellation of the AN\/SPS-74 Program.  FY12 and FY13 funding developed the Periscope Detection and Discrimination (PDD) interface for the AN\/SPQ-9B Radar. FY13 funding also developed a Land Based Test Asset to demonstrate new solid state technology that lowers the required power and removes the highest failing components, improving system reliability and stability while greatly reducing the production life and life costs.\n\nDual Band Radar (DBR) Upgrades: Funding is for Dual Band Radar (DBR) System upgrades to implement cost savings initiatives for Volume Search Radar (VSR) modifications, supportability analysis and associated logistics product updates; future upgrades\/technology insertion efforts for Multi-Function Radar (MFR)\/VSR as a part of the DBR suite on CVN 78 Class ships and the MFR on DDG 1000 Class ships.  Funding is also required to resolve the hardware and software issues discovered during the various test events to include: DTB2-411, Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) testing, Land Based Testing and pertinent At-Sea test events. The upgrades will include all aspects of the radar system\/subsystems, including hardware and software. Specific subsystem areas include the Array, Transmit\/Receive (T\/R) module, Receiver\/Exciter, Signal Data Processor, Radome, and power\/cooling systems. Upgrades and technology insertions are required to maintain the level of force protection needed for ship defense against all threats envisioned in the littoral environment.  The supportability analysis and logistic products associated with these upgrades will also be developed and updated. DBR Battle Force Tactical Trainer (BFTT)\/Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC)\/Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) Interface:  FY12-14 requirement supports the design and development of the software interface between DBR and AN\/USQ-46 BFTT, CEC and SEWIP to enhance CVN 78 combat readiness.  DBR CVN 78 Testing and Certification: FY13-FY17 requirement supports DBR At-Sea Test and Evaluation (T&E), Environmental Testing and DBR Systems Certification for CVN 78. \n\nMulti-Mission Signal Processor (MMSP): The development of Multi-Mission Signal Processor (MMSP) provides Anti-Air Warfare (AAW)\/Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Multi-mission capability for DDG 51 class ships as part of Aegis Modernization Program.  This capability will be utilized for DDG 113 and follow new construction and Aegis Ashore.  Modifies SPY-1D Transmitters to enable dual beam for reduced frame times and better reaction time, and provides stability for all D (V) waveforms and avoid operational degradation.  The SPY-1 radar system detects, tracks and supports engagements of a broader range of threats.  MMSP improves performance in littoral, ducted clutter environments, and in electronic attack (EA), and chaff environments and provides greater commonality in computer programs and equipment. This effort also provides for the development of a Solid State Switch Assembly (SSSA) through an ONR\/MANTECH project, MMSP Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) refresh, radar capability upgrades, reliability improvements, and ship-based Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR).\n\nAdvanced Radar Technology (ART):  Funds the development and integration of existing and new radar technologies into the Navy's sensors to enhance performance and\/or ensure sensor operations and sustainment throughout the lifecycle of the sensor and platforms on which installed.\n\nImproved Capabilities for SPY-1 Radar: These Reliability, Maintainability, and Availability (RM&A) improvements are intended to reduce cascading failures, mitigate obsolescence issues, and improve reliability in support of Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) and Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) missions; while still providing AN\/SPY-1 Radar Total Ownership Cost Reductions.  Improvements will yield reductions in annual fleet maintenance costs.\n\nAdvanced Radar Innovation Fund\/Advanced Radar Research: Funds the development and integration of existing and new technologies into the Navy's sensors to enhance performance and ensure sensor operations and sustainment throughout the lifecycle of the sensor and platforms on which installed."

This suite consists of an S-Band radar (AMDR-S), an X-band radar and a Radar Suite Controller (RSC).  Funding will develop AMDR-S and RSC, and integrate these components with an available X band radar. AMDR will provide multi-mission capabilities, simultaneously supporting both long range, exoatmospheric detection, tracking and discrimination of ballistic missiles, as well as Area and Self Defense against air and surface threats. For the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capability, increased radar sensitivity and bandwidth over current radar systems are needed to detect, track and support engagements of advanced ballistic missile threats at the required ranges, concurrent with Area and Self Defense against Air and Surface threats. For the Area Air Defense and Self Defense capability, increased sensitivity and clutter capability is needed to detect, react to, and engage stressing Very Low Observable\/Very Low Flyer (VLO\/VLF) threats in the presence of heavy land, sea, and rain clutter. This effort provides for the development of an active phased array radar with the required capabilities to address the evolving threat. The AMDR suite will obtain performance and technology enhancements throughout its service life based upon an approach that includes modularity of hardware and software, a scalable design and Open Architecture (OA) compliance."

This enables discrimination of periscopes from surface contacts, buoys, small boats, floating mines, etc.  This effort was initially based on an Advanced Development Model (ADM), developed in PE 0603553N, Surface Antisubmarine Warfare.  VCNO Memorandum Ser N09\/12U100544 dtd 17 Dec, 2012 directs cancellation of the AN\/SPS-74 Program.  FY12 and FY13 funding developed the Periscope Detection and Discrimination (PDD) interface for the AN\/SPQ-9B Radar. FY13 funding also developed a Land Based Test Asset to demonstrate new solid state technology that lowers the required power and removes the highest failing components, improving system reliability and stability while greatly reducing the production life and life costs."

Modifies SPY-1D Transmitters to enable dual beam for reduced frame times and better reaction time, and provides stability for all D (V) waveforms and avoid operational degradation.  The SPY-1 radar system detects, tracks and supports engagements of a broader range of threats.  MMSP improves performance in littoral, ducted clutter environments, and in electronic attack (EA), and chaff environments and provides greater commonality in computer programs and equipment. This effort also provides for the development of a Solid State Switch Assembly (SSSA) through an ONR\/MANTECH project, MMSP Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) refresh, radar capability upgrades, reliability improvements, and ship-based Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR)."
