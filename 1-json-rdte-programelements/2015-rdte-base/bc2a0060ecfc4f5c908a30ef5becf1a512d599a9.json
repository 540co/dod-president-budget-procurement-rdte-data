            "val": "The Command and Control Constellation (C2C) is the sole Air Force program for defining, developing, and assessing integrated effects of global, theater and tactical level Air Force air, space, and cyber command and control (C2) capabilities in support of the joint warfighter. The Air Force faces a complex future where conflict will range across a broad spectrum of operations and lethality. The Air Force requires capabilities with the maximum possible flexibility to deal with the widest possible range of conflict. The C2C is the enabling program element for C2 Integration\/Modernization. The Air Force is working to establish a C2 framework and architecture to be used as a unifying vision of command and control for each of the services core functions. C2C will support the defense strategy through: integration of air, space cyber and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) C2, through architectural analysis, prototyping, experimentation and innovation to develop cross-cutting solutions, and enable an improved \"sense-to-kill\" cycle time. C2C innovations and experimentation provide strategic, operational, and tactical direction for Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions to facilitate an integrated mission environment that supports C2 planning and execution for air, space, and cyberspace. In-depth development and analyses of C2 operational, systems, and technical architectures are geared towards identifying capability gaps, identifying required \"to be\" information services, and evaluating C2 program planned improvements. Through prototyping and experimentation, C2C integrates rapidly developing technologies to promote common standards, data sharing, and information services across Air Force and joint warfighting applications to support joint enterprise solutions.\n\nProject 675078, Horizontal Integration (HI) conducts DOTMLPF analyses and assessments to guide cross-cutting, C2 sub-enterprise and cyberspace investment decisions that integrate USAF capabilities into joint and coalition operations. HI identifies, prioritizes, and develops requirements and horizontally integrated solution recommendations to ensure the latest technologies and information services are integrated into a cross cutting C2 system that enables integrated effects in all warfighter domains. The HI strategy will be validated by Headquarters, Air Force (HAF) to ensure that initiatives are harmonized with the most urgent warfighter needs described by the C2 Capability Assessment Team (CAT) and C2 Core Function Master Plan (CFMP) and supporting the 2012 Air Force, Joint and Defense Strategies and Operational Concepts. Once validated, HI funds are applied toward identifying the most critical warfighter capabilities and ensuring they are horizontally integrated into both Air Force and joint C2 programs of record.\n\nProject 675140, Joint Expeditionary Force Experiments (JEFX) are agile and frequent innovation-focused experiments which lead to pre-fielded operational and technical assessments. Constructive, live and virtual, operationally representative warfighter environments are created to support integration challenges which focus on critical C2 areas of interest that support the joint warfighter; including, C2 of ISR innovation that supports the air, space, and cyberspace domains. JEFX provides the infrastructure and integration initiatives for experimentation with emerging operational concepts and attendant new technologies that fill operational gaps in Air Force capabilities to meet emerging and rapidly changing real world threats. The JEFX strategy is validated and supported by the Commander, Air Combat Command (COMACC) and coordinated with Headquarters, Air Force (HAF) ensuring initiatives are harmonized with the most urgent warfighter needs and validated requirements described in the AF Core Function Master Plans (CFMP) and supported through MAJCOM Core function Lead Integrator (CFLI). JEFX initiatives are based on emerging CONOPS and warfighter challenges, important enablers of innovation and transformation, which are designed to support the themes and demonstrate emerging Air Force capabilities to deploy and employ decisive air, space and cyberspace power in support of the Joint Force. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or have approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

HI activities include:  requirements, architecture, systems engineering, technology development, risk reduction, prototyping, and transition. These activities are required to:  identify, design, develop, experiment, and implement C2 solutions supporting operational requirements for warfighting integration and interoperability needs which are not the sole responsibility of a specific program of record.\n\nThe nature of integrated and interoperable C2 warfighting capabilities spans multiple platforms and domains. These capabilities are routinely being adjusted to meet the changing requirements from the warfighting communities. The HI project is uniquely designed to look across platforms and domains enabling the Air Force to respond to operator needs across the seams of individual systems. These horizontal integration initiatives will be prototyped, assessed, appropriately captured in requirements documents and then transitioned to programs of record for production, fielding and sustainment.\n\nSystems Engineering and analysis is the 'glue' that holds command and control constellation (C2C) elements together and closes the seams in the C2 architectures. Capability analysis identifies areas where interoperability can be improved within the Air Force, as well as among joint services, and coalition partners. Once capability issues are identified, they are prioritized and pilot initiatives are developed to provide solutions to the warfighter challenges to resolve the capability gaps. The HI project also helps to competitively prototype integrated solutions against validated program requirements.\n\nThe benefits of these activities are two-fold:  the operational community is able to weigh the cost, risk, and performance trade-offs between enterprise solutions versus program centric solutions, and it supports competitive prototyping of all acquisition programs.  The synchronization of HI prototyping and program milestone requirements offers an effective environment for increasing interoperability while reducing the impact of this policy on multiple programs.  An infrastructure environment manages a continuous distributed operational environment that supports air, space, and cyberspace C2 and rapid acquisition, prototyping, development, integration, and fielding. C2 initiatives may use this infrastructure to mature their development status prior to entry into operational and technical suitability assessment.\n\nThe HI prototype performances are assessed for operational utility, and the most promising initiatives\/technologies will be matured and transitioned into weapon system configuration control baselines. Requirement documents will be published and revised, and a requirements database and implementation plan identifying the most significant C2C net-centric integration issues will be updated to catalog the activities necessary to accomplish this integration.\n\nIn addition, this project supports concept exploration, program definition\/risk reduction efforts, and studies that support continuous improvements in C2. Guided by the MAJCOM-validated C2 capability gaps developed by the HI Capability Assessment Team annual process and the defense strategy to meet the evolving Anti-Access\/Area Denial (A2\/AD) threats to air, space and cyber C2 operations, these improvements include but are not limited to:  integration of airspace and cross-domain synchronized operations, C2 of integrated air and missile defense, C2 of Air Force Forces and agile combat support, dynamic aerial network capabilities, and Non-Traditional ISR (NTISR), from 4th and 5th generation aircraft through processing and assessment, and interoperability with joint service, allied and coalition systems, C2 of personnel recovery, and air-sea battle. Activities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning."

JEFX provides continued integration and experimentation efforts across the AF C2 seams and programs in air, space and cyber domains as defined by CORONA, HQ AF, and the AF Command and Control Integration Center (AFC2IC).\n\nJEFX\/LOE activities explore significant capability gaps across the range of Air Force command and control (C2) by means of assessing Concept of Operations (CONOPS), tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and materiel solutions. The activities address critical lessons learned from recent operations and the validated requirements described in the 2012 Air Force, Joint and Defense Strategies and Operational Concepts, the AF Core Function Master Plans (CFMP) and supported through MAJCOM Core Function Lead Integrator (CFLI). JEFX creates or leverages operationally representative-experiment enterprise warfighter environments to address joint and coalition warfighter gaps and shortfalls that demonstrate existing and emerging Air Force capabilities to deploy and employ decisive air, space and cyberspace power for the joint force commander and enable innovation and transformation. These unique missions are the major reason JEFX is an experiment and not simply a demonstration or exercise. Activities also include studies and analyses to support current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning."
