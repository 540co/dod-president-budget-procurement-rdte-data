The aircraft integration program maintains compatibility\/performance of the missile with changes occurring on the F\/A-18E\/F, F-15C\/D\/E, F-16, F-22A, and F-18 C\/D platforms.  To keep the existing inventory as effective as possible, the Air Force and Navy also develop, test, and field improvements that are implemented via software upgrades reprogrammed into fielded AMRAAMs, and\/or hardware upgrades inserted into production units.  AMRAAM is a joint Air Force\/Navy, Acquisition Category IC (ACAT IC) program with Air Force as lead service. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7-Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Additional SIP increments are in the planning phase and will further improve the AIM-120D to meet emerging warfighter requirements.\n\nThe Electronic Protection Improvement Program (EPIP) is also underway, with the initial capabilities currently in flight testing.  EPIP Basic capabilities will field in FY14.  The EPIP effort will keep AIM-120C missiles capable against the growing electronic attack threat environment.
