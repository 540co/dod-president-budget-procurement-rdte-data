The overall program mission is to enable defense components ability to effectively plan, integrate, execute and assess OPSEC in concert with other information-related capabilities used against adversaries or potential adversaries.  Funds support the development and integration of capabilities and next generation technologies for department OPSEC activities. \n\nThe objectives of the overall DOSI program are:\n\n1. Establish governance structures, processes and procedures for development and oversight of infrastructure, policy, authorities, and warfighter advocacy across the defense components and for OPSEC intelligence integration that will focus on the incorporation of special intelligence requirements; intelligence and threat repository support; Open Source Intelligence, Human Intelligence, Counterintelligence (CI) and Signals Intelligence support; and intelligence support to Deception in Support of OPSEC (DISO).\n2. Develop a concept for integrating OPSEC into critical plans, operations and activities that will clearly articulate OPSEC requirements and the means for fulfilling them.\n3. Develop an integrated OPSEC education, training and exercise program that can be incorporated with MILDEC and other information-related capabilities and focus on exercise support and formal education curricula review and development.\n4. Develop a technology and capability research, development, testing, and evaluation program to identify emerging physical, technical, and administrative means and capabilities.\n5. Enhance the integration and synchronization of OPSEC with MILDEC to increase effectiveness and efficiency of defense component activities. \n6. Increase the integration of OPSEC with other information-related capabilities such as Electronic Warfare (EW), Computer Network Operations (CNO), Intelligence, CI, Security, and Special Technical Operations (STO) to form an enhanced integrated whole.\n7. Establish assessment programs to assess friendly and adversary measures and countermeasures based on observable actions, indicators, or information that can provide a basis for identifying such control measures as Action Controls, Countermeasures, and Counter Analysis and for assessing revised policy, doctrine, force structure, training and governance processes to identify corrective actions."
