The Special Operations Forces (SOF) mission mandates that SOF vehicles remain technologically superior, operate in multiple environments and be able to meet any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability.  The current family of SOF tactical vehicles include: individual mobility vehicles, light mobility vehicles, medium mobility vehicles, non-standard commercial vehicles, and heavy mobility vehicles.     \n\n  \u2022  Family of Special Operations Vehicles (FSOV).  This initiative provides for product improvements in the areas of suspension, power management, armor protection and unique vehicle design for all SOF tactical vehicle configurations.  Designs must be standardized across all SOF Components that utilize a tactical vehicle.   Improvements include, but are not limited to, new engineering change proposals (ECPs), field safety issues and theater endorsed requirements that make it essential to keep up with the increased weight and minimize the impact to mobility on the basic vehicle.  FSOV develops, integrates and tests Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR)  systems in order to reduce space and power claim on vehicles and develop safety and engineering improvements that specifically address the enemy\u2019s changing tactics on the battlefield which typically focuses on survivability, force protection, or mobility.  Specific efforts include but are not limited to:   Medium Mobility Vehicle Version 1.1 effort which provides for a medium vehicle variant capable of meeting specific requirements of internal aircraft transport on the C\/MH47.  The effort also provides for engineering costs related to performance, endurance, safety testing, integration and logistical analysis of product samples. Additionally, efforts include ECPs associated with the Non-Standard Commercial Vehicle (NSCV) and the Light Tactical Vehicle.  These ECPs will address any identified safety, reliability, and performance concerns.  Finally, funding will be used to support vehicle signature reduction efforts.  The Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicle Kit.  Effort provides design, prototyping, testing and installation manual development of SOF peculiar integration kits for multiple models of Service-common MRAPs employed by SOF.  Kits will enable SOF unique C4ISR installation and Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station integration to service-common MRAPs."
