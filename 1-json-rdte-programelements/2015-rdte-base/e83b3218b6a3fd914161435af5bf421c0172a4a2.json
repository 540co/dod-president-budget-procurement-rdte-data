            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nAll Navy advanced technology development in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking and neutralization is funded through this PE.  The related technologies being developed are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the three core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  The focus is on leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship and air ASW assets.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Specific improvements are classified.\n- Extending deep water active distributed system lifetime to a few months with a probability of detection (Pd) of 90% within 4 hours (field configuration) or 90% per crossing (barrier configuration), with a False Alarm Rate (FAR) of no more than 4\/day.\n- Delivery from a Vertical Takeoff Unmanned Air Vehicle (VTUAV) and\/or a long-range, high-speed Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) a compact undersea weapon capable of a high Probability of Kill (PK) given precise target localization.\n- Detection and localization performance with a single-line vector sensor array nominally equivalent or superior to that of two coherently processed TB-29A arrays. Acquisition costs to be competitive with the cost of a current TB-29A and at least 30% less than the cost of two arrays. Sensor and telemetry packaging will be adequate to achieve neutral buoyancy in an existing TB-29A form factor with array power efficiency greater than 75%.
