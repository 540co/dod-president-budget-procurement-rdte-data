This effort was designated as an ACAT III program and funding was realigned (i.e., a separate project was created) to delineate between the current ACAT I GBS program and the ACAT III SBM Transition program.  \n\nThis effort continues SBM transition\/upgrade to the DISA DECCs, as well as systems transmission security, test, information assurance, program office support and Operational Requirements Document (ORD) III studies. RDT&E Funding for this effort ended in FY13.  No funding in FY15 is requested.\n\nFunding is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, since program is fielding pre-production equipment."
