The project directly provides for the United States contribution to the IMS and addresses Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) monitoring requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD AT&L).  This project conforms to the administration\u2019s research and development priorities as related to WMD arms control and disablement.  Technical assessments are made to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs and provide the data required to inform compliance assessments, and support US monitoring policy- and decision-makers and negotiation teams.  Technology developments and system improvements are conducted to ensure the availability of these CTBT monitoring capabilities.  \n\nPrimary program emphasis is on improving sensors sustainability, operational availability, and detection capabilities against a wide range of nuclear test phenomena and associated threat origins.  The program includes development, fielding, and sustainment of specialized monitoring and analysis equipment and capabilities, procedures, persistent monitoring and associated monitoring data in direct support to the IMS and CTBT requirements.  NACT also directly supports US and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital monitoring data that are extensively used by warfighter planners, Department of Defense (DoD) and other U.S. government agencies, and international agencies.  This project directly supports the warfighting capability area of combatting WMD.\n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the transfer of the NACT program to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).  The NACT program transferred from the United States Army Space Missile Development Command (SMDC) to DTRA in FY 2014."

Conduct signal capture and identification studies to reduce signal clutter, false alarms, and improve noise rejection methods and algorithms.\n- Continue planning to evaluate options for performing experiments or demonstrations to evaluate system performance to monitor a planned underground or underwater detonation.  The detonation will be non-nuclear in nature but configured to simulate the release of suitable surrogate nuclear testing signatures.  All associated signatures will be acceptable to environmental and health regulations and of a nature suitable to challenge IMS monitoring technologies.\n- Continue radio-xenon gas detection system development and research.  Study and evaluate atmospheric and subsurface xenon backgrounds and transport phenomenon.  \n- Continue a study of baseline noble gas detection schemes and select the pathway for future radio-xenon detection options providing enhanced detection and operational capabilities and reliability.  This study is paying close attention to timeline and feasibility of implementation alternatives.\n- Continue infrasound information system enhancements and development of infrasound propagation models to improve detection, identification, and discrimination of sources and signatures of interest.\n-  Continue field experiments to collect data required to constrain and validate models.  Models will include fine-scale atmospheric conditions, topography, 3-D winds and effects of non-linear propagation.\n-  Continue to develop a portable\/rapid deployable infrasound array and standard sound source for calibrating infrasound stations\/arrays.  \n- Continue on-location infrasound event calibration and metrology research at established engineering and development test centers (EDTC), continue development of EDTCs to support research, testing, and evaluation relevant to station shutdowns, configuration changes, and invasive procedures, and  use EDTCs to perform primary evaluations of prototype monitoring arrays and related new technologies and all associated field testing.   \n- Continue R&D on support system to collect and prioritize station operator requirements to inform required design-build-test activities across the monitoring system.  Focus areas continue to be improvements to radionuclide detector cooling and functionality, filtration medium and sample head, and electronic controls.\n- Continue U.S. IMS sensor event signal identification technique research and development of the transportable xenon laboratory (TXL) and associated xenon detection system and prepare for international deployment exercises and demonstrations.  Operations and maintenance performed in advance of the TXL foreign deployment will establish an operations baseline for this xenon monitoring capability and provide unique opportunities to diagnose and resolve remaining operational and technical concerns and issues, including investigating the \u201cmemory effect\u201d recently encountered in these systems as a result of the unintended radio-xenon releases from the Fukushima reactors.  Also planned is a continuation of infrasound event clutter and false alarm reduction, and noise mitigation analyses.  \n- Continue to drive improvements in radionuclide detection and measurement, including xenon gas collection\/analysis systems research.  Evaluate detection limits, and yields.  The PTS technical requirements dictate that the US radionuclide laboratory (RL-16) gas system requires additional capability to meet required detection thresholds.  Develop test methods to increase xenon gas yields, improve detection efficiencies, and decrease dead volume.  To ensure RL-16 is making a high precision measurement, analysis samples will be peer reviewed and calibrated at certified laboratories.\n- Continue to develop a robust, high-precision method to calibrate nuclear detectors and calibration methods to obtain the absolute calibration of the system\u2019s nuclear detector."

Under Project RL, the Net-Centric Architecture program integrates legacy capabilities and facilitates data sharing through a net-centric framework. It provides near-real time collaborative analysis capabilities between Department of Defense (DoD) and key interagency and international partners through a globally accessible net-centric framework known as the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset (IWMDT).  The IWMDT migrates Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high explosive (CBRNE) modeling and simulation codes to provide an integrated suite of Countering WMD decision support capabilities. The framework is the only operational CBRNE framework in the world which provides capabilities through web applications, net-centric web services, and stand-alone mobile deployments which are validated and accredited for operational use by International, National, State, and local authorities.  \n\nThe Net-Centric Architecture program includes three functional areas: 1) IWMDT, 2) IWMDT Codes, and 3) Software Assurance, Certification, and Accreditation.  The IWMDT functional area develops the architecture, defines and implements the standards to consolidate validated DTRA tools, and through this architecture, enables rapid access for planning, emergency response, and assessment capabilities.  These capabilities are used by a wide range of planners, managers, and operational and technical personnel facing the full spectrum of CBRNE threats.  The IWMDT Codes functional area develops analysis and simulation codes, and then integrates the codes into the IWMDT architecture. These activities are unique to this effort across the DoD. They directly support analysis capabilities in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Studies and Analysis Group, and Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (OSD CAPE), US Pacific Command and United States Forces Korea (USFK) offices, Republic of Korea (ROK) Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Defense Taiwan, as well as providing unique simulation capabilities to the Air Force Distributed Mission Operation Center.  The Software Assurance, Certification and Accreditation functional area supports all aspects of DTRA software development and fielding.  This sub-project extends research and development to system development and demonstration. \n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to increased investment for fielding of IWMDT in FY 2014.  The decrease in FY 2015 is due to the completion of IWMDT investments based on Agency priorities."
