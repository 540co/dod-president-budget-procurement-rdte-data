The funds in this PE are distributed among all Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (ASE) projects based on the development priorities established by the USAF SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG) in order to build a total SIGINT capability.  As a result, the USAF will move funds between projects periodically to develop the highest priority projects in response to urgent warfighter needs.  This PE will participate in the development, integration, testing, and implementation of international and Air Force standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.  Modernization efforts include sensors for the platforms and their appropriate interfaces with the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS).  This approach supports a synergistic development effort providing a true Air Force-wide capability.  \n\n(U) This enterprise will use the Air Force Cryptologic Architecture (AFCA) for planning and decision-making and, in turn, employ open architecture standards whenever possible to allow maximum ease of future upgrades and system interoperability.  The primary goal of the ASE is to produce an architecture-based, capability-focused SIGINT investment strategy for the USAF.  Funds in any project may be used to fund initiatives in other projects within this PE at the discretion of the SCWG.  Funds in any project can also cover activities to include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. \n\n(U) This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The project also identifies suitable replacements for components affected by Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS).  This project provides the warfighter with a near-term, increased combat capability. Enhancements are implemented as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Capability improvements will be inserted into the sensors through individual development efforts that exploit signals of interest identified as service priorities by the Air Force SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG).

This RDT&E effort integrates SIGINT capability on medium altitude platforms as required. The sensors will be capable of collecting technical data and geolocating signals of interest and providing sensor data to a workstation.  The design effort will include the use of existing sensor suites to the maximum extent possible to minimize design costs and reduce development timelines.  \n\n(U) Design efforts specific to medium altitude systems may include, but not be limited to, antennas, electromagnetic interference reduction, encryption techniques, and changes to the aircraft, ground station, data link, and simulator necessary to accommodate a SIGINT payload and its data throughput.  Funding will support efforts to develop antennas, receivers, processors, software development, aircraft integration and ground station upgrades to allow a persistent reconnaissance, surveillance, targeting, and acquisition capability against mission specific threats.  Development of a networked capability for medium altitude systems will also be initiated.   These upgrades are designed to exploit signals of interest identified as service priorities by the Air Force SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG). These development activities will continue through future years, to include but not be limited to, integrating capabilities developed under separate efforts.  \n\n(U) This project provides the warfighter with near term increased combat capability.  Enhancements are implemented as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels and exploit signals of interest identified as Service priorities by the AF SCWG."

The common development SIGINT project also supports development of new sensors capabilities, normalization of quick reaction capabilities, and identifies suitable replacements for components affected by Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS).  New capabilities are developed by separate projects. This project also supports the development of projects common to the Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (ASE) Program Element (PE) overall to include, but not limited to: the Air Force Cryptologic Architecture (AFCA) maintenance, modeling and simulation efforts, and NATO SIGINT efforts.\n\n(U) Sensors development supports scalable Airborne Signals Intelligence Payloads (ASIPs) for medium altitude platforms and upgrades for ASIP high altitude payloads.  The systems' open architecture and Joint Airborne SIGINT Architecture (JASA)\/ Unified Cryptologic System Technical View 1 (UCS StdY-1) compliant design supports streamlined integration of ASIP onto additional ISR platforms.  The ASIP Family of Sensors (FoS) will design and build a common\/scalable SIGINT system designed for maximum coverage of the electromagnetic spectrum through the use of an integrated high and low band system.  \n\n(U) Capability improvements will be inserted into the ASIP Family of Sensors through individual development efforts that exploit signals of interest identified as service priorities by the Air Force SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG).  This project provides the warfighter near term increased combat capability. Enhancements are implemented as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels.  Compatability improvements will be inserted into the ASIP FoS through individual development efforts that exploit signals of interest identified as Service priorities by the AF SCWG. Sensors will be integrated and tested on the various platforms as funding permits. \n\n(U) Some parts of ASIP Upgrades are funded within the Common Development project of this PE and some parts are funded within the High Altitude SIGINT project (675181).  Parts that have applicability to other platforms are funded in the Common Development project."

Development efforts will include, but are not limited to such things as new signal sets, antenna improvements, sensitivity upgrades, and radio frequency distribution upgrades.  Additionally, these funds will develop the capability to allow networking with other SIGINT assets to increase collection capabilities.  This project provides the warfighter with a near term combat capability with increased capability improvements accomplished as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels.  Sensors will be integrated and tested on various platforms as funding permits."
