            "val": "This Program Element (PE) contains four projects: Maritime Concept Generation and Development (CGCD), Fleet Experimentation , Allied\/Coalition Interoperability and Information Dominance (ACIID), and Space and Electronic Warfare (SEW) Engineering. \n\nThe CGCD project (2356) focuses on the generation, development and validation of warfighting concepts, Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and doctrine in order to eliminate war fighting gaps. The CGCD project also includes, for FY14 and FY15, funding for the CNO's Rapid Innovation Cell (CRIC), a small group of disruptive thinkers managed by the Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC) to identify and quickly test in an operational environment, innovative ideas and technologies that are outside the traditional development and acquisition processes.  NWDC also manages the Fleet Experimentation program (formerly Sea Trial) under the guidance of Commander USFF and COMPACFLT.  \n\nThe FLEX project (3319) (formerly Sea Trial) develops new or improved warfighter capabilities through the experimentation of high payoff initiatives, technologies and concepts, Fleet Concepts of Operations (CONOPS), doctrine, and new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP). The objective of FLEX is to produce recommended changes in doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership development, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) actions, with an emphasis on non-materiel solutions.  Focusing on war fighting capability improvement through experimentation aimed at delivering potential solutions in support of current Operations Plans (OPLANs), FLEX spans both operational and tactical levels of warfare and reaches across the full range of military operations to enhance war fighting capabilities or fill current or future capability gaps.\n\nThe ACIID and SEW Engineering projects (0798 and 2144 respectively) are systems engineering non-acquisition programs to develop, test, implement technical authority, and validate naval Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) architectures to support naval missions in the Joint and Coalition Theater. The mission of these projects are carried out by multiple tasks that are used to ensure naval C4ISR Command and Control Warfare (C2W) components of SEW are effectively integrated into service-oriented architecture delivering net-centric warfare capability. Additionally, these projects ensure that (1) the composite operational capabilities of SEW systems (not the individual component systems) conform to the naval C4ISR architecture and enhance war fighting capability as related to the objectives of National Defense Strategy, evolving joint visions and direction, such as net centric capability, and are guided by warfighter requirements; (2) that SEW systems and systems integration efforts involve leading-edge technology transfer of information processing technologies primarily through integration of government and commercial off-the-shelf (GOTS\/COTS) products to enhance the Navy's operational capability, interoperability, warfighter effectiveness, flexible reconfiguration, as well as reduce costs; and (3) that SEW systems integration efforts promote the delivery of Information Dominance and the Navy's contribution to the Global Information Grid (GIG)."

The program determines maritime operational gaps with our allies, identifies Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions with the potential to fill those gaps, and assesses these solutions and associated concepts of operation in laboratory and at-sea environments. The ACIID program includes integration and testing in support of joint and Allied war fighting capabilities, including interoperability testing of IW equipment. Allied and joint interoperability is critical for future maritime operations, especially as the United States Navy expands Internet Protocol (IP) networking throughout the fleet via Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES), Next Generation Networks (NGEN), Multi-National Information Sharing (MNIS) and with the Global Information Grid (GiG). Currently, IP connectivity with AUSCANNZUKUS and other Allied\/Coalition forces is limited, requiring extensive backhaul through ashore infrastructure. Higher bandwidth solutions suitable for use over tactical networks require development and assessment for emerging coalition and joint interoperability requirements, such as Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD), Network Operations Without Shore (NOWS) and Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA). Increases in data throughput are required for the effective exchange of rich Information Dominance (ID) data sets and services via Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) within the limitations of High Frequency (HF), Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) and other portions of the radio frequency spectrum, coupled with appropriate Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense (IA\/CND) mechanisms. Development and assessment of potential solutions will integrate improved IP capabilities with the Advanced Digital Network Systems (ADNS) and existing international standards (e.g. Allied Communications Publication 200, NATO Standardization Agreements 5066 and 4691). The continued development and refinement of advanced tactical networking technologies and protocols, as well as automatic link establishment (ALE) standards, will provide for a significant improvement in data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements."

C4ISR integrated architectures are the underpinnings for all C4ISR mission areas and capabilities and, as such, requirements and acquisition processes have been reengineered to use these Integrated Architectures for decisional purposes and strategic planning.\nFurthermore, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has defined key programs\/efforts Global Information Grid Baseline Extension, Joint Tactical Radio System, Network Centric Enterprise Services, Information Assurance and standards that will drive and change the Navy's C4ISR integrated architectures and associated business processes for requirements, budgets and acquisition. To that end, the Space and Electronic Warfare provides three main functions: 1) Perform System of Systems and platform technical evaluations to establish the alignment with the N2\/N6 Information Dominance vision for the Navy on the whole and identify performance and operational risks associated with the integration of multiple systems to provide a robust, mission based capability. 2) Develop C4ISR\/Information Technology (IT)\/Information Dominance (ID) integrated architecture products and 3) Support C4ISR\/IT\/ID systems engineering processes and standards. The integrated architecture products are used to support the Navy's budget process by providing the critical core architecture and enabling capabilities to the war fighter. The systems engineering processes and standards provide the construct for distributed Command and Control (C2) interoperability requirements analyses to identify capability shortfalls\/gaps and for systems engineering to compare\/test alternatives in a joint end-to end environment while identifying associated Navy-wide C4ISR\/IT\/ID implications.

The priorities for the CG\/CD program are to explore near\/far-term technological and non-technological solutions to war fighting gaps across all naval warfare areas. The CG\/CD experimentation efforts include planning, systems engineering and integration, execution, data collection, analysis, and assessment requirements for a wide-range of experiment venues, such as workshops, seminars, wargames, limited objective experiments, limited technical experiments, and live force events. Where appropriate, CG\/CD experimentation will be conducted in a joint or coalition environment.\n\nAlso supports the fleet's experimentation program (Fleet Experimentation - FLEX) by providing planning, systems engineering and integration, execution, data collection, and analysis support to the Mission\/Warfare Area Office of Primary Responsibility where appropriate and as available. This support conducts experimentation in support of the Comander's Guidance for Fleet Experimentation promulgated by Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces.  This program historically does not meet established execution benchmarks. It differs from other Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) programs because it relies upon fleet participation and thus is scheduled around fleet or staff availability. Because that availability frequently occurs during the spring and summer operational schedules, the overall RDT&E obligation\/expenditure rates do not align with OSD practice. As a result, this project's obligation rates do not begin to approach benchmark until the program nears the fiscal year's end while its expenditure rates generally do not approach benchmark until midway through the second year of its appropriation."

FLEX is dedicated to providing solutions to these near term (within the Fiscal Year Defense Plan) prioritized war fighting gaps as defined by the Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces (CUSFF)\/Commander, Pacific Fleet (CPF) Fleet Experimentation annual guidance. With recommendations from Commander, Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC), experimentation campaigns are approved by CUSFF\/CPF each year thus establishing the annual experimentation execution plan.\n\nFleet experimentation runs the gamut from campaigns workshops and seminars to limited objective\/technical experiments, to advanced war fighting experiments. The campaigns involve all facets of experimentation including design, planning, systems engineering and integration, execution, data collection, analysis, assessment, and the delivery of tangible products for the fleet.
