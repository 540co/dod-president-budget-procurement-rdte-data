            "val": "This program element provides resources for development of mine countermeasure systems to provide minehunting, minesweeping, and neutralization to counter known and projected mine threats.  The mine countermeasures systems provide mobile, quick reaction forces capable of land or sea-based minehunting and minesweeping operations worldwide.  Resources are for developing and deploying advanced mine-hunting and minesweeping systems and the intelligence and oceanographic capabilities that will enable mine warfare superiority.  Tactics and techniques used vary across a diversity of environments and a diversity of threats, including both asymmetric and emerging.  Resources provide for systems and support of mine warfare systems, maritime systems, and expeditionary systems to allow for continuous operations of the Navy's warships and support vessels, other military vessels, and commercial vessels.  Core capabilities include forward presence, deterrence, sea control, power projection, maritime security, humanitarian assistance and disaster response to maintain freedom of the seas.  Increased capability includes conducting minefield reconnaissance (mine density and location) at high area search rates, improving detection capability, decreasing sensor false alarm rates, reducing or eliminating post-mission analysis detect, classify, identify, decide time, improving neutralization time, improving network communications, automatic target recognition, and achieving in-stride detect-to-engage capability.  Concept of operations includes development of cooperative, unmanned, modular systems; the establishment of a capable networked command and control systems; and standing up an accurate and interactive environmental system with the ability to form and disseminate a Common Environmental Picture.  Efforts benefit the MCM force by transforming the Navy from the platform-centered legacy set of systems to a capability-centered force that is distributed, networked, and able to provide unique maritime influence and access across the entire maritime domain.\n\nThe Surface Mine Countermeasures (SMCM) programs are platform independent and will provide detection, classification, localization, identification, neutralization, and influence clearance capabilities.  Programs develop: (1) remote minehunting capability for surface platforms; (2) the integration and improvement of new and existing systems (3) support for systems which detect, localize, classify, identify, and neutralize all mine types across Mine Countermeasure (MCM) Avenger Class and other platforms; (4) systems for neutralizing mines and light obstacles through the entire water column to include shallow water, very shallow water, surf zones, and beach landing craft zones in support of operations; (5) the integration of Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) to meet Undersea Surveillance capabilities as well as other prioritized and enduring capabilities, requirements and gaps and (6) integrate hardware for experimental testing related to surface ship, aircraft, and other cross platform applications."

The RMS will provide the Navy the capability to keep ships and sailors out of the minefield. The RMS is deployed from the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) as part of the ships' Mine Countermeasure (MCM) Mission Package (MP). The RMS is a fully integrated system consisting of a semi-submersible Remote Multi-Misson Vehicle (RMMV) towing a variable depth sensor, the AN\/AQS-20A. The RMMV is a high-endurance, semi-autonomous, low-observable, unmanned, diesel-powered vehicle, operated and maintained from the LCS. Line-of-sight (LOS) and over-the-horizon (OTH) data links provide real time vehicle command and control and mine reconnaissance sensor data transmission to\/from LCS.\n\nThe first Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units (LRIP 1) were used during the RMMV Reliability Growth Program (RGP) v4.2 configuration and will be upgraded to the version 6.0 (v6.0) configuration to support LCS integration. \n\nThe Program demonstrated substantially improved RMMV system performance during RMMV v4.2 validation testing in FY13. In the first quarter of FY14, the improved performance was validated during RGP Developmental Testing (DT).  The Milestone C (MS C) Gate Review Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) is scheduled for the third quarter of FY14. \n\nNot a new start.  ACAT 1D Transparency requirement realigned program funding to Project Element 0604122N beginning in FY15."

A description of the major planned programs include the following:\n\n1) AN\/SQQ-32(V)4 High-Frequency, Wide Band (HFWB) is a technology upgrade to the AN\/SQQ-32 Towed Body which will incorporate HFWB technology into the detection sonar to address performance deficiencies against new mine threats in the littorals.  This upgrade will be installed on MCM-1 Class ships with the AN\/SQQ-32(V)3 and will develop new transducer modules, fiber optic cable and modify topside processing and display software.  2) Mine Warfare and Environmental Decision Aids Library (MEDAL) is a software segment on the Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M). MEDAL provides mine and mine warfare planning and evaluation tools and databases to the MCM Commander.  3) Develop and implement Mine Countermeasures Commander's Estimate of the Situation (MCM CES).  4) Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) Flight 1 includes the Unmanned Surface Sweep System (US3,)a magnetic\/acoustic sweep system developed to sweep acoustic\/magnetic influence mines, that when integrated with an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) becomes the Unmanned Influence Sweep System (UISS) deployed from the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS); 5) Multi-Function USV Flight 2 integrates a minehunting sensor with the UISS vehicle. The added capability allows a common USV to conduct minehunting and minesweeping missions. 6) AN?SLQ-60 Mine Neutralization System (MNS) Seafox on the MCM Class ships. MNS is the replacement to the existing AN\/SLQ-48 Mine Neutralization System. 7) SSQ-94 MCM Trainer upgrade will incorporate the AN\/SQQ-32 (V)8 sonar, SSN2(V)5 PINS and Mine Neutralization System Team Trainer."

Requirements conferences gather a list of candidate functions based on a logical sequence to fully implement the overall software architecture. The fleet is presented with a recommended list of candidate capabilities based on this program plan, doctrine, fleet comments, and technology. These capability items are then prioritized by the fleet representatives (coordinated by Naval Mine Warfare and Anti-Submarine Command (NMAWC).The fleet inputs are then consolidated by COMINEWARCOM into an overall list which is then presented to Navy leadership for pricing and final selection. The selection is based on price, risk, available funding, and possibly by other program factors (e.g., ensure that MEDAL supports other program delivery schedules). Selection balances immediate needs, long term objectives, technical maturity and other programmatic factors.

                            "val": "This program provides a combination of U.S. Navy systems to counter the threat to amphibious forces from obstacles and anti-landing\/sea mines in the Beach Zone and Surf Zone (0-10 ft water). The Assault Breaching Systems (ABS) consist of a system of systems approach that includes the following programs:  JABS - Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Assault Breaching System; CMS - Countermine System; COBRA - Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis; PNMS - Precision Navigation and Marking System; and C4I - Command, Control, Computers, Communications, and Intelligence.  The Assault Breaching Systems enable the Navy-Marine Corps team to conduct Joint Forcible Entry Operations (JFEO), Ship-To-Objective Maneuver (STOM), and other combat operations to project power ashore.\n\nThe JDAM Assault Breaching System (JABS) is a currently fielded system that neutralizes surface mines and obstacles in the Beach Zone and Surf Zone.  The ABS Tactical Decision Aid optimizes the Desired Points of Impact (DPI) for JDAM munitions to effectively neutralize mines and obstacles while minimizing the required number of munitions and friendly aircraft sorties.  Continued testing is required to optimize the ABS Tactical Decision Aid database for the most common enemy mines and obstacles.\n\nThe Countermine System (CMS) is the far-term solution for neutralizing buried mines in the Beach Zone and Surf Zone.  CMS transitioned from a 6.3 S&T Concept Demonstration effort to a 6.4 development program after a concept decision\/AoA in FY06.  CMS is the only USN system capable of neutralizing buried mines. \n\nCoastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis (COBRA) is the ABS program to conduct ISR\/T.  This system provides Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) capability, and one system consists of two Airborne Payloads and one Post Mission Analysis Station.  Under the umbrella of evolutionary acquisition, three increments of development are planned. Block I is a multispectral sensor capable of daytime detection of surface-laid minefields and obstacles in the Beach Zone.  Block II adds a 3D LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor that enables nighttime detection of mines and obstacles in the Beach Zone and the Surf Zone (0-10 ft of water).  Block II also adds on-board near real-time processing of multispectral imagery data.  Block III adds an interferometric sensor that is capable of detecting buried mines.  Blocks II and III will incorporate technology being developed by 6.3 S&T.  COBRA consists of a modular payload architecture that can be integrated onto the MQ-8B Fire Scout Vertical Takeoff and Landing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (VTUAV)  or USN manned helicopters like the SH-60.  COBRA will serve as the \"detect\" mission module in the Surf Zone and Beach Zone for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mine Warfare mission package.\n \nPrecision Navigation & Marking System (PNMS) provides navigational upgrades for the Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC); Landing Craft, Utility (LCU); and Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV).  A system of virtual lane marking improves the navigation ability of these three assault craft which enables them to navigate safely through the neutralized assault lanes provided by JABS and CMS.  OPN funds the CRAFTALTS to upgrade the navigation systems.  LCU Navigation Upgrade: Modernized the navigation system to enable safe transit through the breached lane.  LCAC Autopilot Upgrade: An integrated improvement to the LCAC Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) navigation system for craft control that allows precise navigation and hovering within the breached lane.  These software upgrades and backfits occur during scheduled LCAC SLEPs. AAV Navigation Upgrade : Modernize the navigation system to enable precise transit through the breached lane.  \n\nCommand, Control, Computers, Communications and Intelligence (C4I) system will tie all of the above systems together under an integrated ABS architecture that is compatible with the existing Mine Warfare architecture."
