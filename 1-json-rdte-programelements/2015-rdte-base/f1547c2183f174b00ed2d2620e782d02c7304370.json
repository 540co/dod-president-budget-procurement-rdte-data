            "val": "Defense-wide Manufacturing Science and Technology (DMS&T), established within the Manufacturing Technology Program directed in Title 10 USC Section 2521, provides the Department with a comprehensive manufacturing program to achieve the strategic goals of focused technology, improved acquisition across the life cycles, and cost-effective logistics.  By designing for manufacturability early in development, anticipated results will have an impact on increasing reliability and decreasing the life cycle burden of weapon systems. The mission to anticipate and close gaps in defense manufacturing capabilities and drive significant system life cycle affordability benefits makes DMS&T an increasingly important leveraging tool in the current budget environment.\n\t\t\t\nDMS&T will: 1) address manufacturing enterprise game-changing initiatives that are beyond the scope of any one Military Department or Defense Agency or platform and, 2) establish and mature cross-cutting manufacturing processes required for transitioning emerging technologies which impact the time lines, affordability, and productivity of acquisition programs and shorten the deployment cycle times.\n\t\t\t\nThe DMS&T program is fundamental to a coordinated development process.  Concurrent development of manufacturing processes with the S&T development enables the use of emerging technologies.  Key technical areas for investment for DMS&T include Advanced Electronics and Optics Manufacturing, Advanced Materials Manufacturing, and Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing.  Advanced Electronics and Optics addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of applications such as sensors, radars, power generation, switches, and optics for defense applications.  Advanced Materials addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of materials such as composites, metals, ceramics, nanomaterials, metamaterials, and low observables.  Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing addresses advanced manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include the industrial information infrastructure, advanced design\/qualification\/cost tools, supply network integration technologies and management practices, direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, machining; robotics, assembly, and joining.\n\nThe total sequestration reduction executed as a result of the FY 2013 DoD appropriation act was -$.4.438, of which -$3.430 was applied to FY 2012 and -$1.008 was applied to FY 2013.  Sequestration of these amounts impacted the ability of the OSD Defense-wide ManTech program to execute DoD and Administration priorities for Advanced Manufacturing by  investing in fewer manufacturing processes and improved materials, which are intended to drive in affordability for reduction of system life-cycle costs of major weapons systems."

Technology initiatives, in collaboration with the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) and industry, identify and develop investment strategies to advance the manufacturing processes needed to support the specific technology.  Above-the-shop-floor investments focus on new manufacturing processes that have potential to significantly improve manufacturing efficiencies. Single specific projects address investment opportunities not associated with selected technology initiatives and enable the program to respond to urgent, compelling manufacturing needs and provide seed funding to more high risk-high payoff technologies.\n \t\t\t\nData calls are launched through two methods to identify technology initiatives and single specific issues requiring investment.  One method is through the JDMTP.  The JDMTP is comprised of the ManTech Directors from the Services, Defense Logistics Agency, and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The call is distributed through the ManTech Directors to the four JDMTP sub panels: Metals Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Composites Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Electronics Processing and Fabrication Subpanel and Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise Subpanel. Potential candidates are evaluated by the JDMTP based on criteria set forth in the call and announcements and down-selected for further development prior to final selection.  The other method is through Broad Agency Announcements to industry.  Priority is given to investments that support affordability and producibility of critical enabling manufacturing technologies that cut across multiple platforms.  Investments also balance defense priorities in specialty materials, electronics, propulsion and power, and manufacturing processes including \"above the shop floor\" (lean and business technologies facilitating interoperable manufacturing).  Final projects are selected by the OSD ManTech Director, considering input from the JDMTP and Director of Manufacturing, and as approved by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (MIBP).  Technology initiatives and projects are executed at the Component level."

In addition, these programs all had a clear transition path with implementation on a current platform or one undergoing acquisition targeted to be within 2-3 years of project completion.  The following areas of investment were executed to enable a diverse suite of advanced manufacturing production improvements\n\n- Innovation Manufacturing Institutes (IMI) (previously Advanced Manufacturing Innovation Institutes) (see program  descriptions addressed above): \n  1) IMI for 3D printing:  The institute accomplished a first-year, start-up phase consisting of establishing over 80 industry, academic, and non-profit members, creating a balanced governance structure to engage industry and government stakeholders, development of performance metrics, a project call process, an operating plan, the hiring of full-time staff, and completed renovations of the headquarters, the Innovation Factory.  A Call for Projects resulted in six applied research projects, engaging over 35 member organizations on project teams.  The Additive Manufacturing technology roadmap was developed using results generated from a series of workshops with members.  A  Second Project Call was launched with anticipated awards totaling $9 million (government share).  Plans for education and workforce training and outreach were developed, and initiatives were launched in these areas.  The IMI for 3D printing began the development of a new public and private (members-only) collaborative website for secure exchange of relevant information on projects, member organization capabilities, and developments in the additive manufacturing industry.\n\n  2) IMIs for digital manufacturing and design, and for lightweight metals:  Provided resources for initial staffing of each Institute, permitting timely standup of the Institutes to facilitate growth in membership and customer interest.  Awarded initial cooperative agreements. The Technology Advisory Boards of these Institutes were established along with operating procedures on governance, intellectual property protection, and membership. Began cross-institute project teaming with the 3D printing IMI, and began engagement with organic (depot) manufacturing communities within DoD. Executed the initial Project Calls and awarded first round of projects, typically $1M in government funds matched 1:1 or better by industry. Contracts were awarded in the following core areas for each Institute: \n  IMI for digital manufacturing and design: advanced manufacturing enterprise, intelligent machines, and advanced analysis; \n  IMI for lightweight metals: applications of new\/novel metals and alloys, primary metal manufacturing processes, secondary manufacturing processes, and development of products exploiting lightweight and modern metals.\n\nOther projects executed (space limitation precludes project details below, but further descriptions are available):\n\nAutomated Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) Analysis of Composite Ultrasonic Inspection Data for Manufacturing Quality Control\nCarbon Nanotube Cables\nConnecting American Manufacturing\nCurved Transparent Ceramics\nLaser Assisted Consolidation of Composites\nMulti-function Periscope\nOn Tool Inspection of Automated Fiber Placement"

This program will reduce the cost of the current radar system by $1M per ship set, and will fit into the existing TRS-3D top side and below decks available footprint. The open architecture configuration will allow upgrades for new technologies over the lifetime of the program as well as offer lower cost via the potential for open competition for the radar\u2019s building blocks.  Radar manufacturing and support capability will be transferred from a foreign company to a domestic company and facility.  Transmit\/Receive (T\/R) module packaging cost will be reduced through near-hermetic, commercial Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) packaging and automated Surface Mount Technology (SMT) assembly techniques, reducing touch labor costs.  Model Based Enterprise (MBE) concepts will be integrated to ensure supportability and technology refresh via an Intelligent Technical Data Package.  The commercial packaging effort for T\/R module components as a part of this program will have a direct impact on the Volume Search Radar (VSR) on CVN-79 \u2013 creating a $1M\/hull cost savings for the Navy.  This effort will provide the Navy with the first truly open architecture radar solution that will be able to accommodate different Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technologies, Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) technologies, processor, and power supplies from multiple vendors.  The system will use fiber optics to connect the above-deck equipment (antenna) with the below-deck equipment (signal processing and control) which will allow greater flexibility in location of below-deck equipment (allowing a lower center of gravity and thus improved ship stability)."

The size, weight, power, and cost components of conventional atomic clocks are too high for tactical applications. Chip Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) provides improved long-term frequency stability that gets integrated into long-term time accuracy. The focus of this project is leveraging Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) investments in the CSAC technology to reduce operational costs and transition beyond custom fabrication of the current CSAC.  Objectives include improving the existing batch manufacturing processes such as atomic cell filling, cell sealing, physics package assembly, and sub-system testing to reduce the \u201ctouch hours\u201d required for CSAC assembly and testing. Development of a network of multiple vendors to foster competition and ensure a viable supply base is a complementary goal. Current manual assembly processes can produce CSAC in small quantities with low yield at high cost ($8,000\/unit).  The DMS&T funding enables producibility at an affordable cost ($100\u2013$300\/unit). Successful performance enables an environment of continued operation of critical C4ISR systems, regardless of the presence or absence of global positioning system (GPS). The ability to rapidly reacquire GPS military code in a hostile Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI) environment is an additional targeted benefit."

The FAST process passes a pulsed direct current through the part while it is pressed in a die, and the combination of rapid heating and compressive loading results in fine grained, fully dense materials in short processing times that are not possible with conventional sintering processes.

These efforts provide significant productivity and efficiency gains in the defense manufacturing base.  These manufacturing technologies accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs.\n\nSilicon Carbide (SiC) High Efficiency Power Switches: Another emerging manufacturing technology undergoing development is for Silicon Carbide High Efficiency Power Switches to enable a new class of power electronics that allows flexible new architectures at higher voltages, higher frequencies, less volume \/ weight, higher temperatures, higher efficiency (reduced fuel consumption), and better power quality for Program Executive Office Ground Combat Systems and the Air and Missile Defense Radar Radar Power Conversion Module.\n\nMini Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) Cameras and ManTech for SWIR Imagers: Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC)-less SWIR imagers are being developed that are smaller, use less power, have a lower cost than currently available SWIR imagers, and offer improved functionality over sensors presently in use.  These new SWIR imagers will be used by warfighters including SOF to see target designation lasers during day and night, to identify friend or foe at long range at night, and to operate with covert lasers.  Applications include several night vision and targeting system programs with the Army, Navy, Air Force, and SOCOM.\n\nManufacturability of Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs): One emerging manufacturing technology undergoing development focuses on the manufacturability of VCSELs.

                                        "val": "Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing is a series of efforts addressing advanced manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, advanced manufacturing enterprise, machining, robotics, assembly, and joining.  These manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs.\n\nWith our adversaries forced to innovate rapidly to survive, it's become increasingly important for the U.S. military to improve its own agility and flexibility. The focus is to find a solution to overcome a burdensome acquisition cycle requiring a great amount of cost, time, security, and storage space. Through the use of secure satellite data links or a local parts database, warfighters can access CAD designs for replacement parts, allowing them to repair equipment without the need to establish supply chains or wait for shipments. It allows operators to modify a part's design based on its performance in the field.\n\nEmerging manufacturing technologies undergoing development include:  Large-scale, challenge for advanced, interoperable machine tool applications, and methods for exchange of 3D official technical data throughout the supply chain and between government and contractors.\n\n\nMTConnect Challenge: Focuses on developing enterprise manufacturing solutions (tools) using newly developed MTConnect interoperable protocol, for use on machining platforms and manufacturing enterprise communication development. MTConnect is an open communication standard that provides the capability to pass data from enterprise components to higher level systems for further processing using the XML based standard.\n\nFramework for Assessing Cost and Technology (FACT): Producibility analysis tools will be matured so that component performance, manufacturing processing techniques and cost can be simultaneously considered to achieve an optimum design solution.  Current producibility analysis tools do not reuse and connect existing design, manufacturing and cost models. Sustainment and Maintenance will be impacted by maturing advanced sustainability analyses operating within FACT to reduce sustainment costs associated with spare parts acquisition and weapon system maintenance.  The technology will enable correct selection of a manufacturing process to minimize cost given the estimated spare part lot sizes. Block Upgrades or Recapitalization using FACT will be critical for performing analyses associated with integrating new requirements into an existing platform to highlight the manufacturing and lifecycle costs associated with the necessary changes to the weapon system in order to meet new operational requirements.\n\n40mm M433 Warhead Producibility: This effort will improve anti-personnel lethality at the squad level, increasing grenadier first shot effectiveness against personnel targets.  Optimization of production process prior to transition to Full Rate Production will enable avoidance of significantly high cartridge unit costs.  New manufacturing process\/techniques will be established to embed discrete fragments into over molded warhead bodies, replacing deep drawn pre-formed manufacturing techniques. Low Velocity 40mm M433 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) Grenades do not meet lethality requirement stated in FM 23-31.  The grenadier, an integral part of the squad, lacks lethality from the M433 HEDP grenade. The M433 HEDP lethality is restricted by the warhead manufacturing process and design. A new warhead design and manufacturing process is required to achieve lethality requirements and to increase lethality overmatch of the squad.  Currently the M433 HEDP warhead is a deep drawn body with pre-formed fragments.  The deep drawn warhead body, although cost effective, produces inconsistent fragment sizes, weights, and patterns which reduces warhead lethality.\n\nLoading ALIMX-101 into 500 LB General Purpose Bombs: A promising new Insensitive Munitions, IM,  explosive has been selected for implementation into the 500 LB General Purpose Bomb used by the Navy and Air Force so an efficient manufacturing process needs to be developed early in the acquisition cycle in order to avoid costly delays in fielding the new IM-compliant system."

Optimize mold stages to decrease time to load parts, over-mold parts & transition to follow on stages.  Potential Return on Investment (ROI) = 8.5:1; cost savings $24.5M, when calculated over identical production quantities from 2016 to 2022 ($17.00 per round cost reduction).\n\nLoading ALIMX-101 into 500 LB General Purpose Bombs: Develop and optimize  loading rates for each material, fill height levels and tolerances, cooling parameters for each material, and X-ray inspection criteria of loaded bomb. Using ARDEC\u2019s pilot-scale processing facility is typical process development for many programs (155mm artillery, mortars, grenades, etc.) because it is more cost effective and efficient than evaluation at a load plant."

To support these goals, Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation (IMI) will serve as regional hubs to accelerate technological innovation into commercial application and concurrently develop the educational competencies and production processes via shared public-private sectors.   Collaborative execution and funding by the Departments of Defense (DoD), Energy (DoE), and Commerce (DoC), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support the establishment of the IMIs will spur industry cost-share for manufacturing innovation and quickly develop a pathway for technology-focused regional hubs for collaboration among government, industry, and academia that will meet critical government and Warfighter needs.  The concept of these institutes is highlighted in the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) report titled \u201cCapturing Domestic Competitive Advantage in Advanced Manufacturing,\u201d published in July 2012.\n\nIMI for 3D printing: The focus of the 3D printing IMI is to accelerate additive manufacturing technologies to the U.S. manufacturing sector and increase domestic manufacturing competitiveness by: 1) Fostering a highly collaborative infrastructure for the open exchange of additive manufacturing information and research 2) Facilitating the development, evaluation, and deployment of efficient and flexible additive manufacturing technologies 3) Engaging with educational institutions and companies to supply education and training in additive manufacturing technologies to create an adaptive, leading workforce, 4) Serving as a national institute with regional and national impact on additive manufacturing capabilities, 5) Linking and integrating US companies with existing public, private or not-for-profit industrial and economic development resources, and business incubators, with an emphasis on assisting small- and medium-sized enterprises and early-stage companies (start-ups). The 3D printing IMI was established in 2012.\n\nIMI for digital manufacturing and design: Advanced design and manufacturing tools that are digitally integrated and networked with supply chains can lead to 'factories of the future,' forming an agile U.S. industrial base with significant speed to market advantage. A national institute focusing on the development of model-based design methodologies, virtual manufacturing tools, and sensor and robotics-based manufacturing networks will accelerate innovation in manufacturing, increasing U.S. competitiveness. The digital manufacturing and design IMI will provide the proving ground to link promising information technologies, tools, standards, models, sensors, controls, practices and skills, and then transition these capabilities to the industrial base for full-scale application.  For example, proving and progressing intelligent electro-mechanical design and manufacturing capabilities from laboratory to prototype factory environments would improve production efficiencies and costs. The focus is the smart and comprehensive use of the \u2018digital thread\u2019 throughout design, production and support.\n\nIMI for lightweight metals: Advanced lightweight metals possess properties comparable to traditional materials while enabling much lighter components and products. A national institute will scale-up research to accelerate market expansion by applying integrated computational of materials and manufacturing approach.  New structural alloys face tremendous barriers to application due to lack of design guides and certifications as well as cost and scale-up challenges. The goal is to develop an advanced lightweight-metal U.S. supplier base, and to enable DoD to realize significant fuel reduction, increased payloads, and greater speed and agility of manned, unmanned, and soldier systems as well as benefits for commercial applications and energy savings. \n\nTwo additional IMIs will be established in FY 2015, focusing investments in the key technical areas of Advanced Electronics and Optics Manufacturing, Advanced Materials Manufacturing, and Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing.\n\nEach Institute is projected to be financially self-sustaining within a five year period of performance."
