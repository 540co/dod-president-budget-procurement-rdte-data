There are approximately 115 cryptologic capable surface ships and shore sites in the current Navy inventory; each is a potential user of this carry-on equipment, depending on deployment schedules and the tempo of operations. In addition, there are numerous subsurface and air platforms that are also potential users. This funding line will provide the resources to enable rapid transition of available Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off -The-Shelf (GOTS) technologies that apply to Fleet requirements for carry-on system functionalities. These technologies typically require various levels of integration to leverage on-board systems that provide system and mission management, product reporting, and data analysis. COTS\/GOTS system documentation and training materials usually require adaptation or modification to meet fleet operator requirements, or entirely new training materials may need to be developed. Before deployment for operational use, systems must be systematically tested to ensure suitable and reliable operation, tested for network vulnerabilities if connected to shipboard Local Area Networks, and tested relative to interoperability requirements. Certification testing is conducted to meet Office of Naval Intelligence security requirements and network testing is conducted in accordance with Information Technology (IT) requirements to allow connection to Navy networks. Funding will also provide resources to address rapid deployment of enhancements or improvements to the common hardware and\/or software baseline of all other carry-on subsystems to meet emergent requirements.\n\nFY15 funds will continue to integrate, test, and document identified COTS and GOTS technologies and subsystems that meet emergent and on-going Fleet requirements as specified in the Signals of Interest (SOI) and target threat list. Funds will continue to develop upgrades to existing systems and subsystems according to Fleet requirements. Additional funds will aid in the development of new SOI algorithms in support of cryptologic systems."
