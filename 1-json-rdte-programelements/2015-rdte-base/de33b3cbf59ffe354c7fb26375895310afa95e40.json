These are required to evaluate concepts and address needs and issues that occur in joint military environments and provide information required by Congress, Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Unified Commands, and the Department of Defense components relative to joint operations.  This project also funds Follow-on Test and Evaluation (FOTE), as necessary.  FOTE may be required after a full production decision to assess system training and logistics, to verify correction of deficiencies identified during earlier testing and evaluation, and to ensure that initial production items meet operational effectiveness, suitability and supportability thresholds.  There has been a shift of focus for items funded by this project due to continuing operations in the US Central Command (CENTCOM).  Traditional system workload has dropped off and has been replaced by rapid fielding initiatives.  In response to this shift, the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) has established a forward operational assessment team in theater and a rapid response cell.  These groups facilitate MOTE, JT&E, and FOTE events in the rapid environment.  Traditional acquisition requirements are expected to return to normal when operations in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down."

This project finances recurring costs for the Operational Test Command that are essential for conducting realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training.  These recurring costs include civilian pay, requirements for test support contracts, temporary duty, supplies and equipment.  This project funds requirements for the Operational Test Command's eight test directorates and one support activity located at Fort Hood, TX; Fort Bragg, NC; Fort Sill, OK\/Ft. Bliss, TX; and Fort Huachuca, AZ. The primary mission of these test directorates is to perform detailed planning, execution, and reporting of Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOTE), and Force Development Test and Experimentation (FDTE). Project V02 currently provides support for the one Test and Evaluation Coordination Offices (TECOs) located at Fort Leonard Wood, MO and one Infantry Support Cell at Fort Benning, GA.  TECOs previously located in Fort Lee, VA and Fort Knox, KY have been consolidated in Fort Benning, GA."
