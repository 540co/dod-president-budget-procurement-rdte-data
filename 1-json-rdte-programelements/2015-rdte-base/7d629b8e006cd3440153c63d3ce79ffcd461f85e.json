This capability assesses system of systems interoperability, operational capability, procedural compliance, and technical suitability of emerging and existing systems and programs to confirm readiness for deployment.  \n\nBy establishing ground truth for interoperability and suggesting remedies for demonstrated shortfalls, C4 Assessments is an enabler for the Chairman\u2019s priorities to:  pioneer new ways to combine and employ emergent capabilities, drive jointness deeper, sooner in-capability development, move quickly toward joint information and simulation networks that support secure and agile command and control, expand the envelope of interagency and international cooperation, and promote multilateral security approaches and architectures."
