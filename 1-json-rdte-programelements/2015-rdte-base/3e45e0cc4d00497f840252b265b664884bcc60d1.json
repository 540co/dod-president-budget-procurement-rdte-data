Reductions to the Combat Rations Program means microwave technology processing which more efficiently processes combat rations will not be ready for industrial implementation driving up support costs.  Reductions to the Customer Driven Uniform Manufacturing means the needed collaboration capability the GAO identified among the Services, DLA and the industrial base not be in place leading to non-conforming products and excess costs.  Casting Program reductions will result in cancellation of efforts that lowers costs and improves environmental compliance.  Other casting projects' schedules will be extended which will increase DOD costs.  The reduction to the forging program means new forging technology will not be implemented in the industrial base causing weapon systems' support costs to increase and readiness levels reduced.  Reductions to the Battery Network project means that new battery technology vital to operational forces may not be available in the quantities needed for emergencies at a reasonable cost."

The Combat Rations Program is focused on improving the manufacturing technologies related to the production and distribution of the combat rations that are at the forefront of these operations, including Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) as well as Unitized Group Rations (UGR).  The objectives are increased readiness, improved quality, optimum sizing for transportation and storage; and better ration variety.  CORANET research efforts also help control the cost of the combat rations.  The CORANET program engages all elements of the supply chain including the producers, military Services, Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), US Army Veterinary Command, US Army Public Health Command, DLA Logistics R&D, DLA Troop Support Subsistence and academia to research and transition improved technologies for operational rations."

This program takes a holistic view of the problem and attacks root causes inside DLA, at DLA\u2019s engineering support activity partners in the Services, and at DLA forging suppliers.  The program has three thrusts:  Business Enterprise Integration to improve supply support approaches; FORGE-IT to develop and improve technical problems; and R&D which develops new technology for forging suppliers, including new methods for making forge dies (typically the longest lead time item) and for simulation of metal flow inside the forge die (to eliminate trial and error development of the die)."

The BATTNET, which includes a Government Steering Group (GSG) of power source technical experts from the military services R&D groups, is informed of general R&D requirements for supply chain improvement. The partners develop among themselves related R&D projects, which are then formally evaluated by the GSG.
