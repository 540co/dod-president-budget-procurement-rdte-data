            "val": "Operational forces have an immediate need to survive, safely operate, and sustain operations in a Chemical and Biological (CB) threat environment across the continuum of global, contingency, special operations\/low intensity conflict, counternarcotics, and other high-risk missions.  This program element supports the Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) of medical and non-medical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) medical and non-medical CB Defense initiatives.  DoD missions for civil support operations have recently expanded and have resulted in providing focus to develop technologies to support CB counterterrorism initiatives.  ADC&P is conducted for an array of chemical, biological, and toxin detection and warning systems providing early warning, collector concentrators, generic detection, improved reagents, and decontamination systems using solutions that will remove and\/or detoxify contaminated materiel without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment.  CB sensors and diagnostics enhance the Departments environmental and medical surveillance efforts by improving the monitoring and surveillance of threats and forces preparing for and engaged in military operations.  These efforts are required to enable military commanders and the Military Health System to prevent, treat, and mitigate threats to individual Service Members and military units.  Integration of CB sensor and diagnostic data from the programs in this ACD&P will also be usable within the homeland security and Federal public health common operating pictures.  \n\nThe Department of Defense is responsible for research, development, acquisition, and deployment of medical countermeasures to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces, in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens, encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats, because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and\/or operations, may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD, unlike those developed to support U.S. population, must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasizes prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this ACD&P, such as vaccines against the most likely biological threat agents and traditional \/ non-traditional chemical agent prophylaxis, conserves fighting strength, decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation, and satisfies the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available, efforts on this ACD&P support pre-hospitalization treatment, en-route care, hospital care, and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include improvements to CB diagnostics and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of biologic agents and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  DoD is the only Federal activity conducting ACD&P on these prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic CB medical countermeasures.  \n\nThe Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  The Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process (\"One Portfolio\").  The Department of Defense's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research, development, acquisition, and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces, it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research, development, and acquisition because of its unique facilities, testing capabilities, and trained and experienced personnel.  \n\nACD&P also supports the development of updated test capabilities to evaluate Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense systems.  Also included is the Techbase Technology Transition effort which validates high-risk\/high-payoff technologies that could significantly improve Warfighter capabilities.  \n\nThe projects in this program element support efforts in the technology development phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 4."

Individual efforts are: (1) Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS); (2) Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Agent Water Monitor (JCBRAWM) Increment 2; (3) Joint Standoff Detection System (JSDS); and (4) Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD).\n\t\t\nThe Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) is the first lightweight, low cost biological surveillance system that will detect, collect, and identify biological warfare agent aerosols.  JBTDS will provide warning through the Joint Warning And Reporting Network (JWARN) and archive sample for follow-on analyses.  JBTDS will provide near real-time local audio and visual alarm for use by any Military Occupational Specialty (MOS).  JBTDS will be man-portable, battery-operable, and easy to employ.  JBTDS will be used to provide notification of a biological hazard and enhanced battle space awareness to protect and preserve the force.  When networked, JBTDS will augment existing biological detection systems to provide a theater-wide seamless array capable of biological detection, identification and warning.  \n\nThe Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Agent Water Monitor (JCBRAWM) Increment 2 efforts will evaluate existing and emerging technologies to provide improvement to chemical detection in water to meet Tri-Service Drinking Water Standards and to detect emerging threats in water.\n\nThe Joint Standoff Detection System (JSDS) will provide near real-time detection of chemical and biological attacks\/incidents at a standoff distance.  The modular system will be tailorable to the Service and can be employed at Aerial Port of Debarkation (APOD)\/Sea Port of Debarkation (SPOD), Forward Operating Base (FOB), and on multiple platforms to include: fixed site, aerostat, and ground systems.  The system will be networked to allow for cueing of point sensor arrays.  Additionally, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) (as demonstrated in the WMD Aerial Collection System (WACS) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD))\/Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) platforms could be integrated for sampling and identification.  This schedule has been synchronized with the WACS ATD schedule to facilitate data exchange and possible excursions.\n\nThe Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) consists of several detection systems.  The variants will address sampling of multiple phases of matter; locating liquids and solids on surfaces; and vapor and aerosol monitoring.  NGCD will detect and identify non-traditional agents, chemical warfare agents (CWAs), toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) in the air and on surfaces.  The NGCD will provide improved CWA\/TIC selectivity and sensitivity on multiple platforms as well as multiple environments.  These detectors will improve detection, consequence management and reconnaissance, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) interdiction capabilities.  The scope of the project includes detection of agent a few feet away from the detector as well as at the sampling point of the detector."

The awards for the Technology Development (TD) phase utilized a best value approach via the competitive CBRNE mission support contract to three contractor teams.  Full and open competition will be utilized for the EMD contract with options for Low Rate Initial Production and Full Rate Production.  Coordination with other programs (Common Analytical Laboratory System and Next Generation Diagnostic System) is occurring to share information and leverage potential common identification technology solutions to the three programs.\n\nJS CHEM\/BIO\/RAD AGENT WATER MONITOR (JCBRAWM)\n\nCurrent effort is being conducted in-house to address emerging threats in water and to enhance chemical detection capabilities to meet current Tri-Service Drinking Water Standards.    Initial work focuses on determining viability of enhancements to existing kits through analysis of chemical processes.  Results will provide data required to develop viable alternative approaches and to develop performance requirements for the Increment 2 program at MS A.\n\nJOINT STANDOFF DETECTION SYSTEM (JSDS)\n\nJSDS will maximize the use of commercial and government off the shelf mature technologies with an expected start at Milestone B.  Full and open competition will be utilized for the SDD phase of the program.\n\nNEXT GENERATION CHEMICAL DETECTOR (NGCD)\n\nThe NGCD analysis of alternatives will be used to generate performance specifications that will support contracting for competitive prototype development.  The request for proposal was released July 2013.  The goal for the initial stage of development will be to award multiple contracts for each variant of the NGCD.  Full and open competition will be used to award one contract per variant at Milestone B.  Mature technology will be accelerated as appropriate."

ConMit systems provide a force restoration capability for units that become contaminated.  Development efforts will provide systems that reduce operational impact and logistics burden, reduce sustainment costs, increase safety, and minimize environmental effects associated with decontamination and contamination mitigation operations.\n\nThe programs supported under this Project include (1) Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS), (2) Contamination Indicator Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS), (3) General Purpose Decontaminant (GPD), (4) Joint Service Equipment Wipe (JSEW), and (5) Joint Biological Aircraft Decontamination (JBAD) System.  \n\nThe DFoS program facilitates the rapid transition of mature Science and Technology (S&T) research efforts to existing Decontamination or ConMit Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) Programs of Record and guides S&T community efforts toward meeting the needs of the Warfighter.  Leveraging the outcome of the Materiel Development Decision (MDD) (3QFY11) directed Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), DFoS will develop a Family of Systems (FoS) to provide novel preparatory and responsive contamination mitigation technologies to meet the capability gaps for decontaminating chemical and biological (CB) warfare agents and Non Traditional Agents (NTA) from personnel, equipment, vehicle, ship, and aircraft interiors\/exteriors, terrain and fixed facility interiors\/exteriors.  \n\nCIDAS will provide a contamination indicator\/decontamination assurance technology; it will consist of an indicator and an applicator, for which there will be three configurations.  The indicator will be sprayed on tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served and individual weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that may have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional chemical contamination.  CIDAS is a new capability for the Joint Forces that will reduce logistics burden of decontamination by indicating presence and location of traditional (Nerve and Blister) and non-traditional chemical agents on militarily relevant surfaces pre- and post-decontamination.\n\nGPD is a liquid decontaminant that will provide thorough decontamination capabilities for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served weapons, and individual\/personal weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional CB contamination.  \n\nJSEW is a decontamination wipe that will provide immediate\/operational decontamination capabilities for sensitive and non-sensitive equipment in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to traditional (Nerve and Blister) and non-traditional chemical agents\/contamination.  In addition, the JSEW program is intended to be a replacement for the Individual Equipment Decontamination Kit (M295).\n\nThe JBAD System program is a new start in FY15.  The JBAD System will provide thorough biological decontamination of the interior and exterior of tactical and cargo aircraft.  The JBAD System is a capability set that will include a shelter to encapsulate an airframe, a decontamination delivery system (e.g. hot-humid air-blower, etc.), environmental control and monitoring system(s), and other ancillary components required to ensure efficacious biological agent decontamination.  It will provide the capability to decontaminate biologically contaminated airframes to safe levels and allow more rapid return to service."

Following MS A, collaborated with JSTO\/DTRA efforts, including the Hazard Mitigation, Materiel and Equipment Restoration (HaMMER) Advanced Technology Development Operational Demonstration and Extended User Evaluations, and conducted technology demonstrations on candidate indicator and applicator technologies to mitigate risk and identify affordable mature technologies that meet requirements.  Determined need for and initiated Government designed large scale applicator to meet specific User requirements.  Following MS B, use full and open competition to award a performance based contract with options for LRIP and FRP for indicator and small and mid scale applicator systems.  Integrate and test contractor and Government designs in DT and operational testing.\n\nDFoS GENERAL PURPOSE DECONTAMINANT (DFoS GPD)\n\nThe GPD program employed a Competitive Prototyping (CP) effort to facilitate the evaluation of COTs technologies.  Seven contracts were awarded for competing vendors to provide prototype GPDs in support of CP I. A down select occurred based on technical performance and cost and four contracts were awarded to vendors in support of CP II. As the GPD program enters the next acquisition phase, the program will continue following an evolutionary acquisition strategy; employing a verification\/validation effort to facilitate the identification and evaluation of mature technologies that can meet the GPD Capabilities Development Document (CPD) requirements satisfying Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) user needs.\n\nDFoS JOINT SENSITIVE EQUIPMENT WIPE (DFoS JSEW)\n\nJSEW program employed competitive prototyping to facilitate the evaluation of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Technologies during the Technology Development Phase.  Candidates were evaluated from competing vendor prototypes to determine optimal JSEW systems.  Four contracts were awarded to vendors in support of Competitive Prototyping Phase (CP) II.  As the JSEW enters the next acquisition phase, the program will continue following an evolutionary acquisition strategy; employing a verification\/validation effort to facilitate the identification and evaluation of mature technologies that can meet the JSEW Capabilities Development Document (CPD) requirements.  Follow-on increments of JSEW may include biological agent capability and use on skin.\n\nJOINT BIOLOGICAL AGENT DECONTAMINATION SYSTEM (JBAD)\n\nThe JBAD System program will utilize an evolutionary acquisition strategy to mature and deliver incremental capabilities to meet Air Mobility Command and US Transportation Command needs for interior and exterior decontamination of aircraft against biological agents.  The JBAD will employ full and open competition and competitive prototyping during the Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase."

This will be accomplished through class-based analysis, Filtration Advanced Screening Test (FAST), desorption study, and advanced CBRN filtration efforts.\n\nThe Uniform Integrated Protective Ensemble (UIPE) Increment 2 will enhance fielded and emerging individual protective equipment as part of a Family of Systems that enables the Warfighter to operate in a contaminated Chemical and Biological (CB) environment with no or minimal degradation in performance.  UIPE is supported by an approved Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).  UIPE increment 2 will build on and increase capabilities attained in Increment 1.  In addition, Increment 2 will seek to address the broader scope of ICD requirements to include the capability to protect warfighters from operationally relevant traditional, non-traditional, and advanced CBRN\/TIM threats likely to be encountered during joint force operations."

Use of the \"IT Box\" acquisition approach increases flexibility and will expedite fielding of Information System products through a series of Build Decisions (BDs) versus less frequent traditional DoD Milestone B and C decisions.  Each program will use an Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) to describe the required operational capabilities for the development effort.  JEM's IS ICD was approved by the Joint Staff J8 Joint Requirements Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JRO-CBRND) in September 2013 and JWARN's IS ICD will be reviewed for approval in 2QFY14.  After the IS ICD is approved, more detailed requirements will be captured in Requirements Definition Packages (RDP) and will be approved at the Functional Capability Board (FCB) level.  In order to support an agile incremental approach, each program will ensure that the \"IT Box\" describes the entire IT program and not just a single increment.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  These limited fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities\/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.  As software-intensive systems both JEM and JWARN have no separately identifiable unit production components.  Both are designated ACAT III programs and unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost\/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC\/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable. \n \nJEM Increment 2, using IT Box Acquisition Strategy, adds capability to JEM Increment 1 including modeling of missile intercepts and improved modeling of hazard events in urban and littoral terrain.  It also includes improved architecture called Common CBRN Modeling Interface (CCMI).  Together, CCMI and IT Box enable more rapid and less costly integration of Science and Technology updates, aligning with the S&T provider to provide the most current capability to the warfighter.  Battlespace commanders and first responders must have a CBRN hazard prediction capability in order to make decisions that will minimize risks of CBRN contamination and enable them to continue mission operations.  JEM operates in an integrated fashion with operational and tactical Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and in a standalone mode.  JEM interfaces and communicates with the other programs such as JWARN, weather systems, intelligence systems, and various databases.  \n\nJWARN Increment 2 will provide an expansion of sensors that will connect to JWARN, increased automation of message handling, improved false alarm filtering, integration of route-planning calculator, and interoperability with additional Command and Control (C2), medical information and evolving Bio-Surveillance systems.  JWARN will be located in Command and Control Centers at the appropriate level and will be employed by CBRN defense specialists and other designated personnel to improve the efficiency of limited CBRN personnel assets.  This employment will transfer data automatically from existing sensors and to and from the future sensors to provide commanders with the capability to support operational decision making in a CBRN environment.  JWARN will integrate existing sensors into a sensor network or host C2 system, but does not provide the sensors that will be employed in the operating environment.  JWARN will transition from a Command and Control (C2) platform specific implementation to a Web-based Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) meeting the DoD's evolution to a more comprehensive Common Operating Environment (COE) and will operate as a standalone capability.  Activities include: logistical elements, support equipment, manuals and training required to operate and support the system.\n\nThe Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Integrated Architectures, Data Management\/Modeling, Information Assurance (IA), Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.  The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards.  The latest technologies\/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model.  These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users.  The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information."

This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP). The JWARN Program will procure a Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) (hardware materiel solution) in order to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).\n\nSOFTWARE SUPPORT ACTIVITY (SSA)\n\nThe SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  Phase 1a identifies CBDP programs that deal with data or software, and have an IT component.  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  (BA5 - System Development and Demonstration).   Phase 2 will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.

                            "val": "This Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) Project supports: \n\nThe Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) capability provides core and drug development services to include the establishment, commissioning, validation, and attainment of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP)\/Current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) for a Medical Countermeasure (MCM) ADM capability for the Department of Defense (DoD).\n\nThe ADM effort is being executed in two phases.  Phase 1 is for the establishment, commissioning, and validation of the ADM capability.  This project funds the establishment of a capability to be located in Alachua, Florida.  Two ADM cGMP suites, capable of operating at Bio Surety Level (BSL) 3 will be established during the base contract period.  There are contract options to incrementally increase capacity, if needed.  Upon attainment of cGMP capability Phase 2 begins.  During Phase 2, the contractor team will support and maintain the capability in a state of readiness to support MCM development (to include cGMP manufacturing) and assist in training personnel in its use.  The second phase includes transition and integration of new technologies to support MCM development activities, from pre-Investigational New Drug Application phase through FDA licensure.  Phase 1 and 2 contract was awarded in March 2013 to Nanotherapeutics, Inc., Alachua, FL.  The ADM capability sustainment costs during Phase 2 will originate from MCM programs.\n\nBiosurveillance (BSV) actively gathers, analyzes, and interprets collected information that includes biosphere data that relate to disease activity and threats to human or animal health in order to achieve early warning of health threats, early detection of health events, and overall situational awareness of disease activity.  BSV will align the biosurveillance efforts across DoD and national strategies.  BSV will scope and influence BSV capabilities as products to meet Warfighter requirements through innovative management of key BSV initiatives.  BSV requirements address medical and physical CBRN mission needs spanned in over 11 requirements documents and through Combatant Commander (COCOM) identified needs.  BSV funds will support Joint US Forces Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat recognition (JUPITR) ATD\/BSV ATD which will find, demonstrate, transition, and transfer the best operational concepts and technology solutions in support of a holistic approach to countering biological threats from the laboratory to operational use and theater confirmation of a Biological Event.  JUPITR ATD will consist of four legs; Early Warning (EW), Biological Identification Capabilities Sets (BICS), Assessment of Environmental Detectors (AED), and Biosurveillance Portal (BSP).  The JUPITR ATD will provide the USFK with a holistic Biosurveillance capability to provide early warning, detection, collection, identification, and theater confirmation of a Biological event.  The JUPITR ATD consists of filling capability gaps through information sharing and communication systems and detection\/diagnostic systems for the USFK.  Outputs will focus on proving component, CONOPS, and subsystem transition into programs of record (PORs) and\/or integration into existing PORs.\n\nThe Countermeasures for Multi-Drug Resistance-Bacterial (CMDR-B) program develops medical countermeasures (MCMs) for Service members for protection against multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, including Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR.  The resulting product(s) will be US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures.  Leveraging collaborative Department of Defense (DoD), United States Government, and industry efforts will reduce program risk, lower program cost, and accelerate delivery of therapeutics to the Warfighter.  The program will advance MCM candidates against MDR bacterial diseases such as anthrax and plague through the Technology Development phase. \n\nThe Emerging Infectious Diseases Therapeutics (EID Tx) program is developing and will deliver a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, broad-spectrum medical countermeasure to the Warfighter for protection against naturally occurring or biologically engineered viruses.  EID Tx is pursuing influenza indication, EID-Flu MCM, as the first step in the development of a broad spectrum antiviral drug due to a clear and established FDA regulatory approval pathway.  The drug in development is highly efficacious against multiple influenza viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, H5N1 avian influenza virus, the most recently identified H7N9 virus from the outbreak in China, and drug resistant strains of influenza viruses.  This drug has also demonstrated efficacy against other viruses of concern to the DoD's biodefense program.  Ongoing EID Tx drug development will be leveraged to demonstrate additional broad-spectrum MCM's against naturally occurring and\/or engineered biowarfare threats.  Initial testing to support FY15 down-select for follow-on label extension programs has begun.  FDA approval for an influenza treatment is anticipated in FY16 following completion of the SDD phase.  \n\nThe Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (HFV) medical countermeasure acquisition program develops medical countermeasures (MCMs), using high threat, extremely lethal Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) of the Filoviridae family agents (Ebola and Marburg) as model systems.  Medical countermeasures will be advanced through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure\/approval via the FDA 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s) when human testing is not ethically feasible.  HFV will also conduct animal model development and refinement as needed to support the pivotal animal efficacy testing required under the FDA 'Animal Rule'.  Completion of Phase I trials, animal model development, and manufacturing scale up are the focus of the ACD&P phase.  FDA approval for HFV therapeutics are expected in FY18 following completion of the SDD phase.  \n\nThe NGDS is an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System.  The mission of the NGDS is to provide CBRN threat identification and FDA-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment and CBRN situational awareness and disease surveillance.  NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component will significantly improve diagnostic capabilities for deployable combat health support units (role 3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability.  The term \"Role\" is used to describe the stratification of the four tiers in which medical support is organized, on a progressive basis, to conduct treatment, evacuation, resupply, and functions essential to the maintenance of the health of the force.  Role 3 support is normally provided at Division or Service equivalent level and includes specialist laboratory resources.  NGDS Increment 2 is intended to provide advanced diagnostics for biological pathogens and toxins, diagnostics for chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) funds the technology development phase for vaccines that are directed against validated biological warfare (BW) weapons to include bacteria, viruses, and toxins of biological origin.  Effective medical countermeasures to negate the threat of these biological warfare (BW) agents are urgently needed.  Vaccines have been identified as the most efficient countermeasure against the validated threat of BW weapons.  The Trivalent Filovirus Vaccine (VAC FILO) Program will offer protection against the threat of Ebola and Marburg viruses.  The current budget supports development of two prototypes through the Technology Development Phase.  The DoD anticipates that the Food Drug Administration (FDA) will approve this vaccine using the 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy on relevant animal model(s).  During this phase a scalable manufacturing process is developed.  This process will be used to develop current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots suitable for a Phase 1 clinical trial.  In addition, animal safety and efficacy studies will be conducted to support an Investigational New Drug (IND) submission to the FDA.  These efforts will support a Milestone B decision and entry into the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase.  The DoD is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of the Filovirus Vaccine.\n\nThe Ricin toxin is a validated bioweapon threat due to its availability and efficiency of production.  The program supports one DoD vaccine candidate including manufacturing cGMP lots; proof of concept nonclinical efficacy studies and assay development.  These efforts also include a Phase 1b clinical trial and regulatory integration.  These efforts will support a Milestone B decision and entry into the EMD Phase.  The DoD is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of the Ricin Vaccine.\n\nThe DoD initiated the Western, Eastern, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VAC WEVEE) Vaccine program in FY13.  To satisfy the competitive prototyping requirement and to reduce program risk, the DoD will develop two prototypes through the Technology Development Phase.  The efforts to be conducted during this period include: develop pilot scale manufacturing processes and manufacture of cGMP lots to support nonclinical and clinical studies; develop vaccine formulation that meets the logistical requirements of the DoD; conduct non-clinical GLP safety studies; submit Investigational New Drug (IND) applications; and conduct Phase 1 clinical human safety studies.\n\nThe DoD anticipates that the FDA will approve these products using the 'Animal Rule', which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s).  These efforts will support a Milestone B decision and entry into the EMD phase.  The DoD is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of the WEVEE Vaccine."

                            "val": "ADVANCED DEVELOPMENT & MANUFACTURING  (ADM)\n\nThe ADM capability awarded a competitive ten (10) year [two base years with four 2 year options] Cost Plus Fixed fee (CPFF) contract to Nanotherapeutics, Inc., Alachua, FL.\n\nBIOSURVEILLANCE (BSV)\n\nBSV is the delivery of a set of capabilities to acquire, integrate, and analyze medical, environmental, and incident management data using existing and next generation systems, medical and non-medical sample collection tools and identifiers\/diagnostics; and transition hardware\/software tools and devices as residuals from the Biosurveillance Joint USFK Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  Lessons learned from the ATD will be transitioned to the programs of record associated with the CBDP.  The acquisition strategy will address the materiel solutions identified out of the multiple Biosurveillance (BSV) related Analysis of Alternatives (AoA's).\n\nCOUNTERMEASURES FOR DRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA (CMDR-B)\n\nThe CMDR-B program develops MCMs for MDR bacteria, including BWAs and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR.  The resulting product(s) will be US FDA-approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures. The CMDR-B Program acquisition strategy is to employ a full and open competition approach with an anticipated Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) contract.  CMDR-B will follow an integrated acquisition and regulatory pathway to achieve FDA approval for drug candidates.  The CMDR-B Program intends to fund multiple candidates to address competitive prototyping and mitigate drug development risk.   In FY13, a Market Survey and RFI were completed assessing current anti-bacterial countermeasure technologies. Results confirmed technologies exist that are of sufficient maturity to enter advanced development. CMDR-B is establishing collaborative relationships with DoD, other USG entities and international partners to reduce program risk, lower program cost, and accelerate delivery of MCMs to the Warfighter.  Milestone A is anticipated in FY15.  Upon Milestone A approval, the program will advance MCM candidates against MDR bacterial diseases (e.g., anthrax and plague) through the Technology Development phase. In FY16-17 CMDR-B will initiate and complete Phase I clinical studies. CMDR-B anticipates an FY17 Milestone B decision to continue toward a New Drug Application (NDA) and FDA approval\/licensure.\n\nEMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES - THERAPUTIC (EID TX)\n\nThe goal of the EID Tx program is to develop a safe and effective MCM against biothreats of interest to the DoD. The first step of the acquisition strategy is to develop an MCM for influenza due to a clear and established FDA regulatory approval pathway.  The Phase 2 clinical trial is complete, demonstrating both safety and efficacy in humans.  Program was authorized by FDA to move forward at End of Phase 2 meeting on 3 SEP 13.  Phase 3 clinical trials for EID Tx against influenza began during 1QFY14.  Following successful FDA approval of the drug against influenza, EID Tx will utilize an incremental approach to label extensions of this broad spectrum therapeutic. The development strategy for additional label extensions of the antiviral drug consists of detailed characterization of antiviral activities of the broad-spectrum compound against multiple virus families using cell-based and animal model systems.  Using the results of the cell-based assays efficacy assessment of the drug against high-priority viruses of biodefense concern will be performed using small animal studies. The results of the small animal testing will determine the best candidate to move forward for the Label Extension starting in FY15.\n\nHEMORRHAGIC FEVER VIRUS (HFV)\n\nThe acquisition strategy uses a parallel evaluation of drug candidates against the lethal Ebola Zaire and Marburg viruses.  Following a successful Milestone B and entry into SDD phase, the program will conduct expanded human clinical safety studies, definitive animal efficacy, and toxicology studies, required for FDA approval.  The performer(s) will submit a New Drug Application(s) for the Ebola Zaire and Marburg therapeutics during the SDD Phase.  During the Production and Deployment phase, full rate manufacturing and stockpile production will be pursued.  If the FDA mandates post-marketing surveillance studies, they will be conducted during Production and Deployment.\n\nNEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)\n\nThe Next Generation Diagnostics System (NGDS) will develop and field a family of enhanced CBRN analytical and diagnostic systems to the Joint force through an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  NGDS Increment 1 Deployable Component will develop FDA cleared Biological Warfare Agent (BWA) in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays for an existing Commercial diagnostic device with a well established FDA regulatory history and a pipeline of commercial non-BWA infectious disease diagnostic tests.  Additional DoD-unique BWA diagnostic and environmental surveillance capabilities will be added to the downselected instrument after MS C.  BA4 funds are used for NGDS Incr 1 throughout the FY12-15 Technology Development phase in accordance with the streamlined MS A to MS C acquisition strategy.  Specifically, NGDS Incr 1 BA4 funds are used to conduct competitive prototyping, early operational assessments, development of 6 BWA IVD assays (Anthrax, Ebola, Marburg, Plague, Tularemia and Q-Fever), 22 BWA surveillance assays and multiservice operational test prior to MS C.\n\nNGDS Increment 2 will use BA4 funds FY14-16 to conduct technology development prior to MS B.  The acquisition strategy and capability to be developed will be determined by the results of the Analysis of Alternatives to be completed 2QFY14.  NGDS Incr 2 is intended to be complementary to NGDS Incr 1 to expand the breath of diagnostics to CBRN threats, pre-symptomatic diagnostics and far forward echelons of care.\n\nFILOVIRUS (VAC FILO)\n\nThe Government will develop two Filovirus vaccine candidates through a Phase 1 clinical trial.  The Government will serve as the integrator for the Technology Development Phase by managing and coordinating the various vaccine development contracts.  At MS B, the best prototype will be selected through a full and open competition to transition to the Engineering & Manufacturing Development  (EMD) Phase with delivery of a FDA licensed Filovirus Vaccine.  The development contracts will be a mix of Cost Plus and Firm Fixed Price.  In addition, the Program Office will partner with DoD agencies and laboratories to include U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.  This Department of Defense program is the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of this vaccine, and is leveraging expertise across the Federal and International sectors to ensure programmatic success.\n\nRICIN VACCINE (VAC RIC)\n\nA ricin vaccine will protect against exposure to the ricin toxin, an identified BW threat.  The Government will serve as the integrator during this phase by managing and coordinating the various vaccine development efforts.  Additionally, the Program Office will partner with DoD agencies and laboratories to include U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.  FY13-FY14 funding will allow the completion of essential efforts needed to support a Milestone B decision. These efforts include manufacturing of cGMP lots,  proof of concept efficacy studies, and assay development.  These efforts also include a Phase I Clinical Trial to measure the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in humans.  IND submission and Phase 1b Clinical Trial are the final requirements for a Milestone B\n\nWESTERN EASTERN VENEZUELAN EQUINE ENCEPH VACCINE (VAC WEVEE)\n\nThe WEVEE acquisition strategy uses a parallel evaluation of two vaccine candidates through a Phase 1 clinical trial to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Development phase.  The Government will serve as the integrator during this phase by managing and coordinating the various vaccine development efforts.  At MS B, the best prototype will be selected through a full and open competition to transition to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, with delivery of a FDA-licensed WEVEE vaccine.  The development efforts will be a Cost Plus and Firm Fixed Price CLINs.  Additionally, the Program Office will partner Health and Human Services\/National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (HHS\/NIAID), DoD agencies, and laboratories to include U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USMRIID).

A family-of-systems approach for medical defense against chemical warfare agents is required to provide protection, to sustain performance in a chemical environment, and to provide for self-aid\/buddy-aid and medical treatment of chemical casualties.  Fielding of prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs and medical devices requires Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.  Given the family-of-systems approach for development of chemical MCMs for the treatment of nerve agent intoxication, multiple long-term studies are required to obtain FDA approval to deliver products that effectively integrate with current and projected therapeutic regimens.  Efficacy testing of most candidate drugs against chemical warfare agents cannot be conducted in humans; therefore, animal surrogate models must be developed and employed.  The program currently funds: Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) an enhanced nerve agent treatment regimen consisting of an improved oxime to replace the current fielded oxime 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM), product formulation enhancements to increase survival, and expanded pretreatment indications for the use of pyridostigmine bromide (PB), the active component of Soman Nerve Agent Pretreatment Pyridostigmine (SNAPP)."

The components of the INATS program include: 1) development of a broad spectrum oxime that is effective against emerging threats to replace the fielded currently fielded oxime 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM); 2) product formulation enhancements to increase survival; and 3) expanded pretreatment indications for pyridostigmine bromide (PB).  During the Technology Development Phase, the system integrator will oversee conduct of formulation development efforts, nonclinical toxicology and efficacy studies, Phase 1 human clinical safety studies as well as nonclinical studies to obtain FDA approval for expanding the indications for PB.  Following a successful Milestone B and entry in to the Engineering and Manufacturing (EMD) Phase, the system integrator will continue to exercise management oversight with system integration support from a commercial partner or partners to ensure that the development and manufacture of the INATS is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines.  Prior to FDA licensure, the commercial partner(s) will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, nonclinical toxicology studies and definitive animal efficacy studies. The system integrator will also manufacture an improved oxime formulation and autoinjector delivery system that is stable under operationally relevant temperatures.  The system integrator will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval for the INATS product.  During the Production and Deployment Phase, the system integrator, in conjunction with a commercial partner, will pursue full rate and stockpile production and will conduct any FDA mandated post-marketing surveillance studies.  The system integrator will transfer contracting and logistical responsibilities to the Defense Logistics Agency during the Operations and Support Phase however, as the total life-cycle manager the system integrator will monitor program performance through disposal."

Treatment of R\/N casualties depends on effective use of multiple medical capabilities in an integrated manner.  There are currently no FDA-approved prophylactic, therapeutic, or biodosimetry capabilities against ARS.  Thus, this program supports the development of medical radiological countermeasures (MRADC) using a family-of-systems approach to provide a full spectrum medical capability including prophylactics, therapeutics, and biodosimetry to protect Warfighters against the radiation threat and to mitigate the medical consequences of exposure to ionizing radiation.  \t\n\nMRADC efforts include development of multiple countermeasures to prevent, limit, or reverse the myriad of injuries caused by exposure to radiation resulting in increased survival, decreased incapacity, and sustained operational effectiveness of U.S. Forces.  In addition, MRADC will be effective against a broad range of ionizing radiation sources and types and will be useable throughout the full spectrum of healthcare operations."

In support of the MOU, the DoD has entered into Interagency Agreements (IAAs) with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), HHS's advanced developer, to promote the development of MRADC and the Strategic National Medical Radiation Countermeasures Portfolio.  Each contract performer whose work is supported through these IAAs will sponsor its drug to the FDA and hold all approvals and or licenses.  In accordance with the MRADC revised acquisition strategy, the DoD will harmonize DoD investments with HHS investments.

                            "val": "This funding supports the Chemical Biological Defense Portfolio (CBDP) Test Equipment, Strategy, and Support (TESS) efforts.  TESS provides test infrastructure products for testing and evaluating chemical and biological defense systems throughout the life cycle acquisition process in support of the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), Joint Project Managers, and the Test and Evaluation (T&E) community.  TESS test infrastructure products are aligned in three groups to include: (1) Sense Laboratory (Chemical); (2) Sense Laboratory (Biological); (3) Individual Protection, Collective Protection and Decontamination (Shield and Sustain); and (4) Field Simulant (Sense).\n\n(1) Sense Laboratory (Chemical): The product for this area is the Non-Traditional Agent Defense Test System (NTADTS).  The NTADTS provides a new capability at the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) to conduct chemical defense testing using new, emerging threat agents.  The NTADTS supports testing of decontamination, collective protection, individual protection, and contamination avoidance products.  The CBD acquisition programs supported are Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets Kits and Outfits (DR SKO), Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), Decon Family of Systems (DFoS), and Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS).  Future efforts will include the development of test methods and methodologies for additional classes of agents.\n\n(2) Sense Laboratory (Biological): The product for this area is the Joint Ambient Breeze Tunnel (JABT) and the Active Standoff Chamber (ASC).  The JABT and ASC improvements will provide a tech refresh to existing infrastructure and allow for test results to be integrated into the Test Grid data management system.\n\n(3) Individual Protection, Collective Protection and Decontamination (Shield and Sustain): The product for this area is the Chemical Biological Agent Resistance Test Fixture (CBART).  Defense Threat Reduction Agency is continuing to mature this technology prior to transition to the T&E community.  Projected location for this T&E capability is Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah.  CBART provides a state of the art material swatch test fixture for individual and collective protection systems.\n\n(4) Field Simulant (Sense): The product for this area is the Test Grid.  The Test Grid capability demonstrates test methodologies for chem and bio aerosols and advanced technologies.  The Test Grid effort provides a fully instrumented 20 km by 40 km field chemical and biological simulant test capability that integrates cloud tracking equipment; meteorological equipment; and test data network.  The CBD acquisition programs supported are the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP), Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS) and the Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS)."

These programs offer an opportunity to identify and efficiently mature emerging technologies from laboratory experiments to acquisition programs through risk reduction, engineering and integration.  These demonstrations and programs seek to demonstrate the potential for enhanced military operational capability and\/or cost effectiveness.  Upon conclusion of the technical and operational demonstrations, the user or sponsor provides a determination of the military utility and operational impact of the technology and capability demonstrated.  Successfully demonstrated technologies with proven military utility can either be left in place for extended user evaluations, accepted into advanced stages of the formal acquisition process, proceed directly into limited or full-scale production or be returned to the technical base for further development.  This project funds three family of products areas (one of which is a new thrust areas to address DoD emphasis on an interagency collaboration for biological detection, surveillance, recovery and resilience and is annotated as such below): Hazard Mitigation, Early Warning, and Biological Resiliency.  Hazard Mitigation addresses Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) remediation and decontamination processes and demonstrates technologies and methods to restore assets such as mobile equipment, fixed sites, critical infrastructures, personal, and equipment to operational status as a result of having reduced or eliminated CBR contamination.  The Early Warning family of products achieve enhanced command and control decision making capabilities as a result of a combined and orchestrated family of chemical and biological defense systems deployed on various platforms in remote locations.  Biological Resiliency efforts are targeted to reduce biological threats by: (1) improving DoD access to the life sciences to combat infectious disease regardless of its cause; (2) establishing and reinforcing DoD concept of operations (CONOPS) against the misuse of the life sciences; and (3) instituting a suite of coordinated DoD and interagency activities that collectively will help influence, identify, inhibit, and\/or interdict those who seek to misuse the life sciences."

ATDs and JCTDs emphasize technology assessment and integration rather than technology development.  The goal is to provide a prototype capability to the Warfighter and to support in the evaluation of that capability.  The Warfighters evaluate the capabilities in real military exercises and at a scale sufficient to fully assess military utility.  When possible, the ATDs will leverage results from existing chemical and biological science and technology (S&T) efforts and prior ATDs.  Market research\/baselining is performed prior to ATD initiation to determine if a suitable solution exists or whether a solicitation\/sole source is required to develop a solution.  The ATDs are typically managed by DoD, Federally Funded Research Development Centers (FFRDCs) or University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs).  This is done through the Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) or the Interagency Cost Reimbursable Order (IACRO) in accordance with the Economy Act.  In addition, the ATDs utilize the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Broad Area Announcement process to fund promising technologies between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 and TRL 6.  The ATD manager, who is typically responsible for total system development, can subcontract industry, academia, or other government agencies to perform individual component development."
