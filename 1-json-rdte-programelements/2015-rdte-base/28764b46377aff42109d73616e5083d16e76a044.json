MSS provides an integrated suite of enhancements to the combat vehicle crew member and commander to address identifiable capability gaps in their ability to fight, communicate, and maneuver across the full spectrum of operations.  MSS consists of lightweight, modular, and misison tailorable equipment and Command, Control, Communications and Computer (C4) devices worn, carried, or used by mounted crew members in performance of their missions.  Congressionally added funding in FY10 for Soldier Power efforts has been applied to the Soldier Power project line.  NW provides unparalleled situational awareness and understanding to the dismounted leader allowing for faster and more accurate decisions in the tactical fight.  This translates into Soldiers being at the right place, at the right time, with the right equipment making them more effective, more lethal, and more survivable in the execution of their combat mission. TCAPS enables Soldiers to communicate over radios in combat environments while simultaneously providing hearing protection from both steady state and impulse noise."

TCAPS also enhances survivability and situational awareness by allowing Soldiers to selectively amplify faint sounds that would not be otherwise audible. \n\nBy reducing noise-induced hearing damage, TCAPS contributes to the reduction of post-service disability compensation and limits lost in-service time related to hearing injury. TCAPS will employ commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution(s) that annually are evaluated. The best commercial solutions will cut into production. TCAPS will also evaluate lower cost active hearing protection solutions for soldiers without radios."

These improved systems enable the warfighter to sustain themselves for extended mission duration in the most austere operating environments.  An advanced, Integrated Soldier Power\/Data System (ISPDS) provides the Soldier with a worn power\/data capability that is significantly more efficient and lighter than carrying separate batteries for each device.  Soldier and Small Unit Power systems address the power and energy capability gap created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier-portable power consumers, such as Situational Awareness (SA) displays, Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation, weapon sensors, and portable Soldier radios. This effort began as a Congressional add for development and system improvement for early fuel cell and battery technology and has developed into a line of power sources and solutions suited for not only the individual Soldier, but for the small unit as well. These power solutions include, but are not limited to, Soldier-worn power systems, integrated power vests, power management devices and small unit chargers\/scavengers; all intended for use in the most austere operating environments. Soldier-portable power systems reduce the weight and logistical burden associated with moving fuel and primary (disposable) batteries across the conventional battlefield.  By using renewable energy and power scavenging technology, Soldiers and small units are able to operate independently for longer durations without being tethered to a large generator, vehicle, or supply train. This effort supports the August 2013 Small Unit Power MDD, September 2013 Small Unit Power Capability Development Document (CDD), March 2011 Soldier Protection CDD, the December 2011 Operational Energy Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the Army Chief of Staff's Squad: Foundation of the Decisive Force initiative, and the December 2011 Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) Operational Energy directives."

Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program, leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations. The NW system provides leaders electronic real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; a collaborative planning tool; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader. The NW system also provides the same integrated mission command capability to the tactical vehicle-mounted leaders so that when dismounted the leader still maintains the common operating picture (COP) and has continuous situational awareness. This capability provides unparalleled situational awareness and enhanced communications to the dismounted leader allowing for faster, more accurate decisions and reduced fratricide in the tactical fight. \n\nThe continued development and integration of the NW program harnesses soldiers' experience in combat operations and employs combat veterans for Soldier feedback enhancing human factor design and fightability of the system. The NW program also integrates applications from other programs aimed at considerably reducing the weight and bulk of the dismounted soldier's load by using End User Devices. This project funds the following: 1) Yearly developmental and operational test of the NW with continually advancing commercial smart device technology inserted, 2) Software development for planned updates, 3) Integration with AN\/PRC-154A, including vehicle power integration, 4) Government led integration and system engineering and program management, 5) Incorporation of other applications and capabilities into Nett Warrior, 6) and Conduct NW IOT&E with Mechanized and Infantry units in FY14 and FY15."

A Configuration Steering Board (CSB) was held August 2011 which restructured the program to implement COTS-based technology. Twice a year technology maturation and integration is assessed at NIE events. The NW MS C was approved 3 April 2012 followed by a low rate Capability Set (CS) 14 production award. Conducted Developmental Test and Evaluation during 4QFY12-1QFY13, followed by 1QFY13 Operational Test (OT) as well as hardware, software, integration and program management. The Developmental and Operational tests validated the system utility, supportability, and austere-environment power production and regeneration strategy that resulted in a production decision in the 2QFY13 to procure the CS14 quantity of NW systems and support. Conduct a 1QFY14 Operational Test, Developmental and Operational Tests during 2QFY14-3QFY14, as well as hardware, software, integration and program management. The Developmental and Operational tests will continue to validate the system utility, supportability, and austere-environment power production and regeneration strategy-leading to a production decision in the 2QFY14 to procure the CS15 quantity of NW systems and support. While in production NW also continues to reduce size, weight and power through a semi-annual integration and evaluation and test of the latest commercial smart device technologies which evolve continuously."
