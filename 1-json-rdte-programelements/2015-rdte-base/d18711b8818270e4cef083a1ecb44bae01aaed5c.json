The system will be developed in multiple releases as functional capabilities are defined and as integration and synchronization opportunities with related systems present opportunities for subsequent releases.  Release 1.2 (Wave 2) will be a viable stand alone capability that will not require subsequent releases to be operational.  \n\nGCSS-Army is being implemented in three releases to ensure program success. \n\nRelease 1.0 replaces: Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS) at one Direct Support Unit (DSU) in the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR), Fort Irwin, California. An Operational Assessment (OA) was conducted on Release 1.0 and information is gathered through Continuous Evaluation. \n\nRelease 1.1 subsumes Release 1.0 and replaces the SARSS, Property Book Unit Supply Enhanced (PBUSE), Standard Army Maintenance System - Enhanced (SAMS-E) and Standard Army Maintenance System Installation Enhanced (SAMS-IE) legacy systems. Moreover, it includes: Supply (Tactical and Installation Warehouse and Materiel Management); Field-level and Installation Based Maintenance; Property Accountability (Property Book, Unit Level Supply, and Unit Basic Load Ammunition); Force Element and Defense Forces Public Security (Allows Task Organization of Personnel, Equipment and Associated Property Accountability, Maintenance and Finance Actions); Store and Forward capability; Interoperability with STAMIS systems; Tactical and Installation Finance (Cost Management, Funds Distribution and Execution, Fund Status Reporting, and General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) Data Synchronization); Hub services; and Enterprise Master Data Management. Release 1.1 provides over 80% of the required GCSS-Army capability; it subsumes Release 1.0 and replaces the SARSS, Property Book Unit Supply Enhanced (PBUSE), Standard Army Maintenance System - Enhanced (SAMS-E) and Standard Army Maintenance System Installation Enhanced (SAMS-IE) legacy systems. \n\nRelease 1.2 (Wave 2) provides enhanced capabilities such as disconnected operations,increased financial capabilities, expanded enterprise master data management and interface with the Aviation Logistics Enterprise - Platform (ALE-P) Program. Release 1.2 (Wave 2) does not by itself replace any additional Systems. Release 1.2 (Wave 2) represents the complete baseline with all required capabilities provided."

AESIP is the principle GCSS-Army Business Intelligence system and will aggregate data for enterprise reporting. AESIP will support the Army's federated approach and enable the integration of end-to-end logistical and financial processes. The Army has successfully addressed concerns about the lack of integration of ERPs by leveraging AESIP core capabilities and expanding those benefits across the Army enterprise. AESIP will be an Army specific commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) web portal implementation via the NetWeaver Platform from developer Systems Applications and Products (SAP) American Group to support Army process scenarios and requirements that will provide core competencies:\n\nEnterprise Service Bus (Hub Services) - For a Service oriented, Single Point of Entry to connect, mediate, and control the exchange of data.\nEnterprise Business Intelligence\/Business Warehouse - Aggregates data from ERP and non-ERP systems to provide flexible Enterprise level reporting.\nEnterprise Master Data Management - For a single source of authoritative data and improved workflow and business processes. \n\nThe AESIP solution establishes a framework for a fully integrated ERP centric environment that will ultimately provide Commanders Total Visibility from Factory to Battlefield thereby ensuring delivery of the right equipment to the right unit at the right time, while reducing backlogs of material on the battlefield."
