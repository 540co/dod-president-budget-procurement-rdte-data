Work is in support of current and future ground force operations.  Software and architectures for geospatial projects mature and validate geospatial decision tools in support of operations planning and decision making to advance utility for geospatial capability and techniques across the Army, services and coalition and to advance and mature the information architecture that supports the total Army's discovery and access to data, geospatial information and analytical tool suites.  Deployable Force Protection (DFP) activities are focused on filling critical gaps in protecting forces operating at smaller, remote bases and include maturation, integration, and demonstration of components, systems and systems of systems for rapidly deployable threat detection in direct line-of-site and non-line-of-site environments; situation assessment to help reduce false alarms and decrease manpower required to monitor the environment; passive protection to mitigate blasts, direct, and indirect fire effects; and active defense to suppress or eliminate threats and threat systems.  Work in survivability and force protection also includes maturing and demonstrating software to characterize blast effects generated from explosive events, such as improvised explosive device detonation in soils, and support design and decision aids.  Work in mobility and force projection includes maturing and demonstrating software and hardware to assess and improve freedom of movement for ground forces.  \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Ground and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) Portfolios.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nThis work is fully coordinated with and complementary to PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology).

The needs at these smaller bases (less than 300 persons, not all U.S. troops) are unique based on constraints in transportability, manpower, organic resources, lack of hardening of structures, resupply, and training for example. Moreover, lack of interoperability and scalability consume manpower and take away from time needed to perform missions. Threats include bases being overrun by hostiles; direct fire; rockets, artillery and mortars; and improvised explosive devices. Force protection challenges at these remote, smaller bases include providing increased standoff detection, blast and ballistic protection, and kinetic technologies subject to the constraints mentioned above.  This effort begins to fill a significant gap in force protection capabilities. This work is fully coordinated with PE0602784A\/T40, Deployable Force Protection; PE 0602786A; PE0603313A\/G03; and PE 0603125A.  Work is performed by Army, Navy, and Air Force labs and centers."
