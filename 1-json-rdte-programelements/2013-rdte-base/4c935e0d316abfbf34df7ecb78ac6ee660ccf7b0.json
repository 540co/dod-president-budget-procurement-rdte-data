The P5 Combat Training System (P5CTS), a collaborative development between USAF and USN, provides air combat training systems for both services at operational locations worldwide.  Increments include hardware and software upgrades,  an encrypted software communications architecture compliant Advanced Data Link to facilitate interoperability in a multiple independent level security environment and training with F-22A and F-35, internal pod replacement subsystems, integration of new aircraft Operational Flight Programs, and the development of solutions to enable live\/ virtual\/ constructive capabilities.

Consistent with the evolutionary acquisition strategy and documented ACC training requirements, development will continue with next generation threat systems. Future increments will continue to add additional capability to the warfighter's training ranges. This PE includes Legacy Range Threat Systems including Miniature Multiple Threat Emitter Systems-M3P (Mini-MUTES), Multiple Threat Emitter System (MUTES), Modular Threat Emitter (MTE) and Tactical Radar Threat Generator (TRTG), Band Simulator and Unmanned Modular Threat Emitter (UMTE) Systems, which are being considered for modernization that will extend the system's service life and allow for upgrades to antiquated components for increased reliability and capabilities. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5 - Systems Development and Demonstration because the CTR Program directly contributes to the effectiveness and survivability of US combat forces by providing training capabilities to simulate real combat conditions to prepare the warfighter for actual combat."

Consistent with the evolutionary acquisition strategy and documented ACC training requirements, development will continue with next generation threat systems. Future increments will continue to add additional capability to the warfighter's training ranges. This PE includes Legacy Range Threat Systems including Miniature Multiple Threat Emitter Systems-M3P (Mini-MUTES), Multiple Threat Emitter System (MUTES), Modular Threat Emitter (MTE) and Tactical Radar Threat Generator (TRTG), Band Simulator and Unmanned Modular Threat Emitter (UMTE) Systems, which are being considered for modernization that will extend the system's service life and allow for upgrades to antiquated components for increased reliability and capabilities. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5 - Systems Development and Demonstration because the CTR Program directly contributes to the effectiveness and survivability of US combat forces by providing training capabilities to simulate real combat conditions to prepare the warfighter for actual combat."
