            "val": "Defense-wide Manufacturing Science and Technology (DMS&T), established within the Manufacturing Technology Program directed in Title 10 USC Section 2521, provides the Department with a comprehensive manufacturing program to achieve the strategic goals of focused technology, improved acquisition across the life cycles, and cost-effective logistics.  By designing for manufacturability early in development, anticipated results will have an impact on increasing reliability and decreasing the life cycle burden of weapon systems. The mission to anticipate and close gaps in defense manufacturing capabilities and drive significant system life cycle affordability benefits makes DMS&T an increasingly important leveraging tool in the current budget environment.\n\t\t\t\nDMS&T will: 1) address manufacturing enterprise game-changing initiatives that are beyond the scope of any one Military Department or Defense Agency or platform and, 2) establish and mature cross-cutting manufacturing processes required for transitioning emerging technologies which impact the time lines, affordability, and productivity of acquisition programs and shorten the deployment cycle times.\n\t\t\t\nThe DMS&T program is fundamental to a coordinated development process.  Concurrent development of manufacturing processes with the S&T development enables the use of emerging technologies.  Key technical areas for investment for DMS&T include Advanced Electronics and Optics Manufacturing, Advanced Materials Manufacturing, and Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing.  Advanced Electronics and Optics addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of applications such as sensors, radars, power generation, switches, and optics for defense applications.  Advanced Materials addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of materials such as composites, metals, ceramics, nanomaterials, metamaterials, and low observables.  Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing addresses advanced manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include the industrial information infrastructure, advanced design\/qualification\/cost tools, supply network integration technologies and management practices, direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, machining; robotics, assembly, and joining."

Technology initiatives, in collaboration with the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) and industry, identify and develop investment strategies to advance the manufacturing processes needed to support the specific technology.  Above-the-shop-floor investments focus on new manufacturing processes that have potential to significantly improve manufacturing efficiencies. Single specific projects address investment opportunities not associated with selected technology initiatives and enable the program to respond to urgent, compelling manufacturing needs and provide seed funding to more high risk-high payoff technologies.\n \t\t\t\nData calls are launched through two methods to identify technology initiatives and single specific issues requiring investment.  One method is through the JDMTP.  The JDMTP is comprised of the ManTech Directors from the Services, Defense Logistics Agency, and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The call is distributed through the ManTech Directors to the four JDMTP sub panels: Metals Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Composites Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Electronics Processing and Fabrication Subpanel and Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise Subpanel. Potential candidates are evaluated by the JDMTP based on criteria set forth in the call and announcements and down-selected for further development prior to final selection.  The other method is through Broad Agency Announcements to industry.  Priority is given to investments that support affordability and producibility of critical enabling manufacturing technologies that cut across multiple platforms.  Investments also balance defense priorities in specialty materials, electronics, propulsion and power, and manufacturing processes including \"above the shop floor\" (lean and business technologies facilitating interoperable manufacturing).  Final projects are selected by the OSD ManTech Director, considering input from the JDMTP and Director of Manufacturing, and as approved by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (MIBP).

Cost will be reduced 5% - 10% and cycle time will be reduced by 10X-20X. The project will mature three manufacturing technologies for lighter weight armor from a capability to produce the technologies in a laboratory to a capability to produce them in an environment representative of a production facility. The three technologies are: 1) Dissimilar Material Assembly Technology to integrate ceramic, polymer adhesives, composites, and other organic and inorganic constituents into a unified body armor system. 2) Co-consolidation processing, to reduce cost and cycle time for the production of composite material enabling 10% lighter armor while maintaining ballistic performance. 3) Multi-scale modification of ballistic ceramics and associated processes, which will include new additive processes and metallic substrates to improve ballistic integrity and manage adverse shock events due to ballistic impact."

The open architecture configuration will allow upgrades for new technologies over the lifetime of the program as well as offer lower cost via open competition for the radar\u2019s building blocks.

Manufacturing technology improvements will have a direct impact on the rate and quantity of this capability delivered to current operations. This effort will provide the Navy with the first truly open architecture radar solution that will be able to accommodate different MMIC technologies, Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) technologies, processor, and power supplies from multiple vendors.

The size, weight, power, and cost components of conventional atomic clocks are too high for tactical applications. Chip Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) provides improved long-term frequency stability that gets integrated into long-term time accuracy. The focus of this project is to leverage DARPA investments in the CSAC technology to reduce operational costs and transition beyond custom fabrication of the current CSAC.  Objectives include improving the existing batch manufacturing processes such as atomic cell filling, cell sealing, physics package assembly, and sub-system testing to reduce the \u201ctouch hours\u201d required for CSAC assembly and testing. Development of a network of multiple vendors to foster competition and ensure a viable supply base is a complementary goal. Current manual assembly processes can produce CSAC in small quantities with low yield at high cost ($8,000 \/ unit).  The DMS&T funding will enable producibility at an affordable cost ($100 \u2013 300 \/ unit). Successful performance will enable an environment of continued operation of critical C4ISR systems, regardless of the presence or absence of GPS.

Fabrication of large carbon fiber composite parts is limited by the small number of existing large autoclaves that are currently tied up with Boeing 787 and F-35 production.  In addition, the high capital cost of buying large autoclaves is prohibitive.  The ability to use less expensive ovens, coupled with the use of resins at lower cure temperatures, will allow more suppliers to enter the market and fabricate a greater number of larger carbon fiber composite parts at lower costs.  The initial phase of this project focused on the development of the fiber placement process.  The goal is to demonstrate the lay down rates required to meet projected fabrication rates of quality laminates with autoclave-equivalent mechanical performance.

Field Assisted Sintering Technology (FAST) is a new technology that has the potential to dramatically reduce cycle time and manufacturing costs, and to maintain the beneficial characteristics of nano-structured materials. The FAST process passes a pulsed direct current through the part while it is pressed in a die, and the combination of rapid heating and compressive loading results in fine grained, fully dense materials in short processing times that are not possible with conventional sintering processes. Many parts that are made with a powder press and sinter process are candidates for FAST, but this project will focus on ceramic body and vehicle armor, tungsten kinetic energy penetrators, infrared windows, heat sinks for electromagnetic propulsion cooling, and hypersonic and high temperature for enhanced performance jet propulsion. The project will mature the technology, resulting in reduced cost and cycle times for conventional materials, and higher performance for nano-structured materials."
