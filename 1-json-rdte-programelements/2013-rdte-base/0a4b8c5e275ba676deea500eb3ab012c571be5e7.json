Small incremental co-investments with DoD, other government agencies, and commercial organizations allows USSOCOM to influence the schedule and direction of technology developments, emerging technologies, and capabilities for Special Operations Forces (SOF), with significant economies of investment.  This USSOCOM investment strategy is used to link technology opportunities with USSOCOM capability deficiencies, capability objectives; technology thrust areas, and technology objectives.  Requirements in these areas may be advertised to industry and government research and development agencies via broad area announcements and calls for white papers.  Sub-projects within the Special Operations Technology Demonstration effort include:  \n\n     \u2022  Rapid Exploitation of Innovative Technologies (REITS).  Beginning in FY 2012, funds were moved to PE 1160402BB, Special Operations Advanced Technology Development, to more accurately reflect the correct budget activity for projects in this subproject.  REITS provides USSOCOM the ability to identify, assess and exploit emerging innovative technologies for SOF capability deficiencies and expedite technology transitions from the laboratory to operational use.  These technologies provide new transformational capabilities and immediate operational impacts, while providing a compass for the direction of future SOF procurement.  \n\n    \u2022  REITS C4, ISR, and Sensors Capability Area.  Develop technologies that provide SOF with improved situational awareness and communications and computer resources in all environments. Develop and discover technologies offering significant improvements in areas such as: enhanced sensors; enhanced command and control architectures and solutions; information consolidation, dissemination, and coordination; improved man-machine interface; covert secure communications; and effective antenna solutions.          \n\n     \u2022  REITS Mobility, Power and Energy Capability Area.  Exploit and develop technologies to improve the performance and survivability, and reduce the detectability of SOF mobility assets.  Develop and discover technologies offering significant improvements in ground, sea, and air mobility areas such as: increased range\/operational environment; improved durability; power\/propulsion systems including new fuel sources, and reduced signature.\n\n    \u2022  REITS Warrior Systems and Bio-Medical Capability Area.  Exploit and develop technologies to increase the SOF warrior's survivability and performance.  Develop and discover technologies offering significant improvements in areas such as:  improved target identification and engagement, human identification, electro-optical vision systems, sensor fusion, human endurance, SOF medical equipment, operator safety, and improved weapons and accessories.\n\n    \u2022  Special Operations Technology Development Sub-Project:  This project conducts studies and develops laboratory prototypes for applied research and advanced technology developments, and leverages other organizations' technology projects that may not otherwise be affordable within MFP-11.\n\n                 \u2022  Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (TTL) Sub-Project:  TTL technologies are a key element in the ability of SOF to find, fix, and finish targets in overseas contingency operations (OCO).  This sub-project invests in critical science and technology efforts to improve operational capabilities for TTL high value individuals and objects in support of the OCO.  \n\n       \u2022  Classified Sub-Project (provided under separate cover).   \n\n       \u2022  The following technology activity was added by congress in FY 2011:  \n\n       \u2022  Congressional add:  Unfunded Requirement - Increased development of multi-spectral optics which will address night vision capability gaps; concentrated on power requirements for SOF mobility platforms; and initiated efforts to address biometric and non-lethal engagement needs.
