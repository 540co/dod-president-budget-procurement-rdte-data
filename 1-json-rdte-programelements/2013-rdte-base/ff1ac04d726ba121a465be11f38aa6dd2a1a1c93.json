            "val": "The mission of USSTRATCOM is to establish and provide full-spectrum global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives, and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control Communications and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter.  This mission has been defined by the 2002 Unified Command Plan (UCP) changes 1 and 2.  To enable completion of these missions, USSTRATCOM is modernizing the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as SWPS), developing information systems and techniques to counter and conduct Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) and establishing a unified national architecture integrating disparate Missile Warning\/Missile Defense (MW\/MD) systems into a single Internet Protocol (IP)-based system known as the Global Sensor Integrated Network (GSIN) to provide redundant and unambiguous MW\/MD data to national leadership.  When the ISPAN modernization is complete the system will support the warfighter in both deliberate and adaptive planning environments while allowing the National Command Authorities to employ the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons.  The ISPAN system will continue to evolve as weapon systems are matured, new systems are developed, and the threat changes, particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).   \n\nNavigation Warfare (NAVWAR) is a warfighting application of electronic warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO) and space control (SC) employing various techniques and technologies to negate or prevent hostile use of positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information and protect unimpeded use of PNT information by U.S., Allied, and Coalition Forces while not unduly disrupting peaceful use outside an area of operation.  The Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) was established to integrate and coordinate NAVWAR PNT capabilities across the mission areas of intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, information operations, electronic warfare, and space control.  The JNWC is also commissioned to integrate NAVWAR into space operations and assists the warfighter with subject matter expertise to \u201coperationalize\u201d NAVWAR, encouraging the NAVWAR view that the Global Positioning System is a taskable weapons system in addition to being a worldwide PNT service.  The JNWC establishes and maintains the Department\u2019s premier basis of NAVWAR expertise, and provides subject matter expertise and knowledge support to warfighters, Department decision makers, the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure), and the coalition through testing and evaluation; modeling, simulation and analysis; and exercise and training support.  \n\nThe Nation's strategic C2, sensors and mission planning programs can not rapidly exchange information across multiple missions, creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes.  GSIN establishes a unified national architecture integrating disparate MW\/MD systems into a single IP-based system providing redundant and unambiguous MW\/MD data to national leadership.  GSIN nets together all sensors, from tactical to strategic, including the Nation's most modern and capable assets - taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts.  GSIN will permit an IP-based User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP)to augment voice conferencing and rapidly build a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time senior collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) and decision-making. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This mission has been defined by the 2002 Unified Command Plan (UCP) changes 1 and 2. To enable these missions, the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as SWPS) must be capable of both deliberate and adaptive planning employing the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons. The planning system will continue to evolve as weapon systems are matured, new systems are developed, and the threat changes, particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).\n\nThe ISPAN modernization program includes initiation of Course of Action (COA) Development as a service to the DoD enterprise, workflow and decision support development, Combatant Commander (COCOM) Collaboration, User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP)), conventional mission planning integration, and Mission Planning Analysis System (MPAS) maintenance and modernization. This includes software coding, integration of multiple internal and external planning applications, as well as developmental and early operational test activities. ISPAN also includes automated data processing equipment (ADPE), software, facilities support, manpower, and training to support the mission objectives of ISPAN, associated deployable and distributed data processing nodes, and subsidiary systems. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) is a warfighting application of electronic warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO), and space control (SC) employing various techniques and technologies to negate or prevent hostile use of positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information and protect unimpeded use of PNT information by U.S., Allied, and Coalition Forces while not unduly disrupting peaceful use outside an area of operation. The Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) integrates and coordinates NAVWAR PNT capabilities across the mission areas of intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, information operations, electronic warfare, cyber and space control. The JNWC establishes and maintains the Department\u2019s premier basis of NAVWAR expertise, and provides subject matter expertise and knowledge support to warfighters, Department decision makers, the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure), and the coalition through testing and evaluation; modeling, simulation and analysis; and exercise and training support. In recent years, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has become one of the most critical enablers of modern, advanced technology warfare. In an era where everything from advanced weapons systems to basic goods and services are tracked or guided by navigation systems such as GPS, Navigation Warfare is an interest and concern, especially if those systems are interrupted or lost. Likewise, as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) proliferate, it becomes necessary to consider not only denying adversary use of GPS but also negating adversary use of alternate GNSS systems for PNT. The primary mission of the JNWC is to provide joint warfighter NAVWAR support through three broad mission areas:\n\na. Warfighter Operational Support \u2013 The JNWC applies knowledge of PNT vulnerabilities, prevention capabilities, and system operations to integrate NAVWAR as an element of warfighting operations. The JNWC provides reach-back capabilities to assist in resolving NAVWAR issues, address situations involving degradation or denial of PNT capabilities, and recommend actions to mitigate effects of both hostile and non-hostile events. The JNWC develops and maintains current information for the warfighter and theater commanders to include assessments of adversary capabilities, assessments of coalition capabilities and limitations, and other topics of special interest. The JNWC also provides subject matter expertise and knowledge support to Department acquisition and policy decision makers, the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure), and the coalition.\n\nb. Test, Training, Exercises, and Experiments \u2013 This JNWC mission area is the centerpiece for maintaining NAVWAR currency of information for the warfighter. The JNWC conducts annual NAVWAR field test events, and provides NAVWAR technical assistance for training, exercises and experiments. The JNWC, as part of this effort, maintains Integrated Joint NAVWAR Test Roadmaps and current intelligence products on adversary NAVWAR capabilities and Coalition NAVWAR capabilities and vulnerabilities. JNWC GYPSY field test events focus on fielded operational systems and capabilities to integrate NAVWAR and PNT operations, to baseline current NAVWAR electronic protection, support, and attack capabilities, and to assist warfighters optimize and deconflict theater\/tactical assets. JNWC FORTUNE field test events are more engineering focused and are used to evaluate specific NAVWAR capabilities or vulnerabilities, and to reduce engineering risk for GYPSY events. Test, training, exercise and experiment activities: 1) prepare the joint warfighter for operations in current and rapidly evolving NAVWAR threat environments; 2) establish priorities, standardized operational procedures for tactics, techniques, and procedures; 3) test electronic attack CONOPs to endure deconfliction and optimization with other operations to mitigate blue force fratricide; and 4) evolve standardized test methods.\n\nc. Navigation Warfare Information Analysis Center (IAC) \u2013 The JNWC develops and maintains methods, standards, models and simulations used in NAVWAR analysis and operates the NAVWAR Information Analysis Center (IAC). JNWC evaluates new models for accuracy and applicability to specific situations and rapidly evolving threat environments. It also develops and maintains standard test methodologies created solely by the U.S. as well as test methods developed in collaboration with coalition partners. These standard methodologies ensure data sharing is efficient and effective, and ensures accurate feedback to the operational communities. The JNWC, as part of this effort, manages the GPS EA Frequency Clearance process and conducts independent analysis and verification of EA frequency clearance requests. It also maintains and upgrades the Global Positioning System Reliability Prediction Model (GPS-RPM) frequency clearance model as required and conducts modeling and simulation exercises on GPS interference to include test and exercise threat laydowns for DoD organizations unable to perform their own modeling. The NAVWAR IAC serves as a source of NAVWAR information and technical expertise for DoD researchers, engineers, program managers, warfighters, testers, and others. It collects, analyzes, synthesizes, and disseminates scientific and technical information in clearly defined specialized subject areas. It promotes standardization by: 1) providing in-depth analyses; 2) creating products that respond to technical inquiries; 3) preparing state-of-the-art reports, handbooks, and databases; 4) conducting technology assessments; and 5) supporting the exchange of information within the NAVWAR community. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This mission has been defined by the 2002 Unified Command Plan (UCP) changes 1 and 2. GSIN nets together all sensors, from tactical to strategic, including the Nation's most modern and capable assets, taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts. GSIN will permit an IP-based User Defined Operating Picture (UDOP) to augment voice conferencing and rapidly build a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time senior collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) and decision-making.\n\nThe Nation's strategic C2, sensors and mission planning programs can not rapidly exchange information across multiple missions, creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes. The problem is most evident in the Department's missile warning (MW) and missile defense (MD) programs. GSIN establishes a unified national architecture integrating disparate MW\/MD systems into a single IP-based system providing redundant and unambiguous MW\/MD data to national leadership. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
