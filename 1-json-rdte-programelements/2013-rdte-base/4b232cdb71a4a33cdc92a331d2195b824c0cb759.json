        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "Mission: AWACS is the premier airborne platform providing command and control (C2)\/battle management (BM) to Commander In Chief and combatant commander tasking for joint, allied, and coalition operations, humanitarian relief, and homeland defense. AWACS provides a real-time picture of friendly, neutral, and hostile air activity. Its capabilities include all-altitude\/all-weather surveillance of the battle space; early warning of enemy actions; a real-time ability to find, fix, track, and assess airborne or maritime threats; and detection, location, and identification of electronic emitters.\n\nThis program element funds three areas in support of the AWACS program:  1. AWACS Modernization, 2. AWACS Infrastructure and Support Systems, and 3. Material Solutions Development and Analysis. Each of the three areas includes studies and analysis to support both current planning and execution, as well as future program planning.\n\n1. AWACS Modernization (RDT&E, AF):\n\na. Block 40\/45 is replacing AWACS 1970's vintage mission systems that are experiencing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, are difficult and expensive to upgrade, and limit overall AWACS system performance. The Block 40\/45 upgrade will improve integration, quality and timeliness of sensor data to the shooter, improve Combat Identification (CID), improve AWACS contribution to Time Critical Targeting via Data Link Infrastructure (DLI), improve electronic support measures processing and enable more effective, faster upgrades via an open-system, Ethernet-based architecture. The upgrade will also update the ground support infrastructure including training systems.\n\nb. The Next Generation Identification Friend or Foe (NGIFF) Program provides AWACS with enhanced IFF interrogator operation to add a more secure Mode 5 capability. NSA declared IFF Mode 4 unsecure and obsolete on 5 Nov 2003. Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo 047-07 requires IFF Mode 5 interrogation capability by FY14. The new Mode 5 interrogation capability extends the effective range of the AWACS interrogator, while helping discriminate against closely spaced cooperative targets. NGIFF developed and integrated a basic Mode 5 capability on Block 30\/35 starting in FY09 and began developing a full Mode 5 on Block 40\/45 in FY11. Hardware will be common between the platforms. NGIFF will also integrate Mode S, a civilian air traffic control capability residing in the NGIFF hardware, as funding allows.\n\nc. Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) Replacement of Avionics for Global Operations and Navigation (DRAGON) completes the FAA\/International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)\/ EUROCONTROL air traffic control mandated safety of flight capabilities. This program will provide the E-3 fleet with the flight instruments and other avionics for the Required Navigation Performance (RNP), and the surveillance and communication capabilities necessary to maintain continued critical unrestricted access to global airspace. Non-compliance will result in airspace restrictions and denials that will impact AWACS ability to support worldwide responses to situations requiring immediate on-scene command and control (C2) battle management. The DRAGON modifications replace the existing DMS Global Positioning System (GPS) Integrated Navigation System (GINS) with a modern Flight Management System (FMS) that will accommodate new capabilities including Mode 5 IFF and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). Also included as part of the modification is the addition of data link communications, voice and data link digital radios, and improved visual displays. Emphasis on employment of COTS avionics is expected to lower cost, reduce the tech refresh cycle, and enhance life cycle management. Replacement of critical avionics subsystems that became unsustainable beginning in 2010 is included in the DRAGON program. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of DRAGON is being executed cooperatively between the US and NATO.\n\nd. The Flight Performance Software (FPS) program automates calculations currently performed manually by the pilot and flight engineer in accordance with the E-3B and C flight manual.  Phase I, automates the Takeoff and Landing (TOLD) calculations; Phase II automates the high speed calculation.  Automated calculations, using the original source data used to create the flight manual charts increases safety, improves on time departure\/arrival, improves crew efficiency, and reduces tanker support.\n\n2.  AWACS Infrastructure and Support Systems (RDT&E, AF): These efforts synchronize modernization requirements and infrastructure support across the entire weapon system from depot and field test equipment, to maintenance trainers, to simulators, to integration labs, to the TS-3 Developmental Test and Evaluation Aircraft.\n\na. Test System-3\/AWACS Development Integration Test Support (ADITS): The E-3 AWACS Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) aircraft, Test System 3 (TS-3, tail number 73-1674) is a government owned\/contractor managed, maintained and operated system level DT&E asset. Together, TS-3 and ADITS provide test-ready assets to support AWACS modernization, with already imbedded test points to support sub-system and system level developmental testing, per Boeing's TS-3 design specifications. This level of DT&E testing supports both advanced and sustainment projects, which allow AWACS to participate in live-fly exercises (e.g., Joint Expeditionary Force Experiment\/JEFX; Empire Challenge\/EC) and ground-based interoperability testing. These assets also support multiple international Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) projects on a fee basis, including projects for France, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, Japan, and NATO AEW&C efforts.\n\nTS-3, one of the first AWACS production aircraft, is qualified to Boeing manufacturer design specifications, unlike fleet aircraft, which are qualified to technical orders.  In FY12, the Air Force divested TS-3. Beginning in FY13, the ADITS activity will be covered in the Training, Support, and Infrastructure (TSI) effort.  \n\nb. The Training, Support, and Infrastructure (TSI) programs cover required cross-cutting programs and activities in support of AWACS modernization and enhancement efforts. These include managing the AWACS developmental infrastructure, support for equipment concurrency, modernization planning\/analysis, trainer\/simulator integration and concurrency, as well as the Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL). The E-3 Radar Systems Integration Lab\/Software Development Facility (SIL\/SDF) is maintained, operated, and supported by contract to provide customers with a functioning E-3 radar configuration in support of AWACS US, FMS and International radar development, production, and sustainment programs. New support equipment technologies and test strategies need to be analyzed to ensure concurrent capability to sustain existing, modified, and upgraded E-3 equipment. Trainer\/simulator concurrency analysis and requirements definition is necessary to ensure trainers and simulators are kept current with the AWACS baseline. Associate contractor agreements are used to integrate the planning and execution between the prime integrator and training service providers.  In FY13, TSI will continue the remaining ADITS activity which includes the Avionics Integration Laboratory.\n\n3.  Material Solutions Development & Analysis (RDT&E, AF): These efforts look toward the future by investigating enhanced capabilities and exploring new mission areas through C2ISR System Development, while advancing the capabilities of the current weapon system through Support The War Fighter (STWF).\n\na. Command & Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) system improvements investigate and develop future capabilities of the AWACS weapon system, or next C2ISR platform. These efforts also include investigation, analysis and development to ensure that AWACS successfully integrates with joint and coalition forces in a net-centric environment. C2ISR primarily supports Pre-Systems Acquisition in the areas of Material Solution Analysis and Technology Development. This is accomplished by prototyping and demonstrating capabilities required by the warfighter but also includes developing an E-3 Modernization & Sustainment Roadmap that projects user capability needs, as well as material solutions for the user needs. Examples of supporting activities include, but are not limited to: \n\n     (1) Evaluating emerging operational needs, concepts, and technologies to enable integration of AWACS' capabilities to align with integrated C2ISR network architectures as defined in Joint Vision 2020, C2 Constellation Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and Air Force CONOPS.\n\n     (2) Improving sensors and identifying new sensor technologies and netted sensor architectures to meet evolving threats; communications including development of communication roadmaps and assessing related technologies e.g.: all forms of Internet Protocol (IP) communications, and multi-sensor integration such as the ability to send, receive, and fuse the air (and ground) picture via data link to fighter aircraft, through rapid prototyping, modeling, simulation, and participation in Joint exercises (e.g., JEFX and EC).\n\n     (3) Improving the timeliness and accuracy of information passed to\/from fighter aircraft in the engagement zone by providing consistent and re-playable post-mission data to provide quicker reaction capabilities to support the air war.\n\n     (4) Exploring concepts, investigating emerging and developing technologies, and demonstrating efforts that  support continuous improvements and self-protection for C2ISR capabilities of manned & unmanned platforms, space, data links, and advanced Battle Management decision tools.\n\nb. Support the War Fighter (STWF): STWF efforts support AWACS capability to create and sustain the force. Examples of these activities include, but are not limited to:  Designing, developing, and modernizing equipment and systems to ensure AWACS can respond to urgent wartime\/contingency acquisition requirements (e.g. Urgent Operational Needs (UONs) and Wartime Urgent & Compelling Needs (WUCNs)). Upgrading key capabilities to meet contingency needs, modernizing test systems, integrating battle management and data link enhancements, and supporting Reliability, Maintainability, and Availability (RM&A) initiatives which:\n\n     (1) Improve the Mission Capable (MC) rate through RM&A analysis and development projects to provide system improvements that help meet or exceed the required MC rate. These efforts focus on increasing reliability of the air vehicle, command and control systems, voice and data communications systems, computer, sensor systems and infrastructure improvements.\n\n     (2) Solve DMS logistics problems.\n\n     (3) Insert new technologies with the aim of reducing maintenance man-hours along with programmed depot maintenance (PDM) improvements to increase aircraft availability.\n\nc. Electronic Protection (EP): In FY13 EP is a new effort.  The E-3 interim radar upgrade will design and develop capability improvements to the AWACS radar that provide enhanced war fighter capability in a subset of modes identified under the Radar Modernization Program (RMP) study.  The enhanced capability will be available to the airborne radar technician and to the AWACS operators.\n\nBudget Justification: This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                        "ProjectMissionDescription": {
                            "val": "Mission: AWACS is the premier airborne platform providing command and control (C2)\/battle management (BM) to Commander In Chief and combatant commander tasking for joint, allied, and coalition operations, humanitarian relief, and homeland defense. AWACS provides a real-time picture of friendly, neutral, and hostile air activity. Its capabilities include all-altitude\/all-weather surveillance of the battle space; early warning of enemy actions; a real-time ability to find, fix, track, and assess airborne or maritime threats; and detection, location, and identification of electronic emitters.\n\nThis program element funds three areas in support of the AWACS program:  1. AWACS Modernization, 2. AWACS Infrastructure and Support Systems, and 3. Material Solutions Development and Analysis. Each of the three areas includes studies and analysis to support both current planning and execution, as well as future program planning.\n\n1. AWACS Modernization (RDT&E, AF):\n\na. Block 40\/45 is replacing AWACS 1970's vintage mission systems that are experiencing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, are difficult and expensive to upgrade, and limit overall AWACS system performance. The Block 40\/45 upgrade will improve integration, quality and timeliness of sensor data to the shooter, improve Combat Identification (CID), improve AWACS contribution to Time Critical Targeting via Data Link Infrastructure (DLI), improve electronic support measures processing and enable more effective, faster upgrades via an open-system, Ethernet-based architecture. The upgrade will also update the ground support infrastructure including training systems.\n\nb. The Next Generation Identification Friend or Foe (NGIFF) Program provides AWACS with enhanced IFF interrogator operation to add a more secure Mode 5 capability. NSA declared IFF Mode 4 unsecure and obsolete on 5 Nov 2003. Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo 047-07 requires IFF Mode 5 interrogation capability by FY14. The new Mode 5 interrogation capability extends the effective range of the AWACS interrogator, while helping discriminate against closely spaced cooperative targets. NGIFF developed and integrated a basic Mode 5 capability on Block 30\/35 starting in FY09 and began developing a full Mode 5 on Block 40\/45 in FY11. Hardware will be common between the platforms. NGIFF will also integrate Mode S, a civilian air traffic control capability residing in the NGIFF hardware, as funding allows.\n\nc. Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) Replacement of Avionics for Global Operations and Navigation (DRAGON) completes the FAA\/International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)\/ EUROCONTROL air traffic control mandated safety of flight capabilities. This program will provide the E-3 fleet with the flight instruments and other avionics for the Required Navigation Performance (RNP), and the surveillance and communication capabilities necessary to maintain continued critical unrestricted access to global airspace. Non-compliance will result in airspace restrictions and denials that will impact AWACS ability to support worldwide responses to situations requiring immediate on-scene command and control (C2) battle management. The DRAGON modifications replace the existing DMS Global Positioning System (GPS) Integrated Navigation System (GINS) with a modern Flight Management System (FMS) that will accommodate new capabilities including Mode 5 IFF and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). Also included as part of the modification is the addition of data link communications, voice and data link digital radios, and improved visual displays. Emphasis on employment of COTS avionics is expected to lower cost, reduce the tech refresh cycle, and enhance life cycle management. Replacement of critical avionics subsystems that became unsustainable beginning in 2010 is included in the DRAGON program. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of DRAGON is being executed cooperatively between the US and NATO.\n\nd. The Flight Performance Software (FPS) program automates calculations currently performed manually by the pilot and flight engineer in accordance with the E-3B and C flight manual.  Phase I, automates the Takeoff and Landing (TOLD) calculations; Phase II automates the high speed calculation.  Automated calculations, using the original source data used to create the flight manual charts increases safety, improves on time departure\/arrival, improves crew efficiency, and reduces tanker support.\n\n2.  AWACS Infrastructure and Support Systems (RDT&E, AF): These efforts synchronize modernization requirements and infrastructure support across the entire weapon system from depot and field test equipment, to maintenance trainers, to simulators, to integration labs, to the TS-3 Developmental Test and Evaluation Aircraft.\n\na. Test System-3\/AWACS Development Integration Test Support (ADITS): The E-3 AWACS Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) aircraft, Test System 3 (TS-3, tail number 73-1674) is a government owned\/contractor managed, maintained and operated system level DT&E asset. Together, TS-3 and ADITS provide test-ready assets to support AWACS modernization, with already imbedded test points to support sub-system and system level developmental testing, per Boeing's TS-3 design specifications. This level of DT&E testing supports both advanced and sustainment projects, which allow AWACS to participate in live-fly exercises (e.g., Joint Expeditionary Force Experiment\/JEFX; Empire Challenge\/EC) and ground-based interoperability testing. These assets also support multiple international Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) projects on a fee basis, including projects for France, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, Japan, and NATO AEW&C efforts.\n\nTS-3, one of the first AWACS production aircraft, is qualified to Boeing manufacturer design specifications, unlike fleet aircraft, which are qualified to technical orders.  In FY12, the Air Force divested TS-3. Beginning in FY13, the ADITS activity will be covered in the Training, Support, and Infrastructure (TSI) effort.  \n\nb. The Training, Support, and Infrastructure (TSI) programs cover required cross-cutting programs and activities in support of AWACS modernization and enhancement efforts. These include managing the AWACS developmental infrastructure, support for equipment concurrency, modernization planning\/analysis, trainer\/simulator integration and concurrency, as well as the Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL). The E-3 Radar Systems Integration Lab\/Software Development Facility (SIL\/SDF) is maintained, operated, and supported by contract to provide customers with a functioning E-3 radar configuration in support of AWACS US, FMS and International radar development, production, and sustainment programs. New support equipment technologies and test strategies need to be analyzed to ensure concurrent capability to sustain existing, modified, and upgraded E-3 equipment. Trainer\/simulator concurrency analysis and requirements definition is necessary to ensure trainers and simulators are kept current with the AWACS baseline. Associate contractor agreements are used to integrate the planning and execution between the prime integrator and training service providers.  In FY13, TSI will continue the remaining ADITS activity which includes the Avionics Integration Laboratory.\n\n3.  Material Solutions Development & Analysis (RDT&E, AF): These efforts look toward the future by investigating enhanced capabilities and exploring new mission areas through C2ISR System Development, while advancing the capabilities of the current weapon system through Support The War Fighter (STWF).\n\na. Command & Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) system improvements investigate and develop future capabilities of the AWACS weapon system, or next C2ISR platform. These efforts also include investigation, analysis and development to ensure that AWACS successfully integrates with joint and coalition forces in a net-centric environment. C2ISR primarily supports Pre-Systems Acquisition in the areas of Material Solution Analysis and Technology Development. This is accomplished by prototyping and demonstrating capabilities required by the warfighter but also includes developing an E-3 Modernization & Sustainment Roadmap that projects user capability needs, as well as material solutions for the user needs. Examples of supporting activities include, but are not limited to: \n\n     (1) Evaluating emerging operational needs, concepts, and technologies to enable integration of AWACS' capabilities to align with integrated C2ISR network architectures as defined in Joint Vision 2020, C2 Constellation Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and Air Force CONOPS.\n\n     (2) Improving sensors and identifying new sensor technologies and netted sensor architectures to meet evolving threats; communications including development of communication roadmaps and assessing related technologies e.g.: all forms of Internet Protocol (IP) communications, and multi-sensor integration such as the ability to send, receive, and fuse the air (and ground) picture via data link to fighter aircraft, through rapid prototyping, modeling, simulation, and participation in Joint exercises (e.g., JEFX and EC).\n\n     (3) Improving the timeliness and accuracy of information passed to\/from fighter aircraft in the engagement zone by providing consistent and re-playable post-mission data to provide quicker reaction capabilities to support the air war.\n\n     (4) Exploring concepts, investigating emerging and developing technologies, and demonstrating efforts that  support continuous improvements and self-protection for C2ISR capabilities of manned & unmanned platforms, space, data links, and advanced Battle Management decision tools.\n\nb. Support the War Fighter (STWF): STWF efforts support AWACS capability to create and sustain the force. Examples of these activities include, but are not limited to:  Designing, developing, and modernizing equipment and systems to ensure AWACS can respond to urgent wartime\/contingency acquisition requirements (e.g. Urgent Operational Needs (UONs) and Wartime Urgent & Compelling Needs (WUCNs)). Upgrading key capabilities to meet contingency needs, modernizing test systems, integrating battle management and data link enhancements, and supporting Reliability, Maintainability, and Availability (RM&A) initiatives which:\n\n     (1) Improve the Mission Capable (MC) rate through RM&A analysis and development projects to provide system improvements that help meet or exceed the required MC rate. These efforts focus on increasing reliability of the air vehicle, command and control systems, voice and data communications systems, computer, sensor systems and infrastructure improvements.\n\n     (2) Solve DMS logistics problems.\n\n     (3) Insert new technologies with the aim of reducing maintenance man-hours along with programmed depot maintenance (PDM) improvements to increase aircraft availability.\n\nc. Electronic Protection (EP): In FY13 EP is a new effort.  The E-3 interim radar upgrade will design and develop capability improvements to the AWACS radar that provide enhanced war fighter capability in a subset of modes identified under the Radar Modernization Program (RMP) study.  The enhanced capability will be available to the airborne radar technician and to the AWACS operators.\n\nBudget Justification: This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
