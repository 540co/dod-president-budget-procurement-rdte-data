This project is expected to start in FY 2012.\n2)  Distributed Control & Data for Small Unmanned Ground Vehicles - Distributed control and data sharing for EOD small UGVs will increase capabilities of EOD technicians during tactical operations.  The majority of EOD missions require two EOD technicians to safely and effectively carryout tactical procedures.  One of the EOD technicians operates the UGV, while the other technician (the lookout EOD technician) observes the mission from over the shoulder of the UGV operator.  The distributed control and information capability will provide the lookout EOD technician with independent control and data from the UGV visual sensors.  This capability will reduce time on target and increase mission effectiveness by evenly distributing tactical tasks between the EOD team members.  This project is expected to start in FY 2012.\n3)  Non-Radio Frequency (RF) Communication for Small Unmanned Ground Vehicles - This project will research, develop, and evaluate alternative methods to RF communications small UGV.\n     -  Completed Interrogator Fabrication\n     -  Completed Interrogator field tests\n     -  Completed Interrogator Demonstrations\n     -  Completed Modulating Retro-Reflector Fabrication\n     -  Finalized Pod Relay Fabrication\n     -  Finalized Pod Relay Mount Fabrication\n     -  Held System Demonstration and Delivery"

The manipulator is to be capable of performing bimanual tasks as required in the Capability Development Document (CDD) for Advanced Explosive Ordnance Disposal Robotic System (AEODRS).  The direct benefit to the Warfighter is increased performance and capability over the current state-of-the-art which will translate into reduced mission time.\n     -  Dexterous heavy lift hardware and technical documentation package\n     -  Feed-forward controls development\n     -  Human-machine interfaces phase 1 development and report\n     -  End effector interface family technical data package and hardware\n     -  Human-machine interface phase II development and report\n     -  Operator haptic interface\n     -  System integration and testing\n2)  Modular Point to Manipulate - Robot manipulators on current configured EOD robots are predominately controlled one joint at a time.  This type of control makes it difficult for the robot operator to precisely control the position of the manipulator, increasing operator workload and the time it takes to complete the EOD ssion.  In order to assist the robot operator in performing manipulation tasks, point to manipulate technology will be developed.  With point to manipulate technology, the robot operator simply identifies an object within a video feed on the control unit, and the manipulator automatically moves into position for further inspection and manipulation.  The design of the point to manipulate technology, both hardware and software, will focus on a modular design that can be easily ported to different robot platforms with different manipulators.  The design will also focus on providing a compact and lightweight package using low-cost parts, such that even inexpensive lightweight platforms can benefit from the technology.  This project is expected to start in FY2012.\n3)  On-Board Shock Tube Dispenser - The purpose of this effort is to develop an On-Board Shock Tube Dispenser (ORSTD) for robotic platforms that allows for greater maneuverability of the platform, a reduction of the operator\u2019s time on target, more inclusive searches of the target area, and a reduction in the amount of shock tube that must be transported.  The ORSTD will allow the robot operator the flexibility to stage a counter charge on-board the MTRS prior to proceeding down range initially making more efficient use of the on-board firing circuit, and would not require the robot to be tethered to the command post.  The ORSTD would provide a reusable spool for shock tube that would enable connection of counter charges to the on-board robot firing system, a designated payload area to carry the counter charge reachable by the robot manipulator, and an automatic cutter for separating the robot from the shock tube once the charge has been initiated.\n      -  Stakeholder requirement documentation\n      -  Developmental technical data package delivery\n      -  TRL six prototype\n      -  Developmental test and report\n      -  Technology demonstration\n      -  Transition plan"

Support to the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition allows the event to take place each year up at Oakland University in Rochester Michigan. \nDesign and construction of an Intelligent Vehicle fits well in a two semester senior year design capstone course, or an extracurricular activity earning design credit. The deadline of an end-of-term competition is a real-world constraint that includes the excitement of potential winning recognition and financial gain. \nSupport to the United States Air Force Academy allows a senior design team to work on systems designed to fulfill the anti-tunnel capability by performing ISR in cave environments where weapons and\/or high value targets are located.  The project employs five to ten cadets from USAFA, graduate student(s) (likely from the \nUniversity of Texas (UT) at Austin), faculty advisors from both USAFA and other universities, as well as engineering mentors\/sponsors.  Execution of the project design effort involves creative and well established engineering design methods used in both education and industry.  A specific focus for this project is to \ninvestigate creative design solutions that have not been previously used.\n      -  Supported the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition and provided judging for the Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems challenge as well as the autonomy challenge.\n2)  SBIR Fast Track - Current cargo pallet on-load\/off-load operations are rate-limited by availability of manpower and pallet handling equipment at both garrison and contingency airbases. As such, steps to move to an automated cargo handling system are necessary.\n      -  Fabricated and built a prototype system, and demonstrated requirements of objective and description above\n      -  Developed Engineering Design Package\n      -  Developed a plan for system demonstration\n      -  Conducted system demonstration\n      -  Prepared demonstration report \n3)  Cost Benefit Analysis - This study will provide the Department of Defense with an independent cost benefit assessment of the potential effects that robotic systems could have on force structure, focusing on manpower savings within several yet to be determined mission areas (logistics, convoy operations, demining efforts, combat operations, etc).  It is expected to start in FY 2012.\n4)  Test & Evaluation - As more and more Unmanned Ground Systems needs are being determined the number of programs of record for UGVs is increasing.  An issue that has been encountered across the UGV community is the minimal capabilities that the test community currently has for testing and certifying safety for these systems.  This effort will help to determine what the current capability gaps are and where the T&E community needs to invest resources to fill those gaps.  This effort is expected to start in FY 2012."

While various techniques using multi-sensor \nperception have shown the ability to extend the detection range of static and moving obstacles, in many cases the addition of dust, rain, snow, or fog in the local \nenvironment causes sensor performance degrading or complete failure.  This project will endeavor to answer the questions:  When do perceptual sensors fail, and why?  What combination of sensors would be appropriate for a given operational scenario?  Can perceptual sensor failure be reliably detected and mitigated?  This project is expected to start in FY 2012.\n2)  Real Time Radio Modeling - The goal of the Real Time Radio Modeling for Robotics project for FY 2011 is to integrate and demonstrate the capability to perform tradeoff analysis of different radios and waveform technologies in performance of the tele-operation functionality in a simulated relevant mission environment.\n     -  Integrate PEO-I Communication Effects Server  with Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS)\n     -  Integrate JTRS with TARDEC Image Generator (IG)\n     -  Integrate JTRS with TARDEC UGV\n     -  Development\/Integration of COFDM:  Qualnet developers from SNT have offered to provide COFDM models.  These models can be updated and integrated into the Qualnet tool as needed to measure their performance on streaming video.

Most 3D mapping solutions for small UGVs are heavily stereo and visual odometry based, which present significant overload for computation and, in some cases, for illumination for nighttime performance.  Therefore, a lidar-based solution is solely proposed here, providing all of the following: \n     -  Day and night capabilities, with significant range in both indoor and outdoor conditions, including off-road environments \n     -  Operate in robust to complex, dynamic environments that are composed of varying objects such as indoor clutter, outdoor vegetation, etc. \n     -  Adaptable to varying 3D sensor fidelity and scalable to varying small UGV configurations \n     -  Output high-resolution 3D data capable of being streamed, rendered, and\/or displayed in real-time within reasonable bandwidth constraints\n     -  Implemented in a modular fashion with government-owned API\u2019s to ensure 3rd party integration and comparison to new algorithms and sensors that become available in the future\n4)  Negative Obstacle Detection - This project will be a focused effort to examine perception requirements and surveying the existing, new, and \"coming soon\" \nsensor systems. Based on that analysis, a development approach will be determined and executed to combine existing sensors, modify existing sensors, or \ndevelop sensors for this specific application. A large part of the project will be in developing the algorithms to fuse and utilize the selected combination of sensor.  This project is expected to start in FY 2012.\n5)  Enhanced Traversability Analysis for Small Unmanned Ground Vehicles - This project will address the difficulty of small UGVs perceiving off-road environments, which inhibit them from reliably navigating in rough, vegetated terrain. A new class of sensors will be used to greatly improve small UGV traversability analysis and terrain classification. This project will fuse this data with camera imagery to provide enhanced information for better terrain classification. Typical obstacle detection\/avoidance will be improved by allowing small UGVs to classify and thus navigate traversable objects, such as grass, brush, and vegetation that would otherwise be perceived as solid objects to avoid completely. The 3D geometry of the terrain can also be better analyzed from a perspective low to the ground, enhancing terrain analysis for off-road path planning.  This project is expected to start in FY 2012."
