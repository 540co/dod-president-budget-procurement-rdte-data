These features will greatly increase security during code changes by reducing the frequency of open sites 75 days annually and reduce associated resource costs for 450 launch facilities (LF) and 45 launch control centers (LCC).\n\nThe associated production funding for the program is in PE 0101213F Minuteman Squadrons, MM III Modifications.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

The Air Force ICBM Fuze Modernization Program will work in conjunction with the W78 LEP, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Navy, and United Kingdom (UK) Ministry of Defense (MOD) to capitalize on the extensive fuze work done to date by the Navy and NNSA, and make maximum use of joint technologies, parts, components, and development\/production capabilities.  Additionally, the ICBM Fuze Modernization program will address the associated Minuteman III weapon system modifications, system testing, support equipment, data, training, and fielding efforts required to support the new Mk21 fuze and Mk12A\/W78 LEP.\n\nICBM Fuze Support will continue studies, system engineering, modeling and testing, and development planning leading to a development effort for the Mk21 and Mk12A\/W78 LEP replacement fuzes.  Development effort will make maximum use of technologies, parts, and components developed under the Navy Mk5 Alteration Program.  The W78 life extension oversight and engineering will identify and develop the specific LEP for the W78, identifying solutions to problems or deficiencies, opportunities to incorporate enhanced surety concepts to meet National Security Presidential Directive 28 requirements, integration of the Air Force Fuze Modernization Program and the NNSA W78 LEP development, and the related supporting infrastructure.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."
