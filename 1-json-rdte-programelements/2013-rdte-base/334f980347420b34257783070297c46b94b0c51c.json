The funds in this PE are distributed among all Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (ASE) projects based on the development priorities established by the USAF SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG) in order to build a total SIGINT capability.  As a result, the USAF will move funds between projects periodically to develop the highest priority projects in response to urgent warfighter needs.  This PE will participate in the development, integration, testing, and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.  Modernization efforts include sensors for the platforms and their appropriate interfaces with the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS).  This approach will allow a synergistic development effort to be accomplished while developing a true Air Force-wide capability.  \n\n(U) This enterprise will use the Air Force Cryptologic Architecture (AFCA) for planning and decision-making and, in turn, employ the Joint Airborne SIGINT Architecture (JASA) open architecture standards to allow maximum ease of future upgrades and system interoperability.  The primary goal of the ASE is to produce an architecture-based, capability-focused SIGINT investment strategy for the USAF.  Funds in any project may be used to fund initiatives in other projects within this PE at the discretion of the SCWG.  Funds in any project can also cover activities to include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This RDT&E effort integrates SIGINT capability on to the MQ-1\/MQ-9 and other unmanned platforms. The sensors shall be capable of collecting technical data and geolocating signals of interest and providing sensor data to a workstation.  The integration effort shall include the use of existing sensor suites to the maximum extent possible to minimize design costs and reduce development time lines.  \n\nDesign efforts specific to the Predator or Reaper systems may include, but not be limited to, antennas, EMI reduction, encryption techniques, and changes to the aircraft, ground station, data link, and simulator necessary to accommodate a SIGINT payload and its data throughput.  Funding will begin efforts on antennas, receivers, processors, software development, aircraft integration and ground station upgrades to allow a persistent reconnaissance, surveillance, targeting, and acquisition capability against mission specific threats.  Development of a networked capability to other SIGINT platforms will also be initiated.  In accordance with an evolutionary acquisition strategy, a series of Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) 2C capability improvements are planned to begin development in FY13.  These upgrades are designed to exploit signals of interest identified as service priorities by the Air Force SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG). These development activities will continue through future years, to include but not be limited to, integrating capabilities developed under separate efforts.  \n\nThis project provides the warfighter with near term increased combat capability.  Enhancements are implemented as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels and compatibility improvements are inserted into the ASIP Family of Sensors through individual development efforts that exploit signals of interest identified as Service priorities by the AF SCWG.  FY13 funds will continue to develop and integrate the ASIP sensor on the MQ-9 contaning an enhanced signal set.  Blue Moon development efforts began in FY11. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The common development SIGINT project also supports development of new sensors capabilities and identifies suitable replacements for components affected by diminishing manufacturing sources.  New capabilities are developed by separate projects.  \n\n(U) The current sensors being developed are the ASIP (which is operational on the U-2 and is being tested on the Global Hawk (RQ-4)), and the scalable ASIP payloads for the MQ-9 (ASIP-2C).  The systems' open architecture and Joint Airborne SIGINT Architecture (JASA) compliant design supports streamlined integration of ASIP onto additional ISR platforms.  The ASIP Family of Systems (FoS) will design and build a common\/scalable SIGINT system designed for maximum coverage of the electromagnetic spectrum through the use of an integrated high and low band system.  ASIP-2C will develop a SIGINT sensor for the MQ-9.  \n\n(U) Capability improvements will be inserted into the ASIP family of sensors through individual development efforts that exploit signals of interest identified as service priorities by the Air Force SIGINT Capabilities Working Group.  This project provides the warfighter with near term increased combat capability. Enhancements are implemented as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels.  Compatability improvements will be inserted into the ASIP Family of Sensors through individual development efforts that exploit signals of interest identified as Service priorities by the AF SCWG. Sensors will be integrated and tested on the various platforms as funding permits. This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.\n\n(U) Some parts of Baseline ASIP are funded within the Common Development project of this PE and some parts are funded within the RQ-4 Global Hawk project (675184).  Parts that have applicability to other platforms such as the U-2 or MQ-9 are funded in Common Development project.\n\n(U) The Baseline ASIP sensor production will be in the RQ-4 PE 0305220F."

Also identifies suitable replacements for components affected by diminishing manufacturing sources.  This project provides the warfighter with a near-term, increased combat capability. Enhancements are  implemented as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Capability improvements will be inserted into the Airborne Signals Intelligence Program (ASIP) family of sensors through individual development efforts that exploit signals of interest identified as service priorities by the Air Force SIGINT Capabilities Working Group  Funding includes completion of developmental logistics tasks associated with the design, development, and integration of ASIP and the ASIP Depot standup. Additional requirements include the Logistics Support Analysis (LSA) Taskings which consists of design and development of support equipment, technical orders, training courses\/aids\/devices, and shipping containers common to ASIP for U-2 and Global Hawk.  \n\n(U) The Baseline ASIP sensor is an ACAT 1D program.  Baseline ASIP completed its development in the ASE PE in FY 2011. FY12 and FY13 funds support finalizing logistics and updating technical data and standing up the ASIP depot.\n\n(U)  This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

It is the only USAF program that pursues SIGINT and RF MASINT technology transition. The COMPASS BRIGHT program objective is to develop technologies for application in SIGINT and RF MASINT systems\/subsystems. Acquisition and production of these developed technologies will occur within the appropriate platform programs. COMPASS BRIGHT projects are selected through a data call process whereby the USAF evaluates proposals from the labs and industry to select those projects that are most promising. This process is completed the year prior to award. \n\n(U) FY11 and FY12 activities included (but were not limited to) improving capabilities in the areas of digital SIGINT, cross cueing, audio\/speech extraction, and confidence measure improvements.  \n\n(U) FY13 will continue to enhance the ability to geo-locate signals of interest, improve the audio quality of signals and improve the collection capabilities of our receivers.  We will continue to improve our collection against low probability of detection signals.  \n\n(U) This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Development efforts will include, but limited to such things as antenna improvements, sensitivity upgrades, and radio frequency distribution upgrades.  Additionally, these funds will develop the capability to allow networking with other SIGINT assets to increase collection accuracy.  This project provides the warfighter with a near term combat capability with increased capability improvements accomplished as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels.  Sensors will be integrated and tested on various platforms as funding permits.  \n\n(U) FY13 will continue to focus development capabilities to collect against signals that are difficult to intercept due to power levels and other characteristics.\n\n(U) This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
