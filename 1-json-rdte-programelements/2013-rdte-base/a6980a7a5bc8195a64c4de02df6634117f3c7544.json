            "val": "The RC-135 Operational Systems Development and enhancement activities project supports design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, and other efforts associated with the integration and modification of the RC-135 programs and their specialized mission systems -both air and ground.  Extensive utilization of commercial-off the-shelf (COTS) based solutions allows rapid fielding of needed capabilities through continuous technology refresh cycles and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS)\/vanishing vendor items (VVI) logistics mitigation efforts.  The results of these efforts provide for preliminary assessments of technical feasibility, operability, or military utility as well as specific engineering implementations for integration into the various systems baseline configurations.  \n\nThese activities are managed by the Air Force through the 645th Aeronautical System Group (645 AESG, a.k.a. BIG SAFARI Systems Program Office or SPO), Aeronautical Systems Center, Air Force Materiel Command, Wright Patterson AFB, OH.  BIG SAFARI manages engineering, ground and support systems modifications, integration, flight testing, product assurance, acceptance testing, logistics, and training activities.  \n\nAircraft, aircraft sensor systems, and associated ground support system engineering planned for FY13 include support for two distinct RC-135V\/W RIVET JOINT configurations [Baselines 11 & 12], two distinct RC-135U COMBAT SENT configurations [Baselines 4 & 5] and two distinct RC-135S COBRA BALL configurations [Baselines 4 & 5].  The world-wide challenge of keeping pace against technologically agile targets used by both nation and non-nation-state adversaries and the rapid evolution of COTS technologies demands a responsive and adaptive acquisition strategy for fielding \"baseline capabilities\" that are logistically supportable at all locations.  BIG SAFARI uses an incremental \"baseline\" strategy to mitigate risk, find affordable solutions and field needed capabilities on the aircraft and ground support and training systems.  Obsolescence and DMS\/VVI are addressed with each baseline upgrade as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fielding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

BIG SAFARI Systems Program Office or SPO), Aeronautical Systems Center, Air Force Materiel Command, Wright Patterson AFB, OH.  BIG SAFARI manages engineering, ground and support systems modifications, integration, flight testing, product assurance, acceptance testing, logistics, and training activities.  \n\nAircraft, aircraft sensor systems, and associated ground support system engineering planned for FY13 include support for two distinct RC-135V\/W RIVET JOINT configurations [Baselines 11 & 12], two distinct RC-135U COMBAT SENT configurations [Baselines 4 & 5] and two distinct RC-135S COBRA BALL configurations [Baselines 4 & 5].  The world-wide challenge of keeping pace against technologically agile targets used by both nation and non-nation-state adversaries and the rapid evolution of COTS technologies demands a responsive and adaptive acquisition strategy for fielding \"baseline capabilities\" that are logistically supportable at all locations.  BIG SAFARI uses an incremental \"baseline\" strategy to mitigate risk, find affordable solutions and field needed capabilities on the aircraft and ground support and training systems.  Obsolescence and DMS\/VVI are addressed with each baseline upgrade as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fielding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The supplies and services procured by 645 AESG under their J&A to satisfy National Security (FAR 6.302-6) requirements are supported by the BIG SAFARI Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) across the full spectrum of system life cycle management from developmental engineering to system retirement (\"cradle to grave\" support).  Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging Combatant Commander requirements."
