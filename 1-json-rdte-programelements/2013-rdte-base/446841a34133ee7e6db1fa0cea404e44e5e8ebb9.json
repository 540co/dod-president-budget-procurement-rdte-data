            "val": "The Armament Ordnance Development program provides for initial and continuing development of weapons\/munitions (kinetic and non-kinetic) and munitions equipment for support and operational use.  This PE develops and improves the following weapons and weapons subsystems:  bombs, bomb fuzes, insensitive explosive fills (Insensitive Munitions - IM), aircraft ammunition, stores-aircraft interface upgrades to include the Universal Armament Interface (UAI), directed energy technology transition to weapons, munitions materiel handling equipment (MMHE), munitions containers, and other weapon subsystems.  \n- Armament Subsystems:  This project develops and improves conventional weapons\/munitions (kinetic and non-kinetic) and fuzes.  The project also provides an opportunity to quickly insert emerging technologies into existing and developing aircraft munitions.  The project provides for research, development, and testing of medium caliber ammunition and enterprise management of guns, ammunition, and Munitions Materiel Handling Equipment (MMHE) systems integration and testing to ensure tested and certified medium caliber ammunition is provided to users.  The project helps the AF meet Insensitive Munitions (IM) compliance through strategic planning, development of insensitive explosive fills, and bomb case modifications to make weapons insensitive to unplanned stimuli.   Armament Standardization\/Control\/Munitions Materiel Handling Equipment (MMHE) is a continuing project to develop and improve the standardization and commonality of munitions handling and armament equipment to preclude duplication.  This project also funds the operation of the tri-service Container Design Retrieval System (CDRS), maintaining a container database to preclude proliferation and duplication of munitions containers and supporting organic container design.\n- Stores-Aircraft Interface: This project conducts stores-aircraft interface upgrades and standards development to include the Universal Armament Interface (UAI).  UAI is an Air Force initiative to develop standardized software interfaces in aircraft, weapons and mission planning to support integration of weapons independent of aircraft Operation Flight Program (OFP) cycles.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and munufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

Efforts are limited to the study, design, and development of MMHE and armament control systems.  Procurement will be performed and funded by the applicable weapons system project.  The tri-service  Container Design Retrieval System (CDRS) is a database intended to preclude proliferation and duplication of munitions containers.  It also supports organic container design, acquisition transportation, prototyping, testing capabilities, as well as the Joint Ordnance Commander's Working Group (JOCG) for Packaging, Handling, and Loading.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and munufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."
