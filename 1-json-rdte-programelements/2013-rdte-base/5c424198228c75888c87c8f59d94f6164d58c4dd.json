Funds from the JI&I Program are used to address joint capabilities including, but not limited to operational through tactical level joint integration of the following capabilities: Common Operational and Tactical Pictures; Combat Identification; Situational Awareness; Adaptive Mission Planning and Rehearsal; Interoperability among Service\/ Agency intelligence systems; Interoperable Joint Fires, Maneuver, and Intelligence; and Integrated Joint Battle Management Command and Control.  Activities funded by the JI&I Program aim to:\n\n- Identify, and\/or develop mission capable solutions for COCOM interoperability and integration capability shortfalls with emphasis on non-materiel elements;\n- Assess operational suitability and sufficiency of materiel solutions identified by the Defense acquisition enterprise in response to validated joint C2 needs;\n- Provide Combatant Commanders with interoperable combat identification and situational awareness capabilities among United States Interagencies, and Allied and Coalition Forces in support of Overseas Contingency Operations;\n- Develop joint requirements supporting C2-intensive joint missions such as Joint Close Air Support and Joint Fires;\n- Develop joint integrated architectures that guide service capability mapping to achieve joint interoperability; \n- Establish fundamental joint data standards and cross domain solutions to facilitate future system interoperability and integration; and,\n- Undertake other activities to resolve emergent operational and tactical needs associated with joint C2."

JI&I-funded endeavors aim to improve US and coalition capabilities to conduct coordinated operations.  Necessarily, JI&I-funded projects most frequently address Command & Control (C2) and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) - the capstone capabilities for integrating disparate elements of military force for joint and coalition operations.  The JI&I Program supports tasks and projects associated with integration and interoperability of the C2 Portfolio including coordination of C2 operational architectures, standards, and policies. Likewise, JI&I partially funds integration and decision support activities associated with DOD executive level C4 management and oversight.  \n\nThe JI&I Program deliver outcomes conforming to joint integration missions:\n- In concert with the separately funded Joint Systems Integration Command (JSIC) and Joint Fires Integration Interoperability Team (JFIIT), JI&I resources investigate joint C2\/C4ISR shortfalls and ascertain characteristics of DOTMLPF remedies to meet mission requirements. The remedies are then pursued through partnerships with Component force development authorities and acquisition sponsors. \n- Consistent with the role as operational sponsor for joint C2, JI&I underwrites Joint Combat Capability Developer (JCCD) activities compiling operational requirements for C2\/C4ISR capability development and integrated testing. \n- Delivers assessment and recommendations for improvement of interoperable Combat Identification (CID) and Situational Awareness (SA) capabilities among United States forces, interagency organizations, and allied\/coalition forces;\n- Establishes joint data standards and cross domain solutions to facilitate future system interoperability and integration.

Incremental delivery of \"born joint\" capabilities are integrated and synchronized across the Department\u2019s requirements, resources and acquisition processes, enhancing the joint war fighting capabilities of the combatant commanders. The JI&I program, in coordination with the Defense acquisition enterprise, assesses the effectiveness of C2 capabilities, identifies emerging capability gaps, and formulates recommendations to address those gaps via the Joint Staff. \n\nTo hasten delivery of C2 capabilities across the full spectrum of warfare, Joint Test and Evaluation (T&E) requirements were assessed to formulate a Net Enabled Universal Joint Task (NE-UJT) Working Group, which is refining the quantitative aspects of the Net Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPP); C2 attributes measurable through T&E.  JI&I personnel participated in exercises including Joint Task Force Exercises (JTFEX), Empire Challenge, and Bold Quest to identify and collect C2 attributes suitable to support joint C2 operational assessments. These T&E support efforts spawned the C4I Partnership (C4IP) for evaluation of operational and tactical C2 capabilities both fielded and under development.\n\nThe primary outputs and efficiencies pursued through Joint C2 Capability Development and Integration efforts funded by the JI&I program element include: \n1) Improved, integrated, interoperable, and networked joint force; \n2) Reduction in duplicative C2 systems\/programs across the DoD portfolio; \n3) Improved decisions and recommendations regarding investment strategies and development efforts; and,\n4) Associated benefits to warfighter efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nSpecific tasks undertaken in support of these results include:\n- Documenting and validating  needs  for Cooperative Target Identification to enhance combat effectiveness, reduce fratricide, increase availability of close air support for troops under fire, provide more effective coordination of air assets, increase weapon accuracy and support time sensitive targeting;\n- Documenting Authoritative Data Sources (ADS) with \u201csecure transparency\u201d timelines to provide a common data reference set for C2 interoperability;\n- Developing Data Standards with breadth of application through Integrating architectures;\n- Coordinating strategies to transition from legacy, platform-centric systems to a net-enabled environment focused on plug-and play interoperability and application-independent data flow."

The CCD serves as DoD\u2019s operational sponsor and Warfighter advocate for Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) capabilities and Joint C2 capabilities, and as joint functional sponsor to develop requirements for the Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information System (G-TSCMIS).  It also serves as DoD\u2019s operational sponsor for Multi-National and Mission Partner (MNMP) requirements development, including Unclassified Information Sharing capabilities.  The CCD employs a formalized C2 governance and management process codified in CJCSI\/M 3265.01, CJCSI 6285.01B, and the JROC-approved Charter for Joint C2 Capability Requirements Governance to collect, collate, validate, prioritize, and sequence the many C2 stakeholder requirements and capability needs, and ensure Service and agency development efforts are synchronized.  As a key leader of C2 governance and management processes, the CCD co-chairs two C2 working groups with OSD, Joint Staff, Services, Combatant Command, and Agency participation to evaluate the health of current C2 capabilities.  Further, it co-leads an O6-level CCD Council of Colonels to identify and address C2 issues, and recommend solutions to senior level C2 forums up through the Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.  To synchronize C2 development efforts, the CCD leads semi-annual Plan Build conferences composed of Service and Agency materiel developers to prioritize and coordinate C2 development efforts by fiscal year.  To support requirements management and capability development\/integration, the CCD conducts C2 mission capability analysis through C\/S\/A engagement to inform and recommend resource allocation and acquisition decisions for senior portfolio management.  Additionally, the CCD oversees maintenance and development of innovative tools and techniques to support analysis of C2 capabilities based on technical, operational, and programmatic criteria."

The capabilities developed and transitioned provide workable solutions identified by Combatant Command Commanders, Services and Agency inputs.

Additionally, transition activities are focused on the development and processing of acquisition documentation to include; JCIDS requirements, Certification and Accreditation documentation, CONOPS, Technology Transition Agreements, and Test and Evaluation results.  The objective for a material transition is to successfully transfer responsibility and ownership of developed and mature capabilities to formal acquisition programs.  The objective for non-material transition is to ensure that the DOTMLP-FP Change Request (DCR) is institutionalized in a COCOM, Service or Agency and implemented across DoD."
