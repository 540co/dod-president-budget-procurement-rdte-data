            "val": "Nuclear Deterrence Operations (NDO) is an Air Force Core Function.  Within this core function, Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) is the exercise of authority and direction by the President, as Commander in Chief, through established command lines, over nuclear weapon operations of military forces.  The President's authority and direction are exercised through the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS).  The NCCS is the designated combination of flexible and enduring elements including facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, personnel, and the structure in which these elements are integrated, all of which are essential for planning, directing, and controlling nuclear weapon operations.\n\nThe Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) portfolio modernizes the systems necessary to effectively provide assured communications connectivity between the President and the strategic deterrence forces in stressed environments. There are several on-going MEECN activities working to modernize strategic forces' communication networks. \n\nMEECN System Improvements (MSI) is a long-range planning process with users (Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), and the Navy) to develop positions for current and future requirements\/issues based on available technology. MSI is used to conduct technology testing, develop technology strategies and build technology roadmaps as pro-active support to the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) community. \n\nThe Minuteman Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) Program Upgrade (MMPU) modernizes existing Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Launch Control Center (LCC) Extremely High Frequency (EHF) communications to provide an Advanced EHF (AEHF) capability and a capability for Missile Combat Crew Members to have operator control of the terminal in the LCC to switch rapidly among various satellite constellations.  This upgrade will be compatible with AEHF satellite and the supporting key management infrastructure (crypto interoperability).  AEHF is an Extended Data Rate (XDR) waveform that provides more secure transmit\/receive at higher data rate frequencies than the low data rate frequencies currently used on MILSTAR satellites. The AEHF terminal will provide both receive and report-back capability.  These modifications comply with USSTRATCOM requirement for strategic terminals to communicate at higher data rates.\n\nGround Element MEECN System (GEMS) contract was terminated for convenience by the government on 16 Jun 2011.  Program has been replaced by Global ASNT.\n\nNuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Long Term Solution (LTS) was a FY12 New Start, but was cancelled during the FY13 budget development due to higher Air Force priorities.\n\nGlobal Aircrew Strategic Network Terminal (Global ASNT) provides secure, survivable inter-site, intra-site, and mobile VLF and Advanced EHF communication to bomber, tanker, reconnaissance units and mobile support teams with strategic responsibilities. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

MSI is used to conduct technology testing, develop technology strategies, and build technology roadmaps as pro-active support to the Nuclear and National C2 community. \n\nVery Low Frequency\/Low Frequency (VLF\/LF) receivers are currently used as one of the means for secure\/survivable connectivity from the President to strategic forces. Over the years, the AF and Navy have pursued their own VLF products, which meet the unique application and environmental situations for each platform.  MSI is investigating technical feasibility of a future common core of processing hardware and software that supports all VLF receiver platforms. MSI will develop the technology of a Uniform MEECN Mode (UMM) which will result in a common set of waveform software.   \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and antipcate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

This upgrade will be compatible with AEHF satellite and the supporting key management infrastructure (crypto interoperability).  AEHF is an Extended Data Rate (XDR) waveform that provides more secure transmit\/receive at higher data rate frequencies than the low data rate frequencies currently used on MILSTAR satellites. The AEHF terminal will provide both receive and report-back capability.  These modifications comply with USSTRATCOM requirement for strategic terminals to communicate at higher data rates.   \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and antipcate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The mission of the NC3 message service is to provide accurate and reliable delivery of time-crtical messages from the Executing Command Authority to nuclear forces and other authorized subscribers.

Global ASNT terminals will be developed and fielded to replace strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals and Aircraft Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse System\/Electromagnetic Pulse Hardened Dispersal Communications (AACE\/EHDC) systems. Global ASNT primary mission is to provide strategic Wing Command Posts and mobile support teams survivable communication paths to receive EAMs and Force Management messages from Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) nodes and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews.  Global ASNT will provide solutions to existing capability shortfalls for NC2 and has significant potential to provide distributed and transportable command and control capabilities beyond the traditional NC2 mission. Global ASNT will be fielded in separate, incremental phases; the first phase fields the AEHF capability followed by the UHF\/AAS capability. Global ASNT is the last line of operational communication when all other peacetime links fail.  \n\nGround Element MEECN System (GEMS) contract was terminated for convenience on 16 June 2011. Global ASNT is not an FY13 New Start.  FY11 Omnibus New Start approved for Global Aircrew Strategic Network Terminal (Global ASNT).  GEMS (BPAC 675047) FY12 funds were retained for execution of the Global ASNT program. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
