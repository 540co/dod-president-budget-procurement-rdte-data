In addition, it provides for modeling\/simulation, training and systems engineering.  This program also coordinates the development of common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near-real time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). \n\nFunds in any project can also cover activities to include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "The purpose of the Imaging and Targeting Support (I&TS) program is to develop and demonstrate next-generation, persistent, wide area surveillance and common imagery reconnaissance sensor capabilities (radar and electro-optical systems) for multiple airborne platforms, and sensor products to aid in rapid targeting (geolocation models, sensor-based exploitation tools, sensor networking capabilities).  \n\nDevelopmental efforts pursued are improved sensor capabilities (such as hyperspectral imagery [HSI], measurement and signature intelligence [MASINT], polarimetric imaging, ground moving target indication, foliage penetration, and other radar and electro-optical models), increased geolocation accuracy, increased dismount detection capability, advanced sensor data correlation, automated target detection, network centric warfare, and other Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and associated Tasking Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities to reduce both target search and kill chain timelines; as well as supporting traditional intelligence activities. This project will also increase interoperability among developed systems by developing common standards and tools. \n\nThe funds in this project, less OCO and Congressional adds, are distributed in priority order for the goal of building a comprehensive geographical intelligence (GEOINT) capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities and requirements.  Projects advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year.  \n\nTraditional focus areas include, but are not limited to: development and demonstration of common radar and electro-optical sensors (Synthetic Aperture Radar [SAR], Low Frequency SAR, and antenna, Electo-Optical [EO], Infrared [IR], HSI, Low Light, Laser Radar [LADAR], Light Detection And Ranging [LIDAR]) and their operational modes (High Resolution Imagery, Moving Target Indication, Dismount Detection, Persistent Surveillance, Wide Area Motion Imagery, Spectral Identification) for multiple airborne platforms.  Development and demonstration of advanced tactical sensor and associated TPED processing algorithms and tools (automatic registration, automatic and assisted target detection, network centric warfare).  Development of integrated multi-sensor capabilities to detect and identify obscured targets (OT).  Development and implementation of imagery standards (Common Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI), National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF)).  Monitoring and enhancement of Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) product quality (radar and EO\/IR imagery, GMTI data, and spectral information) and timeliness throughout the image chain (from sensor to user).  These efforts focus on reducing the find, fix and track elements of the time critical targeting kill-chain timeline while improving operator and decision-maker efficiency and effectiveness.     \n\nFY11 and FY12 include funds for the design and development of a Dismount Detection Radar (DDR). Beginning in FY13, DDR funding will be discussed in project 676031.\n\nFY12 and FY13 include funds for the maturation of Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) technologies.  This effort matures various wide area motion imagery critical technology elements in support of Combatant Commands\u2019 requirements for end-to-end persistent surveillance. This includes emphasis on the development of airborne sensor suites, processing, data links, and associated ground support elements for near real-time surveillance of city-sized areas.  Products will be provided for large-scale intelligence data users as well as for situational awareness. \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

As the CDL Executive Agent (EA), the Air Force is responsible for cross-service application of CDL RDT&E funds facilitating compliance to Congressional and DoD mandates. Military Intelligence Program (MIP) funds are used to maintain, distribute, and upgrade the CDL specifications while ensuring design configuration, commonality, and interoperability among ISR platforms. Additionally, funds are used for the management of resources allocated for development and migration of CDL technologies. Updates to the CDL specification and developmental systems impact 10,000+ DoD airborne and ground ISR systems. The CDL program enables compliance with OSD and Congressional mandates to minimize spectrum usage, use of cryptographic equipment, and direct support to current operations. The CDL specifications permit current and future ISR assets to operate worldwide by providing sensor data directly via point-to-point broadcast to ground sites, airborne platforms and dismounted users. CDL is a vital link in DoD's emerging communication architectures. CDL provides the capability to relay data via air-to-air or compatible satellite links when the asset and ground site are not in line-of-sight. CDL provides the largest bandwidth datalink in DoD, accommodating numerous sensors collecting Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), and video data. Research and development activities include achieving higher data rates for CDL, operations in other spectral bands, and support of large area surveillance missions, while supporting continuous improvements and implementation of line-of-sight platform and CDL terminal Command and Control, plus increased Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) capabilities. CDL terminal designs provide for future technology insertion and reduce non-recurring engineering and life-cycle costs to the user. \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support current and future program planning and execution. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "The Joint Technology Center\/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC\/SIL) is a center of technical excellence to support Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) programs within the services.  The mission includes Service-specific and Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) programs throughout DoD. The JTC\/SIL provides a Government test bed for interoperability, rapid prototyping, technology insertion and transition, systems engineering, modeling\/simulation, training and C4ISR optimization. The cornerstone of JTC\/SIL's diverse tool set is the Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE), which is the DoD simulation\/training system of choice for many UAS and ISR systems. The MUSE is also known as the Air Force Synthetic Environment for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (AFSERS) in its Air Force application.  The MUSE\/AFSERS simulates Air Vehicles, Sensors, Datalinks, Takeoff and Landing Systems, and to some degree, surrogate UAS ground stations, when actual UAS ground stations are unavailable. \n\nThe Services and Warfighting Commanders have a requirement for the capability to train with a system that provides a real-time simulation environment containing multiple intelligence systems that can be integrated with larger force-on-force simulations. The MUSE creates a realistic operational environment which supports the ability to assess military utility, architecture and CONOPS development, and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) refinement; conduct emerging concepts experimentation; and optimize C4ISR within warfighting exercises and experiments. It is the preferred simulation system used by the Combat Commanders and Joint Services to support command and battle staff C4ISR training.\n\nThe MUSE\/AFSERS also creates a realistic operational environment that supports: an embedded training capability for multiple Program Managers; tools to minimize acquisition and life cycle cost and schedule impacts; the ability to conduct emerging concepts experimentation, future systems exploration, systems integration, and technology insertion; applications for Joint and Service-specific warfighting exercises; and C4ISR optimization.\n\nMUSE\/AFSERS is currently in use within all services and most unified commands simulating Predator, Global Hawk (RQ-4), ERMP, Hunter, and RQ-7 Shadow, national and commercial satellite collectors, P-3, JSTARS, and the U-2. During warfighting exercises, the JTC\/SIL integrates imagery simulations with associated C4ISR systems to support execution of critical imagery processes. For those assets normally not available for training, the JTC\/SIL provides surrogate systems and interfaces. Distributed training environments, virtually linking participants from various locations worldwide, are routinely supported within the MUSE architecture. The MUSE\/AFSERS is also used as a mission rehearsal tool for current, on-going military combat operations.\n\nThe JTC\/SIL is supporting the OSD Task Force Staff and the Standards and Interoperability IPT, as well as the joint team working the Ground Segment Interface (GSI).  The JTC\/SIL is the primary custodian of this interface and in that role performs various supporting tasks including development of tools for helping the definition and execution of open architecture for joint service ground control systems, developing and maintaining STANAG 45 joint interoperability tasks to be defined on an annual basis.  \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and project execution.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

BIG SAFARI Systems Program Office or SPO), Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance and Special Operations Forces (ISR&SOF) Directorate, Aeronautical Systems Center, Air Force Material Command.  Development of the Gorgon Stare QRC system provides a podded wide area airborne sensor suite integrated on an MQ-9 Reaper to provide city-sized and similar broad area surveillance capability for the COCOMs.  The Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM 106-08, dated 27 May 2008) approved the Air Force concept for a program plan to address Service requirements for broad area airborne sensors on existing manned and unmanned aircraft system platforms.  This plan evolved into the current ten pod set Gorgon Stare QRC. The acquisition strategy for this Air Force QRC includes delivery of capability in increments, with development of each increment expanding the capabilities of previous increment with provisions to also integrate pre-planned product improvements (P3I) to address evolving and emerging technology advancements. \n\nActivities also include studies and anlysis to support both current program planning and execution as well as future program planning.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The restructure delivers more Quick Reaction Capabilities (QRC) in the near term while allowing time for the services to incorporate lessons learned from previously initiated QRC activities into a future program of record.  Continued development of critical broad area surveillance technologies will feed existing QRCs supporting various aircraft size, weight, and power configurations; sensor performance attributes; Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) architectures, and operational missions. Pre-program planning activities will continue while incorporating QRC lessons learned into a normalized acquisition program.  The proposed funding profile shown here reflects this strategy.\n\nActivities also include studies, analysis, and technology development, maturation, and demonstration to support current and future program planning and execution.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

DDR help fulfill a portion of the sponsoring combatant command and Central Command (CENTCOM) current dismount detection requirements.  The DDR program will initially develop sensors for the MQ-9 and includes development of the required training, maintenance and fielding plans to support a working architecture.  \n\nActivities within this project also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and tech development for dismount detection sensors and capabilities.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fielding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

With the program's open system architecture (OSA) structure, the radar design and sensor processing were released as separate elements in the request for proposal (RFP) and could be bid on individually.  With the OSA approch, there will be a single contract award however, there is the possibility of having a government directed sub if the radar design and sensor processing selections are different contractors.  This approach quickly fields the best capability possible while maximizing the development efforts and techincal investments enabling more rapid future system improvements."
