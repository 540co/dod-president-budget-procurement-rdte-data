            "val": "The Advanced Electronics Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it seeks to design and demonstrate state-of-the-art manufacturing and processing technologies for the production of various electronics and microelectronic devices, sensor systems, actuators and gear drives that have military applications and potential commercial utility.  Introduction of advanced product design capability and flexible, scalable manufacturing techniques will enable the commercial sector to rapidly and cost-effectively satisfy military requirements.\n\nThe MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Integrated Microsystems Technology project is a broad, cross-disciplinary initiative to merge computation and power generation with sensing and actuation to realize a new technology for both perceiving and controlling weapons systems and battlefield environments.  MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems to address issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements.  The project will also address thermal management, navigation and positioning technology challenges.\n\nThe goal of the Mixed Technology Integration project is to leverage advanced microelectronics manufacturing infrastructure and DARPA component technologies developed in other projects to produce mixed-technology microsystems.  These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness and security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms.  The chip assembly and packaging processes currently in use produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system.  This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'.  The ability to integrate mixed technologies onto a single substrate will increase performance and reliability, while driving down size, weight, volume and cost."

The overall goal of the program is to insert breakthrough materials and structures at all layers of DoD systems, and enable higher power densities, increased performance, and improved efficiency.  Innovative research is underway to go beyond evolutionary thermal management systems.  Modern, high-performance heat spreaders, which use two-phase cooling, are being developed to replace the copper alloy spreaders in conventional systems.  Enhancing air-cooled exchangers by reducing the thermal resistance through the heat sink to the ambient, increasing convection through the system, improving heat sink fin thermal conductivity, optimizing and\/or redesigning the complimentary heat sink blower, and increasing the overall system (heat sink and blower) coefficient of performance is another thrust of this program.  Another element of this effort is focused on novel materials and structures that can provide significant reductions in the thermal resistance of the thermal interface layer between the backside of an electronic device and the next layer of the package, which might be a spreader or a heat sink.  The TMT program is an aggregation of: Thermal Ground Plane (TGP), Microtechnologies for Air-Cooled Exchangers (MACE), Nano Thermal Interfaces (NTI) and Active Cooling Modules (ACM) technology research.  Technology will be inserted through DoD industrial firms into future DoD systems."

This technology promises to effectively mitigate dependence on Global Positioning System (GPS) or any other external signals, and enable uncompromised navigation and guidance capabilities.  The program will enable positioning, navigation and timing functions without the need for external information updates by employing on-chip calibration, thereby overcoming vulnerabilities which arise in environments where external updates are not available such as caves, tunnels, or dense urban locations.  The technologies developed will enable small, low-power, micro-gyroscopes capable of operating in both moderate and challenging dynamic environments; chip-scale primary atomic clock standards; and on-chip calibration systems for error correction.  Advanced micro-fabrication techniques allow a single package containing all the necessary devices (clocks, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and calibration mechanisms) to be incorporated into a volume the size of a sugar cube.  The small size, weight and power (SWaP) of these technologies and their integration into a single package responds to the needs of guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and individual soldiers.  The Micro PN&T program is an aggregation of Integrated Primary Atomic Clock, Navigate Grade Integrated Micromachined Gyroscopes, Micro Inertial Navigation Technology, Information Tethered Microscale Autonomous Rotary Stages, Micromachined Rate Integrating Gyroscopes, Single-Chip Timing and Inertial Measurement Unit, Primary and Secondary Calibration on Active Layer, and Chip-Scale Combinatorial Atomic Navigator.  The technology is expected to transition through industry and existing DoD transition partnerships with the Services.\n\nTo achieve the low SWaP necessary for guided munitions, UAVs, and personal navigation applications, the technologies in the MicroPN&T program will have to push the limitations of integration and performance in current MicroElectroMechanical systems (MEMS) technologies.  Unprecedented levels of precision will be required to meet the stringent demands of the military environment.  New architectures for devices will be developed that will leverage advances in fabrication techniques in order to increase stability and performance of a MEMS structure.  Applied research for this program is funded within PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01."

These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness, security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms.  At the present time, systems are fabricated by assembling a number of mixed-technology components: microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microphotonics, microfluidics and millimeterwave\/microwave.  Each technology usually requires a different level of integration, occupies a separate silicon chip and requires off-chip wiring, and requires fastening and packaging to form a module.  The chip assembly and packaging processes produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system.  This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'.\n\nThe field of microelectronics incorporates micrometer\/nanometer scale integration and is the most highly integrated, low-cost and high-impact technology to date.  Microelectronics technology has produced the microcomputer-chip that enabled or supported the revolutions in computers, networking and communication.  This program extends the microelectronics paradigm to include the integration of heterogeneous or mixed technologies.  This new paradigm will create a new class of 'matchbook-size', highly integrated device and microsystem architectures.  Examples of component-microsystems include low-power, small-volume, lightweight, microsensors, microrobots and microcommunication systems that will improve and expand the performance of the warfighter, military platforms, munitions and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs).\n\nThe program includes the integration of mixed materials on generic substrates including glass, polymers and silicon.  The program is design and process intensive, using 'standard' processes and developing new semiconductor-like processes and technologies that support the integration of mixed-technologies at the micrometer\/nanometer scale.  The program includes the development of micrometer\/nanometer scale isolation, contacts, interconnects and 'multiple-chip-scale' packaging for electronic, mechanical, fluidic, photonic and rf\/mmwave\/microwave technologies.  For example, a mixed-technology microsystem using integrated microfluidics, MEMS, microphotonics, microelectronics and microwave components could provide a highly integrated, portable analytical instrument to monitor the battlefield environment, the physical condition of a warfighter, the identity of warfighters (friend or foe) or the combat readiness of equipment.  The ability to integrate mixed technologies onto a single substrate will drive down the size, weight, volume, and cost of weapon systems while increasing their performance and reliability."

Moore's law has driven the silicon industry for several decades with the minimum feature size on an integrated circuit (IC) reduced to 22 nm for today's commercial products.  Due to challenging patterning requirements and complex circuitry, the costs of circuit design and verification, lithography tools and masks, and testing costs have increased exponentially and are unaffordable for low-volume manufacture of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for military electronics.  Consequently, military electronics capabilities are currently limited by the high cost of nanofabrication.  To solve this important problem, DARPA has invested in a variety of maskless patterning technologies including parallel e-beam arrays, parallel scanning probe arrays, and an innovative e-beam lithography tool.  This program will develop revolutionary circuit design methodologies coupled with innovative fabrication techniques and hybrid maskless patterning tools to realize cost-effective nanofabrication for low-volume defense or commercial ASICs.  Such an approach can also address the nanofabrication requirements of other low-volume DoD technologies such as photonics and micro-electro-mechanical systems.

These fiber-laser arrays will be sufficiently lightweight, compact, and electrically efficient to be fielded on a variety of platforms with minimal impact to the platform's original mission capabilities.  Each array element will possess an adaptive-optic capability to minimize beam divergence in the presence of atmospheric turbulence, together with wide-field-of-view beam steering for target tracking.  With each Excalibur array element powered by high power fiber laser amplifiers (at up to 3 kilowatts per amplifier), high power air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements will be enabled that were previously infeasible because of laser system size and weight.  In addition, this program will also develop kilowatt-class arrays of diode lasers which will provide an alternate route to efficiently reaching mission-relevant power levels, and they will test the ultimate scalability of the optical phased array architecture.  Excalibur arrays will be conformal to aircraft surfaces and scalable in size and power by adding elements to the array.  By defending airborne platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles against proliferated, deployed, and next-generation man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), Excalibur will enable these reconnaissance platforms to fly at lower altitude and obtain truly persistent, all-weather ground reconnaissance despite low-lying cloud cover.  Proliferated and emerging threats will be evaluated for the potential of developing a near-term capability utilizing a single high-power fiber laser amplifier.  Further capabilities include multichannel laser communications, target identification, tracking, designation, precision defeat with minimal collateral effects as well as other applications.\n\nThe Excalibur program will also develop efficient high-power laser amplifier arrays based on coherent or spectral beam-combining.  The potential of these arrays to scale to tactical power levels (100 kilowatt class) will be investigated.  These laser amplifier arrays will be designed to work in tandem with the core laser components developed under the Excalibur program in PE 0602702E, Project TT-06.  In addition prototype High Energy Laser Counter Measure (HELCM) systems will be developed to enable a near-term capability for low-altitude self-defense against MANPADS.  This technology will transition via industry."

These cameras will allow a soldier to have practical thermal imaging capability for locating warm objects (e.g., enemy combatants) in darkness.  The small size, weight and power (SWaP) thermal camera will be integrated with a handheld device such as a cell phone with network capability for tactical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.  In order to achieve this goal, breakthroughs will be required in low-cost thermal imagers manufactured using wafer scale integration, vacuum packaging, low cost optics and low-power signal processing.  By the end of the program, the imager chips will be fully integrated with a low-cost processor and optics.

Organic materials have been shown to have good electronic and optoelectronic properties including light emission and detection.  Furthermore, in-plane organic\/inorganic transistors can be incorporated for pre-processing of images.

The radio frequency (RF) spectrum contains innumerable friendly and adversarial signals of interest including: voice and data communications, electronic signatures, and navigation information.  Conventional electronic systems are challenged in detecting weak signals in the presence of strong ones (low-linearity) across a broad range of frequencies (narrow-band).  The RPT program efficiently captured all RF signals of interest by developing broad-band (>10 gigahertz) high-linearity (>70 decibels dynamic-range) optical components and microsystems.  RPT enabled linear broadband microsystems such as remote links, channelizers, and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).  The RPT program reduced susceptibility to electronic attack, increased the probability-of-intercepting (POI) adversaries on their first-pulse transmission, and increased information awareness 1000-fold.  This technology will transition via industry."
