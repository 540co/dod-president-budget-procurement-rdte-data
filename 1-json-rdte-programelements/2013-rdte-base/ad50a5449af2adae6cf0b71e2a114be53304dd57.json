All project elements are coordinated with and, as appropriate, leveraged by DEW and power\/energy programs in the Air Force, Navy, High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, national labs, university consortia, and relevant industry and foreign partners.   The products of this research are required by developers of Army (DoD) systems to evolve traditional (mechanical-based) sub-systems such as geared transmissions, plate armor, and kinetic projectiles to electrically-based ones.  These products will provide the Soldier enhanced survivability and lethality through increased power management and energy savings as well as new fighting capabilities offered only by electrical power.\n\nThis project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground and Soldier portfolio.\n\nThe work in this project is coordinated with the Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC PE 063005, project 441); Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC) PE063004, project 232; Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) PE 063313, project G03; and Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC) PE 062705, project H11.
