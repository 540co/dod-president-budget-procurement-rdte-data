            "val": "The United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) provides a near real-time worldwide, highly survivable capability to detect, locate, and report any nuclear detonations in the earth's atmosphere or in near space.  USNDS supports NUDET detection requirements across five mission areas: Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW\/AA), Nuclear Force Management (NFM), Space Control (SC), Treaty Monitoring (TM) and a classified mission.  \n\nThe USNDS program is jointly sponsored and funded by the Department of Defense (DoD), through the US Air Force, and the Department of Energy (DoE), through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its Nuclear Detonation Detection (NA-22) office, respectively. NNSA\/NA-22 supplies, at no cost to DoD, USNDS NUDET space sensors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the Air Force's USNDS Program Office, who is responsible for all acquisition and systems engineering, integration and test (SEIT) activities on space vehicles, to include GPS and additional hosts, and their supporting ground control segments.\n\nDoD funds their contribution to the NDS program in PE 0305913F with RDT&E,AF, OPAF and Operation & Maintenance dollars. NDS payload integration onto GPS satellites is funded in the GPS Space & Control Program Element (PE) 0305165F for GPS IIF and in the GPS III Space Segment PE 0305265F for GPS III.\n\nUSNDS consists of nuclear detection space sensors and ground control segments.  The space segment consists of three sensor payloads: the Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) payload for Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites, the Global Burst Detection (GBD) payload for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) platforms (GPS satellites), and the Space Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) payload for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) platforms (Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites and other GEO hosts). The RADEC sensor includes gamma, neutron, optical and X-ray sensors.  The GBD payload consists of optical, x-ray, and Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) sensors.  The SABRS payload consists of neutron, gamma ray and space environmental sensors. Together these sensors in orbit on GEO and MEO platforms comprise the global NUDET detection capability for USNDS. Space Sensors communicate NUDET detection to the grounds control segment which includes the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS), Ground NDS Terminals (GNTs), and Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs). These ground systems perform data analysis and provide a decision support tool to the Air Force controllers concerning probability of NUDET occurrence. ICADS consists of two fixed ground terminals and GNT provides ground receiving analysis and reporting capabilities to national authorities, commands, and forward users.  UGNT will upgrade GNT with survivable and endurable capabilities.  The ground control segment is being modernized and continuously improved through an incremental evolutional acquisition approach.  \n\nThe upgrade to the GNT is the Universal Ground Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) Terminal (UGNT) which is funded with RDT&E, AF in this PE. The UGNT provides NUDET Detection Reports to end users, supports Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW\/AA) missions, and provides survivable and endurable USNDS communications via Milstar\/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) circuits. The UGNT program modifies the baseline of the GNT program and deploys with the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Survivable \/ Endurable Evolution (S2E2) Mobile Ground System (SMGS) units.  The UGNT, when integrated with the SMGS will perform NUDET event processing with fused NUDET Detection System (NDS) data from Global Positioning System (GPS)and DSP.  SMGS capability refers to the result of the S2E2 upgrade program for the MGS mission processing capability, including the integration of UGNT.  The intended end state of UGNT integration is delivery of enhanced missile warning and NUDET detection capabilities that meet survivable\/endurable ITW\/AA requirements directed by the President, SECDEF, Joint Staff, and USSTRATCOM delivering long-term,cost effective, multi-role, multi-mission space effects to the war fighter across the range of military operations.\n\nThis NDS PE includes systems engineering, research, development, manufacture, integration, on-orbit and field testing and end-to-end verification of USNDS space sensors, ground analysis and reporting systems in support of the 5 (five) USNDS mission areas. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7 - Operational System Development because it supports operational systems."

                            "val": "The United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) provides a near real-time worldwide, highly survivable capability to detect, locate, and report any nuclear detonations in the earth's atmosphere or in near space.  USNDS supports NUDET detection requirements across five mission areas: Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW\/AA), Nuclear Force Management (NFM), Space Control (SC), Treaty Monitoring (TM) and a classified mission.  \n\nThe USNDS program is jointly sponsored and funded by the Department of Defense (DoD), through the US Air Force, and the Department of Energy (DoE), through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its Nuclear Detonation Detection (NA-22) office, respectively. NNSA\/NA-22 supplies, at no cost to DoD, USNDS NUDET space sensors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the Air Force's USNDS Program Office, who is responsible for all acquisition and systems engineering, integration and test (SEIT) activities on space vehicles, to include GPS and additional hosts, and their supporting ground control segments.\n\nDoD funds their contribution to the NDS program in PE 0305913F with RDT&E,AF, OPAF and Operation & Maintenance dollars. NDS payload integration onto GPS satellites is funded in the GPS Space & Control Program Element (PE) 0305165F for GPS IIF and in the GPS III Space Segment PE 0305265F for GPS III.\n\nUSNDS consists of nuclear detection space sensors and ground control segments.  The space segment consists of three sensor payloads: the Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) payload for Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites, the Global Burst Detection (GBD) payload for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) platforms (GPS satellites), and the Space Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) payload for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) platforms (Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites and other GEO hosts). The RADEC sensor includes gamma, neutron, optical and X-ray sensors.  The GBD payload consists of optical, x-ray, and Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) sensors.  The SABRS payload consists of neutron, gamma ray and space environmental sensors. Together these sensors in orbit on GEO and MEO platforms comprise the global NUDET detection capability for USNDS. Space Sensors communicate NUDET detection to the grounds control segment which includes the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS), Ground NDS Terminals (GNTs), and Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs). These ground systems perform data analysis and provide a decision support tool to the Air Force controllers concerning probability of NUDET occurrence. ICADS consists of two fixed ground terminals and GNT provides ground receiving analysis and reporting capabilities to national authorities, commands, and forward users.  UGNT will upgrade GNT with survivable and endurable capabilities.  The ground control segment is being modernized and continuously improved through an incremental evolutional acquisition approach.  \n\nThe upgrade to the GNT is the Universal Ground Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) Terminal (UGNT) which is funded with RDT&E, AF in this PE. The UGNT provides NUDET Detection Reports to end users, supports Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW\/AA) missions, and provides survivable and endurable USNDS communications via Milstar\/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) circuits. The UGNT program modifies the baseline of the GNT program and deploys with the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Survivable \/ Endurable Evolution (S2E2) Mobile Ground System (SMGS) units.  The UGNT, when integrated with the SMGS will perform NUDET event processing with fused NUDET Detection System (NDS) data from Global Positioning System (GPS)and DSP.  SMGS capability refers to the result of the S2E2 upgrade program for the MGS mission processing capability, including the integration of UGNT.  The intended end state of UGNT integration is delivery of enhanced missile warning and NUDET detection capabilities that meet survivable\/endurable ITW\/AA requirements directed by the President, SECDEF, Joint Staff, and USSTRATCOM delivering long-term,cost effective, multi-role, multi-mission space effects to the war fighter across the range of military operations.\n\nThis NDS PE includes systems engineering, research, development, manufacture, integration, on-orbit and field testing and end-to-end verification of USNDS space sensors, ground analysis and reporting systems in support of the 5 (five) USNDS mission areas. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7 - Operational System Development because it supports operational systems."
