            "val": "Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) conducts specialized investigative activities and force protection support for Air Force (AF) commanders worldwide. This assists AF commanders in protecting their people and resources.  AFOSI's mission includes investigating criminal  matters affecting AF personnel, contract fraud and economic crimes involving AF weapons systems and spare parts, the investigation of environmental crime, counterdrugs, computer intrusion detection and forensic media analysis of computer crimes. This element supports Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM), Computer Crime Investigations (CCI), and technical support to criminal and counterintelligence investigations and operations conducted by AFOSI. AFOSI's TSCM mission conducts counterintelligence investigations for both AF and DoD facilities and programs in order to deter and detect technical surveillance operations conducted by Foreign Intelligence Services to compromise classified or sensitive information.   The purpose of CCI research is to improve AF and DoD Information Operations capability by enhancing AFOSI's ability to deter or prevent spies, hackers, or saboteurs from manipulating, damaging, or stealing sensitive war fighting data or systems.  Failing that, to investigate, identify, and prosecute those who do.  While most research to meet operational requirements is Operational System Development, there is also research in the category of Engineering and Manufacturing Development due to a need for modifications to present technology.  The equipment required to provide technical support to investigations is unique and complex. This equipment must be continually updated to provide state-of-the-art capabilities to detect and neutralize criminal activities targeted against the AF and DoD. In an era of advancing technology, reduced manning, and increasingly high level fraud, environmental crime and computer crime investigations, technical investigative equipment must be continuously updated to enable AFOSI special agents to have the most cost effective and best possible means of thwarting criminal acts. The evolution of a new wave of computer crimes has made AFOSI responsible for the collection, investigative analysis, national level law enforcement coordination, and dissemination of hacker activity and intrusion incidents for the Air Force. AFOSI's computer crime equipment must stay on the leading edge of technology to collect criminal information as well as pursue and apprehend criminals through a global medium. AFOSI must continually update its existing high tech computer surveillance equipment to support ongoing and future investigative operations to identify hackers and hacker groups, as well as potential hostile government activities targeting Air Force communication and control systems.    Critical Infrastructure Protection identifies weaknesses in the Air Force Critical infrastructure, highlights critical countermeasures and acquires and deploys cost-effective solutions.  The intent is to provide an Air Force-wide review of current infrastructure vulnerabilities; prioritize AF protection planning and integrate with existing programs; identify gaps based on AF needs; direct studies to refine AF requirements.     \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The purpose of CCI research is to improve AF and DoD Information Operations capability by enhancing AFOSI's ability to deter or prevent spies, hackers, or saboteurs from manipulating, damaging, or stealing sensitive war fighting data or systems.  Failing that, to investigate, identify, and prosecute those who do.  While most research to meet operational requirements is Operational System Development, there is also research in the category of Engineering and Manufacturing Development due to a need for modifications to present technology.  The equipment required to provide technical support to investigations is unique and complex. This equipment must be continually updated to provide state-of-the-art capabilities to detect and neutralize criminal activities targeted against the AF and DoD. In an era of advancing technology, reduced manning, and increasingly high level fraud, environmental crime and computer crime investigations, technical investigative equipment must be continuously updated to enable AFOSI special agents to have the most cost effective and best possible means of thwarting criminal acts. The evolution of a new wave of computer crimes has made AFOSI responsible for the collection, investigative analysis, national level law enforcement coordination, and dissemination of hacker activity and intrusion incidents for the Air Force. AFOSI's computer crime equipment must stay on the leading edge of technology to collect criminal information as well as pursue and apprehend criminals through a global medium. AFOSI must continually update its existing high tech computer surveillance equipment to support ongoing and future investigative operations to identify hackers and hacker groups, as well as potential hostile government activities targeting Air Force communication and control systems.    Critical Infrastructure Protection identifies weaknesses in the Air Force Critical infrastructure, highlights critical countermeasures and acquires and deploys cost-effective solutions.  The intent is to provide an Air Force-wide review of current infrastructure vulnerabilities; prioritize AF protection planning and integrate with existing programs; identify gaps based on AF needs; direct studies to refine AF requirements.     \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
