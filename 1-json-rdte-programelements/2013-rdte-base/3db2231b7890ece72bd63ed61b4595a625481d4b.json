The Class I Program was terminated in April 2011 in accordance with the DAB Review on 12 January and the 3 February 2011 Early-Infantry Brigade Combat Team Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM).  \n\nThe XM 156 Class I system for System Development and Demonstration (SDD) provides the dismounted soldier Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA). It has the ability to hover in place and stare for military operations on rural and urban terrain. The Class I provides imagery data in order to recognize personnel and provide targeting information to the BCT Modernization network during day and night operations up to 1000 feet above ground level.\n\nThe Army has incorporated an expedited Class I into IBCT Increment 1 (IBCT INC 1) to provide additional Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability to the soldier starting in 2011. \n \nThe Class I IBCT Increment 1 capability consists of a 20 pound vehicle with a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) Electro Optical (EO) sensor and a COTS Infra-Red (IR) sensor and a gasoline-based propulsion system.\nThe Class I solution for the CP 13\/14 capability will consist of a 41 pound vehicle featuring an Electro Optical Infra-Red Laser Designator Laser Range Finder (EO\/IR\/LD\/LRF) sensor and a heavy fuel based propulsion system. To meet BCT INC 1 CPD objective requirements, the Class I platform requires laser target designation capability which will be incorporated in CP 13\/14. In order for the Class I to carry the laser designation and range finding capability, the airframe and propulsion system must be upgraded to accommodate the additional payload capability. The CP 13\/14 air vehicle operates in complex urban and rural terrains with a vertical take-off and landing capability. The Class I system is carried in two custom Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (MOLLEs) and is air droppable with the soldier. \n \nThe XM157 Class IV UAV has a range and endurance appropriate for the brigade mission. The Class IV supports the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) Commander with communications relay, long endurance persistent stare, and wide area surveillance encompassing a 75km radius. Unique missions include Wide Band Communications Relay and minefield detection. Additionally, Class IV has the payloads to enhance the Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capability by cross-cueing multiple sensors. It operates at survivable altitudes from a standoff range conducted both day, night, and during adverse weather. Based on recent determination by the Army the Class IV program was terminated in January of 2010. Future incremental development will incorporate Class 4 type requirements to conduct both the RSTA and Communications relay mission. \n\nThe Government support costs includes funding for government personnel labor, travel, training, supplies, other support costs (support contractors, Automated Data Processing (ADP), communications, supplies, and equipment), and platform unique testing."
