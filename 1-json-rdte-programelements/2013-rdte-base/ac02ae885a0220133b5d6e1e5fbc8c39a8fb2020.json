The primary aim of this program is to maximize the efficiency of research and development for force and materiel development by reducing the uncertainties concerning these threats. The program also answers general scientific and technical intelligence requirements, aids in the development of countermeasures to threat materiel and threat technology, and provides materiel for realistic testing and training. Operations in Afghanistan have increased the number of items of captured threat material that require immediate exploitation to develop countermeasures and force protection measures for deployed forces. Acquisitions and exploitations are executed according to an Army Foreign Materiel Program Plan and with the approval of the Army, Director of Intelligence (G2)."
