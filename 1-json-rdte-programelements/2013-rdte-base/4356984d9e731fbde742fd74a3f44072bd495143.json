            "val": "The High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility (HELSTF) provides a one-of-a-kind, broad based high energy laser (HEL) test and evaluation capability which directly supports testing of laser variants of the Future Combat Systems (FCS).  Specifically, HEL weapons will play a major role in the Counter Rockets, Artillery and Mortars (CRAM) initiative and can be a key component of the Future Force supporting Full Dimensional Protection. HELSTF is part of the Department of Defense (DoD) Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) and supports Tri-Service HEL research and development to include damage, vulnerability, propagation, and lethality laser testing as well as HEL weapon developmental and operational test and evaluation (DTE&OTE).  The HELSTF's laser development support capabilities include a fully certified open-air HEL test range, test cells for bringing breadboard to brassboard test devices, fully integrated Command, Control, Communications & Intelligence (C3I) systems and a suite of beam directors to perform both static and dynamic tracking tests.  Other capabilities include an extensive array of fully instrumented test sites, full laser meteorological support, and an approved site for above-the-horizon dynamic HEL testing certified for predictive avoidance by the Laser Clearing House.  HELSTF's location on White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) provides unparalleled testing flexibility because of WSMR's 3200 square miles of controlled land mass and 7000 square miles of controlled airspace.  This location also enables HELSTF to leverage the existing WSMR T&E infrastructure. Current HELSTF facilities include the Sea Lite Beam Director (SLBD), the Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser (MIRACL), the Large Vacuum Chamber (LVC) with associated Vacuum Test System (VTS), the Solid State Laser testbed, the Tactical High Energy Laser (THEL) testbed, and the Low Power Chemical Laser (LPCL).  This multiple use facility supports testing of laser effects for targets ranging from material coupon testing up through full-scale static and dynamic targets, explosive targets, and testing of targets in a high altitude space environment.  HELSTF has embarked on its own modernization to fully upgrade its mission control systems, develop state-of-the-art HEL diagnostic capabilities, data reduction, and a mobile HEL diagnostic test suite to support DTE and OTE for potential HEL weapons in the Army Future Force in all relevant combat environments."
