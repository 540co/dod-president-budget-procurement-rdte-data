The Jul 2002 policy statement also reaffirms STP's role as the single manager for all DoD payloads on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station.  In FY11, STP provided launch services to 24 SERB-approved experiments including seven long-duration experiments on the ISS.  FY11 also saw the launch of an additional 13 experiments on the Shuttle or other man-rated systems with additional integration to the ISS.  It also provided operations support for free-flyer experiments and long-duration external experiments on the ISS.  The DoD Space Experiments Review Board (SERB) approved and prioritized 63 experiments in 2011 as candidates for launch services.\n\nBeginning in FY13, new STP efforts are terminated.  FY13 efforts support program closeout and termination.  STP-2 integration and mission will be continued in FY13-FY15 via existing funding in PE 0603401F Advanced Spacecraft Technology, RDT&E AF.  STP-2 is a dedicated research and development launch mission that also supports the commercial new entrant launch strategy.\n\nSTP is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support, because it supports RDT&E satellite launches."

STP missions are the most cost-effective way to flight test new space system technologies, concepts and designs, providing an inexpensive way to:   \n- Support the space acquisition block development approach\n- Demonstrate and develop responsive research and development (R&D) space capabilities \n- Provide early operational capabilities to quickly react to new developments \n- Perform operational risk reduction through direct flight test of prototype components \n- Improve operational design by characterizing the space environment, event, or sensor physics proposed for an operational system\/system upgrade \n- Develop, test, and acquire advanced payload support hardware for small and medium expendable launch vehicles (LV) and unmanned spaceflight vehicles  \n\nThe Deputy Secretary of Defense Space Test Program Management & Funding Policy, issued in Jul 2002, reaffirmed STP as the primary provider of spaceflight for the DoD space research community.  The Jul 2002 policy statement also reaffirms STP's role as the single manager for all DoD payloads on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station.  In FY11, STP provided launch services to 24 SERB-approved experiments including seven long-duration experiments on the ISS.  FY11 also saw the launch of an additional 13 experiments on the Shuttle or other man-rated systems with additional integration to the ISS.  It also provided operations support for free-flyer experiments and long-duration external experiments on the ISS.  The DoD Space Experiments Review Board (SERB) approved and prioritized 63 experiments in 2011 as candidates for launch services.\n\nBeginning in FY13, new STP efforts are terminated.  FY13 efforts support program closeout and termination.  STP-2 integration and mission will be continued in FY13-FY15 via existing funding in PE 0603401F Advanced Spacecraft Technology, RDT&E AF.  STP-2 is a dedicated research and development launch mission that also supports the commercial new entrant launch strategy.\n\nSTP is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support, because it supports RDT&E satellite launches."
