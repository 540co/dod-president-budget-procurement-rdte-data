FOS will improve information sharing and collaboration, providing timely and accurate data for decision-making in the hands of field representatives.  The system will provide agency-wide metrics to measure and improve agency performance in providing security oversight and the protection of national security.  The system will be developed in an iterative fashion in accordance with the Business Transformation Agency (BTA) Business Capability Lifecycle (BCL).\n\nHigh-level program plan is to complete the functional and technical requirements, and develop the first functional prototype for the core system.\n \n4.

ODAA Business Management System (OBMS): Deliver the Full Operational Capability (FOC) by deploying the final solution to the DIB customers under the NISPOM. Completely modernizes the manual DSS security oversight and protection mission by automating the submission and management of System Security Plans (SSP) and Certification and Accreditation (C&A) documentation.  This automation will allow DSS to more effectively oversee classified information in the hands of industry, improving mitigation and response to new and emerging threats to our Defense Industrial Base (DIB).\n\n2. Open Source Corporate Management Information System (OSCMIS): continue implementation of Security and Support Services including Continuity of Operations Planninig (COOP) functionalities to deliver FOC. Fully implementing all functionality for the OSCMIS suite of applications.\n\n3. Field Operations System (FOS): Deliver an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) that supports the core functionality of the system.  Continue planning and systems engineering development to develop future iterations and plan future integration activities with DSS systems and applications.\n\n4. DD 254:  Deliver the Initial Operational Capability (IOC) toward full automation of the oversight and management of providing classified information access and guidance required for the performance on classified contracts. The DoD Form 254 \u2013 Contract Security Classification Specification; required by DoD 5220.22-4, Industrial Security Regulation and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM). The DD Form 254, and underlying business processes, is critical to ensure access to our Nation\u2019s classified information is properly safeguarded.\n\n5. Mobile Workforce Applications (MWA):  Research technical capabilities to implement mobile technologies to improve the efficacy of the DSS mission.  The global DSS industrial security and oversight mission requires field representatives to audit remote contract facilities and information systems that process classified information. By incorporating mobile technologies into daily operations, the workforce has access to relevant and timely information, critical in ensuring security oversight decision-making."
