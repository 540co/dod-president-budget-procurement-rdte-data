                            "val": "This project (TB3) supports preclinical and early phase clinical development of vaccines, therapeutic drugs, and diagnostic capabilities to provide safe and effective medical defense against validated biological threat agents or emerging infectious disease biothreats including bacteria, toxins, and viruses.  Innovative biotechnology approaches to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to biological threat agents will be evaluated.  Entry of candidate vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic technologies into advanced development is facilitated by the development of technical data packages that support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) processes, DoD acquisition regulations, and the oversight of early phase clinical trials in accordance with FDA guidelines.  Categories of this project include biological defense capability areas such as Pretreatments, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics.  Pretreatment efforts conduct research and development (R&D) of promising vaccines, medications, and technologies provided prior to potential exposure to biological agents.  The goal is to reduce or to entirely prevent adverse effects of exposure.  Diagnostic efforts are aimed at screening procedures and analytical methods to verify exposure and determine the effects of exposure to biological warfare (BW) or other biothreat agents.  Therapeutic efforts provide medical solutions to sustain and protect the Warfighter in biological environments.  Specifically, therapeutic efforts are aimed at developing medical countermeasures to treat exposure to biological or emerging threats such as bacterial (plague, anthrax, glanders), viral (smallpox, encephalitic alphaviruses), and toxin (ricin, botulinum neurotoxin, staphylococcal enterotoxin) agents. \n\nThis project includes the Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative (TMTI).  The program was launched to respond to the threat of emerging or intentionally engineered biological threats.  TMT's mission is to protect the Warfighter from genetically engineered or emerging infectious disease biological threats by providing a rapid response capability from identification of pathogens to the delivery of medical countermeasures.  This mission is accomplished through two main efforts: 1) developing broad spectrum (multi-agent) therapeutics against BW or emerging infectious disease agents (e.g. one drug that treats multiple agents); and 2) developing platform technologies to assist in the rapid development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) in response to BW or emerging infectious disease agents (e.g. developing new and innovative ways to mass produce drugs in the event of a biological incident).  Effective FY12 this effort is funded as the Transformational Medical Technologies (TMT) Program. \n\nThe Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities, based on public-private partnership agreements between the government and industry, providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the warfighter and national security needs.  Specifically, the MCMI will provide the capability for the advanced development and flexible manufacturing of biological MCM (to include TMT developed MCMs) to address CBRN threats, including novel and previously unrecognized, naturally-occurring emerging infectious diseases.  MCMI efforts within S&T are concentrated in three areas: 1) transition of novel platform\/expression systems for MCMs, 2) transition advancement of regulatory science, and 3) integration of novel platforms with MCM advanced development and manufacturing.\n\nIn FY13, all research in this Project (TB3) is re-aligned to Project TM3 - Techbase Medical Defense (ATD)."

Entry of candidate pretreatment\/prophylaxes, therapeutics, and diagnostic technologies into advanced development (i.e., efforts funded in Budget Activities 4 and 5) is facilitated by the development of technical data packages that support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) application and licensure processes, as well as Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition regulations.  Categories for this project include Pretreatments, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics to address Chemical Warfare Agent (CWA) and Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs) exposure.  \nIn FY13, all non-NTA research in this Project (TC3) is re-aligned to Project TM3 - Techbase Medical Defense (ATD).

Innovative biotechnology approaches to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to biological threat agents will be evaluated.  In addition this project supports the advanced development of medical countermeasures to include prophylaxes, pretreatments, antidotes, skin decontaminants and therapeutic drugs against identified and emerging chemical warfare threat agents.  Entry of candidate vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic technologies into advanced development is facilitated by the development of technical data packages that support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) processes, DoD acquisition regulations, and the oversight of early phase clinical trials in accordance with FDA guidelines.  This project also supports the advanced development of medical countermeasures to protect the Warfighter against radiological\/nuclear exposure.\n\nThis project also includes efforts such as the Transformational Medical Technologies Program (TMT).  TMT's focus is to protect the Warfighter from genetically engineered or emerging infectious disease threats by providing a rapid response capability from identification of pathogens to the delivery of medical countermeasures.  \n\nThe Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities, providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the warfighter and national security needs.  MCMI efforts within S&T are concentrated in two areas: 1) advancement of regulatory science and 2) advancements in flexible manufacturing technologies for MCMs."

Within this project are two primary capability areas: 1) Experiment and Technology Demonstrations; and 2) Technology Readiness Assessment.  The Experiment and Technology Demonstrations capability area focuses on integration, testing, and assessing candidate ATDs and JCTDs and includes three thrust areas (two of which are new sub-thrust areas that consolidate legacy systems and are annotated as such below): Advanced Remediation Technologies (ART), Early Warning Military Application in Reconnaissance Systems (EW-MARS), and Comprehensive Innovative Protection (CIP).  The ART addresses Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) remediation and decontamination processes and demonstrates technologies and methods to restore assets such as mobile equipment, fixed sites, critical infrastructures, personnel, and equipment to operational status as a result of having reduced or eliminated CBR contamination.  The EW-MARS achieves enhanced command and control decision making capabilities as a result of a combined and orchestrated family of chemical and biological defense systems deployed on various platforms in remote locations.  The CIP transitions mature technologies to improve individual and collective protection capabilities.  The Technology Readiness Assessment capability area focuses on completing manufacturing readiness assessments, technology readiness evaluations, and assessing maturity levels before transitioning ATDs and JCTDs to advanced development efforts located in Budget Activity 4 (Project TT4)."
