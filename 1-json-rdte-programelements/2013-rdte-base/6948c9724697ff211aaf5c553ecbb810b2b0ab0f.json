            "val": "The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) program produces the world's premier airborne ground surveillance platform, meeting joint combat capability requirements.  The 707-based E-8C Joint STARS aircraft provides all-weather radar-derived Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) and targeting information on moving and stationary ground\/surface targets to include dismounts, slowly moving rotary and fixed wing aircraft, and rotating antennas.  Joint STARS provides target information for matching direct attack aircraft, standoff weapons, and ground-based attack assets against selected targets.  It can be cued by other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and target acquisition systems.  This capability enables air and ground regional\/geographic commanders to effectively make and execute battlefield decisions at the component commander's level to battlefield forces.  It also helps achieve predictive battle space awareness.  Activities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nThis program element enhances the war fighter's ability to achieve the joint vision of combat operations.  It develops advanced battle management aids and information fusion technologies to enable rapid decisions in tracking and killing time-critical targets.  Concept exploration, program definition\/risk reduction efforts, and studies support continuous improvements in C2ISR, Network Centric Operations capabilities, and interoperability with Joint Service, Allied, and Coalition systems.\n\nThis program element comprises two major efforts, modernization and re-engining:  \n\nI. Modernization:\nThe modernization effort consists of multiple projects to develop and integrate system improvements, platform wide.  These include, but are not limited to, the following: Spiral development, Enhanced Land Maritime Mode (ELMM), Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS), Cockpit Avionics Upgrades, and Communications and Networking Upgrades (CNU).  The modernization effort also includes support for Joint STARS Test and Infrastructure as well as upgrades to the Training and Support Systems.  These efforts are detailed below.\n\nSpiral Development - The spiral development is an umbrella for various technology development\/ insertion efforts to enhance target identification, data processing and transmittal and weapon control capabilities, such as Joint STARS Net Enabled Weapons (JNEW) and Joint Surface Warfare (JSuW), Joint STARS Radar Modernization (JSRM), Blue Force Tracking, Battlefield Airborne Communication Node (BACN) and future program planning for AoA recommendations. The JSuW- JNEW effort includes participation in the JSuW Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for Network Enabled Weapons (NEW) which includes, but is not limited to, Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile-Air Surface Warfare-Anti-Surface Warfare (JASSM-ASuW). The JSRM program applies the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) technology to JSTARS. The MP-RTIP capability on the E-8 will provide the ability to detect, track and identify both stationary and moving ground vehicles.  Spiral development also supports requirements for current Urgent Operational Needs (UON), Quick Reaction Capabilities (QRCs), top-down directed efforts, requirements definition, capability gap analysis, Pre-MSA technical risk reduction activities, Blue Force Tracking as well as other large airborne platform integration efforts including Self Defense Suite (SDS), and radar and aircraft performance improvements.\n\nPrograms and projects under Spiral Development are procured under Kill Chain Enhancement- MN-38203.\n\nEnhanced Land Maritime Mode (ELMM) - The ELMM program, supporting Air Sea Battle, implements the maritime tracking & improved land tracking upgrade to provide land and maritime tracking capability and improved imagery. ELMM incorporates imagery compression and advanced radar modes.\n\nDiminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) - DMS issues are categorized as Prime Mission Equipment-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (PME-DMS) and Avionics DMS issues and are top issues for fleet viability. The PME-DMS program will address hardware and software DMS issues and COT technology refresh for both the Operator Work Station (OWS) Clipper computer and the Radar Airborne Signal Processor (RASP). Equipment Replacement will include: OWS processor, Central Computer Mass Storage Device (CCMSD), OWS Mass Storage Device (OWSMSD), Removable Media Module (RMM), Fiber Switches, Local Area Network (LAN) HUB, Serial Data HUB, RASP, and a Radar Sensor Interface (RSI) enabling the legacy radar receiver to communicate with the new RASP. The OWS operating system (Open VMS) will be upgraded to a modern Linux OS architecture, the 19\" OWS display will be replaced with 27\" displays, and software applications including Open Office (MS Office-like) and MoveINT Client will be installed. The Avionics DMS issues include, but are not limited to, Aircraft Information Program (AIP), Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS), Communications, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) upgrades, Control and Display Unit (CDU) Replacement, Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT), Flight Data Recorder (FDR), Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), Embedded GPS Inertial (EGI) with Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM)\/M-Code GPS, Digital Multi-Function Flight Display (Attitude Direction Indicator, Horizontal Situation Indicator and Attitude Heading Reference System) , Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), a new Flight Management System (FMS), Flight Director, Instrument Landing System (ILS) Marker Beacon multi-mode receiver (MMR), and digital engine instruments.\n\nCommunications and Networking Upgrades (CNU) - A multi-phased CNU effort includes, but is not limited to, replacement of the E-8C Link 16 Tactical Data Link (TDL) equipment with National Security Agency (NSA) Cryptographic Modernization Program (CMP) compliant equipment, the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Integrated Broadcast Services (IBS), the Family of Advanced Beyond Line of Sight Terminals (FAB-T), Advanced Tactical Data Links integration, Airborne Networking, and Network Centric operation enhancements.\n\nTest and Infrastructure - The test infrastructure includes the Joint STARS Extended Test Support (JETS) Program, Joint STARS Test Force (JTF), and C2 Enterprise Integration Facility (CEIF). All JSTARS efforts rely on the components of the test infrastructure to carry out RDT&E activities. The infrastructure includes but is not limited to a dedicated, T-3 test aircraft, laboratories, support facilities, Priority Level (PL-2) security, information assurance, and range support.\n\nTraining and support systems upgrades as a part of modernization efforts include, but are not limited to: Weapon Systems Trainer (WST); Navigator Training System (NTS); and Mission Crew Trainers to include a Mission Maintenance Trainer (MMT), Prime Mission Equipment-Maintenance Training Device (PME-MTD) and the Mission System Trainer (MST).\n\nOther modernization efforts include interoperability with manned and unmanned platforms; space data links; advanced Battle-Management Command and Control (BMC2) concepts; 8.33\/25 kHz VHF Radio with Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) voice and data communication; ISR Constellation; Air Moving Target Indicator (AMTI); Advanced Radar Modes (ARM); Aided Target Recognition (ATR); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\/Enhanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ESAR); Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT); and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) Network Architecture Upgrades (BNAU).\n\nII. Re-engining:\nThe second major Joint STARS effort is Re-Engining.  The JSTARS Re-Engining program is a System Design and Demonstration (SDD) program to replace legacy TF33-P102C engines with JT8D-219 engines.  The JT8D-219 engines are predicted to provide the E-8C aircraft improved performance, including thrust, altitude capability, mission duration, time to climb, critical field length (i.e. takeoff performance), fuel efficiency, noise abatement, emissions and reliability. It also adds the potential for additional electrical power generation for future system upgrades. SDD efforts include flight test, development of Weapon System trainer modification hardware and software, technical orders (i.e. flight and maintenance manuals) and technical data development, logistic development and analysis, technical analysis and evaluation, engineering support for MIL-STD airworthiness qualification, flight data analysis and upgrade of the T-3 test aircraft's Propulsion Pod System (PPS) and spare engines including upgrade of used JT8D-219 engines to make production representative. A PPS consists of new engines (4), pneumatic bleed air system, engine build up unit, thrust reversers, nacelles, plyons, exhaust ducts, controls, and instrumentation.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nRe-Engining SDD will support non-recurring engineering activities including development, flight testing, flight manuals, pneumatic bleed air system, Weapon System Trainer development and MIL-STD air worthiness qualification.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) program produces the world's premier airborne ground surveillance platform, meeting joint combat capability requirements.  The 707-based E-8C Joint STARS aircraft provides all-weather radar-derived Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) and targeting information on moving and stationary ground\/surface targets to include dismounts, slowly moving rotary and fixed wing aircraft, and rotating antennas.  Joint STARS provides target information for matching direct attack aircraft, standoff weapons, and ground-based attack assets against selected targets.  It can be cued by other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and target acquisition systems.  This capability enables air and ground regional\/geographic commanders to effectively make and execute battlefield decisions at the component commander's level to battlefield forces.  It also helps achieve predictive battle space awareness.  Activities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nThis program element enhances the war fighter's ability to achieve the joint vision of combat operations.  It develops advanced battle management aids and information fusion technologies to enable rapid decisions in tracking and killing time-critical targets.  Concept exploration, program definition\/risk reduction efforts, and studies support continuous improvements in C2ISR, Network Centric Operations capabilities, and interoperability with Joint Service, Allied, and Coalition systems.\n\nThis program element comprises two major efforts, modernization and re-engining:  \n\nI. Modernization:\nThe modernization effort consists of multiple projects to develop and integrate system improvements, platform wide.  These include, but are not limited to, the following: Spiral development, Enhanced Land Maritime Mode (ELMM), Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS), Cockpit Avionics Upgrades, and Communications and Networking Upgrades (CNU).  The modernization effort also includes support for Joint STARS Test and Infrastructure as well as upgrades to the Training and Support Systems.  These efforts are detailed below.\n\nSpiral Development - The spiral development is an umbrella for various technology development\/ insertion efforts to enhance target identification, data processing and transmittal and weapon control capabilities, such as Joint STARS Net Enabled Weapons (JNEW) and Joint Surface Warfare (JSuW), Joint STARS Radar Modernization (JSRM), Blue Force Tracking, Battlefield Airborne Communication Node (BACN) and future program planning for AoA recommendations. The JSuW- JNEW effort includes participation in the JSuW Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for Network Enabled Weapons (NEW) which includes, but is not limited to, Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile-Air Surface Warfare-Anti-Surface Warfare (JASSM-ASuW). The JSRM program applies the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) technology to JSTARS. The MP-RTIP capability on the E-8 will provide the ability to detect, track and identify both stationary and moving ground vehicles.  Spiral development also supports requirements for current Urgent Operational Needs (UON), Quick Reaction Capabilities (QRCs), top-down directed efforts, requirements definition, capability gap analysis, Pre-MSA technical risk reduction activities, Blue Force Tracking as well as other large airborne platform integration efforts including Self Defense Suite (SDS), and radar and aircraft performance improvements.\n\nPrograms and projects under Spiral Development are procured under Kill Chain Enhancement- MN-38203.\n\nEnhanced Land Maritime Mode (ELMM) - The ELMM program, supporting Air Sea Battle, implements the maritime tracking & improved land tracking upgrade to provide land and maritime tracking capability and improved imagery. ELMM incorporates imagery compression and advanced radar modes.\n\nDiminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) - DMS issues are categorized as Prime Mission Equipment-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (PME-DMS) and Avionics DMS issues and are top issues for fleet viability. The PME-DMS program will address hardware and software DMS issues and COT technology refresh for both the Operator Work Station (OWS) Clipper computer and the Radar Airborne Signal Processor (RASP). Equipment Replacement will include: OWS processor, Central Computer Mass Storage Device (CCMSD), OWS Mass Storage Device (OWSMSD), Removable Media Module (RMM), Fiber Switches, Local Area Network (LAN) HUB, Serial Data HUB, RASP, and a Radar Sensor Interface (RSI) enabling the legacy radar receiver to communicate with the new RASP. The OWS operating system (Open VMS) will be upgraded to a modern Linux OS architecture, the 19\" OWS display will be replaced with 27\" displays, and software applications including Open Office (MS Office-like) and MoveINT Client will be installed. The Avionics DMS issues include, but are not limited to, Aircraft Information Program (AIP), Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS), Communications, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) upgrades, Control and Display Unit (CDU) Replacement, Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT), Flight Data Recorder (FDR), Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), Embedded GPS Inertial (EGI) with Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM)\/M-Code GPS, Digital Multi-Function Flight Display (Attitude Direction Indicator, Horizontal Situation Indicator and Attitude Heading Reference System) , Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), a new Flight Management System (FMS), Flight Director, Instrument Landing System (ILS) Marker Beacon multi-mode receiver (MMR), and digital engine instruments.\n\nCommunications and Networking Upgrades (CNU) - A multi-phased CNU effort includes, but is not limited to, replacement of the E-8C Link 16 Tactical Data Link (TDL) equipment with National Security Agency (NSA) Cryptographic Modernization Program (CMP) compliant equipment, the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Integrated Broadcast Services (IBS), the Family of Advanced Beyond Line of Sight Terminals (FAB-T), Advanced Tactical Data Links integration, Airborne Networking, and Network Centric operation enhancements.\n\nTest and Infrastructure - The test infrastructure includes the Joint STARS Extended Test Support (JETS) Program, Joint STARS Test Force (JTF), and C2 Enterprise Integration Facility (CEIF). All JSTARS efforts rely on the components of the test infrastructure to carry out RDT&E activities. The infrastructure includes but is not limited to a dedicated, T-3 test aircraft, laboratories, support facilities, Priority Level (PL-2) security, information assurance, and range support.\n\nTraining and support systems upgrades as a part of modernization efforts include, but are not limited to: Weapon Systems Trainer (WST); Navigator Training System (NTS); and Mission Crew Trainers to include a Mission Maintenance Trainer (MMT), Prime Mission Equipment-Maintenance Training Device (PME-MTD) and the Mission System Trainer (MST).\n\nOther modernization efforts include interoperability with manned and unmanned platforms; space data links; advanced Battle-Management Command and Control (BMC2) concepts; 8.33\/25 kHz VHF Radio with Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) voice and data communication; ISR Constellation; Air Moving Target Indicator (AMTI); Advanced Radar Modes (ARM); Aided Target Recognition (ATR); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\/Enhanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ESAR); Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT); and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) Network Architecture Upgrades (BNAU).\n\nII. Re-engining:\nThe second major Joint STARS effort is Re-Engining.  The JSTARS Re-Engining program is a System Design and Demonstration (SDD) program to replace legacy TF33-P102C engines with JT8D-219 engines.  The JT8D-219 engines are predicted to provide the E-8C aircraft improved performance, including thrust, altitude capability, mission duration, time to climb, critical field length (i.e. takeoff performance), fuel efficiency, noise abatement, emissions and reliability. It also adds the potential for additional electrical power generation for future system upgrades. SDD efforts include flight test, development of Weapon System trainer modification hardware and software, technical orders (i.e. flight and maintenance manuals) and technical data development, logistic development and analysis, technical analysis and evaluation, engineering support for MIL-STD airworthiness qualification, flight data analysis and upgrade of the T-3 test aircraft's Propulsion Pod System (PPS) and spare engines including upgrade of used JT8D-219 engines to make production representative. A PPS consists of new engines (4), pneumatic bleed air system, engine build up unit, thrust reversers, nacelles, plyons, exhaust ducts, controls, and instrumentation.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nRe-Engining SDD will support non-recurring engineering activities including development, flight testing, flight manuals, pneumatic bleed air system, Weapon System Trainer development and MIL-STD air worthiness qualification.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
