JITC chairs the DCGS Test & Evaluation (T&E) Focus Team, provides test & evaluation for assessing DCGS systems, and engineers and operates the DDTE network.  JITC evaluates the DCGS systems\u2019 compliance with the DCGS Enterprise Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and elements of the Net-Ready Key Performance Parameter (NR-KPP) to assess the information needs, timelines and assurance as well as net-ready attributes required for both the technical exchange of information and the end-to-end operational effectiveness of that exchange.  DCGS is an integral and critical component of the overall DoD Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) interoperability and data integration strategy which provides world-wide ground\/surface capabilities to receive, process, exploit, and disseminate data from airborne and national reconnaissance sensors\/platforms and commercial sources.  The key tenets of network-centric operations and the future of DCGS operations lie in the ability for any user to discover, access, and understand the data.  \n\nThe FY 2012 funding of +$3.154 million supports the DDTE, which provides the DCGS Community of Interest (COI) an operationally relevant environment by establishing and maintaining connectivity between National Agency, Coalition partners and Service facilities at unclassified, collateral, Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), and coalition levels.  It will also support the DCGS Enterprise assessment, as directed by OUSD(I), and DCGS Governance.\n\nThis effort provides the basis for the DCGS Enterprise Assessment, allowing the OUSD (I) to determine the validity and maturity status of the DCGS Enterprise during its development.  Rigorous testing and evaluation is required to ensure the DCGS Systems do not bring vulnerabilities to the networks.  The DCGS Service Programs of Record end-state domain is the SIPRNet, the C2 network for the entire Department.  DCGS, as a whole, is a critical element of the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E)."

Under the DCGS Governance, this effort is referred to as the DCGS Test and Evaluation (T&E) Focus Team and is composed of three parts:  The DDTE Focus Group, providing and sustaining a distributed development network; the Strategy Focus Group, looking at current and future net-enabled enterprise testing and evaluation methods; and the Execution Focus Group which leverages the Strategy Focus Groups methodologies in execution of test events such as the annual DCGS demonstration, EMPIRE CHALLENGE.  These program components enable improved systems engineering and test and evaluation throughout all phases of the DCGS life-cycle culminating in the DCGS Enterprise becoming a contributing member of the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E).\n\nDCGS Programs of Record (PoRs) and Coalition partners use the DDTE network to integrate architecture, standards, and capabilities for implementation of the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) and supports the migration to net-centricity, including DCGS Enterprise services for the following PoRs: DCGS-Army (DCGS-A), DCGS-Navy (DCGS-N), Air Force DCGS (AF DCGS), DCGS-Marine Corps (DCGS-MC), DCGS-Special Operations Forces (DCGS-SOF) and the DCGS Intelligence Community (DCGS-IC).  Net-enabled enterprise testing is designed to more closely simulate the complexities of an actual combat environment.  JITC engineered the DDTE network to support the assessment of the DCGS Enterprise under the DCGS Governance.  National Agency capabilities supporting DCGS include Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) and Human Intelligence (HUMINT), which are integrated and tested in the DDTE domain. \n\nJITC operates the DDTE, providing DCGS PoRs a virtual operationally relevant environment maintaining connectivity between national agency, coalition partners and Service facilities.  DDTE allows robust integration of modeling and simulation T&E capabilities across Joint\/DCGS events without bringing vulnerabilities to the operational Command and Control (C2) network known as Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET).  DDTE has enabled vast improvements in systems engineering, instrumentation and test and evaluation throughout all phases of the DCGS life cycle."

The current prime contractors that support this effort are Northrop Grumman Mission Systems, Northrop Grumman Information Technology (to be Task N and Task M pending novation), and INTEROP Joint Venture."

DCGS T&E Focus Team and JITC will continue to collect data on these systems towards overall JS IOP Certification as they develop.  JITC\u2019s NIL plans on increasing the queries captured across the 15 DDTE nodes in DCGS Enterprise during FY 2013\u2019s test events from 130,000 in FY 2010 to over 300,000.  This effort provides the basis for the DCGS Enterprise Assessment, allowing OUSD(I) to measure the five levels of maturity of the DCGS Enterprise supporting the DCGS Governance.  The Test and Evaluations Focus Team will be expanding data collection instrumentation via DDTE to include all potential DCGS domains and enclaves covering the entire DI2E."
