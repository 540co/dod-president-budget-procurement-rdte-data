            "val": "The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) equips US and allied forces with operational space and missile systems, launch systems, and command and control infrastructure in support of global military and national security operations.  SMC operates with over 6,300 people and an annual budget exceeding $8B providing joint warfighters navigation, communication, weather, warning, force application, and space control capabilities.  Through FY11, SMC acquisition workforce civilian personnel costs were funded in O&M and Section 852 accounts.  Beginning in FY12--as an AF pilot initiative--SMC acquisition workforce civilian personnel funding was transferred to RDT&E, AF, and managed within PE 0305173F. The FY13 program includes funding for approximately 1,800 SMC personnel including all existing acquisition workforce civilian personnel, continued contractor to civilian conversions and Acquisition Improvement Program hiring.  The funding does not include the costs for the base operating support civilian personnel supporting the Los Angeles AFB air base group. Funding SMC civilian payroll from the RDT&E appropriation provides program managers the flexibility to hire additional civilian personnel with program dollars versus additional contractors in concert with Acquisition Workforce Improvement Initiatives.  Funds were requested for this effort in FY2012 under PE 0305173F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

In the FY12 PB submission, the Air Force forecast this funding would move within Project 0305173F to a new project.  However, subsequent to the FY12 PB submission, the Air Force established the current Program Element, 0606392F, for more accurate tracking of the funds.\n\nFunds requested for civilian pay within project 0305173F in FY12 PB totalled $194.596M.  Due to a Congressional Directed Reduction of $7.5M, the final FY12 amount transferred to this new project for execution in FY12 was $187.096M."

SMC operates with over 6,300 people and an annual budget exceeding $8B providing joint warfighters navigation, communication, weather, warning, force application, and space control capabilities.  Through FY11, SMC acquisition workforce civilian personnel costs were funded in O&M and Section 852 accounts.  Beginning in FY12--as an AF pilot initiative--SMC acquisition workforce civilian personnel funding was transferred to RDT&E, AF, and managed within PE 0305173F. The FY13 program includes funding for approximately 1,800 SMC personnel including all existing acquisition workforce civilian personnel, continued contractor to civilian conversions and Acquisition Improvement Program hiring.  The funding does not include the costs for the base operating support civilian personnel supporting the Los Angeles AFB air base group. Funding SMC civilian payroll from the RDT&E appropriation provides program managers the flexibility to hire additional civilian personnel with program dollars versus additional contractors in concert with Acquisition Workforce Improvement Initiatives.  Funds were requested for this effort in FY2012 under PE 0305173F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."
