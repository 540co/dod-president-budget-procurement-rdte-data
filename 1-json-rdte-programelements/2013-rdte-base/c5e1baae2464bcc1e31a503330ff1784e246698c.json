            "val": "U.S. participation in NATO AGS was ratified by SECDEF signature of the NATO AGS Program Memorandum of Understanding (PMOU) in June 2009. The PMOU went into effect in Sept 2009. The NATO AGS Program includes an air segment consisting of a Global Hawk Block 40-like air vehicle, using elements of the USN BAMS command and control architecture and the U.S. Radar Technology Insertion Program (RTIP) radar; a unique configuration to allow export of system; a ground segment for data exploitation and distribution; establishment and operation of a management organization; development of operations and support concepts; and definition and establishment of an initial support capability. The program, managed by NATO AGS Management Agency (NAGSMA), is composed of: design, development and demonstration, as well as initial in-service support (IISS). While the current program includes IISS, the current contract does not include these tasks.\n\nIn FY2012, OSD transferred the NATO AGS project funding to the USAF for management and execution.  The NATO AGS project funds the U.S. share of the cost for NATO to acquire an air-to-ground ground surveillance capability, improvements to the radar, and the U.S. support of NATO activities.   \n\nOperations and continuing support will be funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package funded within the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP).\n\nThe AGS system will be a NATO-owned and operated airborne ground surveillance capability that provides continuous, wide area surveillance information in all weather conditions for use at the strategic, operational and tactical levels of command. Interoperable with other national assets, AGS will provide NATO decision makers with near real time, continuous information and situational awareness concerning friendly, neutral, and opposing ground forces to support mission planning and execution to include force protection and targeting. The NATO Staff Requirements (NSR), serving as the basis for the AGS acquisition was approved in 1997.  After a series of studies, including options for a mid-sized fleet composed of manned and unmanned platforms, a decision was reached to pursue the acquisition of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-only capability based on a Global Hawk (GH) Block 40 equipped with the RTIP sensor.  The AGS system will include five (5) NATO-developed air vehicles, ground-based aircraft control equipment, and fixed and deployable data exploitation elements.  \n\nIn September 2009, fifteen nations, including the United States, signed the PMOU financially committing each participant to the procurement and delivery to the war fighter of the NATO Commander\u2019s number one priority.  Denmark has withdrawn from the NATO AGS program support.  Canada gave intent to withdraw in August 2011.\n\nThis funding is the U.S. cost share for the acquisition of the NATO airborne ground surveillance capability as well as the cost share associated with the IISS. In-Service Support (ISS) will be contracted under separate action.  It is anticipated that ISS costs will be commonly funded, using the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP).  This funding also includes developmental activity for RTIP to include additional functionality and configuration requirements, studies and analysis related to mission security and exportability, and current and future program planning, project execution, engineering, and program management support to NATO.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The PMOU went into effect in Sept 2009. The NATO AGS Program includes an air segment consisting of a Global Hawk Block 40-like air vehicle, using elements of the USN BAMS command and control architecture and the U.S. Radar Technology Insertion Program (RTIP) radar; a unique configuration to allow export of system; a ground segment for data exploitation and distribution; establishment and operation of a management organization; development of operations and support concepts; and definition and establishment of an initial support capability. The program, managed by NATO AGS Management Agency (NAGSMA), is composed of: design, development and demonstration, as well as initial in-service support (IISS). While the current program includes IISS, the current contract does not include these tasks.\n\nIn FY2012, OSD transferred the NATO AGS project funding to the USAF for management and execution.  The NATO AGS project funds the U.S. share of the cost for NATO to acquire an air-to-ground ground surveillance capability, improvements to the radar, and the U.S. support of NATO activities.   \n\nOperations and continuing support will be funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package funded within the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP).\n\nThe AGS system will be a NATO-owned and operated airborne ground surveillance capability that provides continuous, wide area surveillance information in all weather conditions for use at the strategic, operational and tactical levels of command. Interoperable with other national assets, AGS will provide NATO decision makers with near real time, continuous information and situational awareness concerning friendly, neutral, and opposing ground forces to support mission planning and execution to include force protection and targeting. The NATO Staff Requirements (NSR), serving as the basis for the AGS acquisition was approved in 1997.  After a series of studies, including options for a mid-sized fleet composed of manned and unmanned platforms, a decision was reached to pursue the acquisition of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-only capability based on a Global Hawk (GH) Block 40 equipped with the RTIP sensor.  The AGS system will include five (5) NATO-developed air vehicles, ground-based aircraft control equipment, and fixed and deployable data exploitation elements.  \n\nIn September 2009, fifteen nations, including the United States, signed the PMOU financially committing each participant to the procurement and delivery to the war fighter of the NATO Commander\u2019s number one priority.  Denmark has withdrawn from the NATO AGS program support.  Canada gave intent to withdraw in August 2011.\n\nThis funding is the U.S. cost share for the acquisition of the NATO airborne ground surveillance capability as well as the cost share associated with the IISS. In-Service Support (ISS) will be contracted under separate action.  It is anticipated that ISS costs will be commonly funded, using the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP).  This funding also includes developmental activity for RTIP to include additional functionality and configuration requirements, studies and analysis related to mission security and exportability, and current and future program planning, project execution, engineering, and program management support to NATO.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
