The program develops a corresponding susceptibility, vulnerability, and lethality data base for directed energy weapons.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  This program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops and demonstrates technologies for existing system upgrades and\/or new system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs."
