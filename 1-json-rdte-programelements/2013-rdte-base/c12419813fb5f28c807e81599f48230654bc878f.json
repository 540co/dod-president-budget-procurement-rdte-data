To assure the RL-16 gas system is making a high precision measurement, the samples will be sent to a certified laboratory for part of the calibration.  Development of a robust, high precision method to calibrate the nuclear detectors effectively is needed. This is a complex problem that requires expertise in gas handling, radionuclide quantification, beta-gamma detector theory of operation and analysis software development.
