Demonstrations include technologies that form a framework for future training applications for the range of future force operations such as robotic control and other sensor operations; mission planning and rehearsal; command, control, and maneuver; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) network analysis to support distributed simulations; and vehicle system interface requirements.  This project creates a joint environment by synchronizing virtual and constructive simulated forces with the next generation and current training systems from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine forces.   \n\nEfforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nWork in this PE complements and is fully coordinated with efforts in PE 0602308A (Advanced Concepts and Simulation), PE 0602785 (Manpower\/Personnel\/Training Technology), PE 0602787A (Medical Technology) and PE 0603007A (Manpower, Personnel and Training Advanced Technology).\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n \nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Weapons and Materials Research Directorate, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland and Human Research and Engineering Directorate, Simulation and Training Technology Center (STTC), Orlando, Florida."

MATREX researches and develops a robust M&S environment wherein a collection of multi-fidelity models, simulations and tools can be integrated as well as mapped to an evolving architecture for conducting multi-scale (time and spatial resolution) M&S activities to provide M&S data and information to multiple users for decision-making.  MATREX provides a unifying M&S architecture and supporting structure that synchronize and integrate multi-resolution (time and space) modeling applications such as Live, Virtual, and Constructive experimentation.  It also exploits applications, operational studies of Network-Centric Operations concepts and technologies, or the modeling of Battle Command operations with elements of advanced communications, information flow, data fusion, decision-making, and information warfare.  MATREX also works to address M&S issues of model scalability, network design, enterprise services, and third party software compatibility issues.  MATREX ultimately comprises a portfolio of one or more year's efforts focused on researching cutting edge M&S methods to enable the Army and DoD to perform critical System of Systems (SoS) analysis, experimentation, technology tradeoffs, capability assessments, concept development, testing, and training. \n \nFunding increase in FY13 reflects the use of MATREX to support development of enterprise architectures for holistic modeling and simulation of dismounted soldier protection, lethality with cognitive and physical performance.\n\nEfforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.   \n \nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Weapons and Materials Research Directorate, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland and Human Research and Engineering Directorate, Simulation and Training Technology Center (STTC), Orlando, Florida."
