The Air Force is executing to the MDA-approved alternative.\n\nFY11: Program is reduced by $1.387M due to Congressional General Reductions. Also, $8.643M reprogrammed due to higher DoD priorities.\n\nFY12: Program is reduced by $0.399M due to a Congressional General Reduction (FFRDC, Sec. 8023).  The Air Force anticipates a restructure of the existing ECSS aquisition strategy based on a forthcoming Critical Change Report.\n\nFY13-17 increases funding for ECSS RDT&E in accordance with the OSD (CAPE) Independent Cost Estimate while also supporting efforts to ensure Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) compliance, per 2010 National Defense Authorization Act, Section 1003."

FY11-13 efforts include: requirements\/gap analysis, business process reengineering, data cleansing, solution development, piloting, initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E), organizational change management, training, IOT&E site preparation, risk reduction activities, and logistics modernization\/remediation activities to achieve FIAR compliance for legacy systems.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
