                            "val": "The F135 Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) supports F-35 propulsion systems.  It provides the only source of critical sustaining engineering support for in-service Air Force propulsion systems.  Engine CIP maintains flight safety (highest priority), to correct service revealed deficiencies, to improve system Operational Readiness (OR) and Reliability & Maintainability (R&M), to reduce propulsion system Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustain the propulsion systems throughout the service life.  Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environment (including new fuels) and meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the propulsion system through actual use and the Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these field problems.  Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and type\/maturity of the propulsion systems, not by the total quantity.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the propulsion system's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety\/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older inventory propulsion systems operational.  Engine CIP, through \"Lead the Fleet\" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes propulsion-related problems ahead of operational impacts.  Engine CIP addresses out-of-warranty usage\/life and enables the Air Force to obtain additional warranties when manufacturers incorporate Engine CIP improvements into production propulsion systems.  Engine CIP ensures continued improvements in R&M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year O&M and spares costs.  Without Engine CIP, out year support funding would have to be significantly increased.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
