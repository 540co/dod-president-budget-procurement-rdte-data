The Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Acquisition Strategy, approved 24 Nov 2011, restructures the approach of the EELV Program to address many challenges the program has experienced throughout the EELV system lifecycle. This acquisition strategy directly addresses the Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 -2019 (Phase 1) timeframe.  In cooperation with the NRO, the Air Force will commit to an annual production rate of launch vehicles establishing better predictability to maintain mission success, stabilize the industrial base, reduce costs, allow competition, prevent or mitigate any cost or redesign impacts to space vehicles, and sustain the program to assure access to space. This strategy will continue to allow the Department of Defense to reliably place medium-, intermediate-, and heavy-class National Security Space (NSS) space vehicles into earth orbit. RDT&E-funded projects are included on the contract as separate contract line items. The acquisition approach supports the 2004 National Space Transportation Policy. The EELV system will launch the majority of the government portion of the NLF through 2030 and the government will continue to work to partner with industry to continuously improve products and processes to enhance reliability and reduce both the contractor's and government's total costs. In October 2011, the Air Force, NRO, and NASA signed a coordinated strategy for certification of commercial new entrants in order to compete to launch EELV-class payloads. \n\nAs of 21 August 2007, the EELV program formally entered the sustainment phase. Section 838 of the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act requires EELV Selected Acquisition Report submittals.\nAs of 31 Oct 2007, Air Force Space Command formally extended the EELV Program an additional 10 years, from 2020 through 2030."
