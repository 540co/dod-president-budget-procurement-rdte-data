MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct MISO in support of combatant commanders. The MISO sub-projects funded are grouped by the level of organization they support.  Sub-projects include:  \n\n\u2022   The MISO Broadcast System consists of fixed and deployable multi-media production facilities for radio and television programming, distribution systems, and dissemination systems to provide MISO support to theater commanders. This program is comprised of several interfacing systems that can stand alone or interoperate with other MISO systems as determined by mission requirements. This program includes the fixed site media production center; a lightweight, deployable media production capability; a distribution system that provides a product distribution link to systems worldwide; a media system; a transit case fly-away broadcast systems that consists of a combination of amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), shortwave (SW), and television (TV) transmitters, and radio\/TV production systems; software defined radio and a long range broadcast system which transmits analog and digital broadcasts. The long range broadcast system will include unmanned aerial vehicle payloads, scatterable media, telephony, and Internet broadcast. MISO media displays will consist of easily transportable, state of the art, electronic media displays designed to disseminate and direct broadcast electronic messages, which will influence foreign target audiences, and will support the MISO direct broadcast mission requirements. The Special Operations Media System-B is a tactical deployable radio and television broadcast system. It is designed to act as the forward deployed broadcast platform of products. It has limited production capabilities and consists of two independent systems: a mobile radio broadcast system (AM, FM, SW) and a mobile television broadcast system (VHF, UHF) capable of receiving audio and video products for broadcasting.  Additionally, lightweight and tactical media development work stations will allow soldiers to produce MISO products in deployed locations.   \n\n\u2022  Commando Solo:  Commando Solo supports combat operations by flying broadcast missions for the purpose of broadcasting analog and digital radio and\/or television signals deep into denied territory.  These broadcasts are made from EC-130J aircraft that are equipped with high powered transmitters and large antenna arrays that operate in the 0.45 - 1,000 MHz frequency range.  The Commando Solo program acquisition strategy includes conducting engineering analyses to develop digital broadcast capabilities for the EC-130J and C-130J aircraft.  Commando SOLO will leverage development and hardware from the Fly-Away Broadcast System."
