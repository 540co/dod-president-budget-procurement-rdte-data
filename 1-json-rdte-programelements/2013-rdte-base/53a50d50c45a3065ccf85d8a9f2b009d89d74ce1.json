Project 221 matures and demonstrates protection and survivability technologies such as active protection systems (APS), advanced vehicle armors, blast mitigation and safety devices to address both traditional and asymmetric threats to ground vehicles.  Project 441 matures and demonstrates advanced ground vehicle power and mobility technologies such as powertrains, power generation and storage, force projection and running gear subsystems for military ground vehicles to enable a more efficient, mobile and deployable force.  Project 497 matures, integrates, and demonstrates vehicle electronics hardware (computers, sensors, communications systems, displays, and vehicle command\/control\/driving mechanisms) and software that result in increased crew efficiencies, vehicle performance, reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP) burdens and vehicle maintenance costs.  Project 515 matures and demonstrates unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) technologies with a focus on sensors, perception hardware and software, and robotic control algorithms that enable UGV systems to maneuver on- and off-road at speeds which meet mission requirements with minimal human intervention.  Project C66 supports classified activities.  Properly accessed individuals can obtain further information from the ASA(ALT) Special Programs Office on C66. \n \nWork in this PE is coordinated with, PEs 0602105A (Materials), 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability, Robotics Technology), 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology), 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), 0602624A (Weapons and Munitions Technology), 0602705A (Battery\/Ind Power Technology), 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), and 0708045A (Manufacturing Technology). \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n \nWork in this PE is performed by the Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC), Warren, Michigan."

Currently, less than 1\/3 of the total available energy from the fuel is converted into usable mechanical work (propulsion). This effort also researches and matures thermal management technologies and systems including heat energy recovery, propulsion and cabin thermal management sub-systems to utilize waste heat energy and meet objective power and mobility requirements on all ground vehicles.

This project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. Additionally this project matures integrated condition based maintenance technologies that reduce the operation and sustainment costs of vehicle electronics and electrical power devices. Technical challenges include: increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure data networks, interoperability of intra-vehicle systems, and advanced user interfaces. Overcoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test\/evaluation. \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Ground Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by the Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC), Warren, MI."

Mature technologies are incorporated in UGV technology demonstrators so that performance can be evaluated for tactical maneuver and sustainment applications.  \n\nThe approach builds upon, complements, and does not duplicate previous and ongoing investments conducted under the Joint Robotics Program Office, in program element (PE) 0602601A, project H91 (Ground Vehicle Technology) and by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability). \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Ground Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nWork in this project is performed by Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC), Warren, MI, in collaboration with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi and Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."
