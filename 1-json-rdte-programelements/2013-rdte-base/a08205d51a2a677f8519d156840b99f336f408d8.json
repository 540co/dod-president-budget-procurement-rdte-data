            "val": "This Program Element supports the Joint Service basic research program for Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) defense.  The objective of the basic research program is to advance fundamental knowledge and understanding of the sciences with an emphasis in exploring new and innovative research for combating or countering chemical, biological and radiological weapons.  Moreover, basic research supports a Joint Force concept of a lethal, integrated, supportable, highly mobile force with enhanced capability by the individual service member.  Specifically, the program promotes theoretical and experimental research and studies in the physical, life and information sciences.  A portion of this program element directly supports basic research efforts for the transformational medical technologies program.  The work in this program element is consistent with the Chemical Biological Defense Program Research, Development and Acquisition (RDA) Plan.  Basic research technological breakthroughs support applied research (PE 0602384BP) activities.  Basic research activities described in this budget justification leverage existing research programs and activities within the DoD and other government agencies and promotes cross-pollination between government and academia, as well as sponsors promising efforts of world class scientists.  The projects in this PE are placed in BA1, because they are basic research efforts directed towards non-specific or non-unique military applications.  \n\nThe Projects within this BA change in FY12 to reflect the research areas of Information Sciences (IS1), Life Sciences (LF1), and Physical Sciences (PS1), but Medical Biological Defense (TB1) is retained.  The projects of CB1 (Chemical\/Biological Defense), TC1 (Medical Chemical Defense), and TR1 (Medical Radiological Defense), will not be used after FY11.  The TB1 (Medical Biological Defense) project will not be used after FY12, with efforts moving into Project LF1 (Life Sciences)."

The objective of the Basic Research program is to successfully support the advancement of fundamental knowledge and understanding of the sciences with an emphasis on exploring new and innovative research for Chemical and Biological (CB) Defense.  It includes new study areas, such as: nanoscale sciences; chemical, biological, and bio-inspired sciences; surface and signature sciences (with an emphasis on Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs); and information sciences.  The aim is to promote innovative concepts and directions of research, which could lead to transformational capabilities to enhance the performance and ensure the safety of the Warfighter.  Research in nanoscale sciences (nanoelectromechanical systems, molecular motors, and nanometer imaging) may bring about improvements in protection, decontamination and other core CB defense fields.  Research in chemical, biological, and bio-inspired sciences includes research in concepts such as synthetic biology, biomimetics, and other emerging areas of science to build a foundation for developing novel smart materials.  This will combine multiple functionalities into a common autonomous unit or network.  Surface and signature sciences focuses on the study of physical and chemical properties, especially with regard to NTAs, that seek to improve physical capabilities such as detection and decontamination.  Informational Sciences includes research in understanding cognitive and physiological effects on human decision-making, behavior and performance, and modeling and simulation of CB threats.  Breakthroughs and advances in functional capabilities gained from these scientific disciplines could impact the entire chemical and biological defense science and technology program.  Basic research activities described in this budget advance fundamental knowledge and understanding of the sciences.  These efforts may be transitioned to applied research or advanced technology development initiatives.  Due to the exploratory, academic, and theoretical nature of basic research efforts, projects described in this justification typically have a duration period, from conception to completion, of three to five years.  Promising basic research efforts will be further exploited for their application to chemical and biological defense in Budget Activity 2 (Applied Research) or Budget Activity 3 (Advanced Technology Demonstrations).  The basic research efforts promote cross-pollination between government and academia, as well as sponsorship of promising efforts of world class scientists while promoting the development of young researchers.\nIn FY12, all Project CB1 research will be realigned to Project LF1 - Life Sciences (Basic Research), PS1 - Physical Sciences (Basic Research), and IS1 - Information Systems (Basic Research)."

Research results in physics, chemistry and materials sciences have potential application in point and standoff detection, as well as protection and decontamination.  Surface and environmental sciences focus on the study of physical and chemical properties and phenomena of interactions, especially with regard to Non Traditional Agents (NTAs), that seek to improve capabilities such as detection, protection, and decontamination.  Research in nanotechnology and nanoscale sciences, such as nanoelectromechanical systems, molecular motors, nanomechanical resonance sensing, and nanometer imaging, has potential application across CB capability areas to provide significant enhancement by, for example, decreasing detection response times, increasing medical countermeasure effectiveness against a wider array of threat agents, and providing currently unavailable modalities like detection imbedded in fabrics."

This project supports core science efforts that may be applied to biological defense capability areas, such as Pretreatments, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics.   \n\nThis project includes basic research to support Transformational Medical Technologies (TMT) efforts.  The program was launched to respond to the threat of emerging or intentionally bioengineered biological threats.  Research efforts evaluate the molecular characteristics of the interaction between host and pathogen, characterize the host's response to infection\/intoxication and identify common mechanisms and\/or pathways. The research also studies the correlates of immunity (common response against different pathogens), and looks for pre-symptomatic bio-markers.\n\nIn FY12, all Project TB1 research (other than Transformational Medical Technologies (TMT) efforts are realigned to Project LF1 - Life Sciences (Basic Research).
