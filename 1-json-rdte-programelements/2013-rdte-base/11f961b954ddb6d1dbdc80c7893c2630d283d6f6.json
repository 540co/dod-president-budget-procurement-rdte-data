USSOCOM is designated as the DoD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing Overseas Contingency Operations against terrorist networks.  USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, finish, exploit, and analyze time-sensitive high-value-targets.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves."
