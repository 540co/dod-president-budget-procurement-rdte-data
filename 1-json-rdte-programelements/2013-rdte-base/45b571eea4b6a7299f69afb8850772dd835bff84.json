            "val": "JPALS is an Acquisition Category ID program with joint partners for requirements and acquisition including the USAF, USN\/USMC, USA, and the Federal Aviation Administration (under the Next Generation (NextGen) Air Transportation System Program).  JPALS development includes an incremental approach employing a family of systems (FoS) to ensure joint, allied, coalition and Federal Aviation Administration\/International Civil Aviation Organization interoperability.  On 16 March 2007, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved the Capability Development Document (CDD) for the JPALS FoS and Increment 1 for the Sea-Based System and designated the Navy as the JPALS lead Department of Defense (DoD) Component.  On 19 January 2010, the JROC approved Increment 2 for the Land-Based System and designated the Air Force as the lead component for the Land-Based System.   \n\nJPALS is the next generation global positioning system (GPS)-based precision approach and landing system for the DoD.  It will replace several aging and obsolete aircraft landing systems with a FoS that will function in more operational environments and in a wide range of meteorological conditions.    \n\nBecause a cornerstone of the JPALS implementation strategy is worldwide and civil interoperability, JPALS must harmonize with US and International Civil Global Navigation Satellite Systems.  This is accomplished through participation in the development testing, and implementation of international standards through the North American Treaty Organization (NATO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization.  \n\nInteroperability of the JPALS ground systems with all military and civil aircraft is a key aspect of the planned system.  Military aircraft must have worldwide access to civil and military airfields\/air stations\/operating locations in benign and hostile (GPS jamming) environments.  The JPALS Land-based Increment 2 system will provide a civil interoperable capability and also a military interoperable encrypted, jam-resistant capability.  JPALS will close capability gaps identified in the Precision Approach and Landing Capability Initial Capabilities Document.  These gaps include: interoperability for naval aircraft landing at shore-based airfields operated by other services, interoperability for Navy\/Marine Corps and Army aircraft landing at civil airports, and for the Civil Reserve Air Fleet landing at DoD airfields. \n\nFY13 efforts focus on MS B documentation preparation and source selection to support contract award.  A MS B is planned for May 2013 with source selection continuing through Jul 2013.  The Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) contract will be awarded in Aug 2013.    \n\n\nThis program is in budget activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

JPALS development includes an incremental approach employing a family of systems (FoS) to ensure joint, allied, coalition and Federal Aviation Administration\/International Civil Aviation Organization interoperability.  On 16 March 2007, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved the Capability Development Document (CDD) for the JPALS FoS and Increment 1 for the Sea-Based System and designated the Navy as the JPALS lead Department of Defense (DoD) Component.  On 19 January 2010, the JROC approved Increment 2 for the Land-Based System and designated the Air Force as the lead component for the Land-Based System.   \n\nJPALS is the next generation global positioning system (GPS)-based precision approach and landing system for the DoD.  It will replace several aging and obsolete aircraft landing systems with a FoS that will function in more operational environments and in a wide range of meteorological conditions.    \n\nBecause a cornerstone of the JPALS implementation strategy is worldwide and civil interoperability, JPALS must harmonize with US and International Civil Global Navigation Satellite Systems.  This is accomplished through participation in the development testing, and implementation of international standards through the North American Treaty Organization (NATO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization.  \n\nInteroperability of the JPALS ground systems with all military and civil aircraft is a key aspect of the planned system.  Military aircraft must have worldwide access to civil and military airfields\/air stations\/operating locations in benign and hostile (GPS jamming) environments.  The JPALS Land-based Increment 2 system will provide a civil interoperable capability and also a military interoperable encrypted, jam-resistant capability.  JPALS will close capability gaps identified in the Precision Approach and Landing Capability Initial Capabilities Document.  These gaps include: interoperability for naval aircraft landing at shore-based airfields operated by other services, interoperability for Navy\/Marine Corps and Army aircraft landing at civil airports, and for the Civil Reserve Air Fleet landing at DoD airfields. \n\nFY13 efforts focus on MS B documentation preparation and source selection to support contract award.  A MS B is planned for May 2013 with source selection continuing through Jul 2013.  The Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) contract will be awarded in Aug 2013.    \n\n\nThis program is in budget activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."
