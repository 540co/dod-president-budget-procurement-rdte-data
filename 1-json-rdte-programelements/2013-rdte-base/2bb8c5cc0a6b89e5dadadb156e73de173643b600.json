MCOTEA must ensure that the Marines in the Operating Forces receive the very best possible equipment and support.  MCOTEA must also ensure each system proposed for acquisition is tested adequately, evaluated objectively and reported independently.\n     Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) is the only unit that provides the Marine Corps with required operational test and evaluation (OT&E) capability, ensuring the Marine Corps is compliant with laws and regulations, and ensuring that training and equipment are operationally effective, relevant, and suitable.  Additionally, MCOTEA's early involvement, coordination, and oversight in developmental testing and evaluation of new combat and combat support systems ensures that our Marines are the best trained, and have the best equipment, with the lowest test costs for taxpayers.  Finally, MCOTEA's support of rapid acquisitions ensures that Marines in the fight are supported with the newest and most advanced equipment and that the Marine Corps is compliant with regulations."

The process supports Commanding General (CG), MCCDC and Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command (COMMARCORSYSCOM) by providing funding to priority programs, thus allowing for the examination of concepts and alternatives to support an orderly transition from requirements to initiatives and initiatives to funded programs.  This will permit the POM process to focus on activities of evaluating, prioritizing and integrating rather than defining and resolving raw, immature requirements.  \n\nPhase A activities \"jump start\" high priority programs of the acquisition process. Furthermore, since 70% of a program's life cycle cost is determined during Phase A, this initiative will put resources to work where the return on investment is the greatest.  Typical studies conducted on Phase A activities include, but are not limited to Market Surveys, Business Case Analysis (BCA), Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV) analysis, Life Cycle Cost Estimates, Cost Comparison Analysis, Acquisition Strategies, and Trade-off Analysis in lieu of an Analysis of Alternatives.\n\nTo satisfy the emerging requirements, the Deputy Commandant for Combat Development is leading the Marine Expeditionary Force Future Vehicle (MEFFV) effort to conduct Joint Capability Integration and Development System analysis to establish a capabilities framework specifically tailored to assess technologies for transition to the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF.  MEFFV efforts are directed at capability refinement and integration, analysis of multiple concepts, determining technology objectives, and continued development of Initial Capabilities Documents (ICDs) and Capabilities Development Documents supporting ''spin-out'' technology transitions.  This budget item supports combat development activities supporting the three Marine Requirements Oversight Council (MROC) priorities in compliance with JROC and USD AT&L guidance to participate in a Joint Program with the Army's Future Combat Systems Program."
