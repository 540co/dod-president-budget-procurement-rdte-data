Candidate projects are reviewed and approved by the USD(AT&L).  An international agreement defining project objectives, responsibilities and costs is required prior to release of funds.  To obtain these funds and ensure service commitment, projects are selected from existing or new RDT&E programs funded in the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP).  Project offices must show matching funds and contributions from associated program elements and equitable allied funding.  As appropriate, funding responsibility for out-year requirements and follow-on efforts are transferred to the project office and associated program elements.  Any new contracts are awarded after full and open competition."
