            "val": "P206, Explosive Ordnance Disposal\/Low-Intensity Conflict (EOD\/LIC).  The EOD\/LIC Program develops and delivers advanced capabilities for military Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) operators and Special Operations Forces (SOF) to meet the challenges of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), force protection, and the war on terrorism.  EOD\/LIC efforts focus in two areas:  support to SOF to combat terrorism; and access, detection, identification, and neutralization of all types of conventional explosive ordnance and improvised explosive devices.  Requirements submitted by the Joint Service EOD and Service Special Operations communities are prioritized and approved by OASD (SO\/LIC).  \n  \nP207, Special Reconnaissance Capabilities (SRC).  The SRC Program exploits, leverages, and integrates DoD\u2019s service and agency efforts to improve surveillance and reconnaissance tools (unattended sensors, tagging and tracking devices, data infiltration\/exfiltration, remote delivery, and mobility\/delivery of sensors), while providing risk reduction for DoD and other agency technology and development programs.  The SRC Program identifies, integrates, and operationalizes the technical tools for the collection of actionable information against a variety of targets and mission requirements, including emerging requirements , and maintains DoD\u2019s on-line catalog of tools in order to minimize crisis response time for special reconnaissance and surveillance. \n \nP208, Information Dissemination Concepts (IDC).  The IDC Program addresses technology capabilities necessary to enable sustained information dissemination campaigns in denied areas.  The IDC program, working as necessary with DoD and the interagency, develops, modifies, and demonstrates concepts, mechanisms, platforms and payloads to propagate themes and messages that convince target audiences to take action favorable to the United States and its allies. \n \nP209, Irregular Warfare Support (IWS).  The IWS Program (IWSP) develops adaptive and agile capabilities and methodologies to support irregular warfare in the current and evolving strategic environments. IWSP supports joint, interagency, and international partners who conduct or counter irregular warfare through indirect and asymmetric approaches, though they may employ a full range of military and other capabilities, in order to erode an adversary\u2019s power, influence, and will. Solutions include material and non-material operational analysis, concept development, field experimentation, and delivery of capabilities, to defeat the motivations, sanctuaries, and enterprises of targeted state and non-state actors."

Due to revocation of external funding, closed out Project CROWDED HOUSE, which reduced insurgent Improvised Explosive Device (IED) activity through local, indigenous rural development projects. Expanded Project LOCHAN, increasing Special Operations Forces (SOF) and Interagency Irregular Warfare knowledge management, communications and C2 capability through rapid adaptation, experimentation and fielding of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS)\/ Government Off The Shelf (GOTS) software, hardware tools and novel concepts. Evaluated pilot project for alternative command and control structures in counterinsurgency and other Irregular Warfare organizations (Project MURRAY). Conducted irregular warfare mission analysis and experimentation (Project WALLIS) to enhance shared understanding and synchronize interagency irregular warfare\/operations integration efforts. Conducted counter-radicalization research efforts to erode adversaries' power, influence, and will through indirect communications support, research into health diplomacy, law fare, and initiatives designed to engage populations at-risk of violent radicalization. Developed and monitored emerging solutions for low cost aviation support for small units conducting distributed operations in remote and austere environments.  Explored new concepts for non-standard aviation support to SOF in Irregular Warfare environments.  Actively built and expanded a Countering Violent Extremists (CVE) community of interest. Enhanced IW Pursuit and Denial capabilities through analysis of threat supply chain and alternate finance\/value transfer methodologies to help identify, disrupt, deny, and destroy hostile organizations and their supporting enterprises (Projects MEIWA, BANIAN, and REVOLVER)."

Research and develop non-material approaches to deterring\/countering violent extremism. Assess effectiveness of current Irregular Warfare strategies and capabilities; design solutions to integrate into current systems; and develop enhanced Irregular Warfare training and education programs across participating agencies. Continue spiral development of capabilities to enhance intelligence analysis, methodologies and operational solutions.  Continue to elicit and refine requirements for users within rapid assessment framework in order to successfully pair SOF and Interagency users with off the shelf, high performance technologies and novel capabilities that fulfill specific requirements to share and analyze operational data better and faster (Project LOCHAN).  Research, develop and demonstrate solutions for low cost aviation support for small units conducting distributed operations in remote and austere environments. Assess relevance and applicability of Project LEGACY doctrine and operational approach for operational environments outside Operation Enduring Freedom.
