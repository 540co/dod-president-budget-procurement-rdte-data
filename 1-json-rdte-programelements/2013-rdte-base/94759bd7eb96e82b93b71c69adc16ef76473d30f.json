            "val": "The program funds efforts to meet the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) (Public Law 101-510, Title XII), as well as Congressional and SECDEF mandates to provide acquisition and engineering process research and cost estimating, systems integration modeling and architectural analysis, information technology infrastructure development, and technical workforce.  Funding also provides the framework for Air Force business and acquisition transformation in developing capabilities-based architectures, re-engineering and enabling technologies, integrating robust systems engineering into early acquisition processes, and developing and managing a larger, more relevant technical workforce with the expertise to uniformly implement OSD and Air Force engineering guidance and policies. Leveraging the Defense Acquisition Performance Assessment, restores stability in Air Force acquisition systems by integrating major processes to reverse trends toward unpredictable program cost, schedule, and performance to facilitate quick response to urgent operational needs from across the entire spectrum of potential conflicts. Efforts include:\n- Increasing technical and analytical support through training development; independent cost estimating and assessment to help analyze cost\/risk growth and create defendable risk analyses for cost, schedule, and technical risks; information technology infrastructure development; and economic, statistical, and engineering analyses of acquisition programs\n- Initiating performance measures for capability-based planning constructs, aligning relevant science and technology areas with operational requirements to include systems integration modeling and architecture analysis\n- Increasing activities to recruit, develop, and manage the technical workforce, enhancing business and engineering processes to develop leaders to manage the acquisition and engineering transformation and interface with the academic community\n- Transforming acquisition review processes to re-establish clean lines of responsibility, authority, and accountability at appropriate levels\n- Exploring methods to operate a materiel solution development process that is responsive to COCOM capability needs, aligned with the OSD Joint Task Assignment Process \n- Develop and implement a services-oriented acquisition business systems environment to deliver capabilities for the acquisition professional that support acquisition transformation.  This effort consists of three components (1) establishing a foundational integrated environment, (2) leveraging the existing technologies and data to standardize access and use, and (3) investing in specific capabilities that enhance process transformation and are interoperable within the overall environment.\n- The foundational integrated environment supports the portfolio of acquisition business systems hardware and software, and implements standards for data management and service-oriented design methodology to facilitate efficiency and interoperability by:\n   -- Exposing core business services currently existing in multiple tools and subsequently retiring duplicative capabilities\n   -- Reducing training on multiple acquisitions systems by providing all core functionality through a single common interface\n   -- Consolidating infrastructure to reduce hosting and infrastructure sustainment costs.\n- Existing technologies and data are leveraged to standardize on proven capabilities, and to make existing data stores more accessible and useful across the acquisition domain roles.\n- Focused investments in specific capabilities address critical gaps supporting the efficient operation of the Acquisition Domain, in areas such as:\n   -- Conducting program management and oversight\n   -- Conducting program resources management\n   -- Planning and executing on-time acquisition milestone readiness\n   -- Preparing Purchase Requisitions and Contract Orders\n   -- Managing contract writing \n   -- Adopting commercial enterprise concept of Product Lifecycle Management for the production of traceable requirements \n   -- Planning and execution of technology development and transition\n   -- Standardizing risk management \n   -- Managing access to scientific and technical information\n   -- Increasing industrial base decision-support information.\nThese integrated capabilities will provide OSD and AF acquisition leadership insights needed to effectively manage a complex portfolio of acquisition programs through more timely and reliable access to authoritative acquisition data.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

Funding also provides the framework for Air Force business and acquisition transformation in developing capabilities-based architectures, re-engineering and enabling technologies, integrating robust systems engineering into early acquisition processes, and developing and managing a larger, more relevant technical workforce with the expertise to uniformly implement OSD and Air Force engineering guidance and policies. Leveraging the Defense Acquisition Performance Assessment, restores stability in Air Force acquisition systems by integrating major processes to reverse trends toward unpredictable program cost, schedule, and performance to facilitate quick response to urgent operational needs from across the entire spectrum of potential conflicts. Efforts include:\n- Increasing technical and analytical support through training development; independent cost estimating and assessment to help analyze cost\/risk growth and create defendable risk analyses for cost, schedule, and technical risks; information technology infrastructure development; and economic, statistical, and engineering analyses of acquisition programs\n- Initiating performance measures for capability-based planning constructs, aligning relevant science and technology areas with operational requirements to include systems integration modeling and architecture analysis\n- Increasing activities to recruit, develop, and manage the technical workforce, enhancing business and engineering processes to develop leaders to manage the acquisition and engineering transformation and interface with the academic community\n- Transforming acquisition review processes to re-establish clean lines of responsibility, authority, and accountability at appropriate levels\n- Exploring methods to operate a materiel solution development process that is responsive to COCOM capability needs, aligned with the OSD Joint Task Assignment Process \n- Develop and implement a services-oriented acquisition business systems environment to deliver capabilities for the acquisition professional that support acquisition transformation.  This effort consists of three components (1) establishing a foundational integrated environment, (2) leveraging the existing technologies and data to standardize access and use, and (3) investing in specific capabilities that enhance process transformation and are interoperable within the overall environment.\n- The foundational integrated environment supports the portfolio of acquisition business systems hardware and software, and implements standards for data management and service-oriented design methodology to facilitate efficiency and interoperability by:\n   -- Exposing core business services currently existing in multiple tools and subsequently retiring duplicative capabilities\n   -- Reducing training on multiple acquisitions systems by providing all core functionality through a single common interface\n   -- Consolidating infrastructure to reduce hosting and infrastructure sustainment costs.\n- Existing technologies and data are leveraged to standardize on proven capabilities, and to make existing data stores more accessible and useful across the acquisition domain roles.\n- Focused investments in specific capabilities address critical gaps supporting the efficient operation of the Acquisition Domain, in areas such as:\n   -- Conducting program management and oversight\n   -- Conducting program resources management\n   -- Planning and executing on-time acquisition milestone readiness\n   -- Preparing Purchase Requisitions and Contract Orders\n   -- Managing contract writing \n   -- Adopting commercial enterprise concept of Product Lifecycle Management for the production of traceable requirements \n   -- Planning and execution of technology development and transition\n   -- Standardizing risk management \n   -- Managing access to scientific and technical information\n   -- Increasing industrial base decision-support information.\nThese integrated capabilities will provide OSD and AF acquisition leadership insights needed to effectively manage a complex portfolio of acquisition programs through more timely and reliable access to authoritative acquisition data.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

Funding also provides the framework for Air Force business and acquisition transformation in developing capabilities-based architectures, re-engineering and enabling technologies, integrating robust systems engineering into early acquisition processes, and developing and managing a larger, more relevant technical workforce with the expertise to uniformly implement OSD and Air Force engineering guidance and policies. Leveraging the Defense Acquisition Performance Assessment, restores stability in Air Force acquisition systems by integrating major processes to reverse trends toward unpredictable program cost, schedule, and performance to facilitate quick response to urgent operational needs from across the entire spectrum of potential conflicts. Efforts include:\n- Increasing technical and analytical support through training development; independent cost estimating and assessment to help analyze cost\/risk growth and create defendable risk analyses for cost, schedule, and technical risks; information technology infrastructure development; and economic, statistical, and engineering analyses of acquisition programs\n- Initiating performance measures for capability-based planning constructs, aligning relevant science and technology areas with operational requirements to include systems integration modeling and architecture analysis\n- Increasing activities to recruit, develop, and manage the technical workforce, enhancing business and engineering processes to develop leaders to manage the acquisition and engineering transformation and interface with the academic community\n- Transforming acquisition review processes to re-establish clean lines of responsibility, authority, and accountability at appropriate levels\n- Exploring methods to operate a materiel solution development process that is responsive to COCOM capability needs, aligned with the OSD Joint Task Assignment Process \n- Develop and implement a services-oriented acquisition business systems environment to deliver capabilities for the acquisition professional that support acquisition transformation.  This effort consists of three components (1) establishing a foundational integrated environment, (2) leveraging the existing technologies and data to standardize access and use, and (3) investing in specific capabilities that enhance process transformation and are interoperable within the overall environment.\n- The foundational integrated environment supports the portfolio of acquisition business systems hardware and software, and implements standards for data management and service-oriented design methodology to facilitate efficiency and interoperability by:\n   -- Exposing core business services currently existing in multiple tools and subsequently retiring duplicative capabilities\n   -- Reducing training on multiple acquisitions systems by providing all core functionality through a single common interface\n   -- Consolidating infrastructure to reduce hosting and infrastructure sustainment costs.\n- Existing technologies and data are leveraged to standardize on proven capabilities, and to make existing data stores more accessible and useful across the acquisition domain roles.\n- Focused investments in specific capabilities address critical gaps supporting the efficient operation of the Acquisition Domain, in areas such as:\n   -- Conducting program management and oversight\n   -- Conducting program resources management\n   -- Planning and executing on-time acquisition milestone readiness\n   -- Preparing Purchase Requisitions and Contract Orders\n   -- Managing contract writing \n   -- Adopting commercial enterprise concept of Product Lifecycle Management for the production of traceable requirements \n   -- Planning and execution of technology development and transition\n   -- Standardizing risk management \n   -- Managing access to scientific and technical information\n   -- Increasing industrial base decision-support information.\nThese integrated capabilities will provide OSD and AF acquisition leadership insights needed to effectively manage a complex portfolio of acquisition programs through more timely and reliable access to authoritative acquisition data.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."
