To further reduce technology and manufacturing risk in MGUE Increment 1, the three contractors will continue risk reduction activities under the MUE completion effort.  This activity is a two part effort: (1) Refining software to resolve any deficiencies revealed during functional qualification tests (FQT) and independent government test & evaluation, and (2) Initiating ASIC modifications to accommodate new updates to GPS system Interface Control Documents (ICDs). This effort will conclude shortly before MGUE Increment 1 PDR, ensuring each contractor has completed discovery and technology maturation in preparation for entry into the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development phase."
