The program also funds development and acquisition of Operational Test Command's (OTC) major field instrumentation.  Requirements for instrumentation are identified through a long range survey of project managers, Research Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs), and Battle Laboratories developing future weapon systems and the test programs that support these systems.  Army testing facilities are also surveyed to determine major testing capability shortfalls."

Army Test and Evaluation Command's (ATEC) activities which include: Yuma Test Center (YTC), AZ; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), MD; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), AZ; White Sands Test Center (WSTC), NM; Redstone Test Center (RTC), AL. \n\nProjects are designated as a major test program based on their visibility, assessed relative technical risk (medium-high), schedule risk, cost (generally greater than $1 Million per year or $5 Million for the total project) and applicability to other mission areas or services.  These projects are technically demanding, state-of-the-art, unique instrumentation assets or suites to meet the technology shortfalls, and generally result from development programs managed by a professional project management team.  \nFiber Optic Network II (FON II) is the installation of digital fiber optic cable and transmission electronics to modernize secure and expand the backbone telecommunication and data transmission network in support of Aberdeen Test Center.  Systems Test and Integration Laboratory (STIL) is the development of a systems integration and test lab for use in developmental testing and integration engineering, including a virtual test environment to support integration testing of aviation electronic systems as a part of modernization of army aircraft.  Advanced Distributed Modular Acquisition System (ADMAS) Product Improvement Program (PIP) develops very small and low power pocket sized ADMAS systems which will extend the Versatile Information Systems Integrated Online system's (VISION) capabilities to support dismounted and small robotic platforms.  Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP) will replace obsolete tracking radars at Redstone Test Center (RTC), Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) and Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) with modern instrumentation radars.  CRIIS Objective Program provides precision location instrumentation which will significantly increase the T&E ranges' capability to meet the test instrumentation needs of the tri-service range users.  Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) Electromagnetic Radiation Effects (EMRE) Systems Modernization will upgrade equipment at the WSMR EMRE site where E3 testing is performed to evaluate survivability and vulnerability of military systems.  Project will upgrade and replace signal transmitters, refurbish an anechoic test chamber, replace data acquisition equipment and install a new turntable to support test items."

In addition, develop and field a Real-Time, Hardware-in-the-Loop, M&S Federation, which can be accredited and portray Blue and Threat Computer Network Device (CND) and Controller Area Network (CAN) will begin in FY12. \n \nTest and Training Common Technology Initiative, Network, Real Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA), Data Collection and After Action Review (AAR) will develop and sustain Army Test and Training Instrumentation Test Bed, support Trade-Off Studies, Development of Common Standards, Analysis of Alternatives, Cost Benefit Analyses, Test Technology Demonstrations and\/or Technology Readiness Events. This capability will also provide risk reduction to future developed assets required to meet test and training needs. These tools will collect, store and analyze data from this new dimension of digital battlefield warfare. This effort responds to the current Operations Tempo (OPTEMPO) and Personnel Tempo (PERSTEMPO) demands to force the U.S. Army to conduct more realistic, more accurate, and comprehensive evaluations at reduced costs by virtually replicating a greater number of troop resources in force-on-force testing and training exercises.  \n\nOperational Test Command (OTC) Advanced Simulation & Instrumentation Systems (OASIS) Enterprise Integration System (EIS) supports the OTC simulation and test support capabilities.  Operational testing of enterprise\/systems of systems (SoS) capabilities requires an integrated test technology tools enterprise: 1) Test Planning & Control systems \/ networks, 2) Live-virtual-constructive (LVC) simulations, 3) Data Collection, Reduction, Analysis (DCRA), and visualization tools and 4) tactical systems and networks. The OASIS-EIS will support test tool integration in three major areas:  1) harmonize OT test technology integration with other acquisition efforts (RTCA, networks, data collection) at the ATEC level, 2) transition Battle Command Network Integration Simulation (BCNIS) program management to PEO-STRI (PM-ITTS) to support leverage by other PEO STRI and ATEC offices (initially TSMO, EPG and RTC), and 3) develop an ATEC and PEO-STRI program to achieve efficiencies and cost savings through shared development and enhancement of key simulation (primarily gaming, virtual, and constructive), and LVC integration capabilities.  Initial focus for shared simulation\/LVC enablers will be in the area of network, fires and ISR simulations and LVC architecture planning, engineering and integration tools."
