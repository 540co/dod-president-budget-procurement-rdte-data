JI&I-funded endeavors aim to improve US and coalition capabilities to conduct coordinated operations.  Necessarily, JI&I-funded projects most frequently address Command & Control (C2) and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) - the capstone capabilities for integrating disparate elements of military force for joint and coalition operations.  The JI&I Program supports tasks and projects associated with integration & interoperability of the C2 Portfolio including coordination of C2 operational architectures, standards, and policies. Likewise, JI&I partially funds integration and decision support activities associated with DOD executive level C4 management and oversight.  \n\nThe JI&I Program deliver outcomes conforming to joint integration missions:\n- In concert with the separately funded Joint Systems Integration Command (JSIC) and Joint Fires Integration Interoperability Team (JFIIT), JI&I resources investigate joint C2\/C4ISR shortfalls and ascertain characteristics of DOTMLPF remedies to meet mission requirements. The remedies are then pursued through partnerships with Component force development authorities and acquisition sponsors. \n- Consistent with the role as operational sponsor for joint C2, JI&I underwrites Joint Combat Capability Developer (JCCD) activities compiling operational requirements for C2\/C4ISR capability development and integrated testing. \n- Delivers assessment and recommendations for improvement of interoperable Combat Identification (CID) and Situational Awareness (SA) capabilities among United States forces, interagency organizations, and allied\/coalition forces;\n- Establishes joint data standards and cross domain solutions to facilitate future system interoperability and integration.
