            "val": "The Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES)Program Element (PE) includes Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES), a system being developed as the next-generation AF interface to the Joint Operational Planning and Execution System (JOPES).  DCAPES is the Air Force's single system to present, plan, source, mobilize, deploy, account for, sustain, redeploy, and reconstitute forces for contingency and crisis operations.   This system provides a real time, two way interchange of personnel, manpower, logistics, and operational data between the Air Force and the warfighting Combatant Commanders.   It matches people, cargo, and airframes\/weapon systems to the Combatant Commander's warfighting requirements.  Acquisition of this system supports the Air Force's expeditionary force concept.\n\nDevelopment activities may also include Logistics Feasibility Analysis Capability (LOGFAC), Logistics Module\/Manpower and Personnel Module-Base (LOGMOD\/MANPER B), War and Mobilization Planning (WMP), Enhanced Contingency Rotational AEF SchedulingTool (ECAST), Web Enablement, and JOPES Modernization Migration.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning to modify systems to consume authoritative force structure from Global Force Management-Data Initiative (GFM-DI) organizational servers, linking the identifiers to or replacing current identifiers and, as applicable, exposing the data in a net-centric fashion.\n\nThis effort is an evolutionary follow-on to the Contingency Operations Mobility Planning and Execution System (COMPES).  DCAPES replaced the operational tasking and priorities functionality of COMPES with modern relational databases, integrated-distributed database, and common and shared data consistent with the joint vision for integrated command and control.  DCAPES is intended to provide a command and control capability by exchanging data with a range of planning support systems to provide a more effective force projection capability for a wider range of operational scenarios and will fully support the force provider function of the AF Forces (AFFOR) commander.  DCAPES along with numerous other war planning support legacy systems are transitioning into a net-centric Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment via a War Planning and Execution System (WPES) management construct.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution, and future program planning.\n\nFunding will also support development and systems engineering activities, to include (1) facilitating improvements to system effectiveness through efficient segregation of mission capabilities (apps, services, applications) from underlying networking, middleware and computing infrastructures by using common architecture, standards, and services, and (2) employing a rapid\/agile IT acquisition process to effectively deliver capabilities to the warfighter.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or having approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

DCAPES is the Air Force's single system to present, plan, source, mobilize, deploy, account for, sustain, redeploy, and reconstitute forces for contingency and crisis operations.   This system provides a real time, two way interchange of personnel, manpower, logistics, and operational data between the Air Force and the warfighting Combatant Commanders.   It matches people, cargo, and airframes\/weapon systems to the Combatant Commander's warfighting requirements.  Acquisition of this system supports the Air Force's expeditionary force concept.\n\nDevelopment activities may also include Logistics Feasibility Analysis Capability (LOGFAC), Logistics Module\/Manpower and Personnel Module-Base (LOGMOD\/MANPER B), War and Mobilization Planning (WMP), Enhanced Contingency Rotational AEF SchedulingTool (ECAST), Web Enablement, and JOPES Modernization Migration.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning to modify systems to consume authoritative force structure from Global Force Management-Data Initiative (GFM-DI) organizational servers, linking the identifiers to or replacing current identifiers and, as applicable, exposing the data in a net-centric fashion.\n\nThis effort is an evolutionary follow-on to the Contingency Operations Mobility Planning and Execution System (COMPES).  DCAPES replaced the operational tasking and priorities functionality of COMPES with modern relational databases, integrated-distributed database, and common and shared data consistent with the joint vision for integrated command and control.  DCAPES is intended to provide a command and control capability by exchanging data with a range of planning support systems to provide a more effective force projection capability for a wider range of operational scenarios and will fully support the force provider function of the AF Forces (AFFOR) commander.  DCAPES along with numerous other war planning support legacy systems are transitioning into a net-centric Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment via a War Planning and Execution System (WPES) management construct.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution, and future program planning.\n\nFunding will also support development and systems engineering activities, to include (1) facilitating improvements to system effectiveness through efficient segregation of mission capabilities (apps, services, applications) from underlying networking, middleware and computing infrastructures by using common architecture, standards, and services, and (2) employing a rapid\/agile IT acquisition process to effectively deliver capabilities to the warfighter.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or having approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
