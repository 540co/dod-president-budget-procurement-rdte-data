Project conducts demonstration and validation of improved subsistence and subsistence support items used to enhance soldier effectiveness and quality of life in all four Services, as part of an integrated Department of Defense (DoD) Food Research, Development, Test, Evaluation and Engineering Program.  The Program is reviewed and validated twice annually by the DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board (CFREB) as part of the Joint Service Food Program.  This project develops critical enablers that support the Joint Future Force Capabilities and the Joint expeditionary mindset by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment.  This equipment enhances the field soldier's well-being and provides the soldier with usable equipment, in addition to reducing sustainment requirements, related Combat Support\/Combat Service Support (CS\/CSS) demands on lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.\n\nThis PE\/Project supports Field Feeding Programs for all the services."

The REF adds value for the Army by rapidly providing urgent capabilities to U.S. Army Forces employed globally by harnessing technologies in order to improve operational effectiveness. The REF canvasses the military, industry, academia and science communities for readily available commercial and government solutions that do not currently exist in the Army inventory, and then transitions successes to Army Materiel Command (AMC) for sustainment and in appropriate cases back to the Army Acquisition community as a Program of Record, for future life-cycle management. Additionally, the REF facilitates the early deployment of Army-managed solutions to meet emerging requirements.\n\nThe REF bridges the gap between the lengthy acquisition process and immediate equipping needs.  We pursue tangible solutions that can be equipped within a goal of 90 days. REF focuses on finding effective game-changing capabilities to increase Soldier effectiveness, protection and lethality in any operational environment. The REF process provides the mechanism to respond rapidly to an adaptive enemy who changes in days and months, not years. The REF Teams deployed in theater work with Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) to understand their urgent needs, for which the REF acquisition capability may identify, procure and deliver solutions to the deployed units. A key element of this process is fiscal flexibility, permitting the REF to allocate funds against emerging threats and requirements in the year of fiscal execution.  \n\nThe REF works directly with Operational Commanders at Brigade and below to find solutions to identified equipping requirements. These solutions may result in procurement of new or existing military\/commercial materiel equipment, or accelerated development of a Future Force materiel solution for insertion into the current force now.  The REF key tasks are:\n- Be responsive to tactical unit commanders engage Brigade Combat Team\/Brigade Commanders (BCT\/BDE CDRs)early and often\n- Bridge specific Operational Needs Statement\/Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (ONS\/JUONS)Gaps meet urgent needs\n- In coordination with Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG)develop materiel solutions to counter Asymmetric Threats\n- Ensure adequate training and sustainment are provided with every capability\n- Cultivate and rapidly insert emerging technologies into Soldiers hands\n- Conduct operational assessments to provide useful operator feedback to the Army \n- Transition effective projects through Capability Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) to support long-term sustainment\n- Be aggressive and push the acquisition envelope, but operate within the law\n- Integrate with existing Army organizations and systems to enable them to recognize and solve problems for tactical units \n\nThe REF Integrated Priority List (RIPL) (Top 11 Priorities driven by input from Deployed Units) drives all REF efforts. The priorities with metrics are shown below:\n1.Dismounted Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Defeat Measures (Requirements 34; Projects 57)\n2.Dismounted Support Operations (Requirements 36; Projects 44)\n3.Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Shortfalls in Environmentally Inhospitable Operational Environments(OEs) (high wind\/high altitude, sewers, tunnels, etc.) (Requirements 93; Projects 97)\n4.Small Combat Outpost (COP)\/Patrol Base Force Protection and Village Support Operations (Requirements 82; Projects 97)\n5.Dismounted Blue Force Tracking and Mission Command (Requirements 18; Projects 20)\n6.Counter Ambush (precision (Small Arms Fire (SAF) and Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) (Requirements 33; Projects 36)\n7.Non-Lethal Messaging (Requirements 9; Projects 9)\n8.Advanced Escalation of Force Equipment (Requirements 22; Projects 19)\n9.Entry control point operations and Vehicle Search Operations (Requirements 13; Projects 19)\n10.Route Clearance Support for non Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) Paladin\/Engineer Units (Requirements 1; Projects 1)\n11.Other (Requirements 129; Projects 79) Additional areas of focus in this priority include reducing energy dependence in small tactical units and understanding the causes of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\nThe REF FY13 RDT&E Request of $5.994 million (base) $19.860 million (OCO) integrates, coordinates, deploys and provides urgent material capabilities to deployed and pre-deploying units in support of Joint and Army Forces Commanders to enhance the combat effectiveness of the operating force and enable the defeat of asymmetric threats. The emphasis for RDT&E funding is on Testing and Evaluation that supports projects in the areas of Force Protection, IED Detection and Defeat, enhanced ISR capabilities, Tactical Command, Control and Communication tools. \n \nRDT&E funding also provides the REF the flexibility to invest in near-term, innovative solutions. RDT&E funds are necessary in the vast majority of all REF projects. REF uses RDT&E funds to work with industry and Other Governmental Agencies (OGAs) in order to further develop high (>6) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) or advanced technologies that often only need small amounts of funding in order to help them achieve a maturity level that is suitable to solve a Warfighter problem with low investments for high payoffs. REF requires RDT&E funds to integrate several different Commercial Off The Shelf\/Government Off The Shelf (COTS\/GOTS) technologies into one capability that solves the tougher and more complex problems. REF uses RDT&E funds to conduct demonstrations and tests to validate technology solutions.  REF requires RDT&E funds in order to modify existing technologies that were developed for one purpose but now may be suitable to solve another problem. REF Expeditionary Labs use RDT&E funds to develop and adapt technologies that meet immediate requirements forward in the theaters of operation with the active assistance of the Warfighter in the solution development process. REF requires RDT&E funds to test technologies in order to ensure suitability and safety before equipping the Warfighter - Any modified COTS\/GOTS item has to be tested.\n \nThe Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG) integrates, coordinates, deploys and provides trained and ready forces in support of Joint and Army Forces Commanders' to enhance the combat effectiveness of the operating force and enable the defeat of asymmetric threats. The AWG observes, collects, develops, validates, and disseminates emerging tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to supported units. AWG povides Train-the-Trainer for countering asymmetric threats, to include Improvised Explosive Devices, suicide bombers and bioweapons. AWG identifies and coordinates the fielding of rapid prototyping and\/or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions to counter asymmetrical threats. By providing the tools, expertise, and experience necessary to improve and quicken a units' reaction to rapidly changing TTPs, the AWG supports the rapid targeting and target execution of asymmetric warfare threats. The AWG also provides service procedures for identifying and disseminating lessons learned in order to support the need for rapid adaptation. Additionally, the AWG provides service acquisition and develops fielding procedures in support of Commanders' requirements for new technologies and materiel solutions for Asymmetric threa"

All capabilities are safety tested prior to insertion into operational environments. Training and sustainment is provided for every capability until it is transitioned to an approved program of record or terminated through the CDRT process. Operational assessments are conducted to provide feedback in support of Army fielding decisions. REF capabilities routinely serve to bridge specific ONS and JUONS gaps to meet urgent requirements."
