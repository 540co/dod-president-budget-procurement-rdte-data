Working closely with programs in the advanced technology development phase, this effort will result in reviews of program technology feasibility from an interoperability perspective and push to proof of concept through prototyping and modeling.\n\nJoint Interoperability has additional efforts to develop advanced mathematics techniques to manage large volumes of sensor data to solve DoD Battlefield challenges, to review new interoperability technologies, and to review program documentation not only to ensure a joint and interoperable approach, but also to mature technologies that advance warfighter effectiveness and that apply technology rapidly to battlespace challenges."

Sharing of systems and information across Services, and with coalition and non-DoD partners, has the benefit of a more rapid and better coordinated response to an ever more agile adversary.  It also enables the full exploitation of our costly (legacy and future) weapon systems at full kinematic range and makes full use of the assets in theater.

This database is intended to enable program managers, test and evaluation personnel, and warfighters to access any available signatures to meet acquisition program, test and evaluation, and operational requirements without expenditure of funding to develop unique set of data.  \n\nJoint Personnel Recovery (JPR)\n\u2022 Provided innovative leadership to the JPR mission by initiating development of six ECPs to integrate Service specific and non-interoperable Personnel Recovery (PR) systems that provide increased capability to the warfighter operating in harms\u2019 way and support personnel operating in the field (soldiers, reporters, ambassadors, contractors, etc.).   This capability is expected to being integration into systems during FY 2012 and fielding in FY 2013.\n\u2022 Provided leadership and oversight to development of operational context that included development and application of joint mission threads and system technical functional descriptions to steer and focus technical interoperable solutions in the Joint Close Air Support, PR, Counter Improvised Explosive Devices, Global Force Management, EW and Electronic Attack, Joint Fires, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief, and Computer Network Defense, Computer Network Attack, and Computer Network Exploitation."

Through a systematic and thorough process, including comprehensive technology assessments, net technical assessments that engage in comparative analysis of United States versus non-United States capabilities, the program will better inform early shaping of acquisition programs, to include Special Access Programs, from a capabilities portfolio management perspective to deliver improved capabilities to the current and future joint warfighter.  This shaping is supported through capability-based assessments, requirements analysis, joint capability area assessments, integrated roadmap development, and the development\/integration of risk-based collaborative tools to conduct capability-based assessments.  These efforts were previously funded under Program Element 0604875D8Z, Joint Systems Architecture Development."
