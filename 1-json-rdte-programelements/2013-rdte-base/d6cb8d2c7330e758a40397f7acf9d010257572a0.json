The AMRAAM Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) program allows Air Force and Navy to continue a joint research and development program.  This enables AMRAAM to be compatible with advanced fighters, enhances AMRAAM capability and operational flexibility against current and projected threats, incorporates high payoff technology development, performs risk reduction activities and investigates new variants and\/or alternate missions which may use AMRAAM attributes. The AIM-120D (Phase 4) delivers improved performance via Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided navigation, a two-way datalink capability for enhanced aircrew survivability and improved network compatibility, and incorporates new guidance software which improves kinematic and weapon effectiveness performance.  Phase 4 Functional Configuration Audit (FCA) was successfully completed in September 2009.  In FY2010, a period of combined Developmental Test (DT)\/Operational Test (OT) was initiated to ensure overall aircraft and missile weapons system maturity prior to the start of dedicated OT.  Dedicated OT will start in FY2012. The program includes integration of the missile onto the F\/A-18E\/F, F-15C\/D\/E, F-16, F-22A, and F-18 C\/D.  To keep the existing inventory as effective as possible, the Air Force and Navy also develop, test, and field improvements that are implemented via software upgrades reprogrammed into fielded weapons, and\/or hardware upgrades inserted into production units.  AMRAAM is a joint Air Force\/Navy, Acquisition Category IC (ACAT IC) program with Air Force as lead service. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7-Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The AMRAAM Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) program allows Air Force and Navy to continue a joint research and development program.  This enables AMRAAM to be compatible with advanced fighters, enhances AMRAAM capability and operational flexibility against current and projected threats, incorporates high payoff technology development, performs risk reduction activities and investigates new variants and\/or alternate missions which may use AMRAAM attributes. The AIM-120D (Phase 4) delivers improved performance via Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided navigation, a two-way datalink capability for enhanced aircrew survivability and improved network compatibility, and incorporates new guidance software which improves kinematic and weapon effectiveness performance.  Phase 4 Functional Configuration Audit (FCA) was successfully completed in September 2009.  In FY2010, a period of combined Developmental Test (DT)\/Operational Test (OT) was initiated to ensure overall aircraft and missile weapons system maturity prior to the start of dedicated OT.  Dedicated OT will start in FY2012. The program includes integration of the missile onto the F\/A-18E\/F, F-15C\/D\/E, F-16, F-22A, and F-18 C\/D.  To keep the existing inventory as effective as possible, the Air Force and Navy also develop, test, and field improvements that are implemented via software upgrades reprogrammed into fielded weapons, and\/or hardware upgrades inserted into production units.  AMRAAM is a joint Air Force\/Navy, Acquisition Category IC (ACAT IC) program with Air Force as lead service. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7-Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Three successful DT\/OT shots were conducted but several anomalies were discovered during this period.  These anomalies were attributed to software maturity with the missile and aircraft integration.  Several of the anomolies have been mitigated.  Further improvements are being flight-tested in early FY2012.  The program plans to enter dedicated OT in the third quarter of FY2012.  \n\nThe AIM-120D Missile Performance Specification (MPS) and Interface Control Document (ICD) define the requirement to integrate the Phase 4 AMRAAM onto the F-15, F-16, and F-22A.  Integration activities are supported via a series of contractual efforts managed via the host platform programs.  For AMRAAM upgrades, contracts were awarded to analyze potential candidates to improve the AIM-120C\/D configurations to provide the warfighter the capability to counter current and emerging threats.  Candidates that are at the appropriate level of technical maturity will be incorporated via a series of design implementation contracts.  Less mature high-payoff candidates will continue to be developed further via concept refinement\/risk reduction contracts for incorporation in future development activities."
