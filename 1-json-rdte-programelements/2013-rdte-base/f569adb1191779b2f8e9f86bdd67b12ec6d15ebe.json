            "val": "These programs are part of a coordinated effort to develop and deploy capabilities for rapidly linking and integrating Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) forces for Services, Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), coalition, and other government agencies.  These programs will create a realistic battlespace environment in which to train as a Joint Warfighting force to meet emerging mission requirements including adapting to new and future realities.  These investments support the Secretary of Defense\u2019s (SECDEF) Commanders Exercise and Engagement Training Transformation (CE2T2) initiative to enable and enhance Joint Warfighting readiness by training as we intend to fight.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:\n\n- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n- Joint Simulation Systems (JSS)\n- Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC)\n- U.S. Forces Korea Training & Exercise Support (USFK)\n- Immersive Trainer \n- Air Force JNTC\n- Navy JNTC\n\nJNTC:  Established in 2003, JNTC continues to develop and integrate Advanced Training Technologies into a seamless Joint training environment.  JNTC establishes the overarching Joint framework and context necessary for COCOMs and Services to achieve a Joint training environment through an integrated network of training sites and nodes.  JNTC provides the common standards, architecture, and development processes required to link Joint training programs.  By leveraging existing training programs or initiating specific actions, JNTC is developing credible opposing force capabilities and expanded access to assets from other Services and locations which are typically unavailable to the training audience by developing and integrating modeled and simulated representations of these capabilities. This furthers the integration of Joint training objectives into Service training events, while capturing the objective data necessary to provide a complete and accurate after action review.  This program develops and enhances current and future Joint training enterprise capabilities.\n\nJSS:  This effort provides warfighters with Joint Simulations and Tools that enhance and enable Joint training across Services, COCOMs, Agencies and Coalition partners.  These Joint Simulations and Tools are part of an overall Joint Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) baseline of training capabilities resident in the Joint Force Trainer Toolkit (JFTT).  The JFTT is a set of training enablers, and \u201ccertified systems\u201d that are interoperable and acceptable for usage within the Joint training environment.  The Joint Simulations and Tools provided by JSS are critical enablers that support the delivery of trained, capable, and interoperable Joint Forces.  \n\nJKDDC:  Develop a Joint Individual Training Toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products and services.  Products and services are developed in response to JKDDC Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) Stakeholder (COCOMs, Services, and Combat Support Agencies) prioritized training requirements.  JKDDC JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education and tailored common training standards to Service members for tasks that are jointly executed, resulting in trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JKDDC JKO technology initiatives principally include Virtual Cultural Awareness Training (VCAT) web-based gaming, Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST), and mobile courseware training devices.  These capabilities facilitate the training and preparation of tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to COCOM theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined\/Joint Task Force (C\/JTF) billets. Specifically, VCAT supports one of the top  identified training shortcomings of returning warriors from United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) based C\/JTFs (cultural awareness training). C\/JTF \u2018battle staffs\u2019 will be adequately trained, as individuals and the staffs collectively, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise. JKO mobile courseware training device development facilitates the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms for joint warriors.  The future learning environment will provide training and learning to promote adaptability and agility in the workforce with the capability to tailor and adapt instructional material to fit the learner's strengths and weaknesses, learning style, and level of proficiency.\n      \nUSFK:  This program will develop a Jointly Accredited and Supported Modeling & Simulation federation of constructive simulations capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations.  This simulation system is also interoperable with the Republic of Korea developed Korean Simulation System.  This solution will be capable of interoperating in a common battle space that realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences, tactical to strategic, in Korean theater exercises.  While supporting USFK\u2019s specific requirements, this solution will contain enhancements that will benefit all users of the JLVC.\n\nImmersive Trainer:  This program supports a broader national effort to advance and integrate emerging technologies to increase the effectiveness of training in dismounted, small-unit operations in the contemporary operating environment.  Today\u2019s dismounted forces when placed in a complex, culturally rich  environment require a training capability that challenges their mental agility as they are required to rapidly adapt in a dynamic environment which ranges from  conventional battles to irregular warfare (IW).  In close coordination with the Services, the Immersive Trainer imitative will create a realistic virtual environment to train small military units with the required level of complexity while creating sensory overload and decision-making under extreme stress.  Additionally, the Immersive Trainer will capture detailed data during complex scenarios to facilitate in-depth debrief and capture lessons learned for training audiences.  To date, this detailed debrief capability has been limited to operators of high-end platforms like fighter aircraft.  Now the infantry squad will be provided a comparable capability as aircraft crew to conduct mission rehearsals and after action reviews before and after critical missions. This capability for our dismounted general purpose and special operations forces is vital to saving lives and ensuring effective and ethical small unit operations in the future.  The immersive trainer also is a key component in development of small unit leaders by allowing them to train in a realistic environment which can be altered to stress different learning objectives.\n\nAir Force JNTC:  Supports the SECDEF's Transformation in Training\/Joint National Training Capability (JNTC).  Develops capabilities that integrate live, virtual, and constructive elements into a seamless joint training environment.  Using a scientific and phased approach and focusing on modeling air and space capabilities, researches new technologies and methods that provide a crucial technology-based foundation supporting all JNTC operations.\n\nNavy JNTC:  Supports SECDEF Transformation of DoD training and Joint National Training Capability. These funds enable Navy in developing unique maritime capabilities that integrate live, virtual, and constructive elements into a seamless joint training environment. Navy continues to develop and integrated joint training technologies that play a crucial role in its ability to address current and future joint operational training requirements. Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation and cross-service architecture certification on all T2 capable systems, developing cross-domain architectures for US and Coalition Forces as well as ensure sister service modeling\/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a common unified standard."

The JWFC FMB\/CAMB consists of senior technical, operational, program manager, and stakeholder representatives within the Joint Force Trainer Community. The board\u2019s responsibilities encompass merging and prioritizing technical training requirements. It apportions work to the RDT&E elements based on an assessment of where the work is best accomplished. The boards evaluate the efficacy of development efforts based on performance metrics and will vote on whether or not to continue the effort.  This process will ensure the Joint Force Trainer capabilities development effort synchronizes with war-fighter requirements.\n\nSpecific performance metrics for FY 2012 include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022  Navy will produce one JSAF software release to include documentation; will design and implement upgrades to JSAF consistent with approved requirements and CRs and document the effects of JSAF capabilities (robustness) and stability.  Will design, implement, test, and integrate JSAF enhancements in accordance with requirements.\n\n\u2022  Navy will produce one Navy Training Federation Object Model (FOM) (NTF) release to include applicable documentation updates for the Guidance, Rational, and Interoperability Manual (GRIM) and Federation Agreement document (FAD). Will implement JSAF capability enhancements to support evolving joint and Coalition training requirements.\n\n\u2022  Navy will deliver a JSAF\/JNTC-JLVC FOM interoperability Guide.\n\n\u2022  Navy will facilitate integration by providing dedicated support to the effort, improving the quality of participation and documentation of Navy efforts in the JNTC.  Refine and mature the Navy Training Federation Object Model (NTF), it is improving interoperability and integration with other services and the Joint community.  Provides a standardized FOM for integration across the Navy training simulations.\n\n\u2022  Navy\u2019s current Joint Live-Virtual-Constructive (JLVC) and other federation simulation distribution is accomplished by tying simulation data to multicast groups. This is neither a scalable solution nor is it an effective one as federates are not able to publish and subscribe with fine enough precision. The Simulation Aware Software Router will address this shortcoming, and additionally provide a flexible solution for federating heterogeneous networks and on-the-wire protocols without forcing all federates onto a single, uniform, lowest common denominator solution for each training event.  Ultimately, a simulation aware router will allow simulation users to optimize the network for both simulation scalable traffic and for voice and Command, Control, Communications, (Computers), Intelligence (C4I) traffic."
