There are two (2) variants of the JASSM missile:  Baseline JASSM and an extended range JASSM (JASSM-ER).  Aircraft integration of baseline JASSM is complete on the B-52H, F-16 (Block 50), B-1, and B-2.  Objective aircraft include the F-15E, F-16 (Block 40), and F-35.  Aircraft integration for JASSM-ER is the B-1B.  Objective aircraft is the B-52H, F16C\/D (Block 50\/52), B-2, F-16C\/D (Block25-42), F-15E, and F-35.  In Jun 2007, the DAE designated the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) program an ACAT 1D program due to a Nunn-McCurdy unit cost breach.  On 1 May, 2008, the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) completed its Nunn-McCurdy review of the JASSM program and certified a restructured program to consist of two separable increments, JASSM baseline and JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) - both with improved reliability, separate milestone decision points and separate projects within a single program element.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.  The JASSM program is evaluating Diminishing Manufacturing Sources Material Shortages (DMSMS) and several obsolescence issues."

Aircraft integration of the baseline JASSM is complete on the B-52H, F-16 (Block 50), B-1, and B-2.  Objective aircraft include the F-15E, F-16 (Block 40), and F-35.  The government is buying the JASSM system based on a contractor-developed, government-approved System Performance Specification (SPS), this SPS is on contract.  The contractor assumes total system performance responsibility (TSPR) for Lots 1-6 as defined in the SPS; for Lot 7 and beyond, the Government has approval authority of Class I configuration changes. This project also develops improvements to the JASSM and JASSM-ER fuze, including the development of the Electronic Safe and Arm Fuze (ESAF). JASSM was designated ACAT 1D in Jun 2007 due to a Nunn-McCurdy unit cost breach.  The JASSM restructured program was certified by DAE to Congress on 1 May 2008."

The threshold integration platform for JASSM-ER is the B-1B.  Objective aircraft include the B-52H, F-16 (Block 40\/50), B-2, F-15E, and F-35.  JASSM-ER provides the capability to attack a variety of high value fixed or relocatable targets with precision, through preplanned missions or target-of-opportunity, deeper into enemy territory than JASSM Baseline while minimizing the threat to launch aircraft.  The Air Force is developing JASSM-ER based on a contractor-developed, government-approved System Performance Specification (SPS) Rev B dated February 28, 2007, which was updated under JASSM-ER development Phase II System Development and Demonstration in FY07.  JASSM and JASSM-ER programs  were designated ACAT 1D in June 2007 due to a Nunn-McCurdy unit cost breach.  On 1 May, 2008, the DAE completed its Nunn-McCurdy review of the JASSM program and certified the program to Congress.  This project also develops a Common Telemetry Instrumentation Kit (C-TIK) which will be used during flight testing and will be common to JASSM and JASSM-ER.  Improvements to the JASSM and JASSM-ER fuze, including the development of the Electronic Safe and Arm Fuze (ESAF) is accomplished in this project.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

In 2008, the program office awarded a Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF) contract with performance incentives to complete the development effort. In January 2010, the program office awarded the remaining 12 JASSM-ER operational test assets with the JASSM Lot 8 production contract. Milestone C was approved on 10 Jan 11 and the JASSM-ER program started Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) with the Lot 9 contract award in 3QFY11."
