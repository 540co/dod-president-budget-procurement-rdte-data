            "val": "Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration.  It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapons, cargo, passenger, and\/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirements, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print, and brief the mission plan; and download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics. \n\nThe Mission Planning Systems (MPS) program is a collaborative program with the Army and Navy to leverage technical solutions and business practices for all Department of Defense (DoD) platforms.  It provides automated mission planning tools and support for fixed and rotary wing aircraft and guided munitions.  It will replace two closed architecture legacy mission planning systems (Unix-based MPS (Unix-MPS) and the PC-based Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS)), with a single multi-service open architecture system more commonly referred to as the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).  MPS will compress the mission planning cycle by providing an improved integrated planning environment, reducing the time required to respond to changing situations and urgent needs such as striking time sensitive\/critical targets and conducting combat search and rescue.  The MPS development program will migrate a variety of Air Force aircraft, weapons, and airdrop payload systems from legacy mission planners to MPS.  These systems include, but are not limited to the: A-10, B-1B, C-5, C-17, C-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, F-16, F-22A, RC-135, HH-60, and their associated weapons (e.g. Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Munitions (JASSM), etc.) and airdrop payloads.  In addition, basic MPS products have the potential to support all DoD fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft and will be shared with other AF programs as well as the Army and Navy.  MPS will deliver significant benefits to command and control performance by enhancing information superiority for the warfighter and by providing unique capabilities in support of both precision engagement and dominant maneuver.  Additionally, elements of Mission Planning Systems will be utilized to continue the development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) in conjunction with the Army.\n\nThe JPADS System of Systems (SoS) capability provides a planning and execution capability for DoD airdrop requirements. It is the primary airdrop mission planning and execution system for all ballistic airdrop mission as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and\/or standoff precision delivery.  JPADS enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) & insurgent attack on ground convoys. JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, etc. to accurately deliver payloads to keep the warfighter supplied and in the fight.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and\/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirement and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; and download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics.\n\nThis project provides for the continuous improvement of mission planning software capabilities that cut across all platforms and systems.  It includes all FY10 and prior development activities for migrating selected Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Mobility Air Forces (MAF) platforms to MPS.  It also allows for the investigation of new technologies and products that have the potential for improving mission planning systems.  This includes the continuous upgrading of the MPS framework.  The framework is the underlying baseline for all mission planning systems.  It will require continuous upgrades to: 1) reduce timelines for route planning; 2) transmit near real-time intelligence data to the platforms; 3) increase the accuracy of the mapping products; 4) provide a Windows-based, commercial off the shelf-based, user friendly product; and 5) retain compatibility with platform changes to avionics and operational flight programs.  \n\nThis project also continues the development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System-Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) in conjunction with the Army. The JPADS System of Systems (SoS) capability provides a planning and execution capability for DoD airdrop requirements. It is the primary airdrop mission planning and execution system when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and\/or standoff precision delivery. JPADS enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Device (IED), and insurgent attack on ground convoys. JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, etc. to accurately deliver payload. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. Development and modernization activities within this project are as follows:\n\na. MPS Increment IV - continues all FY10 and prior year development activities to migrate selected CAF and MAF platforms to the MPS Increment IV planning systems capability.  This includes the initial migration of all designated Increment IV platforms.  FY2011 and outyear development activities for Increment IV will be completed as part of respective projects for CAF and MAF planning systems.\n\nb. MPS Modernization - continues the modernization of overarching technologies (including the framework) to support development of Mission Planning Environments (MPEs) for various CAF and MAF platforms.\n\nc. CAF MPE Modernization: Beginning in FY13, these efforts will modernize CAF MPEs that were developed and delivered under MPS Increments II \u2013 IV.  The modernization effort will provide new and improved mission planning capability for individual Operational Flight Program (OFP) requirements, such as new weapons, avionics upgrades, communications systems, etc.  The OFPs requiring MPE updates under the CAF Modernization effort in Fiscal Years 2011 through 2017 include but are not limited to those for A-10 (Suites 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), B-1B (Sustainment Blocks (SB) 15, 16, 16a, 17 and 18), and F-15 (Suites 7, 8, 9, and 10).  CAF modernization also includes updates to mission planning capabilities supporting associated weapons, including Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM).  Finally, CAF modernization will address required improvements to CAF related MPE Common Components (CCs), including Precision-Guided Munitions Planning System (PGMPS), Electronic Warfare CC (EWCC), etc.  \n\nd. MAF MPE Modernization: This effort modifies the common MAF MPE developed and deployed during previous mission planning increments. The modernization activities will provide new and improved mission planning capabilities for the MAF fleet as required to meet evolving OFP, fuel efficiency and Global Planning netcentric requirements such as avionics upgrades, communication systems, interfaces with command and control systems, new chutes, etc. for various MAF platforms. The MPE updates under the MAF Modernization effort in Fiscal Years 2011 through 2017 include but are not limited to those for C-5, C-17, C-27, C-130s (multiple variants), E-3, E-8, E-4, HH-60, KC-10, KC-46, KC-135, and RC-135. MAF modernization will address required improvements to MAF related MPE CCs, including the Communications, Navigation Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) CC, Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT), Aeronautical Advisory and Notices to Airmen Tool (AANT), and Air Refueling Tool (ART) CC.   \n\ne. Joint Precision Airdrop System \u2013Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) - continues development of software and hardware required to provide a precision airdrop capability for AF and other services (e.g the Army, etc).  \n\nf. Test, Training and Certification - continues all MPS-related integration, test, and certification activities for all CAF and MAF platforms.\n\ng. Operational and Technical Support - continues all program office management operations and support activities to ensure the timely delivery of mission planning systems to the warfighter.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed or rotary wing aircraft sortie. The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and\/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirement and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type. Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic\/in-flight replanning as applicable .  This project continues the development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System-Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) in conjunction with the Army.  The JPADS System of Systems (SoS) capability provides a planning and execution capability for DoD airdrop requirements. It is the primary airdrop mission planning and execution system for all ballistic airdrop mission as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and\/or standoff precision delivery.  JPADS enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) & insurgent attack on ground convoys. JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, etc. to accurately deliver payloads to keep the warfighter supplied and in the fight.  \n\nSome key requirements on the horizon for the Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT) include refactoring WindPADS (Weather component of CAT), Combination Airdrop, Local Analysis and Prediction System (LAPS) replacement, Ensemble Weather prediction, and Obstruction Data.  CAT will also be integrating multiple S&T efforts developed and prototyped by Natick Soldier Center including Airdrop Damage Estimate and updates to Precision Aerial Guidance Units.  The JPADS-MP will also transition various AFRL Flagship Capability Concept (FCC) efforts to include improvements to Airdrop Performance Modeling, Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and updates to Human Effectiveness of the software.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. Development and modernization efforts are as follows: \n\na. MAF MPE Modernization - modifies the common MAF Mission Planning Environment (MPE) developed and deployed during previous mission planning increments. The modernization activities will provide new and improved mission planning capabilities for the MAF fleet  as required to meet evolving Operational Flight Program (OFP), fuel efficiency and Global Planning netcentric requirements such as avionics upgrades, communication systems, interfaces with command and control systems, new chutes, etc. for various MAF platforms. The MPE updates under the MAF Modernization effort in Fiscal Years 2011 through 2017 include but are not limited to those for C-5, C-17, C-27, C-130s (multiple varients), E-3, E-8, E-4, HH-60, KC-10, KC-46, KC-135 and RC-135. MAF modernization will address required improvements to MAF related MPE Common Components (CCs), including the Communications, Navigation Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) CC, Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT), Aeronautical Advisory, and Notices to Airmen (NOTAMS) Tool (AANT), and Air Refueling Tool (ART) CC.  This effort also provides the capability to use the new Digital Aeronautical Information File (DAFIF) web services-based data structure (GNS-A) being produced by NGA in this timeframe.\n\nb. Joint Precision Airdrop System \u2013 Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) - continues development of software and hardware required to provide a precision airdrop capability for AF and other services (e.g the Army, etc). \n\nc. Test, Training and Certification - continues all MPS-related integration, test, and certification activities for all CAF and MAF platforms.\n\nd. Operational and Technical Support - continues all program office management operations and support activities to ensure the timely delivery of mission planning systems to the warfighter.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapons, cargo, passenger, and\/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirement and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft, review, print and brief the plan; and download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics.  This project focuses on modernizing MPS to support CAF and Mobility Air Forces (MAF), including the development, test and sustainment of Mission Planning Environments (MPEs) to support the A-10, B-1B, C-5, C-17, C- 27, C-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, F-16, F-22A, KC-10, KC-46, KC-135, RC-135, and other platforms.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. MPS Modernization efforts are as follows:\n\na. MPS Increment IV Development: This effort continues update\/development activities for platforms that previously transitioned to MPS (e.g. F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1B, and F-22A Increment 3.2A) to provide capabilities IAW the Increment IV Capability Development Document (CDD).  In addition, it also upgrades several Common Components (CCs) that are utilized on a variety of CAF platforms.  Starting in FY13, all MPS Increment IV Development efforts will reside in Project 673858, Mission Planning Systems (MPS) Development.\n\nb. CAF MPE Modernization: These efforts modernize CAF MPEs that were developed and delivered under MPS Increments II \u2013 IV.  The modernization effort will provide new and improved mission planning capability for individual Operational Flight Program (OFP) requirements, such as new weapons, avionics upgrades, communications systems, etc.  The OFPs requiring MPE updates under the CAF Modernization effort in Fiscal Years 2011 through 2017 include but are not limited to those for A-10 (Suites 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), B-1B (Sustainment Blocks 15, 16, 16a, 17 and 18), F-15 (Suites 7, 8, 9, and 10), F-16 Block 30 (System Capability Upgrade [SCU] 8, 9 and 10), F-16 Block 40\/50 (M6.1, M6.5, M7.1, and M8.0) and F-22 (Increments 3.2B, 3.2C, and 4.0).  CAF modernization also includes updates to mission planning capabilities supporting associated weapons, including Small Diameter Bomb (SDB-II), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM).  Finally, CAF modernization will address required improvements to CAF related MPE CCs, including Precision-Guided Munitions Planning System (PGMPS), Electronic Warfare CC (EWCC), etc.  \n\nc. MAF MPE Modernization: This effort modifies the common MAF MPE developed and deployed during previous mission planning increments. The modernization activities will provide new and improved mission planning capabilities for the MAF fleet as required to meet evolving OFP, fuel efficiency and Global Planning netcentric requirements such as avionics upgrades, communication systems, interfaces with command and control systems, new chutes, etc. for various MAF platforms. The MPE updates under the MAF Modernization effort in Fiscal Years 2011 through 2017 include but are not limited to those for C-5, C-17, C-27, C-130s (multiple varients), E-3, E-8, E-4, HH-60, KC-10, KC-46, KC-135, and RC-135. MAF modernization will address required improvements to MAF related MPE CCs, including the Communications, Navigation Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) CC, Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT), Aeronautical Advisory and Notices to Airmen Tool (AANT), and Air Refueling Tool (ART) CC.  This effort also provides the capability to use the new Digital Aeronautical Information File (DAFIF) web services-based data structure (GNS-A) being produced by NGA in this timeframe.  \n\nTo meet the unique needs of Air Mobility Command (AMC), the Mobility Air Force Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS) component of MPS will provide a centralized\/net-centric Global Mobility mission flight planning capability. This service will provide significant fuel savings through automated flight route optimization utilizing aircraft performance, air traffic management, weather, and other data.\u201d \n\nd. Test, Training and Certification: Continues all MPS-related integration, test, and certification activities for all CAF and MAF platforms.\n\ne. Operational and Technical Support: Continues all program office management operations and support activities to ensure the timely delivery of mission planning systems to the warfighter.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
