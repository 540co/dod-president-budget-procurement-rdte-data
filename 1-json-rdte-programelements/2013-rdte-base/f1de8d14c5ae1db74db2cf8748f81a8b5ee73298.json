The program addresses the funding gaps that exist between the time a mature technology is demonstrated and the time it can be funded and procured for use in an intended weapons system or operational capability for the warfighter. Since the TTI (P949) program inception in FY 2003, 78 projects have been initiated and 50 have completed. Of the 50 completed projects, 35 (70%) successfully transitioned to DoD Acquisition Programs of Record or procurement contracts for operational use and subsequent fielding."

Both cartridges use point detonating fuzes with mechanical safe and arm (S&A) devices which do not reliably detonate on soft impact targets or high graze angles.  The objective of this effort is to improve the reliability of these cartridges through a Micro-Electro-Mechanical (MEMS) fuzing system that incorporates electronic initiation, improved target sensing using paired MEMS impact sensors, self-destruct capability, command arm enable, more accurate arming distance, and automated explosive ink loading.  In addition to improved reliability, these design enhancements will reduce volume and cost.\n\nOutputs and efficiencies: Incorporate impact sensors that will sense initial impact and electronically send a signal to initiate the explosive train for improved lethality and improved reliability on soft targets (from 50 percent current performance to 90 percent), and also significantly reduce the number of duds on the battlefield and training ranges.  The 40mm MEMS Fuze also will require less volume providing room for improvements in lethality or other future alternate applications.  TTI accelerates transition of this technology from the Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) to Project-Manager Soldier Weapons (PM-SW) in approximately three years."

The technology to be transitioned consists of thin colorimetric indicator films coated with pondus hydrogenii (pH) sensitive dyes and reagents that target common functional groups and chemical properties of the major classes of blood agents and select Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs).  The approach is to place the ESLI along the inside wall of the filter in contact with the carbon bed so it can react with the passing agent wave front to produce a color change, thereby alerting the user to replace the filter well before its gas-life capacity is depleted. \n\nProgram Outputs and Efficiencies:  The Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM) CBRN filter housing will be equipped with a transparent plastic window to view the indicator response.  The ESLI will be designed to provide a visual signal when approximately 20 to 60 percent of the filter's service life capacity is expired, depending on the target agent.  The ESLI technology will be transitioned to the M50 JSGPM acquisition program as a spiral upgrade (product improvement) to the current primary CBRN filter.  TTI funding accelerates this transition by two years."

IIMS includes detector\/ warning networks, access to CBRN models, and information exchange with civil sector and coalition partner organizations.  IIMS is in the base defense component of the AF Theater Battle Management Core System \u2013 Unit Level\/Unit Command and Control (TBMCS-UL\/UC2).  It addresses both conventional and CBRN incidents.  It is replacing the Survival Recovery Center (SRC).  It improves decision making and battle management activities in the event of a conventional or CBRN incident.\n\nThe objective of this effort is to transition IIMS into TBMCS-UL\/UC2 Increment Two, and subsequently into the final TBMCS-UC2.  The additional IIMS capabilities will augment the fielded TBMC-UL\/UC2 to extend original capabilities, provide a stand-alone capability, and to incorporate joint CBRN tools.  A successful transition of IIMS to TBMCS-UC2 through this spiral development process will significantly increase the base defense\/response capabilities available to the warfighter.  \n\nProgram outputs and efficiencies:  TTI funding accelerates the SRC replacement with planned upgrades to IIMS that more efficiently identify and respond to issues preventing the flying mission by 1-2 years.  The transition of IIMS into the TBMCS-UC2 N-tier Service Oriented Architecture enables transition of new capabilities into TBMCS-UC2 through the IIMS framework and the adjudication of any Priority I or Priority II software trouble reports at the time of transition.  The software will adhere to general quality and reliability standards and include standard software product sets upon delivery (i.e. source code, executable code, documentation, test results).

The interlocking MIC design eliminates the potential alignment of the open ends of the propelling charges and will greatly reduce the chances of more propellant being on one side of the mortar fin boom.  This eliminates the imbalance of the energetics and associated potential problematic pressure differential within the mortar tube.  The warfighter will have no chance of a sheared fin failure due to unexpected alignment of propelling charges which, in turn, will reduce the possibility of a critically short flight 120mm rounds in theater. Accelerating the maturation, transition, and insertion of this interlocking \"high hat\" mortar increment container technology into the 120mm mortar ammo program of record (PoR) will improve safety and accuracy for our light and dismounted ground forces. It also will lay the foundation for potential subsequent application to 60mm and 81mm mortar ammo if warranted .  \n\nProgram Outputs and Efficiencies: Provides the warfighter with safer mortar ammunition; further prevents the possibility of unexpected short flight of 120mm mortar rounds in theater; improves soldier safety during training.
