The broad CWMD military strategic objectives and mission areas encompass many nontraditional capabilities for the Warfighter, and CWMD is not an isolated mission set unique to DoD \u2013 it is intertwined with counter-terrorism and homeland defense.

This program addresses developing an integrated and interconnected CWMD capabilities-based system that defines and enables a comprehensive, global awareness and readiness for CWMD steady-state and surge postures. A global CWMD situational awareness capability will be established and deployed worldwide via current communications systems and common operating pictures in support of this mission.  This program will incorporate portfolio management tools and comprehensive analyses to enable a balanced and integrated CWMD systems portfolio, an optimized CWMD force structure, and the integration with and utilization of existing military assets to fill intelligence, sensor and reconnaissance gaps in CWMD.\n\nThis program also responds to the strategic needs outlined in the President's initiative, stated in his April 2009 speech in Prague; the US Combatant Commands integrated priorities and requirements; the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review; and the FY12-16 Defense Planning and Programming Guidance by providing improved timeliness and relevance through modernizing CWMD support to the Combatant Commands, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Intelligence Community (IC), and other U.S. Government agencies as required. This program is designed to leverage existing DoD resources and proven approaches to achieve its goals and rapidly deliver a capability to the Warfighter.

Analysis will include demonstrated commercial and government available and applicable towards the system requirements for GCAS.\n\u2022 Conduct limited evaluation and downselection of integration and information processing tools based on the candidates evaluated in FY12.  Complete technology readiness evaluations as required.\n\u2022 Continue and expand the methodology for determining what Situational Awareness information should be generated to fulfill information needs to describe steady state and event tracking\/crisis monitoring. Determine the need for additional data streams to support and their availability.\n\u2022 Transition GCAS demonstration capability to an operational prototype in FY13 with the intention for fielding an initial operating capability in FY14.\n\u2022 Develop GCAS prototype. Identify, leverage and integrate appropriate existing technologies, data and fusion methodologies to produce a GCAS capability with minimal new development efforts.  Extend the Haystack data fusion demonstration system to include broader set of data streams and incorporate complementary and orthogonal analytic tools to facilitate the generation of the CWMD situational awareness actionable data.\n\u2022 Develop and implement interfaces to acquire biosurveillance and chemical data from national, international programs and sources.\n\u2022 Develop and implement interfaces to acquire nuclear threat data from nuclear security, nuclear treaty verification, nuclear monitoring, and radiation detection sources and programs.\n\u2022 Initiate exercise program to demonstrate integration and overlaying of CWMD, counterterrorism, maritime and air domain awareness, and counternarcotics for improved situational awareness. This will include the ingestion and fusion of military maritime and worldwide shipping data.\n\u2022 Work closely with and implement the information sharing mechanisms as required including policy, certifications, tags and controls.\n\nCWMD PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT\n\n\u2022 Begin development of a CWMD systems architecture to enable comprehensive and systematic evaluation of needed capabilities as well as their relationship to each other.\n\u2022 Refine qualitative metrics and assessment criteria and begin development of quantitative metrics for evaluation, where applicable.\n\u2022 Begin development of simulation and modeling capability to evaluate and compare proposed investment options.\n\nMAJOR DEFENSE ACQUISITION PROGRAM ENHANCEMENTS\n\n\u2022 Identify those existing and planned major defense programs that can contribute to the CWMD mission by improving status, tracking, interdiction and recovery as necessary.  Begin efforts to integrate supporting data streams from major defense systems (air, land, and sea) to support the persistent surveillance of WMD threats.\n\nFY14 and beyond:\n\n\u2022 Achieve Initial Operating Capability (IOC)\n\u2022 Begin next spiral of situational awareness capability - Add new data sources, life patterns, and rule-sets\/algorithms.  Generate new methodology and supporting situational awareness feeds from new data and algorithms.\n\u2022 Continue to build\/upgrade\/modify the required infrastructure for the GCAS operations home base to include hardware and software for computational and processing capabilities, training, and organizational support to support IOC and attain full operational capability (FOC).\n\u2022 Integrate GCAS components into a service-oriented, web-based collaborative environment; register and publish all service and data capabilities; enable authorized users to subscribe to information of interest; allow accredited data sources to be added.  Where appropriate, allow integrated GCAS services and its associated updated CONOPS available to all Combatant Commands (COCOMs) and military users.\n\u2022 Scale GCAS hardware to support additional users; integrate and test analytical engine updates; perform analyst evaluation of updates.\n\u2022 Achieve network and system certifications and accreditations and identify initial capability for classified and unclassified security domains; identify additional Command and Control (C2) integration updates required; provide integrated technical user support and operational reach-back support.\n\u2022 Achieve full certification and accreditations on all security domains; provide operational GCAS capabilities on classified and unclassified networks; conduct Technology Refresh; Knowledge Refresh; provide additional of Data Sources; integrate with additional C2 systems.\n\u2022 Continue technology and data stream gap analysis and supporting research and development to fulfill the requirements for achieving CWMD situational awareness."
