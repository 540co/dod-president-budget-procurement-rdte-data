This PE fosters innovation in Army niche areas (such as lightweight armor, energetic materials, night vision capability) and areas where there is no commercial investment due to limited markets (e.g., vaccines for tropical diseases).  It also focuses university single investigator research on areas of high interest to the Army (e.g., high-density compact power and novel sensor phenomenologies). The in-house portion of the program capitalizes on the Army's scientific talent and specialized facilities to transition knowledge and technology into appropriate developmental activities.  The extramural program leverages the research efforts of other government agencies, academia, and industry.   \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by: the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD; the RDECOM, Aberdeen, MD; the Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC), Ft. Detrick, MD; the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, MS; and the US Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI), Arlington, VA."

This project focuses on the fundamental underpinnings of aided and unaided target detection and identification techniques for land warfare scenarios including tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) of non-traditional targets. This research enables Army systems that can act independently of the human operator to detect and track targets including clandestine tracking of non-cooperative targets. Such capabilities are needed for smart munitions, unattended ground sensors, and as replacements for existing systems, such as land mines. Critical technology issues include low depression angle, relatively short range, and highly competing clutter backgrounds. The resulting research will provide fundamental capability to predict, explain, and characterize target and background signature content, and reduce the workload on the analyst. This research is aimed at determining the complexity and variability of target and clutter signatures and ultimately utilizing that knowledge to conceptualize and design advanced ATR paradigms to enhance robustness and effectiveness of land warfare systems. ATR research strategies include emerging sensor modalities such as spectral and multi-sensor imaging. Research in this project builds knowledge for several technology efforts including multi-domain smart sensors, third generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), and advanced multi-function laser radar (LADAR). \n\nWork in this project complements and is fully coordinated with the Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (RDEC) (ARDEC); the Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC); and the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC).\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n  \nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD."

This research aims to generate new technologies for unprecedented battlefield situational awareness and to continue the dominance of Army units during night operations.  To achieve these objectives, IR focal plane arrays (FPAs) and lasers with significantly improved performance, lower cost, and increased operating temperatures are required.  This research has direct application to Army ground vehicles, aviation platforms, weapon systems, and the individual Soldier.  Research is focused on material growth, detector and laser design, and processing for large area multicolor IR FPAs and Midwave IR lasers.  The principal efforts are directed towards novel materials for detectors and lasers, and investigating energy band-gap structures in semi-conductor materials to enhance the performance of lasers and IR FPAs.  In the area of RF Photonics, near-IR modeling and nanofabrication techniques are applied to the design and fabrication of IR photonic-crystal waveguide structures having customized IR properties.  This research also is intended to lay the foundation for the development of integrated optoelectronic circuits using active and passive devices and components such as lasers, waveguides, and detectors in conjunction with fiber optic interconnects for the generation, distribution, processing, and control of microwaves and study the fundamental physics of signal processing and noise generation as well as the conversion between the time and frequency domains and the optical and electrical domains in these opto-electronic (OE) circuits\/systems.   The technical goals are to manage and control defects in the raw, unprocessed materials, maintaining quality control in the fabrication of the devices and arrays, limiting introduction of impurities in the material, surface passivation of the devices so that they are resistant to degradation over time and thermal management, particularly as it applies to interband cascade lasers. This work is coordinated with the Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC). \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n  \nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD."

The future Army will operate in very complex environments (e.g., urban, mountainous, forested and jungle terrain) requiring new approaches to understanding, characterizing, and depicting environmental phenomena and their effects on military systems, personnel and operations.  The lack of a complete understanding of the meteorological aspects of the complex microscale boundary layer in which the Army operates continues to impact our abilities to provide predictable, actionable, accurate and timely tactical environmental intelligence to battlefield commanders.  This project focuses on producing the foundational environmental science research to characterize the atmospheric boundary layer and deliver novel capabilities and techniques including urban turbulence characterization for its effects on micro platforms and sensor payloads, high resolution urban wind flow modeling for more efficient and accurate prediction of the transport and dispersion of obscurants and chemicals, battlefield aerosol characterization for soldier health, characterization and detection of bio-warfare agent aerosols, environmental effects on acoustic and electromagnetic signal propagation in urban and other complex domains for improved target location and imaging, exploration of previously unexploited regions of the acoustic and electro-optic spectrum, and formulation of objective analysis tools that can assimilate on-scene all-source weather observations and fuse this information with forecasts to provide immediate Nowcast products.  These capabilities will have a direct impact on ensuring Soldier survivability, weapon system lethality, effective surveillance and reconnaissance, and the mobility required for future warfighter mission planning and execution operations.\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n \nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD & White Sands Missile Range, NM."

Technical barriers include lack of methods for describing, measuring, and managing the interplay of these relatively novel phenomena in the consequent task due to situational complexity and ambiguity that characterize operations in the future force. Technical solutions are being pursued in the areas of data generation and algorithm development in these emerging environments in order to update and improve our understanding of performance boundaries and requirements and enable neuroengineering.  These solutions include multi-disciplinary partnerships, metrics, simulation capabilities, and modeling tools for characterizing Soldier-system performance, and provide a shared conceptual and operational framework for militarily relevant research on cognitive and perceptual processes. In the area of translational neuroscience, which is the transition of basic neuroscience research to relevant applications, research is carried out to examine leading edge methodologies and technologies to improve the measurement and classification of neural states and behavior in operationally-relevant environments, to examine the potential application of neuroscience theories to autonomous systems to improve Soldier-system interactions, to model the relationship between brain structure and cognitive performance for understanding  individual differences and injury, and to assess how neural pathways implicated in functional processing can be enhanced through dynamic system interface technologies for improving in-theatre performance and training. \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n \nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD."

Research covers areas such as assessment of practical intelligence as an aptitude that can be measured across job domains; develop principles and potential methods for training and sustaining complex tasks arising from digital, semi-automated, and robotic systems requirements;  determine potential methods for faster learning, improved skill retention, and adaptable transfer of training to new tasks;  discern likely methods for developing leader adaptability and flexibility as well as for speeding the maturation process; discover and evaluate the basic cognitive principles that underlie effective leader-team performance; better understand the role of emotions in regulating behavior; and improve the match between Soldier skills and their jobs to optimize performance.  Research is focused on fundamental issues that will improve the Army's capability to: (1) select, classify, train, and\/or develop Soldiers and leaders who are adaptable in novel missions and operational environments, can function effectively in digital, information rich, and semi-autonomous environments, can effectively collaborate in quickly formed groups and when distributed in high stress environments, and possess interpersonal and intercultural skills and attributes relevant to Joint-Service and multi-national operations; (2) accelerate the training of leadership, interpersonal, and emotional skills that traditionally develop over long periods of time and through direct experience; and (3) focus on the human cognitive and social domains - understanding individual, unit, and organizational behavior within the context of complex networked environments that will be essential for synergy between technology and human performance. \n\nWork in this project is complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602785A (Project 790) and PE 0603007A (Project 792).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI), Arlington, VA."

Problems addressed include the need for greater fuel efficiency and reduced weight in these propulsion systems.  Technical barriers to advanced propulsion systems are the inadequacy of today's materials to safely withstand higher temperature demands, the lack of capability to accurately simulate the flow physics and the mechanical behavior of these systems, including the engine and drive train.  The Army is the lead Service in these technology areas and performs basic research in propulsion, as applicable to rotorcraft as well as tracked and wheeled vehicles.  Technical solutions are being pursued through analysis, code generation, and evaluations to improve engine and drive train components and investigate advanced materials.  Component level investigations include compressors, combustors, turbines, energy sources and conversion, injectors, pistons, cylinder liners, piston rings, gears, seals, bearings, shafts, and controls.\n\nWork in this project complements and is fully coordinated with PE 62211 (Aviation Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n \nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) at Aberdeen Proving Grounds and the NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH."

The current methodology of using materials to gain added functionality for Army systems is to use a layered approach, whereby each layer provides added capability (i.e. ballistic, chemical\/biological, signature, etc.) but ultimately makes the system too heavy and too expensive.  Technical solutions are being pursued through understanding the fundamental aspects of chemistry and microstructure that influence the performance and failure mechanisms of ceramics, advanced polymer composites, and advanced metals, with the goal of creating hierarchically organized materials systems that possess multifunctional attributes at greatly reduced weight and cost.  These advanced materials will enable revolutionary lethality and survivability technologies for the future. \n\nWork in this project complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602105A, Project H84 (Materials). \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n \nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

Technical barriers include the fundamental speed and bandwidth limitations of current materials and devices, the efficiency of current algorithms, current computing architectures, organic material lifetimes, the understanding of the fundamental concepts of quantum cryptography, and spatial resolution of current radio frequency (RF) sensors.  The technical approach is to exploit large scale electromagnetic (EM) models to predict and explain target and clutter scattering behavior, digital and image processing modules and algorithms, beam propagation and material modeling of nonlinear optical effects, hazardous material detection, remote sensing and intelligent system distributive interactive simulations, unique sensor development, sensor data feature and information fusion in the concept of Data-to-Decisions (D2D), and battlefield acoustic signal processing algorithms.  Research performed under this project also supports survivable sensor systems, organic thin film transistor technology and organic light emitting diode technology for affordable rugged flexible displays.  This project also funds research in the development of biologically inspired materials for use as sensors as well as for power generation and storage; and physics-based multi-scale models for electronic, optical, mechanical, and chemical materials. Payoffs include high-data-rate military communications, low cost compact flexible displays for the Soldier and for the Army, improved radar signal processing techniques that will allow existing systems to improve spatial resolution, improved ultra wideband radar technology for detection of explosives including mine detection, through the wall sensing and robotics perception, improved sensor approaches and signal processing techniques for enhanced acoustic\/seismic sensing systems in noisy environments, distributed sensor data fusion in ad hoc networks, improved cryptography techniques, improved understanding of the physics and atomic properties of materials, and capabilities in hazardous material and event sensing.  \n\nWork in this project complements and is fully coordinated with research at the Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC); the Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC), the Natick Soldier RDEC (NSRDEC) and the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC).  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n \nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD."

As the combat force structure decreases and operates in more dispersed formations, information systems must be more robust, intelligent, interoperable, and survivable if the Army is to retain both information and maneuver dominance.  This research supports the Army's Network Science initiative and in the process addresses the areas of information assurance, the related signal processing for wireless battlefield communications, document and speech machine translation, and intelligent systems for C4I.  Major barriers to achieving the goals are the inherent vulnerabilities associated with using standardized protocols and commercial technologies while addressing survivability in a unique hostile military environment that includes highly mobile nodes and infrastructure, bandwidth-constrained communications at lower echelons, resource-constrained sensor networks, diverse networks with dynamic topologies, high-level multi-path interference and fading, jamming and multi-access interference, levels of noise in speech signals and document images, new low-density languages, and information warfare threats.  The intelligent systems for C4I research will focus on providing the agent technology capabilities that will produce highly relevant tactical events for mounted or dismounted commanders, leaders and soldiers; improve the timeliness, quality and effectiveness of actions; and speed the decision-making process of small teams operating in complex natural or urban terrain.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n \nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD."

This research also enables the design and use of composite structures that can better address the cost, weight, performance, and dynamic interaction requirements of future platforms identified by the Army Modernization Strategy. Ultimately, these technologies result in safer, more affordable vehicles with a greatly reduced logistics footprint. This project is a joint Army\/NASA effort that includes structures technology research into: structural integrity analyses; failure criteria; inspection methods which address fundamental technology deficiencies in both metallic and composite Army rotorcraft structures; use of composite materials in the design and control of structures through structural tailoring techniques; rotorcraft aeroelastic modeling and simulation; helicopter vibration (rotating and fixed systems); and the design and analyses of composite structures with crashworthiness as a goal.  The problems in structural modeling are inaccurate structural analysis and validation methods to predict durability and damage tolerance of composite and metallic rotorcraft structures and inadequate structural dynamics modeling methods for both the rotating and fixed system components to address reliability issues for future aircraft.  The technical barriers include a lack of understanding of failure mechanisms, damage progression, residual strength, high-cycle fatigue, the transfer of aerodynamic loads on the rotor to the fixed system, and impact of these unknown loads on aircraft components.  Technical solutions are focused on: advanced fatigue methodologies for metallic structures, improved composites technology throughout the vehicle, long-term investigation of integrated stress-strength-inspection, advanced methods for rotor system vehicle vibratory loads prediction, improved methods to predict vehicle stability, and improved analyses to address Army Aviation requirements.  These advancements will extend service life, reduce maintenance costs, enhance durability, and reduce the logistics footprint of existing and future Army vehicles.  This is the only basic research project supporting investigations for rotorcraft and ground vehicle structures within the Department of Defense.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n \nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), located in facilities at the NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA, and at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

Work in pollution prevention invests in next generation manufacturing, maintenance, and disposal methods that will result in significantly reducing the usage of hazardous and toxic substances and their associated costs.  The goal is to decrease the overall life-cycle costs of Army systems by 15-30% through the application of advanced pollution prevention technologies.  The CW remediation efforts concentrate on the application of biotechnology in the characterization and physical clean up of agent contaminated soils and groundwater and reduced corrosive and more environmentally benign decontamination of biological warfare (BW) agents on field equipment and weapon systems, with the goal of reducing the cost of remediating a site by at least 50% versus the use of conventional methods.  CW thrusts include establishing the ecotoxicity of CW compounds, environmental fate and effect of CW compounds in soils and biodegradation of CW compounds.  Pollution prevention thrusts include: environmentally acceptable, advanced, non-toxic processes to manufacture lightweight alternative structural materials to enhance weapon system survivability; clean synthesis of more powerful and improved energetic compounds to eliminate the use of hazardous materials and minimize the generation of wastes; and surface protection alternatives to hazardous paints, cadmium, chromium, and chromate conversion metal and composite surfaces.  \n\nWork in this project complements and is fully coordinated with the Army Environmental Requirements Technology Assessment (AERTA) requirements. The program element contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the U.S. Army Armament, Research, Development and Engineering Center, Picatinny, NJ."

Basic research for this project provides an understanding of the mechanisms that make organisms infectious, and mechanisms that render the human body response effective to prevent diseases caused by infectious agents.  Understanding the biological characteristics of infectious organisms also enables the development of point-of-care and laboratory-based diagnostic tools.  Understanding of disease transmission by insects and other organisms helps in developing new interventions to prevent transmission of such diseases.  Infectious disease threats from malaria, diarrhea, and dengue (a severe debilitating disease transmitted by mosquitoes), which are common in Africa, Central, European, Southern, and\/or Pacific Commands, are the highest priorities for basic research.  Research conducted in this project focuses on the following four areas: (1) Prevention\/Treatment of Parasitic (symbiotic relationship between two organisms) Diseases; (2) Bacterial Threats; (3) Viral Threats; and (4) Diagnostics and Disease Transmission Control. Work  is managed by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC).  The Army is responsible for programming and funding all DoD naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.   \n\nWork in this project complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602787A, project 870.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD, and at their overseas laboratories."

Since the malaria parasite becomes resistant to drugs over time, it is necessary to continually search for parasite weaknesses that can be exploited with new, effective drugs and vaccines."

                            "val": "This project supports basic research in areas that will expand the autonomous capabilities, utility, and portability of small robotic systems for military applications, with a focus on enhanced intelligence, biomimetic functionality, and robust mobility, to permit these systems to serve as productive tools for dismounted Soldiers.  The ability of the Warfighter to command a suite of small unmanned systems (air, ground, and hybrid vehicles) will reduce exposure of the Soldier to harm and will improve the efficiency by which a dismounted unit achieves tactical objectives such as securing a targeted zone.  Example missions requiring enhanced autonomy, manipulation, and man-portability include rapid room clearing and interior structure mapping; detection of human presence, chemical\/biological\/nuclear\/radiological\/explosive (CBNRE), and booby-traps; surveillance; and subterranean passage detection and exploration.  Because of their relatively small size, light weight, and service in dismounted environments, small unmanned systems have unique challenges in perception, autonomous processing, mobility mechanics, propulsive power, and multi-functional packaging that transcend similar challenges associated with large unmanned systems.  The Army Research Lab will conduct research in related disciplines, including machine perception, intelligent control, biomimetic robotics, manipulator mechanics, and propulsive power and drives to foster the development of technologies for lightweight, small-volume, environmentally-harsh robotics applications.  Machine perception research includes the exploration of lightweight ultra-compact sensor phenomenology and the maturation of basic machine vision algorithms that enable small unmanned systems to more fully understand their local environment.  Intelligent control research includes the maturation of autonomous processing capabilities and the advancement of artificial intelligence techniques that lead to reliable autonomous behavior in a large-displacement, highly-dynamic environment and permit unmonitored task performance.  Research in biomimetic robotics and manipulator mechanics includes the advancement of mechatronic and biomimetic appendages to enable agile high-speed locomotion, dexterous task-performance, and environmental-manipulation; and the maturing of nonlinear control algorithms to support robust, stable mobility. Propulsion power and drives research includes investigations of engine cycles and alternative hybrid energy conversion techniques to provide compact, lightweight, quiet, low-emission, high-density power sources that support highly-portable unmanned systems capable of performing long-endurance missions.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."

This project funds basic research in the characterization of chemical and biochemical phenomena occurring at or near solid surfaces and interfaces; the interactions between chemical reactions and transport processes on surfaces; theory and modeling of processes at complex surfaces; and the synthesis and characterization of catalysts that function at the nanoscale. Investment in basic research centered on the surface science disciplines will enable growth of a knowledge base that will result in improved understanding of the interactions of complex materials in real world environments.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n  \nWork in this project is performed by the Edgewood Chemical and Biological Center (ECBC), Research, Development and Engineering Command, in Aberdeen, Maryland."
