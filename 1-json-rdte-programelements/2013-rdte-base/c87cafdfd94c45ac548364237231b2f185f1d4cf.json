It will provide identification and mitigation of EMI in Navy, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Allied, Ashore and Joint Combat Operations.\n\n(b) It will support the Shipboard Electromagnetic Compatibility Improvement Program (SEMCIP), an element of the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Systems Engineering Program to identify, engineer, and evaluate effectiveness of potential EMI corrections.\n\n(c) Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Survivability Program assesses the EMP survivability of all mission critical systems and funds development of a hardness assurance and maintenance program. Develops improved modeling capability to reduce hardness validation costs at delivery and over the lifetime of the system\/platform. Provides design criteria, test methodology, test limits, and survivability validation procedures for all Navy systems, ships, submarines and shore facilities.\n\n(d) Advanced Technology: Investigates below deck electromagnetic environmental effects and develops the capability to perform remote spectrum monitoring and electromagnetic noise monitoring. Also, develops the tools and technologies for innovative and efficient spectrum use, and continues the development of relationships between measured EMI and system performance for selected communications systems.\n\n(e) FY11 OCO Planned Program funds will be used for Combat Enabler in Theater OIF \/ OEF-A and Pre-Deployment OIF \/ OEF-A.\n\n(f) FY13 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Request: Combat Enabler in Theatre Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan (OEF-A) - Joint Emitters during the continuing OCO operations was a source of debilitating electromagnetic interference to critical United States Navy (USN) Air Operations (OPS) and Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) assets."

In response to FY11 OIF and OEF-A requirements, funding will be used to expand afloat and ashore spectrum management tools to address the critical need for interoperability with the USMC's spectrum management applications and put into place a joint capability for the warfighter.  USN\/USMC integration promotes interoperability with the multi-national deployed forces fighting the OCO and decreases the risk of friendly fire incidents.  Accurate and timely information on the interoperability of USN and USMC systems provided by this joint capability leverages the response of both the USN and USMC to OCO. Increased situational awareness, reduction of interference, and restored mission capability are all expected benefits of the improved processes and procedures.  The requested funds will deliver a joint capability system that allows group planning and execution, information data discovery, data interoperability, and data fusion to USN and USMC forces directly supporting OIF and the OCO.

This funding will be used to evaluate and mitigate potential EMI problems that may be introduced as the fleet continues to field additional variants of combat systems and commission new ships.  Timely development of EMI solutions restores combat capability lost due to EMI.  In theater requirements demand an acceleration of the development of EMI solutions & prototype hardware (in theater) in order to prompt EMI mitigation.  Evaluation of short-term and long-term EMI fix evaluation on deploying ships is required to determine optimum EMI solution. Funds requested support the procurement and installation of EMI Solutions within 12 months for strike groups and independent deployers.  Higher operating tempo and incremental costs associated with increased pace of Fleet Deployments drive an accelerated response to the development of EMI Fixes which then supports higher usage of equipment (rate of return) and extends communication capabilities."
