            "val": "This Program Element funds research and development of strategy, assessment, and information operations (IO) capabilities required in support of Air Operation Center (AOC) command and control processes and supported combatant commanders.  Programs currently supported include the Information Warfare Planning Capability (IWPC) - the JFACC's system of record for strategy, operational assessment and network mapping\/network nodal analysis.  IWPC is a full-spectrum, offensive and defensive, planning capability.  IWPC is an AOC weapon system component which enables operators to develop courses of action for the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC), create Air Operations Directives (AODs) and Joint Air Operations Plans (JAOPs), and nominate IO \"targets\" for inclusion into the Master Air Attack Plan and the Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List (JIPTL).  This project funds the development and upgrade, testing and evaluation, and installation and training of an evolving suite of interoperable planning and decision support capabilities comprised of software, hardware, and communications products.  This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.  The project builds functional software modules that are designed to be interoperable with C2 systems such as the Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS), Joint Targeting Toolbox, and other AOC tools.  This PE funds development and continued research to identify existing military and commercial efforts which can satisfy unfulfilled operational requirements for IO analysis, targeting, planning, and integration.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nFY13 funding also supports the National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) program.  The NTNF program provides the US Government's framework to identify the source of a nuclear detonation in US or allied territory. AF contributions to this effort, include, but are not limited to collection of airborne particulate material following an incident. Currently, collection would be accomplished via a WC-135 Constant Phoenix aircraft, which is a limited availability asset (only 1 primary a\/c in the fleet).  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is developing a pod (Harvester pod) capable of being mounted on an aircraft (TBD) that will provide additional capacity to conduct this mission.  Funding will provide integration and testing of that pod.  \n \nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Programs currently supported include the Information Warfare Planning Capability (IWPC) - the JFACC's system of record for strategy, operational assessment and network mapping\/network nodal analysis.  IWPC is a full-spectrum, offensive and defensive, planning capability.  IWPC is an AOC weapon system component which enables operators to develop courses of action for the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC), create Air Operations Directives (AODs) and Joint Air Operations Plans (JAOPs), and nominate IO \"targets\" for inclusion into the Master Air Attack Plan and the Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List (JIPTL).  This project funds the development and upgrade, testing and evaluation, and installation and training of an evolving suite of interoperable planning and decision support capabilities comprised of software, hardware, and communications products.  This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.  The project builds functional software modules that are designed to be interoperable with C2 systems such as the Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS), Joint Targeting Toolbox, and other AOC tools.  This PE funds development and continued research to identify existing military and commercial efforts which can satisfy unfulfilled operational requirements for IO analysis, targeting, planning, and integration.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nFY13 funding also supports the National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) program.  The NTNF program provides the US Government's framework to identify the source of a nuclear detonation in US or allied territory. AF contributions to this effort, include, but are not limited to collection of airborne particulate material following an incident. Currently, collection would be accomplished via a WC-135 Constant Phoenix aircraft, which is a limited availability asset (only 1 primary a\/c in the fleet).  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is developing a pod (Harvester pod) capable of being mounted on an aircraft (TBD) that will provide additional capacity to conduct this mission.  Funding will provide integration and testing of that pod.  \n \nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
