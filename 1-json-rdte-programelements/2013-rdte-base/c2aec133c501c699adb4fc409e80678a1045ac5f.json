Other mission areas include casualty evacuation (CASEVAC), medical evacuation (MEDEVAC), non-combatant evacuation operations, civil search and rescue, international aid, disaster humanitarian relief, and insertion\/extraction of combat forces.\n\n671325 - The Mode 5 modification program is an upgrade to the HH-60G's Identification, Friend or Foe (IFF) system--the primary means of aircraft identification during Air Defense operations.    In order to fully implement Mode 5, the HH-60G aircraft is also updating its Global Positioning System.\n\n676016 - The Air Force Rotary Wing Avionics Development and Integration effort will develop a fully integrated avionics upgrade that includes predictive terrain awareness. This program focuses on developing and integrating technologies that will increase the situational awareness of helicopter crews in a degraded visibility environment. This effort was initiated by the Defense Safety Oversight Council.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
