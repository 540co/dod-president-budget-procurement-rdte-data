Training devices and training simulations contribute to the modernization of the forces by enabling and strengthening combat effectiveness through realistic training solutions for the Warfighter.  Training devices maximize the transfer of knowledge, skills, and experience from the training situation to a combat situation.  Force-on-force training at the National Training Center (NTC), Ft. Irwin, CA; Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC), Ft. Polk, LA, and Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC), formerly the Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC), Hohenfels, Germany; and battle staff training in Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) provide increased combat readiness through realistic collective training in low, mid, and high intensity scenarios.  Project 241, Non-System Training Devices-Combined Arms, develops simulation training devices for Army-wide use, including the CTCs.  Project 573 funds key organizational support to Army\/DoD Transformation via innovative simulation and training device efforts.  Program Executive Office (PEO) Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (STRI's) unique geographic co-location with other services facilitates joint training solutions in a common environment.  \n \nFY 2013 Project 241 funds significant development efforts on the Combat Training Center Instrumentation Systems (CTC-IS), Homestation Instrumentation Training System (HITS), Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA), Integration and Interoperability (I2), Engagement Skills Trainer 2000 (EST 2000), Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC), Target Modernization, One Tactical Engagement Simulation System (OneTESS), formerly Live Tactical Engagement Simulation System (L-TESS), and further implementation of Live Training Transformation (LT2) through development of the Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA).\n\nFY 2013 Project 573 will provide for minimum PEO STRI core operations supporting development of training devices and simulations by PEO STRI Project Managers (PM TRADE, PM ITTS, PM CATT, and PM Constructive Simulation)."

CTC-IS develops new data communications systems increasing tracking accuracy and coverage at the CTCs to provide greater training fidelity to training units.  \n\nThe Homestation Instrumentation Training System (HITS) provides a high-fidelity deployable instrumented training capability to support platoon thru battalion level Live Force-on-Force Training.  HITS tracks locations of soldiers, vehicles, and simulates weapons effects and engagements, allowing units to Train as they Fight against live opponents.  HITS provides accurate feedback to training units.  HITS consists of light deployable components that can be rapidly assembled\/disassembled and transported to support deployed training.  HITS integrates with future and legacy I-MILES.  HITS is a member of the LT2 family of training systems and shares several hardware and software components with the CTC-IS.  HITS is required for the Live function of Live-Virtual-Constructive Integrated Training Environment.\n\nThe Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC) program provides a standardized combat medical training capability to sustain and validate Combat Medic's skills and to support Combat Lifesaver training for Active, Reserve and National Guard components, while being capable of training Joint, Interdepartmental, and Coalition partner organizations to better prepare personnel for medical interventions under combat conditions. Each MSTC system is made of sub-systems, to include the Virtual Patient System (VPS) and the Medical Training Evaluation System (MTES). The VPS contains multiple training devices, delivering increasing degrees of fidelity and trauma patient responses. MTES provides networked training and training management, with instruction and performance tracking\/reporting capability. The MSTC system combines training devices, standardized programs of instruction, skilled instructors, adaptive scenarios, and tactical lane training into a cohesive, standardized, training platform for combat medicine.\n\nThe Engagement Skills Trainer (EST 2000) is an indoor, small arms, marksmanship training simulator for individuals and groups with a standard mix of light, heavy and crew-served weapons used in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and support of Decisive Operations (DO). The EST 2000 provides training for individual marksmanship, small unit collective gunnery skills and tactical training. It incorporates judgmental use of force, including escalation of force and graduated response scenarios.  As the only validated and accredited virtual small arms training system, the EST 2000 is a critical element of the U.S. Army's gated marksmanship training strategy.\n\nThe Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA) provides a net-centric linkage that collects, retrieves and exchanges data among existing Training Aids, Devices, Simulations, and Simulators (TADSS) and both Joint and Army Mission Command Systems. The LVC-IA defines the \"how\" information is exchanged among the different LVC domains and the Mission Command Systems.  The LVC-IA provides enterprise level tools for exercise control, after action review, and system information assurance.  It also provides hardware and software to interface the different Live, Virtual and Constructive communication protocols and provides a correlated common operating picture for the training audience on their organic Mission Command equipment.  The integration of the Live, Virtual, and Constructive TADSS with the Mission Command equipment will enable larger, more robust training events better preparing U.S. Soldiers for their missions at an overall reduced cost.  The end-state goal is an LVC Integrated Training Environment that can approximate Operational Environments in a cost effective manner to provide a high level of value-added training and mission rehearsal opportunities to Army Commanders and their Soldiers. \n\nTarget Modernization provides for the development of advanced training target related technologies focused on enhancing threat realism and engagement feedback, development of a non-contact hit sensor to support counter defilade and area effects training, and development\/integration of alternate energy (Green) solutions.  Target Modernization provides for the support of changes in doctrine\/weapons and alignment to the CTIA Product-Line framework and LVC-ITE.\n\nOne Tactical Engagement Simulation System (OneTESS), formerly Live Tactical Engagement Simulation System (L-TESS) will provide a live, precision, combined arms Force-on-Force Indirect Fire training capability for Brigade and below exercises, at Homestation, Maneuver Combat Training Centers and deployed sites.  It will be interoperable with current and future Instrumentable-Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES) Line of Sight (LOS) laser based systems. OneTESS will provide realistic, real-time casualty effects for Force-on-Force tactical engagement training scenarios and the capability to integrate into training instrumentation systems to provide for high fidelity combined arms combat exercises.   \n\nIntegration and Interoperability (I2) integrates activities and products of current programs of record across the entire PEO STRI portfolio.  I2 baselines persistent interoperability in PEO fielded systems, addresses current issues to facilitate interoperability, institutionalizes a common products\/product line management approach and standards\/policies across training\/test, non-system\/system and modeling and simulation domains.\n\nFY 2013 Project 241 funds significant development efforts on the Combat Training Center Instrumentation Systems (CTC-IS), Homestation Instrumentation Training System (HITS), Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA), Integration and Interoperability (I2), Engagement Skills Trainer 2000 (EST 2000), Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC), Target Modernization, One Tactical Engagement Simulation System (OneTESS), and further implementation of Live Training Transformation (LT2) through development of the Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA)."
