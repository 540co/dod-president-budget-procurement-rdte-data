Starting in FY 2013 the funding in ASD(NII) PE 0604771D8Z and PE 0305199D8Z supporting acquisition related functions has been transferred to OUSD(AT&L).\n\nThis funding provides resources for acquisition support and management oversight of critical command, control, communications (C3) and non-intelligence space capabilities as the Department continues its transition to netcentric operations. Funds will be used to provide technical, systems engineering and acquisition management oversight of programs, projects and activities to maximize the Department\u2019s return on investment in information technology resources and effect a comprehensive approach for assessing and procuring critical information systems from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of improved weapons systems performance and military operations. Resources will be allocated for architecture design and development, portfolio management, enterprise-wide systems engineering and operational impact analyses related to C3 and non-intelligence space systems. They will also be used to provide expertise required for exercising technical direction over design, performance and cost parameters of key systems and their dependencies. The goal of this funding is to eliminate redundancy, reduce time to the field, evaluate projects and concepts for adherence to net-centric guidelines, minimize performance and operational risk of developing and fielding complex major systems which rely on networks and supporting applications, ensure program dependencies are documented and included in acquisition decisions and address interoperability requirements, gaps and required technical solutions. Typical deliverables associated with the instantiation of net-centric capabilities for these mission areas include network and vulnerability assessments, migration plans, investment strategies and technical and policy guidance directives."
