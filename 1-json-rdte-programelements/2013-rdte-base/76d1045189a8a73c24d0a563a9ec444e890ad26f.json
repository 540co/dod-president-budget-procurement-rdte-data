Project 592 matures and demonstrates networked and integrated surveillance, communications, and command and control capabilities for high altitude and tactically responsive space payloads to enable information superiority, enhanced situational awareness, and support for distributed operations.  Project DF7 supports classified activities.  Properly accessed individuals can obtain further information from the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition Logistics & Technology (ASAALT) Special Programs Office.   \n\nWork in this PE complements the work in PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability) and PE 0603008A (Electronic Warfare Advanced Technology). \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n \nWork in this PE is performed by the US Army Space and Missile Defense Technical Center in Huntsville, AL."
