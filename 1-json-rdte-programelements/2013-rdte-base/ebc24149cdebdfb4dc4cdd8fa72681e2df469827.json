            "val": "This program incorporates efforts dedicated to the enhancement of ship defense against Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) and other evolving threats. Its primary focus is on the development of technologies, systems, and procedures necessary to defeat the evolving Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threat and then it expands to allow for application of these technologies in other warfighting areas. These projects focus on ship defense improvements through the development of advanced concepts and capabilities that will enhance both defense in depth of ships in a force and self defense of individual ships in a littoral war-fighting environment.\n\nQuick Reaction Combat Capability (QRCC):  The Requirements & Analysis Working Group (RAWG) was established in 1992 to conduct analysis of AAW ship self-defense capabilities and to establish requirements for ship class specific ASCM self-defense to support Navy AAW investment decisions.  The RAWG is an independent and objective analysis team that constitutes the National expertise in force and self-defense capabilities assessment in AAW and Surface Warfare (SUW).  RAWG maintains a database of ship system and ship class performance against ASCM and SUW threats to support rapid response to tasking.   \n\nForce Advanced Warfare Concept Technology (FACT), Project 2184, demonstrates concepts and capabilities that will enhance the warfighting ability of ships and aircraft and enable the coupling of the Force into a single, distributed weapon system through more effective use of tactical data, and force sensors and weapons.\n\nIn FY11, the Innovation Team began development and prototyping of technologies to provide a Strike Group with a Geo-Referenced Common Tactical Maritime Picture (CTMP), incorporating several thousand square miles of accurate, real time surface track data from aircraft such as Broad Area Maritime Surveillance Aircraft (BAMS), P-3, P-8, MH-60R and Fire Scout Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV).  FACT will begin to develop technologies for integration of the tactical surface picture in to surface combat systems such as Aegis and Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) and technologies to disseminate the Common Tactical Maritime Picture amongst the Carrier Strike Group\/Expeditionary Strike Group (CSG\/ESG). The Innovation Team will also analyze and assess the feasibility of wide area Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) sensor netting."

FACT improvements are designed to enhance the warfighting ability of ships and aircraft and to enable coupling of the Force into a single, distributed weapon system and towards more effective use of tactical data and the cooperative use of all the force sensors and weapons. These capabilities will provide the ship offensive flexibility needed to meet the threat brought about by increasing numbers of highly sophisticated weapons held by potentially hostile third world countries. FACT defines requirements and develops prototype systems or modifications to existing systems to test new concepts for the coordination of Force operations. FACT is a model innovation cell which consistently delivers advanced war-fighting capability that addresses current Fleet shortfalls and needs quickly and cost effectively. Some examples of prototype systems now in production are AN\/SPS-48C Detection Data Converter, AN\/SPS-48E Environmental Control Feature, Shipboard Gridlock System\/Automatic Correlation (SGS\/AC) and Dial-a-Track Quality (Link-11 Quality Selection). Other FACT developments include the Automatic Identification System and the Multi-Frequency Link-11 capability; Dual Net Multi-Frequency Link-11 Force Threat Evaluation Weapons Assignment; the prototype Area Air Defense Commander and the Joint Targeting Attack and Assessment Capability (JTAAC).\n\nFY11, the Innovation Team began development and prototyping of technologies to provide a Strike Group with a Geo-Referenced CTMP, incorporating several thousand square miles of accurate, real time surface track data from aircraft such as BAMS, P-3, P-8, MH-60R and Fire Scout UAV.  FACT will begin to develop technologies for integration of the tactical surface picture in to surface combat systems such as Aegis and SSDS and technologies to disseminate the CMTP amongst the CSG\/ESG. The Innovation Team will also analyze and assess the feasibility of wide area ASW sensor netting."
