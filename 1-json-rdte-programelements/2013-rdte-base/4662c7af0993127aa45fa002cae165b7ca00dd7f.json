            "val": "This program element provides systems engineering and technical analysis of the DoD Information Technology (IT) portfolio containing over 600 programs valued at over $180 billion.  The Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) advises OSD leadership on end to end warfighter communication capabilities to include portfolio management, developmental support responsibilities on numerous programs, synchronization, and interoperability efforts and issues.  Emphasis is placed on the information transport, information assurance, net and spectrum management, command and control (C2), space, and enterprise services activities focused on the development, integration, testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of acquisition programs.  The PSA develops portfolio-wide guidance and provides technical analysis to enable the warfighter, intelligence, and business communities to meet their respective mission requirements.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, and it supports system definition, development, testing, and program analysis of major acquisition programs engineering development and synchronization activities.  \n\nThis project provides the resources necessary to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytic methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space) of the net-centric architecture, to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field net centric capabilities more rapidly as an enabler for C2 capabilities and applications.  Resources are required to transform current networks into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse joint network that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, and contested communications on the move capabilities.  These funds develop the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance capabilities with other net centric capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).  \nIn addition, funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes initiating the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators, engineers, and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint \/Allied units prior to system fielding, or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the Global Information Grid (GIG) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future TDES capabilities. These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDES capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled Global Information Grid (GIG) initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies."

The PSA develops portfolio-wide guidance and provides technical analysis to enable the warfighter, intelligence, and business communities to meet their respective mission requirements.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, and it supports system definition, development, testing, and program analysis of major acquisition programs engineering development and synchronization activities.  \n\nThis project provides the resources necessary for the Deputy of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Communication, C2, Space, and Spectrum to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytical methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space) of the net-centric architecture, to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field net centric capabilities more rapidly as an enabler for C2 capabilities and applications.  Resources are required to transform current networks into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse joint network that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, and contested communications on the move capabilities.  These funds develop the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance capabilities with other net centric capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).  \n\nNote that FY 2010\/2011 funding disconnect resulted from duplicate cuts to a program titled Horizontal Fusion (HF) formerly part of this PE to support priority net centric transformation."
