            "val": "The Global Information Grid (GIG) Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE) project resolves near term (1 to 3 years) high-priority technical issues defined by Department of Defense Chief Information Officer (DOD CIO) and DISA, that impact operational capabilities affecting GIG end-to-end (E2E) interoperability and performance.  The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) supports efforts that will strengthen the delivery of critical GIG products, services, and capabilities to the warfighter through the establishment of the DISA Technology Management Framework (TMF).  This Framework provides analysis, strategies, and roadmaps, as well as technology development and insertion into DISA programs of record, while also influencing Service\/Agency program technology investments.  As the Science and Technology arm of DISA, CTO projects are critical to providing the venue for technology assessment and insertion in DISA (and DoD) that will result in more efficient and effective technology investments and ultimately improved global, net-centric operations.  \n\nThe Modeling and Simulation project provides architecture, systems engineering and end-to-end analytical functions for DISA and its customers, ensuring integrated capabilities to fulfill warfighter mission requirements.  Ongoing beneficiaries of these capabilities include DOD CIO, the DISA Network Services Directorate, Program Executive Office-Mission Assurance (PEO-MA), the DISN Command Center (DCC), Joint Communications Simulation System (JCSS) users in DoD, and other DISA programs\/projects such as Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), CENTRIXS Cross Enclave Requirement (CCER) (PEO-C2C), etc.  \n\nFY 2013 funding will provide DISN Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Capacity Planning models, to include FY 2013 technology refresh and new user requirements, DoD Internet traffic models and analyses for capacity planning and IA initiatives, Voice and Video over IP (VVoIP) modeling tools supporting the Unified Capabilities Requirements (UCR) Document and end-to-end security goals of the evolving DISN, enhanced modeling and instrumentation techniques for net-centric applications planning and tuning and  JCSS modeling tools supporting the combatant commands. \n\nAs the Science and Technology arm of DISA, CTO projects are critical to rapidly providing the venue for technology assessment and insertion in DISA (and DoD) that will result in more efficient and effective technology investments and ultimately improved global, net-centric operations.  Further, as the Department of Defense Global Information Grid (DoD GIG) Chief Technologist, the CTO provides analysis of industry standards and specifications and advises the DoD\/CIO on ensuring the framework for information sharing across DoD and the federal community is provided.  The CTO provides rapid integration of emerging commercial technologies to gain immediate user feedback, provide risk mitigation, and support enhancements of concept of operations and tactics, techniques, and procedures for initiatives addressing the Chairman's capability gap. \n\nThe Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) supports the resolution of Tactical Data Enterprise Services (TDES) through issues resolution, the developing TDES capability, and TDES verification and certification.  The overarching objective of the IEP will be to support the realization and maintenance of interoperable Net-Centric weapons, sensors, and Command and Control (C2) systems at the tactical edge.\n\nThe EWSE project will provide technical solutions to addresses unique end-to-end interoperability and performance in DoD and GIG areas of concern.  Enterprise-level technical requirements are undefined for a significant number of GIG end-to-end issues.  EWSE provides end-to-end system documentation that defines functional, performance, and interface guidelines that programs can use but is often unavailable.  Through the EWSE program, no single entity will resolve technical, policy, or programmatic issues on proposed end-to-end solutions.  Without defining enterprise requirements, networks would only interface effectively at Tier 0, effectively defeating the transformational advantages of many next generation GIG components."

Modeling and Simulation performs a broad spectrum of activities for the DoD communications planning and investment strategy, including:  application assessments, contingency planning, network capacity planning and diagnostics, and systems-level modeling and simulation.  Modeling and Simulation develops across-theater information awareness for Combatant Commands through application solutions for integrated networks, to include DoD\u2019s missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN), by:  (1) supporting the development and implementation of GIG EWSE processes essential to evolving the GIG in a manner that enables interoperability and end-to-end performance for critical GIG programs; (2) developing standardized DISA systems analyses and integration processes to improve systems integration across DISA for all DISA developed communication systems and services; and (3) providing the underlying modeling and simulation and analytical support for end-to-end DISA and DoD systems engineering and assessment.  These operations provide DoD decision makers, with services and a suite of tools capable of identifying key points of impact on DoD command and control information systems and recommending tradeoffs within the GIG configuration with regard to prioritized performance, availability, and security.  This effort will reduce the risk in products deployment to the warfighter through improved network performance and traffic analysis, and an efficient means of troubleshooting and subsequent redesign. \n\nThe Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) supports the Tactical Data Enterprise Services (TDES) implementation and issues resolution, the development of TDES capability, and TDES verification and certification.  The overarching objective of the IEP will be to support the implementation and maintenance of interoperable Net-Centric weapons, sensors, and C2 systems at the tactical edge.  The IEP will use jointly defined and developed interoperability tool set to determine the TDES interoperability capabilities of systems. Interoperability shortfalls will be identified for each system.  The gaps will be based on weapon, sensor or C2 system capabilities analyzed with respect to current policies, architectures, operational concepts, Joint Mission Threats (JTMs) and other criteria that collectively form the standard view of the TDES Architecture.  \n\nThe interoperability gaps will be documented to provide each system a common format implementation specification for TDES Interoperability.  This requirements process will be updated consistent with the maintenance\/upgrade cycle for each system.  For emerging systems, the IEP will be conducted prior to Milestone \u201cC\u201d of the platform.  DISA will support this process through:  the establishment and maintenance of the IEP databases that contain platform system interoperability capabilities; the jointly approved standard view of the TDES Architecture; and the implementation specification(s) for TDES Interoperability.  The Services will be responsible for development of the material solutions that provide system compliance with their respective implementation specification(s) for TDES Interoperability.  The Services will update the DISA IEP databases with system interoperability capabilities as validated by flag level review.  Validated data will include capability deviations and schedules for \u201cfull\u201d Joint certification.  A second component of the IEP will provide warfighters operationally relevant information to maximize net-enabled systems.  Services have agreed upon common capability characteristics to identify system performance in a joint environment.  The collection of these efforts, when synchronized across the services and available to joint warfighters through net-centric capabilities is called Joint Capabilities and Limitations."

Six technical tasks were completed in FY11: Federated SOA Architecture for GIG Services; Hosting Applications and Data in a Virtual Computing Environment, End-to-End Service and Performance & SLA Management; Common Radio Interface to IP Layer; Global Access Control; and GIG Multicast Network Architecture.  GIG Technical Profiles (GTP) were developed and delivered under these tasks. GTPs are used by the DoD Programs of Record for NR-KPP compliance. EWSE also continued to technically manage Integrated SATCOM Operations Management JCTD; develop DoD level GIG NetOps Technical Architecture; and evolve DISA Unified Communications and Collaboration Architecture. In partnership with DoD standards management office, EWSE coordinated DoD WiMAX Secure Profile RFI with the industry and adjudicated vendor comments. Four technical tasks were initiated in FY11: Secure Federated GIG Core Architecture and Routing Services; GIG VPN Services and Architecture; Service-Orientation in DIL; and DoD Enterprise User Initiative-Directory Services. All tasks directly support customers within DISA and stakeholder in the DoD community. Preliminary results from the Service-Orientation in DIL task were used for Enterprise Engineering Technical Track at the DISA Customer Conference.\n\nFunds supported development of GIG Convergence Master Plan  Vol. I which defines the DISA technical strategy and articulates the near-term target technical architecture and Vol. II which consists of the complete service offering to service capability mapping, and the complete DISA technical baseline.  Modeling and Simulation funds provided enhanced modeling and instrumentation techniques for Enterprise Email end-to-end performance assessment; enabled continued, enhanced, modeling capabilities to prepare for   the FY 2013  Technology Refresh and to meet new user requirements in each theater;  provided DoD Internet traffic models and analyses for capacity planning and IA initiatives, for DISA Director, CYBERCOM, and Network Services; enhanced modeling tools and techniques to provide inputs to network planning in support of Unified Communications and end to-end security goals of the evolving DISN, to ensure timely support of the plans\/stages in the DISN Technical Evolution Plan and GIG Convergence Master Plan; and supported modeling  for customer needs in DISA program\/project decisions and planning.\n\nDISA EE3 successfully tested, verified, validated, and fielded in DECC operational environment the GIG Technical Guidance federation (GTG-F) to allow for \"data-centric\" Interoperability and Supportability analysis of Joint Information Support Plans by the Services.  Established a program entry point through the Enhanced Information Support Plan (EISP) application to transparently tag data as it is entered or imported in to a structured template with Extensible Markup Language (XML).  In addition, the Interoperability Assessment Module (IAM) was developed within the GTG-F to perform assessment of the data tables to alert the Joint assessment community of potential interoperability gaps.  The introduction of this new \"data-centric\" analysis capability is a positive paradigm shift from document driven reviews to data architecture analysis to continuously improve system level interoperability for the Joint Warfighter.\n\nDISA EE3, as the DoD Executive Agent for IT Standards, merged  the process that determines DoD IT standards applicability and utilization with the emerging standards management processes developed within the Intelligence Community.  This change will improve interoperatbility and enterprise information sharing among the DoD and the IC."

This framework provides analysis, strategies, and roadmaps, as well as technology assessment and insertion into DISA products and services, while also influencing Service\/Agency program technology investments.  As the Science and Technology arm of DISA, CTO projects are critical to rapidly providing the venue for technology assessment and insertion in DISA (and DoD) that will result in more efficient and effective technology investments and ultimately improved global, net-centric operations.  \n\n\u2022Capability 1 supports end-to-end technology analysis, assessments, and reviews of all solutions, products, services, and capabilities to ensure all are consistent with GIG architecture and standards. These projects provide direct support to Services, COCOMS, OSD, and the Joint Staff as well as the DoD business and acquisition communities and the intelligence community (IC).  The end result is more efficient and effective technology investments and ultimately improved global, net-centric operations which are delivered through GIG products, services, and capabilities to the Services, COCOMS, OSD, and the Joint Staff as well as the DoD business and acquisition communities and the IC.  \n\n\u2022Capability 2 supports various aspects of evolving the GIG, including developing enterprise system architecture constructs for the GIG and components, providing engineering guidance for system and component evolution, including incorporating new technology from industry.  Engineering and technical support of the DISA programs implementing the GIG involves technical research and analysis of state-of-the-art and emerging technologies, architectures, and data communication and application frameworks.  This involves the identification and recommendation of innovative engineering techniques, practices and methodologies that are critical to the DISA in its role of instantiating the GIG architecture; the support of information exchanges with the Services, OSD, the COCOMS, and the Joint Staff to identify opportunities, issues, and solutions to improve the DISA products; and, facilitation and harmonization of cross-corporate programs relative to the DISA programs and the GIG.\n\nThe other mission in this exhibit is performing classified work.

DISA has successfully developed an initial technology environment, including the infrastructure and methodologies necessary for technology evaluation and analysis.  A streamlined, Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF)-compliant Multi-level Security (MLS) Enterprise Architecture (EA) was published that fuses the architecture with recognized, dependent enterprise services such as directory and domain name system while supporting vendor agnostic enterprise and local virtual domains.  The design of the Enterprise Identity Management System (EIMS) was completed, using detailed use-cases and work flows abstracted from the recently completed Joint Staff MLS thin-client pilot and leveraging evolving\/emerging IA policies\/practices and best-in-class products that are MLS certified.  The resulting architectural \u201cblue-print\u201d can serve as the building-code for architecture design and service integration\/interoperability among domain and\/or mission-level architectures with the EIMS, targeted for a 2QFY12 proof-of-concept, validating that the architecture is viable and can support GIG 2.0 goals of improved information sharing, security, and resiliency. \n\nThe remaining $4.094 supported classified work."

Performance is measured by achievement of project milestones and the acceptance\/transition of these technologies\/services\/capabilities into programs of record or as a new, separate program\/service offering to the DoD and IC communities.  Specific and measurable metrics that will be introduced and used include number and percentage of emerging and mature technologies adopted and\/or adapted by DISA and\/or the Department to address\/satisfy the documented technology and service gaps identified in capstone enterprise environment architectures, program\/project needs statements, and other key technology planning and guideline documents; and the number and percentage of technology research and development initiatives and investments in the Department, peering organizations, and\/or industry partners that are attributable to technology research, investments and evolution plans in DISA and promoted via the technology watch-list and outreach activities used to identify, promote, channel and aligning technology research and investments to reduce time to field new\/emerging technologies to satisfy warfighter requirements. \n\nIn FY 2011, Program Management Support provided managers with project management, financial management, contract management assistance, information assurance technical expertise, knowledge management, outreach, and transition engineering.  Program management resources continued to support the growth in all key mission areas of technology analysis, assessment, evaluation, and integration.  Additionally, DISA will need continued civilian pay funding to cover salaries and benefits for Government civilian personnel assigned to CTO; training, professional development and travel for CTO personnel; and supplies and services for CTO operations.  \n\nIn FY 2012 and FY 2013, there will be a continued need for core program management support to the technology analysis, assessment, evaluation, and integration activities to manage financial accounts, oversee information assurance activities, assist in contract administration, and provide technical advice and assistance through the use of subject matter experts.  Program Management support will also provide asset management, quality assurance and business line improvement, information assurance oversight, technical oversight and assistance, web support, and application hosting fees.  Technology integration support, including knowledge management expertise, outreach, transition engineering expertise, and scenario and\/or capability-based demonstrations, will continue for all the program managers in each of the mission areas."
