The systems under this program provides the Army with the capability to degrade or deny hostile forces the effective use of their communications, countermortar\/counterbattery radars, surveillance radars, infrared\/optical battlefield surveillance systems and electronically fused munitions.  Existing Army EW systems must be replaced or upgraded to maintain their capability in the face of threats.  The Army Reprogramming Analysis Team (ARAT) Project will develop, test and equip an Army-wide infrastructure capable of rapidly reprogramming electronic combat software embedded in offensive and defensive weapon systems."

Its primary mission is to provide 24-hour Situation Development and Information Superiority to the supported maneuver brigade to enable the most effective engagement of enemy forces.  A BCT is typically fielded with two PE sensors and one Prophet Control\/Prophet Analytic Cell (PC\/PAC), which comprise the organic SIGINT collection and analytical functions for the unit.  PE provides a modular, scalable, open architecture-based system solution optimized for ease of use in a variety of profiles (Stationary-Fixed, Mobile and Manpack).  It also incorporates the ability for rapid integration of Technical Insertions and Pre-Planned Product Improvements to ensure operational relevance.  PE is a non-vehicle specific system, allowing maximum flexibility to accommodate a myriad of platforms.  It is comprised of modular components that provide a simultaneous mission capability in Stationary-Fixed, Mobile and Manpack configurations.  This provides the commander maximum flexibility in employing the PE system and enhances the SIGINT capabilities available.  PE provides reach-back capability and interfaces directly with the National SIGINT Enterprise via Wideband Beyond Line of Sight (WB BLOS) Satellite Communications at PC\/PAC and the Sensor.  PE is an integral part of the Army Modernization providing Near Real Time (NRT) information to the Brigade Commander within their combat decision cycle.  This NRT information provides a key component of the fused intelligence Common Operating Environment (COE).  PE is being fielded to deploying units in accordance with Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) requirements.\n\nFY2013 Base dollars support the following activities: develops product upgrades for Next Generation Signals to increase the capabilities of the PE and maintain operational relevance; initiates integration of Real-time Signal Processing architectural framework (e.g. Red Hawk); and initiates integration and testing of a software defined radio\/receiver and antenna solutions (e.g. PENNANTRACE and Roadmaster) into the PE Sensor."

The regulatory guidance directing this mission is contained in AR 525-15, AR 525-22, and AR 95-1. Current military operations are conducted in a rapidly changing threat environment, where Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), Infra Red (IR) man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) seekers, radar guided surface-to-air-missiles (SAM), laser guided weapons, anti-helicopter mines, and targeting sensors are proliferating and evolving. Integrated solutions are required to counter increasingly sophisticated Electronic Warfare (EW) threats, and the ARAT reprogramming infrastructure supports the tactical Commander by providing timely rapid-reprogramming, and software\/information dissemination for Army supported, Joint, allied service, electronic warfare integrated reprogramming of target acquisition, target engagement, vehicle survivability, and Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE). ARAT efforts support Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Protect (EP) and Electronic Support (ES). The ARAT rapid-reprogramming infrastructure supports tactical requirements for deployed aircraft and ground-based (e.g. CREW) survivability systems including those deployed in the CENTCOM area of responsibility (AOR). ARAT identifies and analyzes threat signature changes which affect FPS and TSS; determines the impact of observed signature changes; creates new mission data software to adapt the system to the changes; disseminates the mission software changes; and provides methods to upload the new mission software into the affected FPS and TSS.  Each element within the ARAT infrastructure plays a specific role within the program's rapid reprogramming process, providing the Soldier with the capability to install mission and target identification software at the lowest possible level - maximizing flexibility for tactical commanders. ARAT participates in the operational and developmental test design of Army FPS and TSS, and supports Service and JCS Reprogramming Exercises in all theaters.\t\t\t\t\nARAT Research and Development enables continuing development of: 1) automated threat analysis tools to rapidly detect (flag) threat changes within the intelligence system, 2) tools to minimize the time to develop Mission Data Sets (MDS), 3) tools and technology to minimize the time required to test and validate MDSs, 4) improved communications conduits to transmit mission software changes to field users, and 5) enhanced mission-software uploading tools. These efforts allow for rapid threat analysis, simulation, mission software development, distribution and uploading of mission software changes directly to the supported Soldier."

Create MDS development, testing and validation tools to decrease time from threat-change detection to the distribution of MDS products in order to increase the accuracy and fidelity of threat identification, and reduce the engineering involvement\/workload associated with the manually intensive analysis and MDS development processes. Define requirements and develop tools to migrate to a data support infrastructure that employs Next Generation EWIR System (NGES) when the NGES is deployed and the current EWIR system is decommissioned."
