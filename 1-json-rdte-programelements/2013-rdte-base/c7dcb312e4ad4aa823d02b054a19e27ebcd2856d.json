Further, value stream modifications and manufacturing throughput improvements are effected to shorten cycle times of weapon systems during design, development, production and sustainment. ManTech objectives are conducted through industrial partnerships which enable the demonstration of manufacturing technologies for existing weapon system upgrades and\/or for new warfighter systems.  Efforts in the program have been coordinated through the Reliance 21 process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.  Manufacturing Technologies is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development, since it develops and demonstrates manufacturing technologies for existing upgrades and\/or new system developments that have military utility and address warfighter needs."

Within each product sector (aeronautical, space, munitions\/directed energy, and C2ISR), manufacturing readiness assessments (MRAs) will be applied and manufacturing readiness levels (MRLs) utilized to gauge and manage manufacturing related issues.   Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) will be used when appropriate to aid in efficient transition.  Selected acquisition programs will also be assessed to determine readiness for milestone decisions and\/or to reduce manufacturing risk.  Pervasive, generic and system-specific manufacturing maturation plans will be developed and implemented based on the assessments to reduce overall program risk and to provide an increased awareness of manufacturing issues throughout major weapon system life cycles.  Generic and pervasive manufacturing issues will be identified and considered as potential ManTech programs to transition advanced manufacturing technologies into multiple sectors."
