            "val": "The Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system collects, digitally processes, and disseminates real-time target cuing and tracking information; the common tactical 3-dimentional air picture; and command, control, and intelligence information to all Maneuver Air and Missile Defense (MAMD) weapon systems (Avenger and Man-Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS)), and joint and combined arms systems. The FAAD C2 system provides alerting data to air defense gunners, airspace battle management, and up-linking of mission operations, thereby enhancing force protection against air and missile attack.  Situational awareness and targeting data is provided on threat aircraft, cruise missiles, and unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The FAAD C2 system provides this mission capability by integrating dynamic FAAD C2 engagement operations software with the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS), Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT), Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS), Enhanced Position Location System (EPLRS), Global Positioning System (GPS), Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS), Sentinel radar, and the Mission Command architecture.  In addition, FAAD C2 provides interoperability with Joint C2 systems and horizontal integration with PATRIOT, Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), and the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor (JLENS) by fusing sensor data to create a scalable and filterable Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP) and common tactical picture.  The system software is a key component of the Air Defense and Airspace Management (ADAM) Cell that is being fielded to Brigade Combat Teams (BCT), Multi-Functional Support Brigades and Divisions\/Corps as part of the Army's modularity concept.  System software is able to provide target data and engagement commands\/status to MAMD Battalions. FAAD C2 is also a principal air defense system within the Homeland Defense Program. Soldiers from activated Army National Guard MAMD battalions operate the FAAD C2 systems in the National Capital Region and other locations.\n\nThe Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control System (AMDPCS) is an Army Objective Force System that provides integration of Air and Missile Defense (AMD) operations at all echelons. AMDPCS systems are deployed with Air Defense Artillery (ADA) brigades, Army Air and Missile Defense Commands (AAMDCs), and ADAM Cells at the BCTs, Multi Functional Support Brigades and Divisions\/Corps. AMDPCS systems also provide air defense capabilities to Homeland Defense systems. The development of ADAM Cells is essential in fulfilling the Army's Modularity requirement.  ADAM Cells provide the Commander at BCTs, Brigades and Divisions with air defense situational awareness and airspace management capabilities. They also provide the interoperability link with Joint, multinational and coalition forces.  AMDPCS components are vital in the transformation of ADA units and the activation of the AMD Battalions. AMDPCS has three major components: (1) Air and Missile Defense Workstation (AMDWS) is an automated defense and staff planning tool that displays the common tactical and operational 3-dimentional air picture; (2) Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI) is a communications data link processor and display system that provides near-real time, 3-dimensional, joint airspace situational awareness and fire direction command and control for AMD forces; (3) Army Air Defense shelter configurations use automated data processing equipment, tactical communications, Common Hardware Systems, standard vehicles and tactical power to provide AMD unit commanders and staffs with the capabilities to plan missions, direct forces, and control the airspace. \n\nCounter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) is an evolutionary, non-developmental program initiated by the Army Chief of Staff in response to the Indirect Fire (IDF) threat and a validated Operational Needs Statement (ONS).  The primary mission of the C-RAM program is to develop, procure, field, and maintain a system-of-systems (SoS) that can detect RAM launches; locally warn the defended area with sufficient time for personnel to take appropriate action; intercept rounds in flight, thus preventing damage to ground forces or facilities; and enhance response to and defeat of enemy forces.  The C-RAM capability is comprised of a combination of multi-service fielded and non-developmental item (NDI) sensors, command and control (C2) systems, and a modified U.S. Navy intercept system (Land-based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS)), with a low cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) warning system and wireless local area network.  The C-RAM SoS capability is currently deployed at multiple sites in two theaters of operation, providing them correlated air and ground pictures and linking them to the Army Mission Command and the Joint Defense Network with various forms of communications to provide situational awareness and exchange of timely"

AMDPCS systems are deployed with Air Defense Artillery (ADA) brigades, Army Air and Missile Defense Commands (AAMDCs), and Air Defense and Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells at the Brigade Combat Teams (BCT's), Multi Functional Support Brigades and Divisions\/Corps.  AMDPCS systems also provide air defense capabilities to Homeland Defense systems.  The development of ADAM Cells is essential in fulfilling the Army's Modularity requirement.  ADAM Cells provide the Commander at BCTs, Brigades and Divisions with air defense situational awareness and airspace management capabilities.  They also provide the interoperability link with Joint, multinational and coalition forces.  AMDPCS components are vital in the transformation of ADA units and the activation of the Air & Missile Defense (AMD) Battalions.  AMDPCS has three major components:  (1) The Air and Missile Defense Workstation (AMDWS) is an automated defense and staff planning tool that displays the common tactical and operational 3-dimentional air picture.  AMDWS is the air picture provider for the Army, producing an integrated and correlated air picture at all tactical levels and locations.  AMDWS is also an integral component of Integrated Base Defense.  AMDWS provides an interoperability link to multinational air defense forces IAW Annex C to a Joint US\/NATO Air Defense Agreement; (2) The Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI) is a communications data link processor and display system that provides near-real time, 3-dimensional, joint airspace situational awareness and fire direction command and control for Air and Missile Defense forces; (3) The Army Air Defense shelter configurations use automated data processing equipment, tactical communications, Common Hardware Systems, standard vehicles and tactical power to provide AMD unit commanders and staffs with the capabilities to plan missions, direct forces, and control the airspace.  \n \nFY13 funds the development, software engineering, testing and certification of the AMDWS, ADSI, and sheltered subsystem software as described below."

                            "val": "Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) is an evolutionary, non-developmental program initiated by the Army Chief of Staff in response to the Indirect Fire (IDF) threat and a validated Operational Needs Statement (ONS).  The primary mission of the C-RAM program is to develop, procure, field, and maintain a system-of-systems (SoS) that can detect RAM launches; locally warn the defended area with sufficient time for personnel to take appropriate action; intercept rounds in flight, thus preventing damage to ground forces or facilities; and enhance response to and defeat of enemy forces.  The C-RAM capability is comprised of a combination of multi-service fielded and non-developmental item (NDI) sensors, command and control (C2) systems, and a modified U.S. Navy intercept system (Land-based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS)), with a low cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) warning system and wireless local area network.  The C-RAM SoS capability is currently deployed at multiple sites in two theaters of operation, providing them correlated air and ground pictures and linking them to the Army Mission Command and the Joint Defense Network with various forms of communications to provide situational awareness and exchange of timely and accurate information to synchronize and optimize automated Shape, Sense, Warn, Intercept, Respond, and Protect decisions.\n\nThe deployment of the C-RAM SoS was accomplished through an incremental acquisition process driven by urgent operational needs, theater priorities, and emerging capability requirements to provide a counter-RAM capability to combat forces.  The C-RAM SoS approach was initially validated by a Proof of Principle demonstration in December 2004 and has undergone more than 25 Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC)-supported operational assessments to incorporate multiple improvements in response to changes in threat tactics and lessons learned.  The C-RAM Sense and Warn (S&W) capability is currently deployed to Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) in support of Department of State\/Office of Security Cooperation-Iraq (DoS\/OSC-I) operations, and PD C-RAM is currently deploying C-RAM S&W capability to FOBs in Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  In response to a theater requirement tasked to the Rapid Equipping Force (REF), C-RAM installed Mass Notification Systems (MNS) at multiple OEF sites to support base-wide alerts and announcements.  Continuing C-RAM SoS improvement efforts, to include C2 software upgrades, as well as deploying enhanced detection\/intercept capability against low Quadrant Elevation (QE) rocket and Improvised Rocket Assisted Munitions (IRAM) , are required to meet emerging theater requirements.  Support of the existing C-RAM SoS capability deployed in theater has been through the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) process. .  \n\nNear-term directed enhancements to the C-RAM SoS capability include use of Army tactical communications rather than commercial systems; integration of Warn functionality into the C2 workstation to reduce complexity and footprint; integration with Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS) for enhanced situational awareness, combat identification, and response options; and dynamic clearance of unplanned fires in conjunction with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) for rapid and enhanced response.  Additionally, the C-RAM Program Directorate has been directed to make enhancements to Intercept (e.g., improved tactical mobility, upgun for increased lethality\/range, and\/or alternative options to the current LPWS Intercept capability).\n\nIndirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) Increment 1, will be the Army's acquisition program to provide the existing C-RAM Warn capability to all Maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCT).  IFPC INC 1 is a horizontal technology insertion, using current C-RAM Warning equipment, to provide early, localized warning.  It will employ the Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cell already resident in the BCT Headquarters as the C2 element, use the Firefinders and LCMRs already in the Target Acquisition Platoon of the Fires Battalion as the Sense element, and add Warning devices, controller, and dedicated communications devices between the existing radars and the ADAM Cell.  The Capability Production Document (CPD) was approved in August 2010; The CPD was approved in August 2010.  An operational assessment will be conducted to support a Milestone C decision."

The Capability Production Document (CPD) for the Land-based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS) is currently in world-wide staffing.  Upon approval of the CPD, LPWS will transition to a Program of Record (POR) for sustainment and fielding to army units, pending force structure approval.\n\nIn parallel, Intercept enhancement alternatives are being evaluated to upgrade the current LPWS capability to provide improved tactical mobility and increased range\/lethality against indirect fire threats.  The enhanced Intercept capability will be supported as part of the LPWS POR above or established as a separate POR as appropriate.\n\nIndirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) Increment 1 will provide an early, localized warning capability to the maneuver BCTs.  The CPD was approved in August 2010 and the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) establishing IFPC INC 1 as a POR was approved in January 2012.  The program office will continue procurement of currently fielded IFPC INC 1 systems and transition all systems to the POR."
