Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60L\/M, MH-47G, and A\/MH-6M.  These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts, and they must be capable of rapid deployment; undetected penetration of hostile areas; and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  Sub-projects include:  \n\n\u2022    A\/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade includes development of an integrated digital moving map, upgraded multifunctional displays, improved communication\/navigation suites, lightweight mission processor, structural upgrades, and next generation main\/tail rotor systems. This upgrade modification will increase safety margins and increase operational capabilities at higher altitude and temperature conditions.\n\n\u2022   The A\/MH-6 Improved Seat system will provide a crash-worthy ballistic protection, crash attenuation, and restraint system upgrades to prevent severe injury to Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA) pilots.  The Center for Army Lessons Learned reported that over a three year period, 50 ARSOA pilots suffered serious back injuries and were grounded due to hard landings.     \n\n\u2022    Hostile Fire Indicating System (HFIS) detects, classifies, and alerts the aircrew to the presence of small caliber weapons fire for SOF MH-47\/60 platforms.  By providing detection and angle of arrival information, the HFIS will allow the aircrew to perform evasive and counter-fire actions significantly increasing the aircraft's probability of survival.  The Helicopter Survivability Task Force (HSTF) additional funds will incorporate Hostile Fire Indication in the Infrared Spectrum as well as providing sensor fusion of Infrared, Ultra-Violet, and acoustic sensors in order to reduce false alarms and increase probability of detection.  \n\n\u2022   The MH-47 Engine Automatic Re-Light (EARL) system will detect the presence of an impending or an in-progress engine flame-out event and re-establish combustion within the engine to avoid an actual engine flame-out.  EARL will recognize the event much faster than a pilot and then proceed to reignite\/restart the engine while monitoring and adjusting engine parameters including the ignition system and fuel flow scheduling.  EARL is required to address safety issues in the MH-47 fleet where engine flame-out has been cited as one of the probable causes of the loss of an MH-47G with loss of life in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\n\u2022   MH-47 Low Cost Modifications program is an effort to integrate an improved Common Rotor Blade (CRB) being developed by the Army into the MH-47G.\n\n\u2022   MH-60 SOF Modernization program provides for the systems engineering and platform integration efforts, to include continued flight and qualification testing and test support.   \n\n\u2022    Next Generation Forward Looking Infrared Radar (NGFLIR) develops and qualifies a laser rangefinder\/designator (LRF\/D) for the AN\/ZSQ-3 Electro Optical Sighting System (EOSS). \n\n\u2022   Reduced Optical Signature Emissions Solution (ROSES) program reduces the optical signature output of the current infrared expendable decoys for purposes of reducing Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA) aircraft vulnerabilities.  This flare solution will have the capability to decoy currently fielded infrared missiles and more sophisticated emerging threats, and is an interim solution pending flare technology advancements.\n\n\u2022   Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) Solution will fuse information from currently fielded aircraft sensors with emerging technology to display real-time reference points, obstacles, and landing zone information to the aviator.  The DVE solution will provide MH-47\/60\/6 aircrews with visual cues for obstacle avoidance and aircraft control during all phases of flight and significantly increase crew and passenger survivability in DVE such as dirt and snow.  Additional funding is provided to enhance the maturity of the rotor-craft and begin software development.\n\n\u2022   Aircraft Occupant Ballistic Protection System (AOBPS) is a follow-on procurement for ship-sets of Multiple Impact Transparent Armor System (MITAS) panels that were developed with Helicopter Survivability Task Force (HSTF) FY 2010 RDT&E funds.  These components will replace panels and windows to increase aircrew and passenger safety and survivability."

This effort is critically required to make the A\/MH-6M more relevant on the battlefield today and well into 2020 decade.  This effort will increase safety margins and increase operational capabilities at higher altitude and temperature conditions.  Competitive source selection processes will be conducted for the Block 3.0 upgrades to the extent possible. Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer. \n\n\u2022   A\/MH-6M Improved Seat System - This effort develops and qualifies an integrated ballistic tolerant, ergonomic, and crashworthy crew seat system for the A\/MH-6M fleet.  This modification will provide critical protection from crash loads and airframe vibrations by upgrading the current A\/MH-6M seat and restraint system.  A competitive source selection process will be conducted for the crashworthy seat system replacement to the extent possible.  Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer.  \n\n\u2022   HFIS - This effort will develop, integrate, install, and field the capability to detect, classify, and alert the aircrew to the presence of small arms fire, Anti-Aircraft Artillery, and Rocket Propelled Grenades.  HFIS will allow aircrews to perform evasive and counter-fire actions, which will increase aircraft survivability and mission success.  A competitive source selection process will be conducted for the HFIS effort to the extent possible.  Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer. The HSTF additional funds will incorporate Hostile Fire Indication in the Infrared Spectrum as well as providing sensor fusion of Infrared, Ultra-violet, and acoustic sensors in order to reduce false alarms and increase probability of detection.   \n  \n\n\u2022   MH-47 EARL  System - This effort develops and qualifies a solution to address safety issues in the MH-47 fleet through the development, test, qualification, and fielding of changes to the engine control system to perform automatic engine failure detection and flame-out protection.

Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer.  \n\n\u2022   MH-47 Low Cost Modification to integrate the Army Common Rotor Blade (CRB) - This effort integrates and qualifies a CRB solution that significantly increases payload capability, expands forward flight envelope, improves manufacturing and maintenance characteristics, and maintains commonality with the Army.  As the MH-47 CRB integration leverages Army CRB development activities with the original equipment manufacturer, this effort will consist mostly of Government executed integration, testing, and qualification efforts with some analytical engineering services to be procured.  Because of proprietary considerations, efforts may be directed to the original equipment manufacturer.  \n\n\u2022   MH-60M SOF Modernization Program - This supports the Systems Integration and Qualification efforts on the prototype MH-60M helicopter. This includes, but is not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation. There are no proprietary considerations that may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer.  \n\n\u2022   NGFLIR - Develops, integrates and qualifies the laser rangefinder and designator to the AN\/ZSQ-3 and develops a drop-in, advanced, dual-color (long and mid-wave) IR detector upgrade for the AN\/ZSQ-2.  NGFLIR will be installed on the MH-47\/60 and AH-6M platforms within the ARSOA fleet.  Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer.\n\n\u2022   ROSES - This effort develops and qualifies a flare solution that discharges fewer expendables per dispense and emits less visible light to improve aircrew's ability to survive in sophisticated threat environments.  A competitive source selection process will be conducted for the ROSES to the extent possible.  Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer.\n\n\u2022   DVE - This effort integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in degraded visual environments.  A competitive source process will be conducted for the DVE solution to the extent possible while capitalizing on Science and Technology initiatives and other Service DVE investments.  Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer. Additional funds will be employed to begin the development of the software\/firmware for the Synthetic Vision Backbone which uses Digital Terrain Elevation Data or High Resolution digital elevation maps, Threat Data, and Blue Force Tracker combined with Q2 Electro-Optic Sighting System overlay and Silent Knight Radar or DVE sensors (not yet defined) to provide a synthetic vision scene to aid the aircrew in degraded visual environments. The Synthetic Vision Backbone is sensor agnostic, maximizing the use of a priori data with sensors used for change detection.\n\n\u2022   AOBPS -This is a follow-on procurement for shipsets of Multiple Impact Transparent Armor System panels that were developed with HSTF FY 2010 RDT&E funds.  These components will replace panels and windows to increase aircrew and passenger safety and survivability."
