            "val": "The Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) mission is to command and control space systems and to distribute space system information in support of DoD, Intelligence Community (IC), and Civil operational and RDT&E missions, and other designated users.  The AFSCN is a fielded, globally-distributed infrastructure of control centers, Remote Tracking Stations (RTSs), and communications links that provides unique capability for designated users to deploy and operate their satellites.  AFSCN provides the highly reliable command and control, communications, and range systems required to support the nation's surveillance, navigation, communications, warning, and weather satellite operations.  Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) performs operations, maintenance, modernization, and sustainment of the system to provide operational capabilities validated by a US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) Initial Capabilities Document and a Headquarters USAF-approved Operational Requirements Document (ORD).  This program element funds the development and acquisition of AFSCN Improvement and Modernization (I&M), an ongoing program of replacements and upgrades which will meet validated USSTRATCOM and AFSPC operational requirements to replace non-standard, unsupportable equipment with more reliable, maintainable, interoperable, and standardized hardware and software.  This new equipment is intended to enable AFSPC satellite operations to be performed with reduced hardware\/software maintenance costs.  The principal efforts within this program are currently focused on Range Upgrades, Network Operations Upgrades, training tools, and associated studies.  \n\nRANGE UPGRADES include the RTS Block Change (RBC), which will standardize, automate and make interoperable the remote tracking stations through the replacement of outdated government-unique equipment with standardized equipment and technology in order to reduce failures, correct operational deficiencies, and reduce operating and sustainment costs; the Unified S-band (USB) high power amplifier development for the RTS to enable dual frequency band uplink commanding of satellites; and systems engineering to ensure integrated upgrade efforts.  FY13 funds include, but are not limited to systems engineering, integration, and test support for the Transportable RBC and continued USB high power amplifier development.  \n\nNETWORK OPERATIONS UPGRADES improve AFSCN resource management capabilities.  The focus of these efforts is on the upgrade of the Electronic Scheduling and Dissemination (ESD) system, which enables satellite operators at over 40 geographically separated locations to request \u201ccontact time\u201d with their satellites via the shared AFSCN antennas, and allows AFSCN schedulers to de-conflict overlapping requests to create and publish a schedule.  FY13 funds continue development of ESD 3.0 software builds and testing.  \n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because it supports a fielded system."

AFSCN provides the highly reliable command and control, communications, and range systems required to support the nation's surveillance, navigation, communications, warning, and weather satellite operations.  Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) performs operations, maintenance, modernization, and sustainment of the system to provide operational capabilities validated by a US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) Initial Capabilities Document and a Headquarters USAF-approved Operational Requirements Document (ORD).  This program element funds the development and acquisition of AFSCN Improvement and Modernization (I&M), an ongoing program of replacements and upgrades which will meet validated USSTRATCOM and AFSPC operational requirements to replace non-standard, unsupportable equipment with more reliable, maintainable, interoperable, and standardized hardware and software.  This new equipment is intended to enable AFSPC satellite operations to be performed with reduced hardware\/software maintenance costs.  The principal efforts within this program are currently focused on Range Upgrades, Network Operations Upgrades, training tools, and associated studies.  \n\nRANGE UPGRADES include the RTS Block Change (RBC), which will standardize, automate and make interoperable the remote tracking stations through the replacement of outdated government-unique equipment with standardized equipment and technology in order to reduce failures, correct operational deficiencies, and reduce operating and sustainment costs; the Unified S-band (USB) high power amplifier development for the RTS to enable dual frequency band uplink commanding of satellites; and systems engineering to ensure integrated upgrade efforts.  FY13 funds include, but are not limited to systems engineering, integration, and test support for the Transportable RBC and continued USB high power amplifier development.  \n\nNETWORK OPERATIONS UPGRADES improve AFSCN resource management capabilities.  The focus of these efforts is on the upgrade of the Electronic Scheduling and Dissemination (ESD) system, which enables satellite operators at over 40 geographically separated locations to request \u201ccontact time\u201d with their satellites via the shared AFSCN antennas, and allows AFSCN schedulers to de-conflict overlapping requests to create and publish a schedule.  FY13 funds continue development of ESD 3.0 software builds and testing.  \n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because it supports a fielded system."
