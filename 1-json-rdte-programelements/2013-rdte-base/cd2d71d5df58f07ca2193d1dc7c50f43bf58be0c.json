The test bed program will validate and test the operational cost and performance of innovative energy technologies in a real-world integrated building environment so as to reduce risk, overcome the barriers to deployment, and facilitate wide-scale deployment.  The DoD test bed program exploits the Department's existing built infrastructure to test energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in three areas: component technologies (i.e., HVAC, lighting, distributed energy generation); system approaches to building energy design, control, and management; and installation-level smart micro-grid technologies.  It is a distributed test bed designed to evaluate energy technologies under the varied climatic conditions and building types DoD manages. The test beds key elements are: 1) competitive selection of new technologies, 2) systematic and consistent evaluation to determine performance, operational readiness and life cycle costs, and 3) development of guidance and design information for future deployment across installations.  This process has been developed, piloted, and validated through previous Congressional funding. Information on existing demonstrations can be found at WWW.SERDP-ESTCP.ORG."
