The JCTD BA-4 PE and DAE BA-5 Pilot Program PEs ended.\n\nToday's operations require even faster delivery of new capabilities.  Therefore, the JCTD Program was revised to accelerate project selection, encourage capability demonstration of more short projects (one year or less) and fewer long projects (two to three years), and increase the delivery rate of new capabilities.  This new process includes: streamlined project approval and initiation; clear one-year deliverables and decision points for projects greater than a year in duration; and annual reviews of ongoing JCTDs to assess deliverables and continuation of the project."

            "val": "The Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) Program directly addresses Joint, Coalition, and\/or Interagency capability needs expressed by Combatant Commands (COCOMs).  Due to significant successes since inception of the program (initially the Advanced Capability Technology Demonstration (ACTD) Program), the JCTD Program is now viewed by COCOMs as a primary means to rapidly develop, assess, and transition needed capabilities into operations.  Through partnering with other solution providers and resource sponsors, the JCTD Program typically leverages $2 in partner funding for every $1 in the JCTD budget.  Thus, the value and impact of JCTDs to the COCOMs is significantly greater than a typical Research and Development program.\n\nKey values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:\n- The program has a long history of providing enduring capabilities.  To date, over 90 percent of completed JCTDs have successfully transitioned capabilities to warfighters.  70 percent of completed ACTD projects successfully transitioned their products.  (See \u201cSection D.  Acquisition Strategy\u201d for transition discussion).\n- The program delivers capabilities rapidly.  Projects execute within the Department of Defense (DoD) Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process.  In other words, when a new capability need is identified, a JCTD project can be started and completed before funding can start in the traditional PPBE cycle.  The result is that 74 JCTD\/ACTD projects delivered capabilities used in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and 57 projects delivered capabilities to Operation ENDURING FREEDOM.  Most of those capabilities would not have been delivered - or would have been significantly delayed \u2013 without the JCTD program.  A recent example is the Persistent Ground Surveillance System (PGSS) JCTD, which quickly (several months) demonstrated and assessed aerostat and integrated sensor technologies to provide wide area surveillance for forward operating bases.  Success has led to procurement of over 30 PGSS systems providing 24 hour protection to bases in Afghanistan.\n- The program enables Coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources.  More than one quarter of JCTD projects involve some coalition participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations, the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the Republic of Korea, and the Republic of Singapore.\n- The program enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects, such as projects with the Department of Homeland Security, Department of State, and Department of Transportation.  Recent examples are interdepartmental collaborations for maritime awareness, air domain information sharing, tunnel detection and characterization, and Arctic awareness.\n- The program enables rapid response to new DoD priorities before Service PPBE cycles can respond.  For example, the Department has recently established priorities for Building Partner Capacity, understanding human terrain, and nuclear forensics.  The JCTD Program quickly responded and is providing initial capabilities that are transitioning to Service efforts.\n\nMEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  Metrics include: all JCTDs will have deliverables within 12 months to enable assessment for project continuation; 50 percent of JCTDs will provide an operationally-relevant prototype within 12 months; and 75 percent will complete final demonstration within 24 months of receiving funding.  JCTDs will spiral products and deliverables during the demonstration.  At least 75 percent of JCTD projects will transition products to a Program of Record (POR), residual operations, or availability for procurement from the General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule.\n\nTransition Achievement:  The JCTD program has been achieving actual transition rates in excess of the stated goal.  The JCTD Program defines transition as a project\u2019s product(s) going to new or existing POR, providing residual capabilities sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations, or commodity-type capabilities entered onto GSA schedule for procurement by Department users.  14 of 18 completions in FY 2011 successfully transitioned."

A recent example is the Persistent Ground Surveillance System (PGSS) JCTD, which quickly (several months) demonstrated and assessed aerostat and integrated sensor technologies to provide wide area surveillance for forward operating bases.  Success has led to procurement of over 30 PGSS systems providing 24 hour protection to bases in Afghanistan.\n- The program enables Coalition cooperative development by leveraging partner nation expertise and resources.  More than one quarter of JCTD projects involve some coalition participation.  As a result of successful past collaborations, the program now enjoys routine interactions with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the Republic of Korea, and the Republic of Singapore.\n- The program enables development and execution of interdepartmental cooperation projects, such as projects with the Department of Homeland Security, Department of State, and Department of Transportation.  Recent examples are interdepartmental collaborations for maritime awareness, air domain information sharing, tunnel detection and characterization, and Arctic awareness.\n- The program enables rapid response to new DoD priorities before Service PPBE cycles can respond.  For example, the Department has recently established priorities for Building Partner Capacity, understanding human terrain, and nuclear forensics.  The JCTD Program quickly responded and is providing initial capabilities that are transitioning to Service efforts.\n\nMEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  Metrics include: all JCTDs will have deliverables within 12 months to enable assessment for project continuation; 50 percent of JCTDs will provide an operationally-relevant prototype within 12 months and 75 percent will complete final demonstration within 24 months of receiving funding.  JCTDs will spiral products and deliverables during the demonstration.  At least 75 percent of JCTD projects will transition products to a Program of Record (POR), residual operations, or availability for procurement from the General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule.\n\nTransition Achievement:  The JCTD program has been achieving actual transition rates in excess of the stated goal.  The JCTD Program defines transition as a project\u2019s product(s) going to new or existing POR, providing residual capabilities sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations, or commodity-type capabilities entered onto GSA schedule for procurement by Department users.  14 of 18 completions in FY 2011 successfully transitioned."

Additionally, supporting personnel may be reduced due to the semi-autonomous operating capability of JRaDS, and reduced need for supplementary materiel handling equipment.  These aspects will expedite cargo movement from Sea Ports of Debarkation, Aerial Ports of Debarkation, and Theater Supply Depots to front-line users, while reducing costs associated with movement of cargo within theater.  JRaDS will also afford an expeditious and efficient method of recovering disabled and catastrophically damaged Tactical Wheeled Vehicles and light to medium weight Rotary Wing aircraft.  Residual trailers from the JCTD will be used by field units, thereby placing the JRaDS capability into forces sooner than waiting for production of trailers."

Using these technologies, Combatant Commanders will have the reliable option of neutralizing heavily defended and dynamic targets without the incursion of manned platforms.  Hardware and software changes to the TLAM Program of Record (PMA-280) will be incorporated via Engineering Change Proposals once demonstrated.  Deliverables will include documented CONOPS and TTPs.  Production of the TLAM will incorporate the JMEWS warhead, and add the data link, radio equipment, and interfaces necessary for 3PT.

TEDS focuses on exchanging data from Army and Marine Corps C2 Authoritative Data Sources for the C2 and Battlespace Awareness domains.  The efficiencies gained will be the reduction of redundant software being developed across multiple programs and the ability to seamlessly exchange data within Military Services as well as NATO and coalition partners who adopt UCore.  Transition of the C2 Core extensions and Web services for translation and semantic mediation is planned for programs of record in the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps.

The three programs are (1) Unified  COCOM Direct Participation; (2) JCTD Transition Enabling; and (3) Program Integration Office for interagency classified projects.   Additional details follow:\n(1) COCOM Direct Participation:  The COCOMs are essential in specifying capability needs, project selection, validation, demonstration, assessment, and transition of JCTDs.  However, COCOM staffs are not manned to provide the daily interactions needed to develop and execute successful JCTDs and coordinate all operational interactions.  Therefore, the JCTD Program enables COCOM staffs to directly participate in the Program, allowing each COCOM to select and fund an on-site JCTD manager, typically 1 full-time equivalent engineer with operational experience.\n(2) JCTD Transition Enabling:  In FY 2011 the funding for JCTD Transition,  Program Element 0604648D8Z, was transfered to the Program Element 0603648D8Z, which is reflected in the growth of this program.  In some cases, Service or Agency partners cannot commit to transition JCTD products until demonstrations and assessments are complete at the end of the JCTD.  This leads to situations in which the Service or Agency transition funding is not available for one to two years, due to the Service or Agency prior Program Objective Memorandum commitments.  In such cases, where there is clear transition and the need to sustain the capability for a short time prior to availability of Service or Agency transition funds, the JCTD Transition Enabling fund may be used to meet that need.  \n(3) Program Integration Office: A limited number of classified JCTDs are executed in special classification channels, typically involving partnership with other government agencies.  JCTD Program funds are used to provide the special classification handling capability and to provide partial funding to the selected special projects."

In these cases, existing program documentation (such as the Capabilities Development Document or Capabilities Production Document) is revised to include the new capabilities from the JCTD, and the JCTD capabilities transition to the Program of Record.\n- The capabilities address a current operational need without requiring Program of Record changes.  In these cases, the JCTD capabilities may transition directly to operational use, with sustainment (operations and maintenance) funding arranged through the gaining command.  \n- The capabilities may be widely applicable commodity products, useful to many commands.  In these cases, the commodity products listed on General Services Administration schedule, and made available for purchase by any commands needing the capability, using procurement funds."

The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Rapid Fielding maintains and provides overall programmatic oversight for the JCTD program, to include the individual JCTD projects.  The JCTD performance metrics center on how fast relevant joint and\/or transformational technologies can be demonstrated and provided to the joint warfighter.  These metrics are driven by the overall business process which includes six parts:  (1) selection focus; (2) ability to spin-off spiral technologies; (3) time necessary to complete a final demonstration; (4) adequately resourced projects with appropriate oversight; (5) capability to complete an independent assessment of the technology; and (6) the number of successful capabilities that are actually transitioned to the warfighter.  \n\nMEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  Metrics include: all JCTDs will deliver products within 12 months to enable assessment for project continuation; 50 percent of JCTDs will provide an operationally-relevant prototype within 12 months and 75 percent will complete final demonstration within 24 months of Implementation Directive signature.  JCTDs will spiral products and deliverables during the demonstration.  At least 75 percent of JCTD projects will transition products to Programs of Record (PoR), sustained residual operations, or availability for procurement from the GSA Schedule.\n\nTransition Achievement:  The JCTD program has been achieving actual transition rates in excess of the stated goal.  The JCTD Program defines transition as a project\u2019s product or products going to new or existing PoRs and\/or providing residual products sustained in direct support of operations that satisfies a specific requirement, or procurement availability on GSA Schedule."
