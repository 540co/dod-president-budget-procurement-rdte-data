            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nAll Navy advanced technology development in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking and neutralization is funded through this PE.  The related technologies being developed are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the three core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  The focus is on leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship and air ASW assets.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The submarine target must be detected beyond its weapons release range. The objective is to develop rapidly deployable systems employing automated detection and classification capabilities for use in both shallow and deep water operating environments. Distributed Search supports the ASW protected passage Maritime Shield operational constructs. Related efforts include the development of distributed systems employing optimization as well as active acoustic sensing and processing techniques, navy-unique transduction and underwater networking technology. Efforts also include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing persistent detection concepts and components. These efforts provide an extended reach of organic platform-based systems through the use of new sensor concepts, improved materials for advanced sensors, optimized deployment, employment, and automated operation of distributed sensor fields. The cornerstone of Distributed Search is the development of rapidly deployable, long-endurance active sensors with automated processing suitable for use in a wide variety of operational environments.\n\nDecrease from FY 2011 to FY 2012 is due to the completion of Future Naval Capability (FNC) Distributed System Processing.\n\nDecrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to realignment of Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) SHD-FY10-02 ASW Command Level Training and SHD-FY10-02 Operator Training to R2 Activity SEA SHIELD in PE 0603673N."

The results of these research efforts in conjunction with embedded state-of-the-art command and operator-level training will facilitate the optimum employment of ASW sensor systems, thus increasing their effectiveness and potentially decreasing the number of sensors used to provide coverage in a given area. This work will provide operational commanders with sensor performance predictions which allow them to accurately judge the performance of those sensors, as well as information with which to deploy them for the greatest operational effect. It will also provide information as to how the performance evolves over time due to effects such as the deformation of sensor locations by currents, sound velocity profile changes, geologic magnetic interference changes, or changes to the optical properties of the water, etc. The effort includes performance predictions for fields of sensors as well as individual sensors themselves and applies to both acoustic and nonacoustic sensors.\n\nWork includes development of ASW sensor and system performance models, and realistic simulations and measures of effectiveness that incorporate and exploit critical environmental knowledge. It includes efforts to couple ocean dynamics and acoustics, characterize ambient noise in the littorals, measure and model acoustic and optical propagation and scattering in complex environments, develop algorithms to extract environmental information from through-the-sensor measurements and quantification and prediction of uncertainty. This information is combined with the operating characteristics of particular sensors (or groups of sensors) to provide predictions of sensor performance in the environment at that particular time and in the future. The predictions will also include assessments of the prediction uncertainty due to environmental measurement and sensor performance uncertainties.\n\nThis work aligns principally with the Assure Access and Hold at Risk S&T Focus Area in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan and contributes measurably to the Operational Environments S&T Focus Area strategic objectives.\n\nThe FY 2011 to FY 2012 funding decrease is due to the phasing down of FNC - Drifting System Placement and Source Control Algorithm.\n\nThe FY 2012 to FY 2013 funding decrease is due to the realignment of Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) SHD-FY09-01 Drifting System Placement and Source Control Algorithm, SHD-FY09-01 In-Situ Environmental Characterization and System Monitoring and SHD-FY09-01 Mobile System Placement, Source Control, and Pattern Keeping Algorithm to R2 Activity SEA SHIELD in PE 0603673N."

Specific improvements are classified.\n- Extending deep water active distributed system lifetime to a few months with a probability of detection (Pd) of 90% within 4 hours (field configuration) or 90% per crossing (barrier configuration), with a False Alarm Rate (FAR) of no more than 4\/day.\n- Delivery from a Vertical Takeoff Unmanned Air Vehicle (VTUAV) and\/or a long-range, high-speed Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) a compact undersea weapon capable of a high Probability of Kill (PK) given precise target localization.\n- Detection and localization performance with a single-line vector sensor array nominally equivalent or superior to that of two coherently processed TB-29A arrays. Acquisition costs to be competitive with the cost of a current TB-29A and at least 30% less than the cost of two arrays. Sensor and telemetry packaging will be adequate to achieve neutral buoyancy in an existing TB-29A form factor with array power efficiency greater than 75%. Array handling will be compatible with the existing TB-29 handling system.\n\nIncrease sensor to shooter performance and the effective lifetime of distributed ASW search systems by:\n- Achieving a drifting active distributed system lifetime of at least two days in areas of tactical significance while maintaining required system performance with a minimum number of sensor nodes.\n- Maintaining an effective lifetime of a month for mobile active distributed systems when subjected to the action of eddies from a major ocean current.\n- Predicting reseed 6 hours before performance degrades.\n- Holding the Area of Uncertainty (AOU) to no larger than 10 nm2 for an hour after initial detection through the control of the coherent sources.\n\nThrough a combination of better Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) command-level training and improved operator training provide the following:\n- Improve the ability of active sonar operators to detect targets and reject potential false alarms compared to current simulation based training.\n- Increase Pd by 50%.\n- Provide a decrease in FAR by a factor of two.\n- Provide a reduction in the probability of a hit on a High Value Unit (HVU) by a factor of two.\n- Improve the ability of the ASW Commander to position assets to increase coverage, reduce active system interference and deal effectively with competing missions.\n- Reduce training cost by greater than 80% and increase the frequency of training opportunities by greater than 600% relative to live training."
