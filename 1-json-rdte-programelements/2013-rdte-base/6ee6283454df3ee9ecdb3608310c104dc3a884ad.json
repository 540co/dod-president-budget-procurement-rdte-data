            "val": "The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) includes over 1,084 military, civilian, and contractor personnel and nearly 140,274 square feet of Command, Control, Communications, Computing and Intelligence (C4I)\/Global Information Grid (GIG) testing laboratories.   Under DISA\u2019s Test and Evaluation (T&E) Executive, the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) serves as the only joint element of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD\u2019s) MRTFB, which is a national asset that is sized, operated, and maintained primarily for DoD test and evaluation support missions.  \n\nJITC is the sole interoperability certifier for all Information Technology\/National Security Systems (IT\/NSS) for DoD.  Additional core missions include testing of DoD terrestrial, space, and tactical communications capabilities, supporting warfighters on technical IT\/NSS issues, and assisting Combatant Command to Coalition partner interoperability.  JITC, as the only Joint Operational Test Agency (OTA), plans and conducts operational tests and evaluations (OT&E) for DISA, the National Security Agency (NSA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), military services, and other DoD agencies.  JITC supports agile acquisition and rapid fielding of net-centric capabilities by improving test, evaluation, and certification (TE&C) processes and gaining efficiencies, investigating innovative methodologies and tools, and continuously enhancing the posture of the T&E infrastructure for its customers.  \n\nIn FY 2013, to ensure its relevancy to DoD and the warfighter community, JITC will continue to manage and maintain its current capability base to provide efficient, responsive TE&C services, as well as continue to: \n \n\u2022 Integrate evolving web-based, cloud and virtual information technology capabilities and designing, implementing and maintaining the Net-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPP) as part of the core DoD interoperability certification process.  These serve as pillars to the TE&C methodology and use operationally realistic test concepts which reduce risk and offer efficiencies across the DoD Enterprise. \n\u2022  Expand test infrastructure and operations to allow for rapid, on-demand provisioning, federation across the DoD and integration with enterprise environments by implementing cloud and virtualized computing concepts in support of Joint\/Coalition and Service unique certifications at minimum cost.\n\u2022 Coordinate and manage functional area products required for Joint T&E of Intelligence, Warfighting, and Business capabilities supporting Joint and Coalition warfighting efficiencies and effectiveness.\n\u2022 Provide consistent, repeatable test methodologies that ensure DISA and other DoD Service\/Agency acquired capabilities are operationally effective, suitable, and secure; certifying Joint Warfighter systems are interoperable with each other.\n\u2022 Provide T&E guidance\/oversight to nearly 130 DISA programs, creating synergy and efficiencies across the large IT portfolio within DISA, gaining insight in new technologies and commercial best practices. \n\u2022 Operate, manage, and maintain DISA\u2019s state-of-the-art test infrastructure and facility to ensure the DISA and JITC missions are executed, while optimizing support to their Service\/Agency\/Coalition customers. \n\u2022 Evolve IT test policies and processes to proactively support the DoD\u2019s migration towards more agile development and acquisition of IT\/NSS capabilities in support of Section 804 Acquisition Reform.  \n\u2022  Implement Design of Experiments (DOE) and Science-Based Test Design (SBTD) approaches, concepts, and strategies in T&E methodologies to support the Director, Operational Testing and Evaluation and the Under Assistant Secretary of Defense for Developmental T&E guidance to increase the emphasis on scientific test design and statistical rigor in T&E."

JITC serves as the only joint element of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD\u2019s) Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), which is a national asset that is sized, operated, and maintained primarily for DoD test and evaluation support missions.  As an MRTFB facility, JITC\u2019s global reach extends to the entire spectrum of the DoD, Federal government, private industry, and allies in support of command and control, intelligence, and defense reform initiatives.  This includes commercial entities, which allows JITC to coordinate directly with vendors to obtain critical pre-acquisition test results.  This early involvement enables rapid delivery of enhanced military capabilities at lower cost.\n\n\u2022  Fully enables JITC mission capability, thus making DISA capable of executing its Information Technology\/National Security System (IT\/NSS) interoperability test and evaluation (T&E) mission mandated in the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6212 and DoD policies.  \n\u2022  Provides the necessary test capabilities and facilities infrastructure, process tracking and reporting systems, as well as hardware and software maintenance to enable direct test support to DoD\u2019s major IT\/NSS acquisitions (e.g., Net-centric core services, Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS), B-52 Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT), Global Combat Support System (GCSS), etc.) as well as Joint Tactical Data Links (TDL), command and control, global, terrestrial, satellite and tactical communications systems, evolving to hand held and wireless technologies.  Supports DISA\u2019s mandated mission to serve as an MRTFB by providing for and maintaining the DISA\/JITC IT infrastructure.  The environments and test tool enhancements allow testing efforts to keep pace with the rapid change in technology and improve the testing methodologies and timelines for DoD IT\/NSS acquisitions.\n\u2022  From an IT\/NSS perspective, DISA acquisition and the T&E support coupled with infrastructure of the Global Information Grid (GIG) serve as the DoD's corollary information technology capability.  \n\u2022  Includes working with industry consortiums on best practices, investing in process based modeling and simulation, evolving standards based frameworks to support testing and analysis as a service, and evolving and virtualizing the laboratories to meet future technology changes and enhancements in hardware and testing software with an emphasis on unified communications requirements, and interactive web enabled capabilities.  \n\u2022  Enables the DISA MRTFB to continue implementing Net Readiness Capabilities Resources (NRCR), which provide DoD with a lifecycle support capability for DoD\u2019s tactical and strategic networks and their interfaces, as well as build communications and test environments for the current and future Converged Real-time Internet Protocol (IP) Services for voice, data and video, Software as a Service (SaaS), NCES, and core services in preparation to conduct agile, on-demand test services for the department.\n\u2022  Continues efforts to provision a Joint Test and Evaluation network through the convergence of current test networks that meets the infrastructure requirements to support the entire spectrum of DoD acquisition process life cycle needs."
