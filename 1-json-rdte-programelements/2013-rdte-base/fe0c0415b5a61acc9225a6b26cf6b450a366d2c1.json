            "val": "Change Summary Explanation:\nFunding:\nFY2011: The FY2012 President?s Budget did not reflect program strategy revisions approved late in 2010. These revisions reduced estimated program costs and also delayed the planned contract awards by approximately seven months (to 3QFY2011). Delays related to the source selection and milestone review processes resulted in a further three month slip to the contract awards. In addition, two (versus the planned three) contracts were awarded for the TD phase. Finally, a protest caused a stop work order shortly after award of the contracts. All of these factors contributed to the congressional reduction (Other Adjustment 1) and rescission (Other Adjustment 2) in FY2011.\nFY2012: Based on the factors discussed above, the Army provided revised FY2012 funding requirements to the congressional committees 4QFY2011. As a result, Congressional action as part of the final FY2012 appropriation\/authorization process reduced funding to the level reflected in this exhibit (Other Adjustment 1).  \nFY2013: The FY2013 requested funding reflects adjustments (Other Adjustment 3) due to all the factors discussed above."

        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "The Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program is based on an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) that was approved 10 December 2009 and a draft Capabilities Development Document (CDD) developed by the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC).  The accomplishments and funding reflected in this justification are based on these documents and on program milestone decision memoranda. A Milestone A Defense Acquisition Board was conducted on 21 July 2011. An Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was signed 17 August 2011. It granted the Project Management Office approval to enter the Technology Development (TD) phase. Although the Army had originally planned to award up to three TD contracts, the source selection process resulted in only two being awarded on 18 August 2011. One contract was awarded to BAE Systems Land & Armaments, L.P. and one was awarded to General Dynamics Land Systems Inc. Following GAO receipt of a protest, stop work orders were issued on 29 August 2011. The Government Accountability Office denied the protest on 5 December 2011, and work resumed 6 December 2011. The following funding requirements\/justifications reflect the impact of the 100 day delay caused by the protest. This delay also means that full contract baselines were not available for use in preparing these justifications. Accordingly, these funding requirements are largely based on program office estimates. \n\t\t\nThe Army requires an Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) capability to rapidly deploy an overmatching infantry squad anywhere on the battlefield.  The GCV IFV will provide the infantry squad with a highly mobile, protected, transport to the decisive locations on the battlefield. The GCV IFV will provide both destructive fires against threat armored vehicles and direct fire support for the squad during dismounted assaults. It will increase the Infantry's tactical mobility, survivability, and lethality against light and heavy armored threats across a variety of missions. \n\t\nThe GCV program is using an incremental approach with the GCV IFV as the first increment (future increments have not yet been defined). The GCV IFV program will utilize competitive development and a 3-phased approach that started with MS A in 4QFY2011.  Due to the aforementioned protest, the 24 month Technology Development phase (with 2 competing contractors) began 6 December 2011. Following Milestone B currently planned for 1Q2014, the program is planning to award up to two competitively selected 48 month contracts for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. During EMD, each contractor will continue to refine designs and deliver prototypes to support engineering development, risk mitigation, and technical and operational tests. Milestone C is planned for 1QFY2018 and will immediately be followed with award of a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract to one contractor.\n\t\nFor the TD phase, the Army will mature its requirements by using four key program imperatives to shape trade space and to ensure convergence on an affordable and achievable set of requirements: 1) Providing requisite force protection to the Squad and crew in the vehicle, 2) Capable of carrying a full nine-Soldier squad, 3) using a modular, open architecture and sufficient margin to support full spectrum operations and changing threats over time, and 4) deliver the first production vehicle approximately seven years after award of the TD phase contracts. In support of these key requirements as well as affordability targets, the TD phase contracts allow contractors to trade selected capability to support the path to an affordable set of requirements and to reduce program cost and risk. In addition to the effort related to the TD contracts, PM GCV will conduct assessments of selected non-developmental vehicles and will support a dynamic update to the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). This \"three pronged effort\" (TD contracts, vehicle assessments, and dynamic AoA update) will generate data that will ensure a well informed Milestone B. Information generated from the TD phase will inform the requirements generation\/maturation process and will lead to a Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved CDD prior to Milestone B.\n\nDuring the TD phase, the contractors will focus on integration leading to the completion of Preliminary Design Reviews (PDR). In support of the PDRs, each contractor will be required to develop, fabricate, integrate, and test two different subsystem prototypes: Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) Protection Subsystem prototype and Mine Blast Subsystem prototype. Additional subsystem prototypes may be defined by contactors to support development. Prototype subsystem testing will be conducted by the Government.\n\nThe combined fiscal impacts of the protest delay and the selection of only two TD contractors are: 1) larger than planned FY2011 carry-over dollars, and 2) adjustments to funding requirements for FY2012 and beyond. The FY2012 funding was adjusted as"

The first consists of award of development contracts (two TD phase contracts were awarded 18 August 2011). The second prong consists of assessments of selected non-developmental vehicles and the third includes a dynamic update to the Analysis of Alternatives.   For the contracts, the TD phase will consist of designing an Infantry Fighting Vehicle based on requirements defined in the draft Capability Development Document (CDD) and articulated in the Specification included in the GCV Request for Proposal (RFP). Selected sub-system test assets will be delivered in FY2013. The TD phase includes competitive testing and evaluation of the sub-system test assets and completion of a Preliminary Design Review (3Q FY2013). This information, coupled with data obtained from the other two prongs, will be used to define an affordable, effective, and suitable set of requirements that will be embodied in the CDD and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) RFP performance specification. A full and open competition will be held and up to two contractors will enter EMD phase (2Q FY2014).  EMD will end at MS C (2Q FY2018). During EMD, each contractor will successfully complete a Critical Design Review and produce three (3) early prototypes and twelve (12) complete prototypes. The EMD phase will end with a competitive down select to one contractor. The selected contractor will execute Low Rate Initial Production."
