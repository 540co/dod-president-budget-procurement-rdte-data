Program efforts provide advanced cyber warfare capabilities to the 24th Air Force in direct support of US CYBERCOM and other combatant commanders.  Program efforts also directly support the AF Information Operations Capability Plan (IOCP) and the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO).  The program office investigates and selects the highest potential cyber and Information Operations (IO) technologies to meet specific shortfalls, deficiencies, and requirements documented by major commands (MAJCOMs), unified commands, and IO agencies in Mission Area Plans (MAPs) and capabilities documents.  In accordance with AF Policy, the information and cyberspace superiority core capability areas to be considered are influence operations, electronic warfare operations and network warfare operations.  Planned areas of study, prototyping, and technology demonstration will be used to provide warfighters access, platforms, Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO) production (e.g. test and budgets), infrastructure (e.g. mission planning, intelligence, command and control), and tools needed to exploit enemy networks, telephony, Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), electronic warfare operations and Command and Control (C2) systems.  These advancements will be used to develop and deliver cutting edge technologies to the warfighter.  The program office works directly with labs, industry, and warfighters to set priorities and find synergistic combinations of new technology, doctrine and training via multiple Network Warfare Operations Capability (NWOC) contract awards to deliver state of the art cyber and IO applications to the warfighter as well as to engineer key upgrades and modifications to the NAS.  Program funds Cyber C2 efforts to provide development of C2 capabilities across the entire spectrum of air, space, and cyber operations from strategic to tactical level for planning, executing and assessing theater-wide air, space and cyber operations.  Program efforts will be prioritized and guided by the Air Force Space Command Situation Awareness and Command and Control (AFSPC SA&C2) and Cyber Warfare Capability Teams in support of the AF IOCP and other applicable requirements documents.  Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging cyber technologies into all regions of the Global Information Grid.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  Program activities are protected under AF Network Warfare Special Access Program(s).  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The program office investigates and selects the highest potential cyber and Information Operations (IO) technologies to meet specific shortfalls, deficiencies, and requirements documented by major commands (MAJCOMs), unified commands, and IO agencies in Mission Area Plans (MAPs) and capabilities documents.  In accordance with AF Policy, the information and cyberspace superiority core capability areas to be considered are influence operations, electronic warfare operations and network warfare operations.  Planned areas of study, prototyping, and technology demonstration will be used to provide warfighters access, platforms, Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO) production (e.g. test and budgets), infrastructure (e.g. mission planning, intelligence, command and control), and tools needed to exploit enemy networks, telephony, Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), electronic warfare operations and Command and Control (C2) systems.  These advancements will be used to develop and deliver cutting edge technologies to the warfighter.  The program office works directly with labs, industry, and warfighters to set priorities and find synergistic combinations of new technology, doctrine and training via multiple Network Warfare Operations Capability (NWOC) contract awards to deliver state of the art cyber and IO applications to the warfighter as well as to engineer key upgrades and modifications to the NAS.  Program funds Cyber C2 efforts to provide development of C2 capabilities across the entire spectrum of air, space, and cyber operations from strategic to tactical level for planning, executing and assessing theater-wide air, space and cyber operations.  Program efforts will be prioritized and guided by the Air Force Space Command Situation Awareness and Command and Control (AFSPC SA&C2) and Cyber Warfare Capability Teams in support of the AF IOCP and other applicable requirements documents.  Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging cyber technologies into all regions of the Global Information Grid.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  Program activities are protected under AF Network Warfare Special Access Program(s).  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
