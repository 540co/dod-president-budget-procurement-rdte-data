In addition, this PE provides tactical and strategic aeromedical evacuation systems, automated information systems, and medical treatment equipment to meet unique Air Force medical readiness and operational requirements.  These activities are prerequisites to establishing air superiority.  Development of Agile Combat Support (ACS) systems provides beddown for aircraft, support equipment, and forces at both main operating bases and contingency operating locations, which may have only a runway and a water source.  They also offer crucial utilities, runway stabilization and repair, explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), rescue and recovery aids, aeromedical evacuation and treatment equipment, and security and reconnaissance capabilities to support aircraft deployment, launch, recovery and regeneration.  Lighter-weight, rapidly deployable equipment has become essential in providing the ability to quickly establish operations, security, and base defense in support of numerous global contingencies, including various humanitarian\/relief efforts, and special operations throughout the world.  \n\nThe Agile Combat Support program is in RDT&E Budget Activity 5 - Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) because it supports development, testing and evaluation of materials and equipment for contingency basing, detection and handling of explosive ordnance, tactical shelters, and aeromedical systems."
