            "val": "This program element funds Department of the Army (DA) civilians at the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA) to conduct responsive and effective materiel systems analysis in support of senior Army decision making for equipping the U.S. Army.  AMSAA conducts systems and engineering analyses to support Army decisions in technology; materiel acquisitions; and the design, development, fielding, and sustaining of Army weapon\/materiel systems.  As part of this mission, AMSAA develops and certifies systems performance data used in Army studies, and develops systems performance methodology and Models and Simulations (M&S).  \n\nAMSAA is the Army's center for item\/system level performance analysis and certified data.  In support of its materiel systems analysis mission, AMSAA analyzes the performance and combat effectiveness of conceptual, developmental, and fielded systems.  Unique models and methodologies have been developed to predict critical performance variables, such as weapon accuracy, target acquisition, rate of fire, probability of inflicting catastrophic damage, survivability, mobility and system reliability.  AMSAA generates performance and effectiveness measures and ensures their standard use across major Army and Joint studies.  AMSAA conducts and supports various systems analysis efforts across the entire materiel system life cycle, such as:  Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs); system cost\/performance tradeoffs and early technology trade-offs to inform system and acquisition program risk assessments; weapons\/systems mix analyses; business case analyses and cost benefit analyses; requirements analyses; technology insertion studies; reliability growth studies; Physics of Failure (PoF) analyses; and analytical support for Test and Evaluation.  AMSAA also maintains, pursuant to Army Acquisition Executive direction, the Center for Army Acquisition Lessons Learned.  These analyses are used by the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command; Army Materiel Command; Training and Doctrine Command; Army Test and Evaluation Command; Program Executive Officers\/Project Managers; Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) (both Army Staff and Assistant Secretaries in the HQDA Secretariat); and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD)\/Department of Defense (DoD) Leadership.  AMSAA analyses and data are used by these organizations in making acquisition, procurement, and logistics decisions in order to provide quality equipment and procedures to the Soldier. \n\nAMSAA's M&S capabilities support the development, linkage, and accreditation of live, virtual, and constructive simulations, and provide unique tools that support systems analysis of individual systems and the combined-arms environment.  AMSAA maintains a significant number of models and simulations, most of which were developed in-house to address specific analytical requirements.  This M&S infrastructure provides a hierarchical modeling process that is unique to AMSAA and allows for a comprehensive performance and effectiveness prediction capability that can be utilized to make trade-off and investment decisions prior to extensive and expensive hardware testing of proposed systems\/technologies for Current and Future Force efforts.  AMSAA is the Army's executive agent for the verification, validation, and accreditation of item\/system level performance models.  In this role, AMSAA assists model developers with the development and execution of verification and validation plans to ensure new models and simulations provide credible information\/results for decision making.\n\nAs the Army's Executive Agent for reliability and maintainability standardization improvement, AMSAA develops and implements reliability and maintainability acquisition reform initiatives.  AMSAA develops and applies engineering approaches that assess the reliability of Army materiel and also provides recommendations on ways to improve reliability, thereby reducing the logistics footprint, reducing life cycle costs, and extending failure-free periods for deployed equipment.  AMSAA's electronic and mechanical Physics of Failure (PoF) program pioneered the Army's involvement in utilizing computer-aided engineering tools in the analysis of root-cause failure mechanisms at the component level during the system design process.  AMSAA's reliability engineering and PoF tools\/analyses have been used extensively to support the design improvement of developmental and fielded systems used in Current Operations resulting in improved reliability, reduced Operational and Support costs, and reduced logistics expenditures and footprint.

Initial efforts were performed in support of Irregular Warfare (IW) related tasks, analyses, and model enhancements.  AMSAA conducted initial planning efforts and began the stand-up of an Army Center for Reliability Growth.  Efforts continued to focus on constant enhancements to methodologies and M&S that are the foundation for accurate and timely analytical products and data (which include,  enhancements to power and energy (soldier and vehicle) methodology, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and Counter IED modeling, target acquisition methodology, sensor fusion modeling, mechanical and electronic Physics of Failure (PoF) modeling, vehicle performance methodology, fuel consumption modeling, Active Protection System performance, System of Systems Communications Network Model development, non-lethal weapons performance and effectiveness estimation methodology, and the Infantry Warrior Simulation (IWARS), to include modeling operations in urban terrain)."

AMSAA also, pursuant to Army Acquisition Executive memo dated 8 January 2012, establishes the Center for Army Acquisition Lessons Learned (CAALL).  CAALL is a critical link in addressing requirements from the 2009 Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) as well as the Decker-Wagner study on acquisition reform to conduct acquisition program risk assessments and trade-space analyses between cost, schedule and system performance in order to allow earlier identification, and corrective action, of risks and hazards concerning major Army acquisition efforts.  AMSAA achieves Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of the CAALL by the end of fiscal year 2012.  AMSAA continues to enhance the essential methodologies, tools, and models and simulations to facilitate accurate analytical prodcts."
