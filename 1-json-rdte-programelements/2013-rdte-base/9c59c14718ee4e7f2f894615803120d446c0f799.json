            "val": "This program provides Research, Development, Test & Engineering (RDT&E) funding for the B-1B modernization program. The modernization program addresses potential aircraft obsolescent issues due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and provides new and improved capabilities to the B-1B weapon system that require significant hardware and software development and testing. Vertical Situational Display Upgrade (VSDU) development effort is currently addressing reliability and maintainability issues with the primary flight displays, which are quickly becoming unsupportable due to DMS for repair parts. B-1B improvement efforts include, but are not limited to, the development of the Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL) and Self Contained Standby Attitude Indicator (SCAI).  Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL) will provide Link 16 line of sight (LOS) and Joint Range Extension (JRE) beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) data link capability and supports machine-to-machine transfer of target data to the B-1.  SCAI is the backup to the primary flight instruments and provides indications of attitude, airspeed, mach, altitude and vertical velocity. This development activity will replace the current obsolete legacy SCAI with a more reliable\/supportable off-the-shelf display.  SCAI must be functional and reliable in the event of primary flight display failure, and is a Mission-Essential Subsystem List (MESL) item required for flight. Upgrades to the B-1B training systems are included in the modernization program to keep the training systems current with the aircraft configuration.  In addition, program funds cover engineering\/planning studies, related engineering efforts, program management administrative (PMA) costs and initiatives for future weapon system enhancements, including efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total ownership cost. Previous development activities such as Central Integrated Test System (CITS) upgrade, Radar Reliability and Maintainability Improvement Program (RMIP), Inertial Navigation System (INS) upgrade, and ALQ-161A Preprocessor Avionics Control Unit (PACU) software re-host\/development, have completed development and are now in production. The Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar study has been completed. All B-1B development programs support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases. \nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL) will provide Link 16 line of sight (LOS) and Joint Range Extension (JRE) beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) data link capability and supports machine-to-machine transfer of target data to the B-1.  SCAI is the backup to the primary flight instruments and provides indications of attitude, airspeed, mach, altitude and vertical velocity. This development activity will replace the current obsolete legacy SCAI with a more reliable\/supportable off-the-shelf display.  SCAI must be functional and reliable in the event of primary flight display failure, and is a Mission-Essential Subsystem List (MESL) item required for flight. Upgrades to the B-1B training systems are included in the modernization program to keep the training systems current with the aircraft configuration.  In addition, program funds cover engineering\/planning studies, related engineering efforts, program management administrative (PMA) costs and initiatives for future weapon system enhancements, including efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total ownership cost. Previous development activities such as Central Integrated Test System (CITS) upgrade, Radar Reliability and Maintainability Improvement Program (RMIP), Inertial Navigation System (INS) upgrade, and ALQ-161A Preprocessor Avionics Control Unit (PACU) software re-host\/development, have completed development and are now in production. The Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar study has been completed. All B-1B development programs support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases. \nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
