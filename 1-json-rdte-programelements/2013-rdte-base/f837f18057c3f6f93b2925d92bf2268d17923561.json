            "val": "(U) Intelligence Advanced Development (IAD) demonstrates and validates advanced technologies required to support warfighter needs for timely all-source intelligence information.  IAD research supports global awareness, consistent battlespace knowledge, precision information, and the execution of time-critical missions.  IAD projects provide better on-time information to the warfighter by using new and existing data sources, streamlining data analyses, reducing the required intelligence footprint, and by extending the life of sensors in place as well as enhancing their performance.  The Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site, Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division (AFRL\/RIE) works directly with users, employing a rapid prototyping evolutionary approach, and then integrating finished modules directly into the field.  The programs are oriented towards specific shortfalls and deficiencies as documented by the major commands, combatant commands, and intelligence organizations in their mission and functional area plans.  The goal of this activity is to expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use via rapid prototyping.  This activity is focused on technology insertion to correct Air Force intelligence deficiencies at tactical and operational levels.  The effort bridges the transition of new technologies from Advanced Technology Demonstrations and Integrated Technology Thrust Programs into current\/new systems, and also supports the associated Defense Technology Objectives.  IAD may reallocate existing resources to support out-of-cycle new\/updated warfighter requirements.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."

Capabilities will be developed in an open systems architecture environment allowing for the greatest efficiency in terms of integrating or interfacing with other systems.  There are Air Force, DoD, and Coalition needs to correlate various sources of intelligence information (Communications Intelligence - COMINT, Electronic Intelligence - ELINT, Imagery Intelligence - IMINT and Measurement and Signature Intelligence - MASINT) within seconds\/minutes as opposed to hours\/days with current manual and semi-automated methods.  The project includes development of data correlation and predictive intelligence algorithms as well as target analysis and prioritization, air order of battle update, and tactical analysis techniques.  This computerized approach will speed up the correlation of data from diverse sources of intelligence information, including COMINT, ELINT, IMINT and MASINT; providing faster situational awareness and threat assessment, and replace manual systems with automated capabilities.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment."
