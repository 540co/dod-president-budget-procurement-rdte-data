Evaluated, refined, and supported FY-13 Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) proposals in conjunction with ONR program officers, four Enabling Capability (EC)s were approved for new start: Towed Array Reliability Improvement, ASW Fusion for Remote sensors, Alternate Anti-Surface Warfare Torpedo Homing and Target Discrimination, and Simulation Toolset for Analysis of Mission, Personnel, and Systems. \n\nSA, Commander Naval Surface Forces (SURFOR), provided continuous engagement with ONR, fellow SAs, and Fleet and Systems Command senior leaders in the creation, modification, and promulgation of Total Ownership Cost, Anti-Surface Warfare (ASW) and Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) gaps used as the basis for the development of FNC EC products.\n\nSA, Commander Third Fleet (C3F), led the demonstration planning efforts for an Information Operations Technology Demonstration that was tasked by the CNO.  Also, completed a survey of game changing or disruptive S&T efforts throughout the NRE.  As a result of the survey, developed a Future Capabilities Needs List, which details desired areas of future S&T investment. This IO demonstration will commence again this year to improve on what we learned last year and implement new technologies and tactics. \n\nSA, US Naval Forces Europe\/Africa, (C6F), managed the deployment of the Computer Aided Maritime Threat Evaluation System, a rules based information technology to aid C6F in assessing the risk of commercial shipping within the AOR.
