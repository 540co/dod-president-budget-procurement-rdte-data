DAC funds the test and evaluation of technologies and products with potential to improve performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of current acquisition programs at the subcomponent, component, or system level.\n \nSince the program inception in FY 2003, Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) has initiated 151 projects; 96 projects have been completed to date; 69 met Service or Agency testing requirements and 49 led to procurements with technology currently in use by our warfighters in Iraq, Afghanistan, or at U.S. training facilities.  Given the program tests developed equipment, Service and United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) program managers report that the average Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) and Operations and Support (O&S) non-recurring cost avoidance is at least 5-to-1.\n\nThe DAC program provides the Department an efficiency that is not generally recognized.  With centralized DAC funding in OSD, funding can be readily moved among the Services and USSOCOM to take advantage of emerging opportunities and fund joint projects.\n\nDAC increases opportunities for domestic vendors to enter the DoD acquisition process.  Although business size is not an evaluation criterion, approximately 60 percent of the projects awarded are with technology providers at the small or mid-sized enterprise level.  DAC has the additional DoD\/National Security benefit of expanding the industrial base for Defense acquisition."
