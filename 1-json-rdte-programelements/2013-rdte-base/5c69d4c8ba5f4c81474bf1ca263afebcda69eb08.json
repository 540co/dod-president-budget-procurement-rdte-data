            "val": "The CIA established the Senior Year Program in 1955.  The program has evolved to include the U-2 airframes, engines, sensors, cameras, recorders, data links life support systems, test facilities, and equipment.   The U-2S model airframes were constructed in the late 1980s, with the last aircraft rolling off the assembly line in 1989.  The U-2S provides global reconnaissance signals intelligence (SIGINT) and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) 24 hours a day, seven days a week in support of national and DoD worldwide missions.  The U-2 is currently deployed to forward operating locations (FOL) around the world.  Due to delays in the Global Hawk program, the U-2 has been extended to 2025.\n\nThe Lithium-Ion Battery replacement activity addresses a critical U-2 sustainment issue by developing a replacement for the lead-acid batteries that provide emergency electrical power in the event of an engine\/generator failure during flight.  The lithium-ion battery solution eliminates the need to remove the batteries from the aircraft for recharging\/maintenance and eliminates the need to replace the current battery recharging system at a cost savings of $5M.  The lighter weight lithium-ion batteries will also improve the fuel consumption.\n\nThe U-2 Fuel Conversion activity will certify an additive to the widely available JP8 jet fuel for flight on the U-2 as a replacement for the current Jet Propellant Thermally Stable (JPTS) fuel.  The U-2 has special fuel requirements due to the extreme temperatures it encounters in its operating environment.  The production, special handling, and prepositioning of JPTS results in significant cost increase.  By switching to an additive to the common JP8, the logistical challenges are greatly reduced and the fuel costs are reduced by 50%.\n \nThe U-2 Sump Tank activity develops a composite materials replacement for the existing aluminum sump tank that will reduce the mean time between failure rate for this key component.  Annual cost of replacing the existing aluminum tank is currently $1.8M. \n\nThe U-2 GPS receiver replacement activity addresses a vanishing vendor item\/diminishing material source issue in the FY17 timeframe for this critical navigation component.  Development and testing of a replacement GPS receiver for the U-2 in FY13 is required to ensure continued operations beyond FY17. \n\nActivities also include, but not limited to, studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The U-2S provides global reconnaissance signals intelligence (SIGINT) and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) 24 hours a day, seven days a week in support of national and DoD worldwide missions.  The U-2 is currently deployed to forward operating locations (FOL) around the world.  Due to delays in the Global Hawk program, the U-2 has been extended to 2025.\n\nThe Lithium-Ion Battery replacement activity addresses a critical U-2 sustainment issue by developing a replacement for the lead-acid batteries that provide emergency electrical power in the event of an engine\/generator failure during flight.  The lithium-ion battery solution eliminates the need to remove the batteries from the aircraft for recharging\/maintenance and eliminates the need to replace the current battery recharging system at a cost savings of $5M.  The lighter weight lithium-ion batteries will also improve the fuel consumption.\n\nThe U-2 Fuel Conversion activity will certify an additive to the widely available JP8 jet fuel for flight on the U-2 as a replacement for the current Jet Propellant Thermally Stable (JPTS) fuel.  The U-2 has special fuel requirements due to the extreme temperatures it encounters in its operating environment.  The production, special handling, and prepositioning of JPTS results in significant cost increase.  By switching to an additive to the common JP8, the logistical challenges are greatly reduced and the fuel costs are reduced by 50%.\n \nThe U-2 Sump Tank activity develops a composite materials replacement for the existing aluminum sump tank that will reduce the mean time between failure rate for this key component.  Annual cost of replacing the existing aluminum tank is currently $1.8M. \n\nThe U-2 GPS receiver replacement activity addresses a vanishing vendor item\/diminishing material source issue in the FY17 timeframe for this critical navigation component.  Development and testing of a replacement GPS receiver for the U-2 in FY13 is required to ensure continued operations beyond FY17. \n\nActivities also include, but not limited to, studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
