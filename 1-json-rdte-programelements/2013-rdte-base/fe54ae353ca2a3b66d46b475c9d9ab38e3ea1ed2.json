In the FY12 PB submission, the Air Force forecast this funding would move within Project 0305173F to a new project.  However, subsequent to the FY12 PB submission, the Air Force established the current Program Element, 0606392F, for more accurate tracking of the funds."

It consists of (1) the RDT&E Support Complex (RSC) at Kirtland AFB, NM and Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) equipment installed in 1 Space Operations Squadron (1 SOPS) at Schriever AFB, CO which operates R&D satellites; (2) the Space Test Operations organization at Kirtland AFB which is the focal point for small satellite tests, plans, programs, and policy and (3) the deployable test systems, based at Kirtland AFB, NM which deploys mobile antennas worldwide to support space RDT&E activities.    \n\nFY13 funds continue incremental development of the MMSOC.  The main objective of MMSOC is to develop the capability to rapidly support R&D and operational systems and to transition R&D space vehicle technology with residual military utility to operational status for immediate war-fighter support.  MMSOC is a multiple-mission operation system that uses standard software (1) to perform satellite command and control (C2) in support of launch requirements; (2) develop and test tactics, techniques, procedures and concepts to conduct operations for R&D satellites; (3) provide a satellite C2 incremental block evolution resource for RDT&E of new systems and concepts; and (4) deliver operational flexibility for new and currently-flying assigned satellites.  MMSOC leverages demonstrated RDT&E experience to expand the capabilities of proven technologies currently in use in Air Force Space Development and Test Directorate facilities.  MMSOC also supports all RDSMO-sustained space vehicles through existing resources.    \n\nThe RDT&E effort also includes the development of a mobile test system, known as the Remote Tracking Station Block Change Transportable Space Test Resource (RBC TSTR), used to verify satellite compatibility with the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) Remote Block Change architecture, currently being fielded worldwide.  The system will be capable of being deployed around the world to perform compatibility testing in the factory as well as launch ranges to include Kodiak, AK, Wallops Island, VA, and Kwajalein Atoll where there is no other existing or planned capability.  \n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, and it supports research and development of space systems."

In the FY12 PB submission, the Air Force forecast this funding would move within Project 0305173F to a new project.  However, subsequent to the FY12 PB submission, the Air Force established the current Program Element, 0606392F, for more accurate tracking of the funds."

It consists of (1) the RDT&E Support Complex (RSC) at Kirtland AFB, NM and Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) equipment installed in 1 Space Operations Squadron (1 SOPS) at Schriever AFB, CO which operates R&D satellites; (2) the Space Test Operations organization at Kirtland AFB which is the focal point for small satellite tests, plans, programs, and policy and (3) the deployable test systems, based at Kirtland AFB, NM which deploys mobile antennas worldwide to support space RDT&E activities.    \n\nFY13 funds continue incremental development of the MMSOC.  The main objective of MMSOC is to develop the capability to rapidly support R&D and operational systems and to transition R&D space vehicle technology with residual military utility to operational status for immediate war-fighter support.  MMSOC is a multiple-mission operation system that uses standard software (1) to perform satellite command and control (C2) in support of launch requirements; (2) develop and test tactics, techniques, procedures and concepts to conduct operations for R&D satellites; (3) provide a satellite C2 incremental block evolution resource for RDT&E of new systems and concepts; and (4) deliver operational flexibility for new and currently-flying assigned satellites.  MMSOC leverages demonstrated RDT&E experience to expand the capabilities of proven technologies currently in use in Air Force Space Development and Test Directorate facilities.  MMSOC also supports all RDSMO-sustained space vehicles through existing resources.    \n\nThe RDT&E effort also includes the development of a mobile test system, known as the Remote Tracking Station Block Change Transportable Space Test Resource (RBC TSTR), used to verify satellite compatibility with the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) Remote Block Change architecture, currently being fielded worldwide.  The system will be capable of being deployed around the world to perform compatibility testing in the factory as well as launch ranges to include Kodiak, AK, Wallops Island, VA, and Kwajalein Atoll where there is no other existing or planned capability.  \n\nThis effort is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, and it supports research and development of space systems."
