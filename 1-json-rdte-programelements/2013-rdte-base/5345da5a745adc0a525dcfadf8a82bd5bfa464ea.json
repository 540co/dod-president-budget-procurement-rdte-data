The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technologies for possible future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS) needs. Dual-use means that the technologies will also be judged on their potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new MDA BMDS technologies, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products. MDA will conduct the competition and will award and manage the contracts. \n\nThe Missile Defense Agency`s SBIR\/STTR investments are divided into 13 Research Areas from 6 MDA Elements:\nAegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD): A hybrid program office (MDA\/Navy) that builds BMD Capability for use in multi-mission ships and in Aegis Ashore.\nCommand, Control, Communication, Computer Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR): Defines, develops and deploys an integrated Sensor and Command and Control (C2) capability for Missile Defense\nEngineering: Defines the current and future BMDS: leads and is responsible for its technical design and development, and supports its integration and assessment.\nProgram and Integration: Supervises the Acquisition Category ID ACAT 1D Ballistic Missile Defense System Program portfolio including element design, development, system integration, and test.\nTest: Characterizes ballistic missile defense capabilities and supports fielding of an integrated and effective capability to the Warfighter.\nAdvanced Technology: Develops cost and operationally effective capabilities; explores and develops technology to counter future threats. \n\nSmall Business Innovation Research (SBIR) topic areas for FY 2011 included: \n\n-Methodologies for Accurate Scene Generation of Target Characteristics as Seen by an Airborne Platform through Dynamic Atmospheric Conditions \n-Methodologies for Accurate Scene Generation of Complex Target Plume Characteristics \n-Methodologies for Developing Extremely Large IR Scene Projectors \n-Methodologies for a Partial Frame Correlation of Multiple Sensors \n-Smart Infrared Focal Plane Arrays and Advanced Electronics \n-Acquisition, Tracking and Pointing Technologies \n-Development of line-narrowed diode pumps sources for DPAL systems \n-Development of optical quality thin-film coatings for DPAL windows \n-Innovative Signature Exploitation for Long Range Object Discrimination \n-Sensor Resource Management \n-Guidance, Navigation and Control Algorithms and Hardware for Advanced Interceptors \n-Light Weight Divert and Attitude Control Systems for Missile Defense Interceptors \n-Long-Term Missile Aging Reliability Prediction for Advanced Platforms \n-Anti-Tamper Technology for Missile Defense \n-Develop and Demonstrate High Performance Infrared Focal Plane Arrays with Advanced Quantum Structures \n-Composite Structures for lightweight missile components \n-Hot gas components for lightweight missile components \n-Sensor & Mitigation Technologies for Liquid Hypergolic Propulsion Systems \n-Advanced Power Storage Systems for Interceptors \n-Innovative Propulsion Technology for Missile Defense Interceptors \n-Characterization and Incorporation of Vernier Engines within the Plume Modeling Process \n-Advanced Particle Treatment in Modeling Rocket Exhaust Plumes \n-Intelligent Adaptive Needs Characterization for M&S Systems Engineering \n-Improved Techniques for Optimistic Modeling \n-Star Background Model \n-Automatic Test and Analysis (ATA) Tool \n-Mitigation of the effects of the ionosphere on Upgraded Early Warning Radars \n-Innovative Solid State Power Supply-Modulator for High Power Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier \n-Methodologies for Accurate Assessment of Target Characteristics \n-Telemetry Impact Reduction for Target Objects \n-Passive Techniques for Flight Reconstruction Data \n-Techniques for Anchoring Debris Models"

The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technologies for possible future Missile Defense Agency Ballistic Missile Defense System needs. Dual-use means that the technologies will also be judged on their potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new MDA BMDS technologies, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products. MDA will conduct the competition and will award and manage the contracts. \n\nThe Missile Defense Agency`s SBIR\/STTR investments are divided into 13 Research Areas from 6 MDA Elements:\nAegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD): A hybrid program office (MDA\/Navy) that builds BMD Capability for use in multi-mission ships and in Aegis Ashore.\nCommand, Control, Communication, Computer Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR): Defines, develops and deploys an integrated Sensor and Command and Control (C2) capability for Missile Defense\nEngineering: Defines the current and future Ballistic Missile Defense System: leads and is responsible for its technical design and development, and supports its integration and assessment.\nProgram and Integration: Supervises the Acquisition Category ID ACAT 1D Ballistic Missile Defense System Program portfolio including element design, development, system integration, and test.\nTest: Characterizes ballistic missile defense capabilities and supports fielding of an integrated and effective capability to the Warfighter.\nAdvanced Technology: Develops cost and operationally effective capabilities; explores and develops technology to counter future threats. The SBIR Research Areas for FY 2012 include Test Instrumentation, Aegis, Command Control Battle Management Communication (C2BMC), Radar, Infrared, Tamper, Standard Missile-3 Block IIB, Directed Energy, and Quality, Safety and Mission Assurance."
