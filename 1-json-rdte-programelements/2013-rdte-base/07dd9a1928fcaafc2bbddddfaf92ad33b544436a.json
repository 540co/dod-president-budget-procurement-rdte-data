Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, and future program planning.  USCYBERCOM will also provide the ability for other COCOMs to conduct CNO OCO\/DCO planning.\n  \nUSCYBERCOM supports research and development OCO\/DCO capabilities based upon COCOM and USCYBERCOM operational requirements to include supporting and conducting quick reaction development of OCO\/DCO capabilities in support of OCO\/DCO operations required.  An in-house development team (Special Projects Vulnerability Assessment Team) will perform research, small scale prototyping and integration as required to support the mission.   The Special Projects Vulnerability Assessment Team provides for electric transmission and analytical support to exploitable vulnerabilities.  Additionally, this team will re-tool existing OCO\/DCO capabilities to satisfy immediate USCYBERCOM operational needs. \n\nUSCYBERCOM accomplishes a large portion of its mission via systems engineering, testing and development across the primary functions of prototyping and deployment for current operations, technical assurance, risk assessments, requirements management, capability development and gap analysis.  USCYBERCOM coordinates capability research and development in order to achieve global military objectives.    The technical assurance provides \u201cassurance-in-depth\u201d products and services enabling COCOMs to confidently, legally, safely and securely apply CNO capabilities as one of the elements of national power.  Further detail is classified and can be provided upon request.\n\nUSCYBERCOM provides support for US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and other geographic and functional COCOM exercises, war games, and experimentation requirements.   USCYBERCOM supports the Information Operations (IO) community by providing a cadre of experts on CNO technology and renders technical assistance in the development, review and coordination of CNO plans and operations.  \n\nUSCYBERCOM integrates and synchronizes its effort with the USSTRATCOM development of CNO military utility assessments, research and development efforts, and advocacy of capability needs for the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System (JCIDS) process.  USCYBERCOM specifically is responsible for advocating on behalf of the COCOMs for capability development.  It is also responsible for partnering with the development community to seek resource advocacy from USSTRATCOM, and fund capability development with service sponsorship and coordination.\n \nAdditionally, USCYBERCOM focuses capability developer\u2019s efforts on addressing COCOM requirements, fosters collaboration and partnership to service components and supports research and development of OCO\/DCO capabilities for conducting operational planning activities.  These efforts include support for initial development, enhancement, testing and fielding support of COCOM or Service capabilities. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, and future program planning.  USCYBERCOM will also provide the ability for other COCOMs to conduct CNO OCO\/DCO planning.\n  \nUSCYBERCOM supports research and development OCO\/DCO capabilities based upon COCOM and USCYBERCOM operational requirements to include supporting and conducting quick reaction development of OCO\/DCO capabilities in support of OCO\/DCO operations required.  An in-house development team (Special Projects Vulnerability Assessment Team) will perform research, small scale prototyping and integration as required to support the mission.   The Special Projects Vulnerability Assessment Team provides for electric transmission and analytical support to exploitable vulnerabilities.  Additionally, this team will re-tool existing OCO\/DCO capabilities to satisfy immediate USCYBERCOM operational needs. \n\nUSCYBERCOM accomplishes a large portion of its mission via systems engineering, testing and development across the primary functions of prototyping and deployment for current operations, technical assurance, risk assessments, requirements management, capability development and gap analysis.  USCYBERCOM coordinates capability research and development in order to achieve global military objectives.    The technical assurance provides \u201cassurance-in-depth\u201d products and services enabling COCOMs to confidently, legally, safely and securely apply CNO capabilities as one of the elements of national power.  Further detail is classified and can be provided upon request.\n\nUSCYBERCOM provides support for US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and other geographic and functional COCOM exercises, war games, and experimentation requirements.   USCYBERCOM supports the Information Operations (IO) community by providing a cadre of experts on CNO technology and renders technical assistance in the development, review and coordination of CNO plans and operations.  \n\nUSCYBERCOM integrates and synchronizes its effort with the USSTRATCOM development of CNO military utility assessments, research and development efforts, and advocacy of capability needs for the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System (JCIDS) process.  USCYBERCOM specifically is responsible for advocating on behalf of the COCOMs for capability development.  It is also responsible for partnering with the development community to seek resource advocacy from USSTRATCOM, and fund capability development with service sponsorship and coordination.\n \nAdditionally, USCYBERCOM focuses capability developer\u2019s efforts on addressing COCOM requirements, fosters collaboration and partnership to service components and supports research and development of OCO\/DCO capabilities for conducting operational planning activities.  These efforts include support for initial development, enhancement, testing and fielding support of COCOM or Service capabilities. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
