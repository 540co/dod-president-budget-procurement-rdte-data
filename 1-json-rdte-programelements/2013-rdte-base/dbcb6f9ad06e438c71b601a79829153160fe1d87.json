The CISA program develops and maintains the Global Information Grid Enterprise Architecture, the Department\u2019s enterprise architecture as directed by Title 40. It supports the development of the framework, processes, and standards for developing and maintaining a DoD federated enterprise architecture. CISA is the leading developer for the net-centric reference model, the standard evaluation guide used by DoD Program Managers at all echelons of command for transitioning DoD programs to the net-centric environment.  The CISA program supports the development of architectural standard tools and systems, including the DoD Architectural Framework manual and artifacts as well as facilitating the effective use of architectures in IT portfolio management. Develop and maintain key GIG policy and guidance documents that drive the acquisition, transition to and operation of a net-centric GIG; the implementation of policy\/guidance through a set of critical supporting activities such as IT standards management, and DoD transition to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6); Real Time Service and IP convergence and enforcing policy through key enterprise governance mechanisms.

It serves as the Department\u2019s primary catalog of architecture data holdings and provides users the ability to register holdings metadata and search, retrieve, and use DoD architecture data in federated architecture data repositories across DoD.  DARS provides a key component of the Department\u2019s net-centric data management capability by federating enterprise architecture data across the Department.  It enables alignment of program architecture components with the Federal Enterprise Architecture Business Reference Model - consistent with OMB directives for exhibit 300s - via the DoD Business Reference Model.  DARS implements a federated search capability and metadata catalog that will interoperate with the Department\u2019s Net-Centric Enterprise Discovery Service and enterprise content metadata catalog.  Architecture metadata is searchable using the DARS federated discovery web service.  The discovery search results provide links to architecture data that is retrievable based on user roles and access permissions.  Implementations are accessible on both the NIPRNET (unclassified) and SIPRNET (Collateral Classified).  Key features of the DARS program focus on: (1) Making architecture data visible, accessible, trusted, understandable, and interoperable (2) enabling reuse of validated architecture data to build \u201ccomposite\u201d integrated architectures; (3) enabling architecture analysis; and, (4) integrating architecture data into the DoD mainstream decision-making processes.  The Department of the Air Force, Army, and Navy CIO\u2019s are collaborating in the development of DARS federation web services via the Federated Joint Architecture Working Group under the auspices of the DoD Enterprise Architecture Summit to ensure DoD-wide access to and usability of all components of the composite DoD enterprise architecture model."

The NMO serves as the single point of contact within the Department for policy, long-range plans, programs and budget, integrated mission advocacy, and management of decision-maker capabilities.  NMO\u2019s objective is to ensure capabilities are in place to provide complete and timely situational awareness and decision tools for senior decision-makers.  Additionally, the NMO assists the ASD NII\/DoD CIO as the Executive Agent and primary OSD advocate for the White House Military Office (WHMO) with oversight of a wide range of DoD command and control and communications (C3) assets and oversees the efforts of the Services and Agencies in the design, integration, and deployment of critical and sensitive C3 capabilities.  Three overall areas of focus include: 1) National Senior Leader C3 Systems, Emergency Preparedness, DoD support to Civil Authorities; Continuity of Government (COG); 2) Global Nuclear C2, Integrated Missile Defense, Tactical Warning, Global Strike; and 3) Cyber Mission Indications and Warnings."
