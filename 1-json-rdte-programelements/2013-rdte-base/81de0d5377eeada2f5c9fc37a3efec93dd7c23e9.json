CP Future the Capability Package (CP) which included; defining what was affordable and defining what could be realistically accomplished within the Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) window. They conducted requirements traces across the NIE portfolio by conducting current requirements analysis, identifying gaps and overlaps, and identifying solution sets. They conducted Network Analysis for NIE by completing initial and high level fidelity reviews. In support of the NIE; they conducted sources sought procedures, completed evaluations of submissions, planned vignettes, completed architecture analysis, developed and published which systems will participate in NIE 11.1 and 11.2 as either a System Under Test (SUT) or a System Under Evaluation (SUE) and defined what the Tech Base capabilities will be. They developed and manage an tier 1 Integrated Master Schedule (IMS). \nCP Current conducted current operations with government and contract personnel in order to execute the plans developed by CP Future for NIE11.1 and 11.2. Conducted daily operations and the execution of the plans by; maintaining a daily battle rhythm, synchronized calendar, conducting operational meetings, developing and submitting reports, tracking and maintaining accountability of all assets and the operational scheduling of assets and personnel. They developed the brigade level architecture from the top level plan provided by CP Future which included; the development of detailed network designs for the Systems Under Test (SUTs) and Systems Under Evaluation (SUEs) which were assigned to the maneuver brigades during the NIE 11.1 and 11.2, conducted detailed planning and development of the architecture and vignettes, and information assurance. They established metrics and measurement requirements across the SUTs\/SUEs, and identified and implemented tools, data points and data collection measures for both of the NIEs. They conducted test planning and management which included, conducting coordination of requirements with Army Evaluation Command (AEC), Operational Test Center (OTC), and Developmental Test Command (DTC). This coordination included; the development and procurement of modeling and simulation tools, instrumentation for data collection, facilities required to store and maintain equipment, facilities required to integrate capabilities, other test equipment, for REDFORCE systems."
