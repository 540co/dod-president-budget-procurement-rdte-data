            "val": "Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) is the Department of Defense (DoD) family of interoperable, modular, software-defined radios that will form the foundation of radio frequency information transmission for Joint Vision 2020. Joint Tactical Radio Systems (JTRS) will link the power of the Global Information Grid (GIG) to the warfighter in applying fire effects and achieving overall battlefield superiority. By developing and implementing an open architecture of cutting-edge radio waveform technology, multiple radio types (e.g., handheld, ground-mobile, airborne, maritime, etc.) are now capable of communicating with one another.   JTRS radios are intended to interoperate with existing radio systems and improve joint warfighting through a series of new, joint networking waveforms enabling communication via voice, data, and video over mobile, ad-hoc, internet protocol (IP) based networks.  Each radio will operate as a node in the network to ensure secure wireless communication and networking services for airborne, mobile and fixed forces. These goals extend to U.S. allies, joint and coalition partners, and, in time, disaster response personnel. JTRS will make the Air Force more effective in Joint warfighting through a series of new, joint networking waveforms.  These waveforms included the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), which provides next generation SATCOM beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) communications, as well as the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), which provide interoperability with Army ground forces from the brigade level down to the dismounted soldier.  Together these waveforms enable Joint Close Air Support (JCAS), Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), and other Joint missions.  The JTRS program is built around an open Software Communications Architecture (SCA), allowing common software waveform applications to be implemented across the family of radios to provide joint-service, allied, and coalition interoperability. The Enterprise Business Model, incorporating a common set of shared open system standards, promotes competition and reduces procurement costs for the DoD.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year"

                            "val": "The TACP-Modernization (TACP-M) program is developing new equipment to give TACPs the capability to detect targets and compute precise target coordinates for employment of GPS aided weapons, reduce the potential for fratricide, and reduce the potential for collateral damage in civilian-occupied areas.  This new equipment shortens the kill chain by reducing the time required to submit air support requests, provide target information to aircraft, and ensure pilots are tracking the correct target.  By reducing the time required to execute close air support missions in \"troops-in-contact\" situations, the TACP-M program helps reduce the number of U.S. and coalition casualties due to enemy action.  TACPs deploy with Army maneuver units and provide a Command and Control (C2) link for Close Air Support (CAS), airlift and AF surveillance\/reconnaissance missions.  TACPs are equipped with various targeting and communications equipment needed to interface with ground maneuver forces, aircraft conducting CAS operations, other joint fires assets, aerospace C2 aircraft\/agencies, and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms\/agencies.  The TACP-M program provides TACP, Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs), and Tactical Operations Center (TOCs) personnel with the capability to precisely locate and target enemy ground forces by integrating various Laser Targeting Devices (LTD) and ultra high frequency satellite communications (UHF SATCOM) for beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) Air Force Air Request Net operations.  \n\nThe purpose of the TACP-M program is to reduce reliance on voice transmission and replace analog equipment with the latest digital, data link and streaming video (e.g. Streaming Video Receiver) technology.  Upgraded digital communications enable machine-to- machine interface between TACPs and Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft, Army units and other TACP units.  Machine-to-machine communication provides reliable, high speed digital communications, ultimately supports joint and multinational interoperability, improves battlefield Situational Awareness (SA), increases targeting accuracy, reduces kill chain decision time, improves data flows\/information exchange,and reduces potential fratricide and collateral damage in civilian occupied areas.  The TACP-M program supports the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and significantly increased the mission effectiveness of the TACPs and ASOCs during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New Dawn. The TACP-M program continues to be instrumental in providing ground communications for TACPs during federal emergency relief operations and Homeland Defense initiatives. \n\nTACP-M is divided into three segments:  dismounted, mounted, and software.  The TACP provides modernized, modular, re-locatable and man portable capabilities via streamlined acquisition using non-developmental, off-the-shelf (OTS) Manpack Radios (MPR) or Handheld Radios (HHR), laser targeting devices (LTDs) (including Laser Range Finder (LRFs), Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS) laser designators and imagers, tactical computers, and ancillary equipment combined with Close Air Support System (CASS) software for dismounted, ASOC, and TOC use. \n\nThe TACP mounted segment upgrades TACP communications systems with Software Communication Architecture (SCA)-certified,available software programmable radios, legacy radios, and ancillary components. These systems provide reliable communications for CAS and other air support operations.  TACP-M will integrate Internet Protocol (IP)-capable, SCA radios for voice & data UHF SATCOM and LOS UHF \/VHF communications.  \n\nTACP-M funds will continue to develop systems integration software for dismounted and mounted air\/ground platforms (e.g. JETS (Target Effects Coordination System [TECS]), Small Diameter Bomb II (SDBII), F-35, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle, Gateway Lite, and ASOC Gateway) and will provide interoperability data links such as Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Link-16 and other transformational communications capabilities.\n\nThe mounted capabilities used in overseas contingency operations also require new digital communications\/network enabled capabilities integrated in armored vehicle platforms such as the High Mobility, Multi-Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV), Stryker, and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP). The Air Force has requested acceleration of a vehicle communications capability into TACP Stryker Light Armored Vehicles (LAV), and other tactical vehicles.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development these budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticpate production funding in current or subsequent fiscal year."

Joint Tactical Radio Systems (JTRS) will link the power of the Global Information Grid (GIG) to the warfighter in applying fire effects and achieving overall battlefield superiority. By developing and implementing an open architecture of cutting-edge radio waveform technology, multiple radio types (e.g., handheld, ground-mobile, airborne, maritime, etc.) are now capable of communicating with one another.   JTRS radios are intended to interoperate with existing radio systems and improve Joint warfighting through a series of new, joint networking waveforms enabling communication via voice, data, and video over mobile, ad-hoc, internet protocol (IP) based networks.  Each radio will operate as a node in the network to ensure secure wireless communication and networking services for airborne, mobile and fixed forces. These goals extend to U.S. allies, joint and coalition partners, and, in time, disaster response personnel.  JTRS will make the Air Force more effective in Joint warfighting through a series of new, joint networking waveforms.  These waveforms included the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), which provides next generation SATCOM beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS)communications, as well as the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and the Soldier Radio Waveform(SRW) which provide interoperability with Army ground forces from the brigade level down to the dismounted soldier.  Together these waveforms enable Joint Close Air Support (JCAS), Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) and other Joint missions.  The JTRS program is built around an open Software Communications Architecture (SCA), allowing common software waveform applications to be implemented across the family of radios to provide joint-service, allied, and coalition interoperability. The Enterprise Business Model, incorporating a common set of shared open system standards, promotes competition and reduces procurement costs for the DoD."

The JPEO is funded jointly by the Services in PE 0604280N.\n\nAir Force JTRS Program Office will perform system engineering integration, to deliver an interoperable, fully synchronized, deployable JTRS system under various contract awards. The program office will lead the development of common integration hardware and sofware that can be used across multiple Air Force platforms.  The AF JTRS program office will also work with the JPEO, industry, and the platform program offices to develop integration solutions specific to each platform.  This effort will assist various AF platform users in acquiring and integrating the next generation communications system, to include all key documentation (CONOPS, TTPs, ICDs, TRDs, etc.)"
