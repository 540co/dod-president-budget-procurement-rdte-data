The key aspects of this PE are divided into four areas: (1) SwampWorks develops and demonstrates newly invented or recently discovered technologies that address emergent and enduring operational problems in an accelerated timeframe; (2) Naval Warfare Experimentation develops prototypes of recent technology breakthroughs and provides them to the warfighter for experimentation during FBEs, LOEs or Sea Trials; (3) Tech Solutions develops rapid response science and technology prototypes addressing Fleet\/Force needs identified by Sailors and Marines at the deckplate level; and (4) Operations Analysis provides the Navy and Marine Corps the means to identify capability needs that can be addressed with science and technology solutions, and (5) Manufacturing Technology Science and Technology (S&T) to accelerate recently discovered manufacturing technologies to reduce the acquisition and ownership costs of current and future platforms.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

Some of these technologies may end up in the hands of the warfighter for experimentation, or may culminate in a significant exercise that demonstrates capability then transitions into the Acquisition Program of Record (POR). Examples of recent successes are DDG-51 energy storage, transportable electronic warfare module, high temperature superconducting degaussing, submarine electric actuator, and structural acoustics detection and classification.  Examples of current efforts include energy storage and reduced energy consumption technologies, robotic damage control; carbon nanotube, effective active acoustics simulation, power and energy for unmanned vehicles, and technology investigation studies.\n\nThe increase in funding in FY 2011 is due to an increased emphasis in developing and demonstrating technologies that address emergent and enduring operational problems in an accelerated timeframe. Among the efforts pursued during FY 2011 are advanced development of DC power components and systems for shipboard applications; development of advanced unmanned systems; development of advanced technologies for the new generation of DDG-51; increased emphasis on electronic warfare, reduction of Total Ownership Costs (TOC), and autonomy capabilities; and rapid development of advanced technologies that directly support Navy priorities due to shifting theatres of operation.\n\nThe funding level decreases from FY 2011 to FY 2012 are the result of POM-12 refresh of ONR Leap Ahead portfolio as approved by DON S&T Corporate Board.  This reduces the program's capability to engage in planned high risk technology development for direct warfighter support."

The performance of the work funded in this PE is reviewed at several levels to ensure that the investment is relevant and productive.  At the macroscopic level, the investment is coordinated with Navy Warfare Development Command and Commander, Fleet Forces Command to address the goals and objectives identified for Sea Trials and LOEs.  At the microscopic level, the work funded in this PE is reviewed periodically by the Program Manager to ensure the investment is meeting the goals defined for each project. This review includes feedback collected from the warfighter community on all Sea Trials and LOEs to support the Program Manager's assessment of the value and relevance of each investment. Furthermore, the entire program is reviewed yearly by the Chief of Naval Research."
