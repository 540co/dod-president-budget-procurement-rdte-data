Basic Research sustains scientific and engineering communities in areas that form critical technical underpinning of DoD capabilities.  Basic Research through exploration and discovery provides unique means for disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military strategy and operations.   \n\nThe Minerva Research Initiative is a university-based social science basic research program initiated in FY 2008 and managed within the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  Minerva seeks to build deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political forces that shape regions of the world of strategic importance to the U.S.  This will support more effective strategic decisions, operational policies and force deployments.\n\nThe Basic Research Strategic Support program funds initiatives to implement the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering strategic plan for defense basic research.  This plan defines specific and quantifiable actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of creating high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for DoD.  These initiatives support the five aims of providing scientific leadership, attracting the Nation\u2019s best scientists and engineers, ensuring the coherence and balance of the basic research portfolio, fostering connections between DoD performers and DoD, and improving the efficiency of the defense research business environment."
