The GCSS-Army approved Joint Capability Description Document (CDD) requires an enterprise approach to replace current logistics and maintenance Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS). GCSS-Army will provide the Army's Sustainment Support (CS\/CSS) warfighter with a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible and secure information management that gives combat forces a decisive edge. AESIP will provide the system's enterprise hub services, centralized master data management and cross-functional business intelligence\/analytics.

GCSS-Army will modernize automated logistics by implementing best business practices to streamline supply operations, maintenance operations, property accountability, and tactical logistics and financial management and integration procedures in support of the Future Force transition path of the Army Campaign Plan.  This effort will implement a comprehensive logistics automation solution for the field (deployable) and installation level Army and provide the Commander on the battlefield with an integrated, interoperable view of the battle-space in time to support decisions that will affect the outcome of combat operations.  Further, it will allow the Army to meet statutory requirements for auditability.  This solution implements Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) products from SAP AG.  This will also allow the Army to retire multiple custom designed stand-alone business software baselines optimized to existing Army business processes and replace them with a single integrated business software baseline that has been optimized to industry defined best business practices.  GCSS-Army is a key component of the Federated ERP Integration solution that will optimize tactical logistics and finance domain business processes into a single federated approach.  It will eliminate the need for extensive maintenance and modification of aging, diverse software systems resulting in improved and efficient change control and configuration management through implementation of an enterprise system."

The system will be developed in multiple releases as functional capabilities are defined and as integration and synchronization opportunities with related systems present opportunities for subsequent releases.  Release 1.2 will be a viable stand alone capability that will not require subsequent releases to be operational.  \n\nGCSS-Army is being implemented in three releases to ensure program success. \n\nRelease 1.0 replaces: Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS) at one Direct Support Unit (DSU) in the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR), Fort Irwin, California. An Operational Assessment (OA) was conducted on Release 1.0 and information is gathered through Continuous Evaluation. \n\nRelease 1.1 includes: Supply (Tactical and Installation Warehouse and Materiel Management); Field-level Maintenance; Property Accountability (Property Book, Unit Level Supply, and Unit Basic Load Ammunition); Force Element and Defense Forces Public Security (Allows Task Organization of Personnel, Equipment and Associated Property Accountability, Maintenance and Finance Actions); Store and Forward capability; Interoperability with STAMIS systems; Tactical and Installation Finance (Cost Management, Funds Distribution and Execution, Fund Status Reporting, and General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) Data Synchronization); Hub services; and Enterprise Master Data Management. Release 1.1 provides over 80% of the required GCSS-Army capability; it subsumes Release 1.0 and replaces the SARSS, Property Book Unit Supply Enhanced (PBUSE), Standard Army Maintenance System - Enhanced (SAMS-E) and Standard Army Maintenance System Installation Enhanced (SAMS-IE) legacy systems. \n\nRelease 1.2 provides enhanced capabilities such as disconnected operations,increased financial capabilities, expanded enterprise master data management, installation based maintenance and is prepared to receive a bolt-on aviation maintenance system. Rel 1.2 does not by itself replace any additional Systems. Rel 1.2 represents the complete\nbaseline with all required capabilities provided."

The Army has successfully addressed concerns about the lack of integration of ERPs by leveraging AESIP core capabilities and expanding those benefits across the Army enterprise. AESIP will be an Army specific commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) web portal implementation via the NetWeaver Platform from developer Systems Applications and Products (SAP) American Group to support Army process scenarios and requirements that will provide core competencies:\n\nEnterprise Service Bus (Hub Services) - For a Service oriented, Single Point of Entry to connect, mediate, and control the exchange of data.\nEnterprise Business Intelligence\/Business Warehouse - Aggregates data from ERP and non-ERP systems to provide flexible Enterprise level reporting.\nEnterprise Master Data Management - For a single source of authoritative data and improved workflow and business processes. \n\nHence, the AESIP solution establishes a framework for a fully integrated ERP centric environment that will ultimately provide Commanders Total Visibility from Factory to Foxhole thereby ensuring delivery of the right equipment to the right unit at the right time, while reducing backlogs of material on the battlefield."
