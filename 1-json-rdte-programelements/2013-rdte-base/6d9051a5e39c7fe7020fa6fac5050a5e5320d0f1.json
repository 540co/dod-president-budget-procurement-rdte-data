            "val": "The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space based navigation system that fills validated Joint Service requirements for worldwide, accurate, common grid three dimensional positioning\/navigation for military aircraft, ships, and ground personnel. The consistent accuracy, unaffected by location or weather and available in real time, significantly improves effectiveness of reconnaissance, weapons delivery, mine countermeasures and rapid deployment for all services.\n\nThe system is composed of three segments: user equipment (funded upder PE 0305164F), space (funded under this PE and PE 0305165F) and a control network (funded under PE 0305165F and PE 0603423F). The satellites broadcast high accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals which are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. This equipment computes the platform position and velocity and provides steering vectors to target locations or navigation equipment installed in military platforms. The control segment provides daily updates to the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to maintain system precision in three dimensions to 16 meters spherical error probable worldwide. Additionally, GPS supports the Unites States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) mission and provides strategic and tactical support to the following Department of Defense (DoD) missions: Joint Operations by providing capabilities for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT); Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence; Special Operations; Military Operations in Urban Terrain; Defense-Wide Mission Support; Air Mobility; and Space Launch Orbital Support. \n\nGPS III is the next generation space vehicle to join the GPS constellation.  GPS III space vehicles will deliver significant enhancements, including a new civil (L1C) Galileo-compatible signal, enhanced anti-jam power, and affordable on-ramps to provide full warfighter capabilities (e.g., better signal maintainability (Digital Waveform Generator (DWG), Unified S-Band (USB), near-real time Command and Control) and the civil search and rescue payload (SAR\/GPS). GPS III Satellite Vehicles (SVs) 03 - 08 are in the Production & Deployment Phase.  \n\nRDT&E, AF  PE 0305265F funds for GPS III provides support research, development, test and evaluation of two GPS III space vehicles, SVs 01-02, and risk-reducing simulators through a structured systems engineering approach that matures and delivers space vehicles for launch. The program includes capability maturation and risk reduction efforts (Capability Insertion Program (CIP))to affordably develop follow-on performance parameters including the \"advanced component development and prototype\" engineering and development for full GPS III warfighter capability and \"system development and design\" post-PDR. For example, as a part of reducing the cost to orbit, CIP includes dual launch initiatives to support 2 (two) SV's launching on 1 (one) launch vehicle. Additionally the program includes engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations supporting civil applications that protect U.S. military and allies' use of GPS. SAR\/GPS, previously known as Distress Alerting Satellite System (DASS), is an approved secondary payload on GPS III space vehicles beginning with SV 09. SAR\/GPS will fill a validated National Search and Rescue Committee requirement to provide enduring, space-based distress alerting capability to detect, locate, and relay distress alerts to fulfill its responsibilities under international agreements for Search and Rescue. \n\nThis program is a Budget Activity 7 - Operational System Development because it supports operational systems (GPS)."

The implementation of a US Mid Earth Orbiting Search and Rescue Space Segment is via a Canadian-Provided 406 MHZ SAR repeater on GPS III satellites presents a cost effective opportunity with low risk to provide a SAR system that accommodates existing and planned 406 MHz beacons across the globe. USAF and USCG as the US operators of the civil COSPAS\/SARSAT system, the international search and rescue system, share (50\/50) costs associated with integrating Canadian provided SAR repeater to GPS III beginning with SV 09 in accordance with NSPD-39 which requires civil capabilities hosted on GPS satellites be funded by the appropriate civil agencies. Costs presented represent USAF 50% Share.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7 - Operational Systems Development because it supports operational systems."

GPS III Satellite Vechiles (SV's) 03 - 08 are in the Production & Deployment Phase. \n\nFunds in this project are for GPS III SV's 01 - 08 and will support research, development, test and evaluation of two GPS III space vehicles (01 and 02) and associated simulators through a structured systems engineering approach that matures and delivers space vehicles for launch. The program includes capability maturation and risk reduction efforts (Capability Insertion Program (CIP)) to affordably develop follow-on performance parameters for example as part of reducing the cost to orbit, CIP will include dual launch initiatives to support 2 (two) SV's launching on 1 (one) launch vehicle. Additionally, the program includes engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations supporting civil applications that protect U.S. military and allies' use of GPS. \n\nFunds in this PE for GPS III SV's 09 and beyond include the \"advanced component development and prototype\" engineering and development for full GPS III warfighter capabilities and system development and design post-PDR."
