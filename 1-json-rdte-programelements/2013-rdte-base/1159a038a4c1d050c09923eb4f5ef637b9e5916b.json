The two phased AoA is expected to be completed by April 2011 resulting in program and materiel solution recommendations.  The program Milestone (MS) A decision and entry into the Technology Development (TD) phase is expected in FY12.  The MS A will be followed by release of the FoD Acquisition Requirements Package (ARP) to solicit and competitively awarded TD contracts in FY12.  Two (or more) TD cost-plus type contracts will be awarded to competing teams to develop system (or key system elements) prototypes for demonstrating in a relevant environment and conduct a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) prior to MS B.  A successful PDR, along with an approved Capability Development Document (CDD), and Acquisition Strategy will be the criteria supporting a MS B and entry into Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  The result of EMD will be a baseline system configuration for production. This strategy will require the support of other Military Services and Government agencies."
