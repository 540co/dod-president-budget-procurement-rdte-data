This PE is dedicated to Rapid Acquisition Incentives \u2013 Net Centricity (RAI-NC) which serve DoD by providing RDT&E proof-of-concept early implementation of key initiatives targeted at advancing and moving the Mission Areas of DoD towards Net Centricity.   For example, a coherent and timely transition across DoD Enterprise networks and infrastructure to the next generation of the Internet Protocol, ( IP) IP Version 6 (IPv6), is critical to leveraging the power of information by the business and warfighting mission areas through net-centric operations\/warfare. The PE permits accelerating domain support processes thru rapid proof of concept development and early implementation.  \n\nRAI-NC provides funding for Net Centric initiatives that directly support and facilitate the transformation of the DoD enterprise.   This effort is consistent with the Department\u2019s strategic goals to: enable net-centric operations and warfare, reduce costs; improve efficiency; increase effectiveness by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of process redesign; business systems modernization; strategic sourcing; infrastructure reductions; and optimal-sized inventories.  The objective of RAI-NC is to accelerate DoD\u2019s net centric transformation in support of the warfighter.  Fully achieving net-centricity requires the ubiquity, mobility, security and performance achievable through implementation of the value added features of IPv6.   The DoD IPv6 transition and implementation program has been incorporated into the DoD Unified Capabilities (UC) implementation program.  DoD UC is the integration of voice, video, and\/or data services delivered ubiquitously across an interoperable, secure, and highly available IP network infrastructure, independent of technology, to provide increased mission effectiveness to the warfighter.  DoD UC integrates standards-based communication and collaboration services including, but not limited to:  messaging; voice, video, and Web conferencing; and unified communication and collaboration applications or clients.  These standards-based UC services are integrated with available enterprise applications, both business and warfighting.  As stated earlier, DoD UC includes DoD IPv6 implementation.  The scope of Rapid Acquisition Incentives \u2013 Net Centricity encompasses defense policies, processes, people, technologies and systems that guide, perform or support aspects of warfighter support processes within the Department.  Each RAI-NC initiative provides proof of concept sustainability, as well as the scalability necessary for Domain enterprise wide implementation that will allow end-to- end accessibility to net-centric based decision-making information.  Successful implementation will result in more reliable, accurate and timely net- centric management information upon which managers can make more effective business decisions in a timely manner for the Department.  \n\nRAI-NC enables the acceleration of DoD efforts to implement network centric operational environments while providing a secure, flexible, reliable, affordable, integrated network to achieve high effectiveness in joint and combined operations.  This program employs RDT&E funds to plan, develop, prototype and oversee proof of concept initiatives.  Successful initiatives with supporting business cases demonstrating the achieved goals and outcomes and mission area support will be allowed to enter full deployment.  This program is funded under BA-6, Management Support because it includes studies and analyses in support of R&D efforts."
