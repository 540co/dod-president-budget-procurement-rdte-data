            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE funds applied research efforts in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking, and neutralization.  Technologies being developed within this PE are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking, and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  Related efforts are aimed at leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship, and air ASW assets. Research focused on understanding the impacts on marine mammals of manmade underwater sound is also conducted in the Program Element.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

The submarine target must be detected beyond its weapons release range. The objective is to develop rapidly deployable systems employing automated detection and classification capabilities for use in both shallow and deep water operating environments. Distributed Search supports the ASW protected passage Maritime Shield operational constructs. Related efforts include the development of distributed systems employing optimization as well as active acoustic sensing and processing techniques, navy-unique transduction and underwater networking technology. Efforts also include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing persistent detection concepts and components. These efforts provide an extended reach of organic platform-based systems through the use of new sensor concepts, improved materials for advanced sensors, optimized deployment, employment, and automated operation of distributed sensor fields. The cornerstone of Distributed Search is the development of rapidly deployable, long-endurance active sensors with automated processing suitable for use in a wide variety of operational environments.\n\nFunding increase from FY 2011 to FY 2012 is due to increased emphasis in sonar and acoustic technology efforts.\n\nFunding decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to the realignment of Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) SHD-FY10-02 ASW Command Level Training and SHD-FY10-02 Operator Training to the R-2 Activity SEA SHIELD in PE 0602750N."

The results of these research efforts in conjunction with embedded state-of-the-art command and operator-level training will facilitate the optimum employment of ASW sensor systems, thus increasing their effectiveness and potentially decreasing the number of sensors used to provide coverage in a given area. This work will provide operational commanders with sensor performance predictions which allow them to accurately judge the performance of those sensors, as well as information with which to deploy them for the greatest operational effect. It will also provide information as to how the performance evolves over time due to effects such as the deformation of sensor locations by currents, sound velocity profile changes, geologic magnetic interference changes, or changes to the optical properties of the water, etc. The effort includes performance predictions for fields of sensors as well as individual sensors themselves and applies to both acoustic and nonacoustic sensors.\n\nWork includes development of ASW sensor and system performance models, and realistic simulations and measures of effectiveness that incorporate and exploit critical environmental knowledge. It includes efforts to couple ocean dynamics and acoustics, characterize ambient noise in the littorals, measure and model acoustic and optical propagation and scattering in complex environments, develop algorithms to extract environmental information from through-the-sensor measurements and quantification and prediction of uncertainty. This information is combined with the operating characteristics of particular sensors (or groups of sensors) to provide predictions of sensor performance in the environment at that particular time and in the future. The predictions will also include assessments of the prediction uncertainty due to environmental measurement and sensor performance uncertainties.\n\nThis work aligns principally with the Assure Access and Hold at Risk S&T Focus Area in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan and contributes measurably to the Operational Environments S&T Focus Area strategic objectives.\n\nDecrease in funding from FY 2011 to FY 2012 is due to the phasing down of funding for FNC SHD-FY09-01 (Operation of ASW Active Distributed Systems).\n\nDecrease in funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to the realignment of FNC effort to the R-2 Activity SEA SHIELD in PE 0602750N."

The related technologies support the conduct of covert wide-area surveillance ranging from one day to six months. The objectives are to develop and demonstrate technologies that provide clandestine indications and warnings in far forward and contested operating areas and in complex operational environments against all submarine threats including new threats with unknown target signatures and tactics. Covertness implies use of non-observable platforms and\/or deployed automated sensors employing passive sonar or other non-detectable methods. The surveillance process includes initial detection and classification. Efforts include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing a wide variety of surveillance concepts and components. These efforts focus on alternative detection phenomena, vector\/tensor sensors, automated acoustic processing, more compact and longer lasting power sources, and high bandwidth acoustic communications links.\n\nIncrease in funding from FY 2011 to FY 2012 is due to the initiation of a new Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) for Large Displacement Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (LD-UUV)."
