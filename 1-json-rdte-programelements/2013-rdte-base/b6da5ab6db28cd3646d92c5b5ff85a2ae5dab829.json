            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nActivities and efforts in this program examine concepts and technologies that enable the transformation to network centric warfare. Network centric capabilities rely on information to connect assets and provide timely and accurate understanding of the environment.  The mission area requirements for rapid, accurate decision-making; dynamic, efficient, mission-focused communications and networks; and pervasive and persistent sensing drive network centric S&T investments.  The program focus is investments in the following Enabling Capabilities (ECs):  Combat Identification (ID) Information Management of Coordinated Electronic Surveillance, Automated Control of Large Sensor Networks, OCO Focused Tactical Persistent Surveillance, Globally Netted Joint\/Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander, Dynamic Tactical Communications Networks, Dynamic C2 for Tactical Forces and Maritime Operations Center (MOC), High-bandwidth Free-space Lasercomm, Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance, Pro-Active Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance, Fast Magic, Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Space; Advanced Tactical Data Link; and Autonomous Tactical Persistent Surveillance.  In the context of the Naval Transformation Roadmap construct, this investment will achieve capabilities required by FORCEnet (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Time Sensitive Strike; and Sea Based Information Operations), Sea Strike (Ship-to-Objective Maneuver), and Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense).\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nActivities and efforts in this program examine concepts and technologies that enable the transformation to network centric warfare. Network centric capabilities rely on information to connect assets and provide timely and accurate understanding of the environment.  The mission area requirements for rapid, accurate decision-making; dynamic, efficient, mission-focused communications and networks; and pervasive and persistent sensing drive network centric S&T investments.  The program focus is investments in the following Enabling Capabilities (ECs):  Combat Identification (ID) Information Management of Coordinated Electronic Surveillance, Automated Control of Large Sensor Networks, OCO Focused Tactical Persistent Surveillance, Globally Netted Joint\/Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander, Dynamic Tactical Communications Networks, Dynamic C2 for Tactical Forces and Maritime Operations Center (MOC), High-bandwidth Free-space Lasercomm, Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance, Pro-Active Computer Network Defense and Information Assurance, Fast Magic, Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Space; Advanced Tactical Data Link; and Autonomous Tactical Persistent Surveillance.  In the context of the Naval Transformation Roadmap construct, this investment will achieve capabilities required by FORCEnet (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Time Sensitive Strike; and Sea Based Information Operations), Sea Strike (Ship-to-Objective Maneuver), and Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense)."

These platforms are often size, weight and power (SWaP) limited, and will operate under constraints of cluttered RF spectrum, harsh electro-magnetic interference (EMI) and Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) conditions.  The technical payoff is increased network data rates, interoperability across heterogeneous radios, dynamic bandwidth management, and greater mobile network connectivity.  The operational payoff is that warfighters from the operational command to the tactical edge have near real-time access to information, knowledge and decision-making necessary to perform their tasks, including coalition and allied forces.  Emphasis is on tactical edge communications and networks to fully realize net-centric warfare, bridging the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the 'disadvantaged user', e.g., small-deck combatants, submarines, unmanned vehicles, distributed sensors and ground units in urban and radio frequency (RF) challenged environments.  The current specific objectives are:\n\na) Radios and Apertures: Develop technologies for high band radio, electrically-small and actively scanned antennas, addressing critical issue of radio spectrum bandwidth efficiency, spectrum contention and clutter, agile frequency communications with dynamic spectrum access, all-digital front-end with wide dynamic range, power amplifier efficiency, multipath effects, saltwater propagation and BLOS communications. Develop algorithms and signal processing for space-time-frequency diversity communications, including measures for electronic protection, such as low-intercept antijam waveforms and modulation.  Develop affordable antenna technologies for small size and weight, high radiation efficiency, and wideband operation with rapid beam-steering.  Develop alternatives to RF communications in airborne and terrestrial environments as well as high data rate underwater communications for undersea warfare (distributed sensors netting, unmanned underwater vehicle data exfiltration, submarine Communications at Speed and Depth) using electro-optic\/infra-red (EO\/IR) technologies.  Develop secure, high bandwidth communications systems and the exploitation of existing and emerging network protocols that will avail development of new Low Earth Orbit (LEO) based data transport mechanisms.\n\nb) Tactical Networking and Network Control\/Management: Develop advanced networking techniques for robust, highly dynamic environments; interoperable networks for secure communications and protocols, bandwidth and network management techniques that manage and allocate bandwidth across tactical and theater levels in support of net-centric operations. Develop rapidly auto-configuring and selforganizing networks with efficient and survivable routing, secure authentication, mobility management and Quality-of-Service guarantee while optimizing network resources.  Address low bandwidth, synchronization and reliability for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)\/middleware architecture in both mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) and infrastructure-based Internet Protocol (IP) backbone networks. Develop cognitive network planning and operations engines whose criteria are based directly on mission objectives while self-adapting and managing the spectrum allocation and radio resources in such a way that network operations, SOA community of interest, and computer network defense are integrated to form a single common tactical network picture that requires a minimum of human intervention and skill.  Develop technology for improving tactical edge networking and for improving voice communications.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2011 to FY 2012 is associated with reduced efforts in Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Targeting (ISRT)- Electro-Optic\/Infrared (EO\/IR), EW Attack, and Communication and Networks.  \n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

To achieve this, it must be possible to automate understanding of the battlespace by identifying objects, determining relationships among the objects, assessing intent, and automatically generating courses of action with associated risks and uncertainty.

This research would extend ongoing research in lightweight robotic arms.\n\nAutonomous Refueling - development of hardware, algorithms, and sensors for hybrid rigid-compliant robotic arms in rapidly changing environments, with specific application to autonomous refueling of USVs, UAVs and UGVs while moving in their environments, advancing beyond the DARPA-sponsored \"Rapid Autonomous Fuel Transfer Project\".\n\nLow Power Micro-robotics - development of onboard sensors, control electronics, and actuators requiring very low power, with specific application to robotic missions over long durations.\n\nAdvanced Manipulators and Tool-Changers - development of innovative robotic manipulators, tool changers, and associated sensors for challenging robotic manipulation tasks, with specific application to EOD and other robotic missions in difficult environments. This research would extend previous research by providing robust end effector technology and tool changing capability. The overall research outcomes will enhance DoD capability in the areas of explosive ordnance disposal, autonomous vehicle refueling, and innovative robotic arm control. Research deliverables will include hardware development in the areas of lightweight robotic arms, end effector tools and tool changers, and low power electronics and actuators.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles:\n- This effort will draw from current research and push the technology development to the next level to provide a leap-ahead capability in long endurance, deployable, autonomous, robotic air vehicle using fuel cell electric propulsion systems for high efficiency, even in small vehicles, which can provide robust airborne sensor capabilities for submarines, UUVs, small naval platforms and small dismounted units.\n\nUndersea Vehicles:\n- Funding would be used to acquire a medium sized (12.5 inch diameter) Autonomous Underwater Vehicle as an at sea test platform to advance the state of art of onboard intelligent autonomy. This medium sized UUV is readily amenable to vehicle and sensor testing in the wave pool in the Laboratory for Autonomous Systems Research facility. Subsequently, this would allow at sea testing of State of the art autonomy algorithms (e.g. goal driven autonomy, human cognitive models, Markov decision processes) that allow Navy underwater vehicles to carry out complex mission in denied areas by understanding the environment and adapting mission goals in the context of the commander's intent, with little or no human operator intervention.\n\nAutonomous Systems Integration:\n- To support the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) (ASD(R&E)) priorities in autonomous systems, and specifically to advance the state of the art in heterogeneous teams of autonomous platforms, (including sensor networks and mobile communication nodes) that can work seamlessly with the warfighter, funding will be applied to small air platforms and militarily relevant unmanned ground vehicles to integrate sensors and advanced power sources, and to develop the autonomy software that allows the individual platforms to work together, as well as to work at a peer-to-peer level with the warfighter. This includes advanced human-robot interaction techniques and information processing and presentation techniques that reduce the warfighter's cognitive load and allows him to work with a team of autonomous systems."
