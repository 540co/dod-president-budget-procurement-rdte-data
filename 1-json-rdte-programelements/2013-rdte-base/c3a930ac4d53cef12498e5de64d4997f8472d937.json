BCS-F is a bi-national cooperative program with Canada, ensuring air defense and surveillance capability for the entire North American continent (including Hawaii).  BCS-F achieved Initial Operational Capability in October 2006. The current effort focuses on the mordernization and improvement of the hardware and software suite to address operational gaps, prevent and overcome diminishing manufacturing sources and obsolescence issues, and implement fixes for critical Information Assurance deficiencies.  NCR-IADS is the post-September 11 2001, quickly established, ground based air defense system using sensors to enhance the air surveillance picture incorporated in BCS-F.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.   \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
