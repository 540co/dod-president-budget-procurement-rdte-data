            "val": "The Human Social Culture Behavior (HSCB) Modeling Program is a vertically integrated effort to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems to programs of record and users in need. The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces\u2019 ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and take effective courses of action in the full range of military operations. Program research enhances intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the Irregular Warfare environment and meeting the challenges of instability and violent extremism. Under three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program conducts applied research, matures and demonstrates advanced technology, and develops transition-ready components and prototypes. Work under PE 0604670D8Z creates transition-ready software tools that help intelligence analysts, operations analysts, operations planners, wargamers, and others represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. This program focuses on maturing, hardening, and validating human, social, culture, and behavior modeling software for transition to meet the needs of the warfighter, integration into the architectures of existing programs of record, and\/or maturing software via open architectures to allow broad systems integration. The 6.4 program provides a development to product transition pathway for sociocultural models, tools, and capabilities to rapidly meet immediate and emerging warfighter needs. The work supports the testing, validation, and transition of model-based technology into existing and developing systems in coordination with Program Executive Offices\/Program Managers, Combatant Commanders, Joint and Service organizations, warfighters in need, and other transition customers. The Program matures sociocultural relevant data and tools to provide essential sociocultural understanding and forecasting capabilities at the strategic, operational and tactical levels."
