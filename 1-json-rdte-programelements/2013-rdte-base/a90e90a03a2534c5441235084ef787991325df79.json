            "val": "There is a broad application potential for environmental quality technology (EQT) to be applied to multiple Army weapon systems and installations.  However, technology must be demonstrated and validated (total ownership cost and performance data identified) before potential users will consider exploiting it.  Therefore, this program element includes projects focused on validating the general military utility or cost reduction potential of technology when applied to different types of infrastructure, military equipment or techniques.  It may include validations and proof-of-principle demonstrations in field exercises to evaluate upgrades or provide new operational capabilities.  The validation of technologies will be in as realistic an operating environment as possible to assess performance or cost reduction potential.  EQT demonstration\/validation is systemic; i.e., applies to a class of systems (e.g., tanks or aircraft) or to a Department of Army-wide, multiple site\/installation problem (e.g., unexploded ordnance detection and discrimination).  This program will address, and eventually resource, programs in each of the environmental quality technology pillars (restoration, conservation, compliance, and pollution prevention).  Work must be endorsed by potential users and supported by a state-of-the-art assessment (i.e., \"technology is heading for user to implement\")."

The NDCEE is used to demonstrate environmentally acceptable technology to industry; validate new technology prior to transferring that technology; and assist in the training of potential users as part of that technology transfer process.  The NDCEE is a DoD resource for environmental quality management and technology validation.  This program is managed by the Army on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environment (ADUSD-E).  In May 2008, the program name was redesignated from the National Defense for Environmental Excellence to the National Defense Center for Energy and Environment to ensure that the Center's mission recognizes and addresses the strategic interdependence of energy and environmental technology requirements within an overall sustainability framework in support of our installations, weapons systems and war fighters.  This name change also directly supports the DoD's proactive implementation of Executive Order 13423, \"Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy and Transportation Management.\"\n\nOur broadly encompassing and growing mobile, personal and stationary advanced energy technology requirements include infrastructure, alternative and synthetic fuels, surety, renewables, storage, distribution, advanced power, micro-grids, transportation, systems integration and others.  Further, to train as we fight, validated energy and environmental technologies need to be available, and implemented at our power projection bases and training areas.  The NDCEE will continue to research, demonstrate and transfer these technologies supporting our integrated Environment, Safety and Occupational Health (ESOH) and energy objectives with full consideration of the triple bottom line of mission, environment and community."

The NDCEE fosters an outreach program to describe its products and capabilities that include publication of results and participation in professional meetings, symposia, conferences, and appropriate coordination with industry.  The management strategy for the NDCEE centers on a DoD Executive Advisory Board (EAB) chaired by the DoD NDCEE Executive Agent on behalf of the ADUSD (ESOH) and composed of senior DoD leadership to oversee NDCEE operations.  The EAB is supported by an EAB Working Group (EABWG) that includes staff members from each of the offices represented on the EAB.  The EABWG coordinates all NDCEE activities and reports back to the EAB Principals.  The EABWG is, in turn, supported by a Technical Working Group that addresses the details of NDCEE program execution.  The contracting strategy of the NDCEE is based on using an NDCEE Contracting Officer's Representative to validate all the contractual portions of the NDCEE and by technical monitors (TM) to oversee the technical aspects of each contracted task.  A prime contractor operates NDCEE test facility(s) to validate environmentally compatible technologies on a representative \"shop floor\".  The NDCEE accounts for and conducts work for: (1) direct funded Army tasks; (2) reimbursable tasks from within DoD and from other Government agencies; and (3) Congressionally directed and funded tasks."

The restoration demonstration\/validation portion of EQT is designed to support Army-wide stewardship of its lands and facilities by focusing on the transfer of potential technological solutions to restoration problems on Army installations and to industry to support restoration of Army lands to their former or redesignated use.  The restoration EQT demonstration\/validation program goal is to support installation needs through exploitation of technology without compromising readiness or training.  It accomplishes this goal in two steps.  First, Technology Teams identify, prioritize, and justify technological solutions to Army high-priority environmental quality technology restoration requirements.  Second, based on Department of the Army and Office of the Secretary of Defense guidance, funding authority is sought through the Army's planning, programming, and budgeting process.  The EQT management oversight process consists of an Environmental Technology Technical Council (ETTC; a program management council), an Environmental Technology Integrated Process Team, (a working group supporting the ETTC) and, in this case, a Restoration Technology Team (composed of experts in restoration technology and in Army user needs).\nThis program is leveraging resources and knowledge gained from the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP), the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) and the National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence (NDCEE)."
