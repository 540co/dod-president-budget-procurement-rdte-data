            "val": "This Program Element (PE) establishes the dedicated funding line to carry out the duties as described in Title 10 US Code, Section 139, the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009.  The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Engineering (DASD(SE)) is the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) on systems engineering, development planning, and related technical fields in the Department of Defense.  The DASD(SE) develops policies and guidance for (1) the use of systems engineering principles and best practices; (2) the use of systems and software engineering planning and contracting approaches to enhance reliability, availability, and maintainability on major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs); (3) the systems engineering plans (SEPs) for MDAPs including software, and systems engineering considerations in support of lifecycle management and sustainability; and (4) the inclusion of provisions relating to systems engineering and reliability in requests for proposals.  The DASD(SE) reviews and approves the SEP for each MDAP and monitors and reviews the systems engineering and development planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs as directed by the Secretary of Defense or the USD(AT&L).  Based on the Director\u2019s continuous program engagement, the DASD(SE) advises and makes recommendations to the Secretary of Defense and the USD(AT&L) regarding systems engineering, development planning and the execution of these activities.  As a member of the Defense Acquisition Board, the DASD(SE) provides independent assessments of defense acquisition program\u2019s systems engineering, development planning, technical execution, and risk.  The DASD(SE) also provides input on the inclusion of systems engineering requirements as part of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's process for joint military requirements, to include developing specific inputs relating to each capabilities development document.\n\nThe DASD(SE) issues guidance to, and consults with, the Services and Agencies with respect to systems engineering in the Department and provides advocacy, oversight, and guidance to elements of the acquisition workforce responsible for systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability functions and developing policies and guidance for the integration of specialty engineering functions.  The DASD(SE) integrates systems engineering with Mission Assurance in the acquisition system.  The DASD(SE) periodically reviews the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability, and identifies needed changes or improvements to such organizations and capabilities. \n\nThe DASD(SE) prepares and submits an annual report to Congress on systems engineering activities and effectiveness.\n\nThis PE includes effort by the office of the DASD(SE) in implementing the Department\u2019s Cyber initiatives.  Specifically, the PE will develop and address the critical subdiscipline of systems engineering - system security engineering and Program Protection.  This includes study and maturation of discipline fundamentals such as best practices, tools, guidance, and policy, and will also pilot system security practices in defense acquisition as a fundamental element of systems engineering and technical reviews.  Efforts in this area are directly driven by cyber and malicious supply chain threats that the Department faces, and therefore, will include implementing Department directives and regulations to protect critical program information."

Increased reliance on the internet as a vehicle for sharing information, globalization of the supply chain, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) that can evade commercially available security tools and defeat generic security best practices, drive the need for better and smarter program protection planning and execution.  The President's Cyber Initiative has moved to counter these threats and mitigate the risks.  The Acquisition Cyber Security Initiative links high level policies and practical expertise to specific acquisition practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department will pilot activities with the DIB to reduce risks in sharing and storing critical program information, better understand and mitigate supply chain risks, improve program protection planning, and improve and streamline program protection engineering.  The Department has developed a Trusted Systems strategy which integrates Protection Planning for the development of capabilities, the use of proven mitigation techniques and tools, the ongoing refinement of risk management processes, and creation of needed technology."
