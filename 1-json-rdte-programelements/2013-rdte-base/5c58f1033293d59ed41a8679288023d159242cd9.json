Block 7.0 is an international collaboration as the common core development costs are being shared by each participating nation (United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the United States).  Block 7.0 requirements include: a) Communication, Navigation & Identification (CNI) upgrades; b) Dual Multi-Mode Receivers (MMR) with a Civil Global Positioning System; c) CNI special processor upgrade; d) Tactical datalink; and e) Mission computer upgrades.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."
