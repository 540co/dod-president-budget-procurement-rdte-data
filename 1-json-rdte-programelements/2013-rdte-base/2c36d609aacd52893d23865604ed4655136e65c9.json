Complementary efforts include: Technical Fire Control Technology provides the firing solution and launch command and Counter RAM Tracking and Fire Control, PE 0603313A Project 704, provides tracking of the RAM threat for intercept. This effort will support the design, fabrication, integration, and flight demonstration of 2-4 hit-to-kill interceptors each year beginning in FY12. Beginning in FY12, this effort combines the Defense against RAM and Enhanced Precision Interceptor Technology efforts to provide more detail on the two technically different missile-based counter-RAM systems that are being flight demonstrated.  The technologies demonstrated will be applicable to the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC), which began the Material Solution Analysis Phase in 4QFY11."
