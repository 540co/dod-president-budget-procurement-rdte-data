            "val": "The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications.  It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, biological and materials sciences.\n\n     The Bio\/Info\/Micro Sciences project will explore and develop potential technological breakthroughs that exist at the intersection of biology, information technology and micro\/physical systems to exploit advances and leverage fundamental discoveries for the development of new technologies, techniques and systems of interest to the DoD.  Programs in this project will draw upon information and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple biological architectures and functions, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels.  Programs in this project also lay the groundwork for advances in military medicine and combat casualty care.\n\n     The Math and Computer Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in new computational models and mechanisms for reasoning and communication in complex, interconnected systems.  The project is exploring novel means to exploit computer capabilities; enhance human-to-computer and computer-to-computer interaction technologies; advance innovative computer architectures; and discover new learning mechanisms and innovations in software composition.  It is also fostering the computer science academic community to address the DoD's need for innovative computer and information science technologies.  Additionally, this project explores the science of mathematics for potential defense applications.\n\n      The Cyber Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber-security.  Networked computing systems control virtually everything, from power plants and energy distribution, transportation systems, food and water distribution, financial systems, to defense systems.  Protecting the infrastructure on which these systems rely is a national security issue.   The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD cyber-capabilities survive adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Basic research in cyber security is required to provide a basis for continuing progress in this area. Promising research results will transition to both technology development and system-level projects.\n\n     The Electronic Sciences project explores and demonstrates electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits and processing concepts that will provide: 1) new technical options for meeting the information gathering, transmission and processing required to maintain near-real time knowledge of the enemy and the ability to communicate decisions based on that knowledge to all forces in near-real time; and 2) provide new means for achieving substantial increases in performance and cost reduction of military systems providing these capabilities.\n\n     The Materials Sciences project is concerned with the development of: high power density\/high energy density mobile and portable power sources; processing and design approaches for nanoscale and\/or bimolecular materials, interfaces and microsystems; and materials and measurements for molecular-scale electronics.\n\n     The Transformative Sciences project supports scientific research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in the areas of computing and the computing-reliant subareas of social sciences, life sciences, manufacturing, and commerce as a means of improving military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging converging trends."

The unique stability afforded biological systems in their ability to adapt to wide extremes of physical and endurance (e.g., heat, cold, and sleeplessness) parameters will be examined and exploited in order to engineer stability into biological systems required for the military (such as blood, bioengineered tissues or other therapeutics).  In addition, the fault tolerance present in biological systems will be exploited in order to assemble and manufacture complex physical and multi-functional systems, both biological and abiotic (such as tissue constructs designed for reconstructive surgery).  These systems include novel load-bearing bio-interactive materials and composites for repair of severe hard tissue trauma, including complex bone fractures.  A key new antibody technology will develop the ideal antibody master molecule for use in unattended sensors that maintains high temperature stability and controllable affinity for threat agents.  Using the Freytag triangle structure, the interplay of narratives or stories may reveal how they tap into an array of mechanisms implicated in memory, reasoning, and strategy behavior.  Applications to Defense systems include the development of chemical and biological sensors; tools for strategic military decision-makers involved in public relations and information operations, and improved warfighter battlefield survivability."

This requires an understanding of neuroscience, significant computational efforts, and new material design and implementation.  Key advances expected from this research include determining the nature and means through which short-term memory is encoded, and discovering the mechanisms and dynamics underlying neural computation and reorganization.  These advances will enable memory restoration through the use of devices programmed to bridge gaps in the injured brain.  Further, modeling of the brain progresses to an unprecedented level with this novel approach.  The programs funded under the Human Assisted Neural Devices are continued in Budget Activity 6.1 Medical Program Element 0601117E, in FY 2012 and subsequent years."

The long-term goal for this program is to develop the next generation of academic scientists, engineers, and mathematicians in key disciplines who will focus a significant portion of their careers on DoD and National Security issues.  Current activities include research in twelve topic areas: Quantum Science and Technology; New Physical Methods for Biological Characterization and Control; Mathematics; Structural Materials; Functional Materials; Power and Energy; Advanced Electronics; Micro\/Nano Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS\/NEMS); Photonics and Lasers; Digital Direct Manufacturing; Neuroscience; and Computational and Quantitative Social, Decision, and Behavioral Sciences.  For YFA 2012 a new topic on Robotics will be added and the three historic materials science and power & energy topics will be replaced with three revised materials science topics.  A key aspect of the YFA program is DARPA-sponsored military visits; all YFA Principal Investigators are expected to participate in one or more military site visits to help them better understand DoD needs."

In the current operational environment, it is imperative to develop rapport with local leaders and civilians as their cooperation and consent will be necessary for successful operations.  SSIM will emphasize the foundational social skills necessary to achieve cultural understanding in any social setting and the skills necessary for successful interactions across different social groups.  These core skills do not require soldiers to have knowledge of a specific culture prior to contact but emphasizes skills for orienting toward and discovering patterns of meaningful social behavior.  SSIM will develop the requisite training technology including advanced gaming\/simulation techniques that incorporate new methods for practicing social agility in social encounters, as well as how to discover and adapt to unfamiliar culturally-specific conduct, manners, and practices.  SSIM will enhance military effectiveness by enabling close collaborative relationships with local peoples and leaders."

Recent evidence has shown that social network analysis can provide critical insight when used in DoD-relevant scenarios.  In this paradigm, nodes represent people of interest and their relationships or interactions are edges; the result forms a network or graph.  Current analysis of social networks, however, is just in its infancy:  the composition of real-world networks is understood only at the most coarse and basic details (diameter, degree distribution).  In order to implement social network techniques efficiently and usefully, a better understanding of the finer mathematical structure of social networks is needed.  This includes the development of a comprehensive and minimal mathematical set which characterizes social networks of DoD interest, and includes a description of how these quantities vary in both space and time.  This also necessitates creation of fundamental theory of how heterogeneous social networks of different media (Facebook, Twitter, Picasa) interact."

The program will require cross-disciplinary collaboration to exploit and advance unique computational models and connectivity architectures which minimize power, processing time, and\/or instruction complexity in DoD-critical applications such as image\/pattern detection, signal filtering\/data reduction, and change detection.  Some example approaches include, but are not limited to, co-opting neuro-biological material to implement a specific function or mapping biological functions to electronic circuitry.  Bayesian inference engines, specialized processors, approximate computation, and DNA computing are explicitly of interest.  The ultimate goal of the Unconventional Computing program is to develop devices, architectures, and systems capable of exploiting innovative computation models to enhance the computation capabilities of the DoD."

These will have far-reaching military implications with potential applications such as anomaly detection, object recognition, language understanding, information retrieval, pattern recognition, robotic task learning and automatic metadata extraction from video streams, sensor data, and multi-media objects.

Networked computing systems control virtually everything, from power plants and energy distribution grids, transportation systems, food and water distribution systems, and financial networks to defense systems.  Protecting the infrastructure on which these systems rely is a national security issue.  Cyberspace is not only critical to our national security, it is fundamental to our way of life: over the past decade information technologies have driven the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Unfortunately, during the same period, cyber-adversaries, which include nation-states, criminal\/terrorist groups, transnational actors, and miscreants, have grown rapidly in sophistication and number.  The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD cyber-capabilities survive adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Basic research in cyber security is required to provide a basis for continuing progress in this area.  Promising research results will transition to both technology development and system-level projects."

Such X-ray sources will enable new versatile imaging modalities based on phase contrast which are 1000X more sensitive than the conventional absorption contrast imaging.  Such imaging modalities should enable reverse engineering of integrated circuits to validate trustworthiness as well as battlefield imaging of soft tissues and blood vessel injuries without the injection of a contrast enhancing agent in blunt trauma.  It will also reduce radiation dose required for imaging.\n\nThe Basic Research component of this effort will focus on defining the fundamental science necessary for the creation of compact and highly efficient synchrotron X-ray sources.

For government, it will accelerate the time frame from design to production of the new generation of defense systems, providing the high performance devices and applications needed by warfighters in the field.  Research in the MRC program is divided into the broad categories of technology discovery and system discovery.  Technology discovery efforts will be focused on providing a pipeline of innovative devices and basic discovery.  In contrast, the system discovery efforts will focus on integration of existing technologies to provide new capabilities.  These include, among many others, producing new opportunities for functionality beyond digital CMOS, and developing anticipatory technology, where systems interact actively with their environment and\/or users, adapting their response to execute the most advantageous and effective actions.  MRC is unique in that government participates as a partner on an equal ground as industry, with contracting function to pursue its goals directly rather than extracting indirect benefits from subsidizing technology.

The program seeks to develop the new tools, technologies and methodologies to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  The goal is to enable the rapid development of previously unattainable technologies and products, leveraging biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials, novel capabilities, fuels and medicines and providing novel solutions and enhancements to military needs and capabilities.  For example, one motivating, widespread and currently intractable problem is that of corrosion\/materials degradation - a challenge that costs the DoD nearly $23 billion per year and has no near term solution in sight.  Living Foundries offers the potential to program and engineer biology, and enable the capability to design and engineer systems that rapidly and dynamically prevent, seek out, identify and repair corrosion\/materials degradation.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling distributed, adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value materials, devices and capabilities in the field or on base.  Such a capability will decrease the DoD's dependence on tenuous material and energy supply chains that could be cut due to political change, targeted attack or environmental accident.   \n\nLiving Foundries aims to do for biology what very-large-scale integration (VLSI) did for the semiconductor device industry - i.e. enable the design and engineering of increasingly complex systems to address and enhance military needs and capabilities.  Living Foundries will develop and apply an engineering framework to biology that decouples biological design from fabrication, yields design rules and tools, and manages biological complexity through simplification, abstraction and standardization.  The result will be to enable the design and implementation of complex, higher-order genetic networks with programmable functionality and DoD applicability.  Research thrusts include developing the fundamental tools, capabilities and methodologies to accelerate the biological design-build-test cycle, thereby reducing extensive cost and time it takes to engineer new systems and expanding the complexity and accuracy of designs that can be built.  Specific tools and capabilities include: interoperable tools for design, modeling, and automated fabrication; modular regulatory elements devices and circuits for hierarchical and scalable engineering; standardized test platforms and chassis; and novel approaches to process measurement, validation and debugging.  Applied research for this program continues in FY 2013 in PE 0602715E, project MBT-02."

A social compiler which views people, computer, and network ensembles as elements of a single architecture and enables crowd sourced developers to write social programs in a high-level language would automatically decompose the task and organize, incentivize, and outsource appropriate aspects to peer production.  The resulting social computing systems could be applied both within the military and across larger communities to achieve capabilities ranging from highly responsive development of tactics, techniques, and procedures to open-source intelligence and strategic communications."

Understanding the neural mechanisms that govern the transfer of virtual behavior into actual behavior will enable optimization of virtual resources to train and educate soldiers, and could lead to therapeutic and preventative capabilities.  B3 will examine how virtual world interactions influence neural mechanisms of learning (both one-shot and traditional) and executive function (especially judgment).

These systems have important applications in tactical contexts to aid analysts and operators in connecting the dots amid complex, conflicting, and incomplete data sets.  They also establish a foundation for cultural intelligence -- understanding the stability, governance, and economic indicators of a region. These technologies have transitioned into the Nexus 7 program in PE 0602702E, Project TT-13."
