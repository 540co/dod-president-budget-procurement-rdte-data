            "val": "The Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) is the hub of DoD Scientific and Technical Information interchanges, empowering innovators with greater efficiency, effectiveness, and agility by accelerating the delivery of warfighting technology.  Located at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, DTIC leverages DoD\u2019s substantial investment in scientific and technical research and development by facilitating the transfer of scientific, technical and program information throughout the national defense community.  The DTIC program generates a significant return on investment within the Department, as DTIC products and services represent a force multiplier within the S&T community.  Employing efficient information organization, discovery, and delivery processes, DTIC reduces research costs and supports effective acquisition decision-making throughout the Department, and ultimately improves the technological superiority of the American warfighter. DTIC develops and maintains centralized information systems that collect, process, retrieve, and disseminate scientific and technical (S&T) information. By combining advanced knowledge management techniques with new information technologies, DTIC serves as the Department's agile information provider, delivering innovative discovery, collaboration and analysis products and services that support DoD program managers, acquisition professionals, warfighters, scientists, and engineers, as well as other government agencies, US allies, and DoD\u2019s academic and private sector partners.  With a modest funding level, DTIC serves as an efficiency enabler, providing products and services in support of federal-wide collaboration, facilitating the elimination of redundant research efforts and reducing the traditional reliance on conferences and travel as a means of connecting with professional colleagues.\nThe DTIC mission is tied specifically to warfighting technologies, investments, and expenditures.  With efficiencies being demanded of DoD, DTIC saves the Department money by bringing technology to bear to improve communication across DoD, between the DoD Labs and the COCOMs, and between Industry and DoD.   DTIC increases the return on investment of DoD\u2019s research dollars, encouraging reuse of existing data.   DTIC supports researchers and developers who create the technologies that support the warfighter\u2019s mission and saves lives. \nRecent innovative products and services include:\n- \u201cDoDTechSpace Limited and Classified Collaboration Tools\u201d \u2013 These collaboration tools are similar to LinkedIn and FaceBook. The limited-access site will facilitate collaboration between Defense Laboratories, the Services, COCOM S&T Advisors\/Staffs and the DoD Research and Engineering (R&E) Community. The classified site will enhance the COCOM Capability Gap Analysis process, which is specifically focused on Science and Technology Integrated Priority Lists (STIPLs). This will also enable the DoD R&E community to openly discuss capability gaps and reach out to the broad community for Proposed Solutions\/Mitigation Strategies.  Both the limited-access and classified DoDTechSpace will be enhanced through the ability to locate experts, post questions for discussion and explore the DTIC collections for relevant emerging candidate programs.\n- \u201cDoDTechipedia Limited and Classified Wikis\u201d - The limited-access wiki supports collaborative research and knowledge sharing within the DoD and throughout the Federal research and acquisitions communities. Launched October 1, 2008, DoDTechipedia annually serves over 600,000 page views to registered users. The classified wiki also supports capability gap discussions in a more restricted environment.  The DoDTechipedia Limited Wiki has been featured on the White House Innovations Gallery and was selected for the 2009 Government Computer News Outstanding Information Technology Award.  DTIC is moving this DoD R&E information entry point into a highly collaborative tool focused on communities of interest.\n- \u201cDTIC Online Access Controlled and Classified Interfaces\u201d \u2013 These Access Controlled and Classified versions of the DTIC Online customer interfaces serve as the gateway to provide users one-stop access to research and engineering information, budget analysis tools, science and technology strategic planning documents, and advanced searching capabilities.\n- \u201cAristotle\u201d \u2013 Implemented in production at DTIC, and developed by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Aristotle is a limited access relationship discovery tool; it provides users with the ability to discover where current research is being conducted, review completed project outcomes, and identify subject matter experts.  Aristotle is an additional tool in the DoDTechipedia Suite of Services.  Aristotle has been featured on the White House Innovations Gallery.\n\nApproximately 30,000 eligible individuals, representing hundreds of organizations (military, federal, industry, and academia), are registered to access DTIC\u2019s information. DTIC's public and access controlled Websites average 32 million page requests per month. DTIC develops and hosts over 70 Websites, collaboration tools and other applications for DoD Component organizations including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)), Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), several Combatant Commands (COCOMs), and the Federal Voting Assistance Program. The Information Analysis Center (IAC) Program Office at DTIC provides core funding, management and oversight for 10 IACs. The IACs are chartered by DoD to collect, analyze, and disseminate worldwide scientific and technical information in specialized fields such as information assurance, chemical\/biological defense, and weapons systems technology. IACs support the acquisition community, prevent unnecessary duplication of research and promote standardization of research methods and processes.  The IAC funding level represents the Department\u2019s approved customer cost sharing methodology in accordance with the Economy Act and DoD regulations.\nThis Program Element (PE) supports DTIC mission operations, to include four core integrated functions:  Research Support & Library Repository, Web Services & Hosting, Collaboration, and Information Analysis Centers (IACs).  Mission funding provides for salaries and benefits of government civilian personnel assigned to DTIC; training, professional development, and travel for DTIC personnel; facility-related requirements; support agreements for Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) financial activities and Human Resource (HR) services, Defense Information Services Agency (DISA) communications support; annual maintenance and licensing requirements; supplies, equipment, Hardware\/Software; and support contracts for Information Technology services, Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI) system integration, and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliance efforts.  In addition, this PE provides funding in support of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, in accordance with Public Law No: 111-251 (Small Business Reauthorization Act) and Small Business Technology Transfer Program Reauthorization Act.  Within the PE, an annual set-aside contribution totaling approximately $400 Thousand is provided to the Department's Commercialization Pilot Program, as directed by the Department's Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP)."

                "val": "Specific changes to the FY 2013 program (net reduction of $0.561 Million) are outlined below:\n\nDoD Initiatives:   - $3.115 Million decrease of FY 2013 budget authority in compliance with the Department\u2019s efforts to reduce programs.  The reduction reflects a reshaping of planned contract support activities in areas such as Information Technology (IT) services, maintenance, etc.; streamlining of Support Agreement facility and contracting services; expanded utilization of new collaborative technologies, tools and distance training\/learning; and new processes supporting the dissemination of Scientific and Technical information.\n\nProgram Changes:  $2.500 Million in support of the Department\u2019s Discovery, Analysis, and Collaboration Support Tools.  This change to the program supports integration efforts and the development and implementation of additional features for the DoDTechipedia Suite of Services on both NIPRNET and SIPRNET.  Specifically, this effort includes:  enhancing a single user profile across DTIC products and features; enabling access by non-DoD Federal workforce to DTIC collections via the Personal Identification Verification (PIV) card; building out of WebServices interfaces to support federation across the DTIC collaboration tools and collections, and allowing DTIC users to access other DoD and non-DoD resources and tools.  This effort will expand DTIC's user community by reducing the level of subject matter domain expertise needed to rapidly identify and act on relevant data and expand the material accessible, thus opening DTIC collections more broadly among technology customers, to include Warfighters, Combatant Commands, Acquisition, and Logistics communities, and technology providers within the Science and Technology (S&T) and Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) communities.\n\nOther Program Changes:  -$0.019 Million of reductions to travel, printing and reproduction accounts within the program.\n\nEconomic Adjustments:  $0.073 Million in funding change reflects revised economic assumptions based on anticipated inflation rates associated with both pay and non-pay accounts."

                            "val": "As the leader of the DoD\u2019s scientific and technical information (STINFO) program, DTIC has the responsibility to develop, coordinate and enable a strong STINFO program for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) and the DoD Scientific & Technical (S&T) enterprise.  In its role as the DoD STINFO Manager, DTIC sets and enables policy for scientific and technical information exchanges for the research and engineering community.  DTIC\u2019s aim is to maximize the availability and use of technical information and products resulting from Defense-funded technical activities while ensuring restrictions in national security, export control, and intellectual property rights are safeguarded.\nIt is DoD policy to establish and maintain a coordinated and comprehensive program to document the results and outcome of DoD-sponsored and performed research and engineering (R&E) and studies, and to provide access to those efforts in an effective manner, in order to make efficient use of the investment that taxpayers have previously made in R&E.  In the 21st Century, supporting the S&T and RDT&E communities requires that DTIC integrate, more than ever, our collections with databases, information links, utilizing the latest information technology, whether in-house or outside of our Department, regardless of the source. DTIC, as the central repository for the DoD-funded current and completed research, brings efficiencies to the Department as users can gather information from many sources with one search.  DTIC\u2019s customers, from the individual researcher to the acquisition professional, can quickly fuse information into the most complete picture needed in a matter of minutes to hours; not days to months.  DTIC accomplishes its mission to provide critical scientific, technical and related program information by performing the activities described in the three core integrated functions below:\n\n1.  RESEARCH SUPPORT AND LIBRARY REPOSITORY.  This activity represents a world-class library with exceptional librarians capable of providing targeted research quickly.  DTIC offers the STI community an authoritative source of information, including protecting the material according to its dissemination limitations.  DTIC is the information repository from which new technologies arise.  DTIC\u2019s repository allows DoD to reuse the research in which it already invested its money, leveraging prior research to maximize R&D dollars.   DTIC\u2019s data also provides identification of how DoD R&D dollars were invested and the resulting outcomes. \nWorking with classification\/declassification experts across the DoD, the U.S. Government and affiliates, DTIC obtains the latest document classification and dissemination information. DTIC leads the DoD in the implementation of a new marking\/protection scheme for unclassified sensitive information, now called Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), and is exploring how these changes will affect all of our automated validation and registration systems.\n\n2.  COLLABORATION.  DTIC is at the center of the Research & Engineering hub, connecting users, data and subject matter experts in meaningful ways.  As the DoD S&T information hub, DTIC provides the technology and tools to promote collaboration, integration and innovation--in real time--among the entire DoD enterprise and its partners.  Through DTIC's collaborative tools, the Department entrusts DTIC to forge critical linkages, or paths, between and amongst the various Service Laboratories, COCOMs, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), Industry\/Academia, connecting diverse communities of interest to the critical research data maintained in the Department's designated Science & Technology repository.  The value of scientific research lies not only in the knowledge it adds, but also in the ideas it leads to when shared.  Access to information enables creative and new technologies, methods and approaches to researchers in government and business, alike.  DTIC\u2019s collaborative yet secure technologies assist researchers by connecting them with others and permitting them to tap into networks similar to those seen in social media.  By sharing knowledge more quickly, easily and securely, the DoD community can accelerate innovation in technologies which will benefit the warfighter.  Recognizing that information technology and information usage demands continually evolve, DTIC works within DoD and industry to leverage existing tools and pilot new capabilities and approaches to improve information discovery, analysis, and collaboration--connecting teams and people across the enterprise. To avoid duplication of efforts and increase information sharing, DTIC partners with DoD and other federal government organizations to provide federated access to information resources and tools. As relevant research and engineering and S&T information is stored at organizations across the Department, DTIC will expand its collections, virtually, by helping users leverage remote collections. DTIC will work to federate access to users through identity management agreements, or by exploiting remote collections through search crawlers, abstracts, links, and other references.  Traditionally, the R&E community has worked in small geographically clustered teams and then shared information broadly through publishing reports on completed work. Internet technologies have changed the paradigm. Web 2.0 collaboration and professional networking technologies bring scientific investigation and research and development to an inflection point. Small geographically collocated teams, with limited resources and unique perspectives, will combine with other teams around the globe, bringing a diversity of perspectives and experiences to bear on problems to develop new solutions quickly and with increased innovation. Collaboration tools have the additional opportunity for the solution provider to fully engage the warfighter and decision makers; allowing those working on the solution to connect with those presenting the challenge\/problem.  In partnership with ASD(R&E) Communities of Interest, such as Modeling & Simulation; Rapid Prototyping; High Performance Computing; Basic Research & laboratory programs; and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM); to name a few; DTIC continues to enhance our collaborative suite of services, complementing our core repositories with advanced search to empower users in the Defense community to quickly recognize where resources are being applied, expertise exists, the state of the art happens, and most importantly, the art of the possible, as decision makers at all levels work to field solutions to near-, mid- and long-term warfighter needs.\n\n3.  WEB SERVICES AND SITE HOSTING.  Within this activity, DTIC develops customized information solutions and hosts applications that support DoD Components. The jointly developed information collection, collaboration and analysis projects facilitate components\u2019 goals to improve DoD acquisition decision-making, increase collaborative research and development efforts, facilitate business processes, and provide improved support for the warfighter. DTIC hosts over 70 public, limited and classified web-based information systems for DoD Components.  Customers include such organizations as: Joint Chief of Staff (JCS), Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research & Engineering (ASD(R&E)), Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)), and the Combatant Commands.  Notable web-hosting development efforts include the Federal Voter Assistance Program (FVAP), providing voter access to U.S. citizens across the world; the OSD-Comptroller\u2019s R-2 application, a Department-wide effort to standardize appropriated budget information for submission to Congress; and Science Mathematics and Research for Transformation (SMART) Scholarship for Service Program, providing scholarships to colleges and universities in an effort to recruit, develop and retain the next generation of personnel in the science, mathematics and research fields for the Department of Defense."
