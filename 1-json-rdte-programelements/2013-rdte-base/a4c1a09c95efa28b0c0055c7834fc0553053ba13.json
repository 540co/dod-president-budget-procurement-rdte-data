AF-IPPS eliminates the current systems' problems by delivering an integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that provides accurate and timely personnel and pay information for AF operations and superior customer service for the Airman. AF-IPPS will ensure that Air Force personnel and pay fully support the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) FY17 auditability requirements.\n\nThe AF-IPPS acquisition strategy is a two increment approach, with multiple, discrete, and severable capability releases delivered every 18-24 months. For Increment 1, the government will conduct a full and open competitive (best value) source selection with a single contract award for blueprinting, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementation, integration with the government hosting environment, testing, delivery, and sustainment. Increment 2 will be a separate acquisition effort focused on the sustainment of the system.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The lack of an integrated system and antiquated technology contribute to thousands of personnel and pay errors and delays in customer support that drives total cost of ownership higher across system operations. AF-IPPS eliminates the current systems' problems by delivering an integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that provides accurate and timely personnel and pay information for AF operations and superior customer service for the Airman. AF-IPPS will ensure that Air Force personnel and pay fully support the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) FY17 auditability requirements.\n\nThe AF-IPPS acquisition strategy is a two increment approach, with multiple, discrete, and severable capability releases delivered every 18-24 months. For Increment 1, the government will conduct a full and open competitive (best value) source selection with a single contract award for blueprinting, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementation, integration with the government hosting environment, testing, delivery, and sustainment. Increment 2 will be a separate acquisition effort focused on the sustainment of the system.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
