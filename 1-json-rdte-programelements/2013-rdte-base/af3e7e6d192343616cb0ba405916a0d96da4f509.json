The A-10 is an essential component of successful air operations, and represents a significant percentage of the CAF force structure.  FY 2013 RDT&E funds address continuing user requirements that need to be incorporated within the Operational Flight Program (OFP).

Results of previously planned developmental and modernization actions provide the A-10 with new combat capabilities that employ a variety of smart weapons, improved situational awareness, increased service life to the wing and fuselage, and enhanced target identification and designation capability.  The funds budgeted in the near term provide updates to the aircraft OFP in Suites 7B, 8, and 9 addressing the future integration of Mode 5, Lightweight Airborne Radio System (LARS) V12, Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS), and Combatant Survivor Evader Locator (CSEL), Anti-Jam Embedded Global Positioning System\/Inertial Navigation System (EGI Embedded GPS\/INS), weapons, and targeting pods integration.  Ongoing planning activities will continue to address diminishing manufacturing sources and obsolescence issues as required and provide replacement capabilities.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Final integration of hardware and software requirements into a unified release occurs only after rigorous testing, including validation and verification using software integration laboratories, field representative assets, and production representative assets. Results of previously planned developmental and modernization actions provide the A-10 with new combat capabilities that employ a variety of smart weapons, improved situational awareness, increased service life to the wing and fuselage, and enhanced target identification and designation capability.  The funds budgeted in the near term provide updates to the aircraft OFP in Suites 7B, 8, and 9 addressing the future integration of Mode 5, Lightweight Airborne Radio System (LARS) V12, Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS), and Combatant Survivor Evader Locator (CSEL), Anti-Jam Embedded Global Positioning System\/Inertial Navigation System (EGI Embedded GPS\/INS), weapons, and targeting pods integration.  Ongoing planning activities will continue to address diminishing manufacturing sources and obsolescence issues as required and provide replacement capabilities.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The original period of performance\/ordering period ended in December 2006. A new Thunderbolt Lifecycle Program Support (TLPS) contract was awarded to three sucessful bidders in 2009. \n\nSuite 8 development efforts will begin in FY12, with SIL development and stand-up begin in FY11 as A-10 OFP suites development and sustainment efforts transition from contractual work by Lockheed Martin to organic work by 309th SMX at Hill AFB.
