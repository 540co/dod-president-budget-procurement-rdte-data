CNA provides independent, objective, and expert analyses based on its unique access to sensitive data and hands-on exposure to fleet operations gained through its world-wide field program. CNA's research program is centrally funded by this program element and is primarily concentrated along one Marine Corps category and thirteen Navy categories of study called product areas. These product areas are structured to enhance CNA's focus of research and analysis upon the major present and future needs and issues of the Navy and the Marine Corps. Because of rapid advances in technology, changes in the fleet, the increasing complexity of weapon systems, and reductions in manpower, force structure, budgets, the current security environment, and Department of Defense (DoD) transformation, the Navy and Marine Corps have a greater need for analyses that are sophisticated, relevant, and timely. CNA is highly qualified to meet that need."

As a result of the findings and recommendations of the Fiscal Year 1997 Defense Science Board, the Marine Corps refocused the type of support CNA provides.  The CNA maintains a varied number of field representatives for the Operational Forces Commanders and eight (8) program areas for CNA to establish and maintain. The program areas are linked to the Marine Corps Advocacy (prepotency), which are: (1) Policy and Operations; (2) Systems and Tactics; (3) Research, Development and Acquisition; (4) Infrastructure and Readiness; (5) Manpower, Medical and Training; (6) Resources, Planning and Assessments; (7) Capabilities, Force Structure and Systems and (8) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.  Scientific Analyst support provides six scientific analysts for the following six focus areas: Deputy Commandant (DC), Plans, Policies and Operations; DC Aviation; DC Installation and Logistics; DC Programs and Resources; DC Manpower Reserve Affairs; and Director, Manpower Plans (MP) - Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA).

The MCSS maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the Marine Corps.  The MCSS ensures there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the Marine Corps.  Additionally, the Operations Analysis Division of Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the Marine Corps and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter for research and analysis.  Other evaluation processes are as follows: \nA) Contract Status Meetings: The Marine Corps participates in the DoN Contract Status Meetings. As part of the CNA oversight process, the Contracting Officer chairs a monthly meeting with the COTR, the Marine Corps, and members of the CNA Business Support Group to provide guidance regarding contract management. Issues range from reviewing the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) database requirements to emphasize the contractual requirement that all ongoing research be submitted to DTIC to ensure against duplication to reviewing CNA's cost effectiveness and efficiency.\nB) Award Fee Evaluation Process: As required by CNA's contract with DoN, the Marine Corps participates in the CNA evaluation on a semi-annual basis throughout the entire five year performance period of Contract N00014-05-D-0500. Over 28 Marine Corps sponsors of CNA deliverables provide input regarding CNA's value to their respective organizations.  Evaluations cover CNA's support to Marine Corps leadership and management, timeliness and quality of research, as well as cost effectiveness and efficiency.  The Marine Corps' evaluation contributes to CNA's overall performance rating that is the primary basis for determining the amount, if any, of the available award fee earned by CNA. \nC) Marine Corps Three-Star Flag Officer Review: The Commanding General, Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) and the Director, Operations Analysis Division meet several times per month to review the current fiscal year's research program and provide guidance to CNA regarding their future research requirements for the Marine Corps. These high level meetings are essential to provide CNA with Marine Corps' guidance to ensure that the research conducted is of the greatest value to the Marine Corps. The meetings also serve as the roadmap for research during the upcoming fiscal year. The Marine Corps' research plan is consolidated with the DoN's Annual Plan that is submitted to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Integration of Capabilities and Resources (N8) for final review and acceptance.\nD) CNA Comprehensive Review: Prior to contract renewal, CNA, as a FFRDC, must be evaluated to ensure that the DoN wants to renew their contract for an additional five years. The Marine Corps conducts a comprehensive review of sponsors' technical needs and mission requirements, consideration of alternative sources, efficiency and effectiveness, and management and cost effectiveness that contributes to DoN's establishment of criteria and sponsorship agreement."

The primary (and most effective) method of review for duplication is the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) review and approval of each and every project proposal submitted by CNA.  This method is highly effective in providing the necessary oversight to ensure that duplication of effort does not occur.  The Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the USMC.  The MCSS ensures that there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the USMC.  Additionally, the Studies and Analysis Division of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the USMC and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter and an annual plan for research and analysis.  Other evaluation processes:  A) DoN Contract Status Meetings:  As part of the CNA oversight process, the ONR Contracting Officer chairs a monthly meeting with the COTR, the USMC, and the CNA Business Support Group to provide guidance regarding contract management.  B) Two-Star Flag Officers and VCNO Corporate Board Meetings:  DoN Two-Star and their equivalent civilian counterparts meet several times a year to review the current fiscal year's research and provide guidance to CNA regarding their future research for DoN.  These high level meetings are essential to provide CNA with DoN's guidance to ensure that the research conducted is of the greatest value to DoN.  The meetings also serve as the catalyst for the formation of the CNA Annual Plan, CNA's roadmap for research during the upcoming fiscal year.  The CNA Annual Plan is then submitted to VCNO\/N8 for final review and acceptance.  C)  CNA Comprehensive Review:  Prior to contract renewal, CNA, as an FFRDC, must be evaluated to ensure that the DoN wants to renew CNA's contract for an additional five year period.  DoN completes an exhaustive review of sponsors' technical needs and mission requirements; DoN's consideration of other sources; CNA's efficiency and effectiveness; CNA's management and cost effectiveness; as well as the FFRDC establishment criteria and sponsorship agreement.  The CNA Comprehensive Review is approved by ASN (RDA) and accepted by OSD (AT&L)."
