            "val": "This PE focuses USAF efforts on long endurance platforms which allow days, months, or years of endurance, as well as their associated sensors and communications suites.  Efforts include, but are not limited to, airships and more standard aircraft structures. \n\nThe Integrated Sensor IS Structure (ISIS) project develops a radar which is fully integrated into a station-keeping, stratospheric airship.  ISIS supports the nation's need for persistent wide-area surveillance, tracking, and engagement of time-critical air and ground targets.  Automated surveillance and tracking includes air targets to the radar horizon of 600 km and all ground targets to a range of 300 km.  The radar aperture is intended to provide track data and other communications directly to users in-theater.  The system is planned to launch from CONUS locations with a multi-year operational life.  No support personnel or facilities are required in-theater.  Efforts include work on the ground station and the corresponding Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) connectivity.\n\nThe Blue Devil Block 2 (BD2) project is an Air Force-led single ship technology and concept demonstration of multi-intelligence, cross-platform tipping and cueing of fused SIGINT, wide area and high-definition (HD) EO\/IR motion imagery on a persistent lighter-than-air (LTA) airship.  BD2 will employ a payload integration infrastructure (PII) with a Command and Control (C2) and Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) Ground Station.  This effort directly supports multiple validated CENTCOM urgent operational needs, and contributes directly to force protection and counter Improvised Explosive Device (IED) missions for Coalition Forces. \n\nThe Medium Altitude Global ISR and Communications (MAGIC) project develops a multiple day, medium altitude ISR unmmanned aerial system (UAS) to provide long endurance surveillance with a multiple sensor payload.\n\nFunds also cover activities to include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Automated surveillance and tracking includes air targets to the radar horizon of 600 km and all ground targets to a range of 300 km.  The radar aperture also is intended to provide track data and other communications directly to users in-theater.  The system is planned to launch from CONUS locations with a multi-year operational life.  No support personnel or facilities are required in-theater.  Efforts include work on the ground station and the corresponding Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) connectivity.  \n\nDARPA funded development of the prototype in FY11-12.  Air Force will contribute funding in FY12-FY14 to this joint DARPA - Air Force project to complete and demonstrate the prototype.  This project includes completion of the designs for the radar, propulsion, power systems, and the airframe.  The project also includes development and testing of the hull materials, antenna design\/production, calibration system design, software development for the radar and flight control systems, and integration of the radar into the hull structure.  This system will demonstrate capability in FY14.\n\nFunds also cover studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution and future program planning. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

BD2 is being developed to employ a payload integration infrastructure (PII) with a Command and Control (C2) and Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) Ground Station.  This effort directly supports multiple validated CENTCOM urgent operational needs, and contributes directly to force protection and counter Improvised Explosive Device (IED) missions for coalition Forces.  BD2 is a rapid acquisition technology demonstration that started in FY 2010.  \n\nThe Blue Devil Block 2 initiative is supported by the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) and monitored intently as a program of interest by OSD's ISR Task Force.  JIEDDO in coordination with the ISR Task Force provide $9.844M in FY11 to accelerated the procurement of the ARGUS IS Electro-Optical\/Infra-Red (EO\/IR) camera system.  A $10.0M reduction in FY12 funding paid for the accelerated purchase of the ARGUS EO\/IR sensor with FY11 funding.  \n\nFunds also cover studies and analysis to support current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The MAGIC project concept was initiated in 2010 by five COCOMs ranking this initiative as the highest priority joint concept and tecnology demonstration (JCTD) but the with the Air Force accepting this initiative it is no longer under consideration as a JCTD.  \n\nData gathered from the MAGIC project will support end-to-end long endurance ISR planning.  Persistent ISR supports both regular and irregular warfare.  The challenge to supporting regular and irregular warfare is the integration of legacy ISR architectures with emerging end-to-end infrastructures.  The MAGIC project will provide the USAF with  critically needed data regarding sensor and aircraft performance parameters at a five-day duration flight.  This data will augment the Persistent ISR study completed by ACC and AFMC in March 2011.  This project is designed to meet the requirement of two joint urgent operational needs for long dwell and persistent ISR.  The objectives of the MAGIC project is to fly an RPA for a duration of five days with a minimum sensor payload of 1,000 pounds at 20,000 feet.\n\nIn FY10, OSD\/DDR&E (now ASD\/R&E) provided $5M to AFRL for initial funding of the MAGIC project.  In FY11, DDR&E provided an additional $5M to keep the project moving forward.  The Air Force followed suit and provided $3M of end of year FY11 below threshold reprogramming (BTR) to allow the Aurora Flight Sciences development team to set up for an operational five-day running engine bench test in preparation for an inflight five-day duration flight test of the Orion RPA at a later date.  The five-day duration running engine bench test is projected to occur in late January or early February 2012."
