In direct support of Combatant Commanders, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration (ASD\/NII), Military Services, and Defense Agencies, the Defense Spectrum Organization (DSO), a component of DISA, provides a full array of electromagnetic spectrum services and capabilities, ranging from short notice on-the-ground operational support at the forward edge, to long range planning in pursuit of national strategic objectives.  The DSO is the center of excellence for electromagnetic spectrum analysis and the development of integrated spectrum plans and strategies to address current and future needs for DoD spectrum access.  In addition, DSO serves as DoD's spectrum advocate at national and international forums and conducts extensive outreach to both industry and government.  DSO also implements enterprise spectrum management capabilities to enhance spectrum efficiency and agility to improve spectrum-dependent capabilities in support of United States and Coalition operations.  This includes acquiring, implementing and sustaining the Global Electromagnetic Spectrum Information System (GEMSIS) which provides an integrated catalog of joint net-centric spectrum management tools and services."

The E3 Program also supports the development of the Joint Ordnance E3 Risk Assessment Database (JOERAD) and Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) electromagnetic environmental effects (EME) surveys in support of the COCOMS and Joint Task Forces (JTF). JOERAD develops algorithms and provides analytical capabilities to perform real-time risk assessments to evaluate platform\/system safety and identify equipment limitations in the operational EM environment. JOERAD enables operators to make critical decisions about the hazards associated with the use of ordnance within complex EM environments. A Spectrum Supportability Risk Assessment (SSRA) is performed by program managers (PMs) and materiel developers (MATDEVs) on all programs that are acquiring or incorporating spectrum-dependent (S-D) systems or equipment per DoDI 4650.1.  The assessment is accomplished with due consideration to regulatory, technical, and operational spectrum and E3 issues and assigned risks.  FY 2012 funds will initiate establishment of a software tool to evaluate electromagnetic environmental effects (E3) and assess spectrum supportability risks of spectrum dependent systems in a realistic operational environment."

There is no comprehensive automated tool or service available today that allows decision makers to set priorities with the benefit of a common display of timely and relevant spectrum information.  The proposed capability would provide operational and tactical planners and commanders in the field with a comprehensive layered picture of spectrum use through a Service Oriented Architecture-based web service tied to a GIS driven by robust, accurate information.  Current manual and time intensive data gathering, correlation and visualization methods are not responsive to operational requirements and place undue risk to warfighters and mission accomplishment. SCOP will substantially reduce analysis and presentation time, from weeks\/days to minutes\/seconds.  That situational awareness will enable real time decisions based on the area of operation and mission planning factors, resulting in more effective mission planning for the spectrum management community as well as for operations planners, electronic warfare planners, and intelligence collection."
