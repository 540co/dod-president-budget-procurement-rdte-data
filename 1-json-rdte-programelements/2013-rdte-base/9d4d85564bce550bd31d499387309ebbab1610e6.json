            "val": "The Advanced IT Services Joint Program Office (AITS-JPO) identifies and integrates new, mature commercial Information Technology (IT) and advanced operational concepts into net-centric battlespace capabilities to:  access and exchange critical information; exploit opportunities to enhance current force capabilities; and project future force IT requirements.  These products provide the Department of Defense (DoD) and National Senior Leaders, (e.g., the President of the United States (POTUS), Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), Combatant Commands (COCOMs)), as well as inter-agency participants with critical focus on the long-term collaboration, planning and information sharing operations by bringing together technology, security cooperation, and education.  The program components support preparation for future joint and coalition initiatives through development and integration of a full range of data services and advanced IT applications to support practical aspects of approved cooperative activities of the United States and its coalition partners.  These emergent capabilities are technologies that can be rapidly infused into existing tools.  \n\nProgram investments in advanced technology benefit strategic and tactical users in the intelligence, warfighting and business domains by providing them with reliable, persistent collaboration, and networking technologies including computing-on-demand to reduce the need to replicate data or services at the point of consumption.  Investments also provide support for virtual end-user environments and semantic search capabilities which enhance the decision-making process.  The goal of the AITS-JPO is to provide the warfighter with technical superiority and to achieve interoperability and integration, while working in concert with joint, allied and coalition forces to effectively counter terrorism and enhance homeland security defense through the confluence of technology, security cooperation, and education.\n\nThe program uses three key mechanisms to streamline the process of fielding emergent requirements:  (1) Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTD) with Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) \/COCOM\/Service\/Agency teaming; (2) Joint Ventures with Combatant Commanders\/Program of Record (POR) teaming; and (3) Risk Mitigation Pilots with POR\/Community of Interest (COI) teaming.  The JCTD process aligns with the revised Joint Capability Integration and Development System (JCIDS) process, developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff by adapting technology and concept solutions to meet pressing warfighter needs.  OSD approves new JCTDs annually and on a rolling start basis.  DISA participates in both an operational and transition manager role.  The JCTDs, along with the Joint ventures and risk mitigation pilots, feature teaming with appropriate offices so that funds and skill sets are leveraged across all participants.  The costs are shared, thus reducing the risk to individual organizations.  \n\nThe program is further divided into major subprogram areas:  Command and Control (C2) and Combat Support (CS), Information Sharing (IS), Network Infrastructure (NI), Network Operations (NetOps), Cyber Threat Discovery and Program Management Support.\n\nIf funds are not provided in FY 2013, DISA will not be able to rapidly deliver high-value capabilities and expose them to the enterprise and warfighter."

The focus of the FY 2011 capabilities included the ability to place global and national level events into context using a contextual reasoning framework and automating and refining outdated business processes in today's national operations and intelligence center. The operational utility assessment included favorable comments from the VCJCS on the delivered NSLDSS framework and technical underpinnings. Further, decision aid tools and infrastructure components were added as a means of providing improved decision making based on improved capabilities to understand an event, visualizing the various courses of action, and understanding the context and ramifications of the actions.  These capabilities expanded user credentialing via personal attribute based access to interface with the Enterprise Identity Attribute Service to securely harvest the personal information that will improve unanticipated user access. Further, initial integration and demonstration of a machine identity capability was successfully demonstrated and will be part of the Local Attribute Store (LAS)\/Contextual Policy Decision Point (CPDP) transition. A mediation service for Universal Core and DoD Metadata Standard (CDMS) schemas provided improved data interoperability. The CDMS Mediation Service successfully demonstrated a translation capability using Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) Extensible Markup Language (XML) as source and output in a situational awareness schema.  CDMS transitioned to Program Executive Office Command and Control Capabilities (PEO-C2C) on 1 July 2011, three months ahead of schedule.  This provided a mediation service to the Enterprise and fills a gap in core Enterprise services.  Preferred Force Generator (PFG) started on 1 July 2011 following the continuing resolution and congressional approval. PFG was able to leverage portions of the NSLDSS Framework and Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) to help accelerate initial capability and to demonstrate the ability to populate preferred forces in support of Global Force Management. PFG allows secure and reliable access and exposure of C2 data. Rapid Development and Sustainment of Enterprise Mission Services (RDEMS) provided engineering support to Joint Staff, United States European Command (EUCOM), United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM), and other COCOMs-designated data sources exposing new data sources in a NCES-compliant web services. RDEMS delivered a \u2018how-to\u2019 guide for engineers to assist in integration of NCES Compliant standards and specifications.

Market research during the acquisition process included a review of DISA contracts, other DoD contract vehicles, and other Government agency contracts which were advertised for Government-wide usage.  This market research also included consideration of small business, minority\/women owned (8A), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), mentor\/prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and other specialized contract vehicles and processes.  It evaluated all contractors available from DISA sources for their ability to deliver the products specifically required for the unique program efforts.  The program works collaboratively with vendors when possible to obtain generic cost data for planning and analysis purposes.  Past and current contract prices for similar work and other government-wide agency contracts provided additional sources of information.  Quotes from multiple sources helped provide averages for more realistic cost estimates.  DISA makes a concerted effort to award many of its contracts to small businesses.  Additionally, many of the DISA contracts were awarded with multiple option periods that have the benefit of fixing labor costs over an extended period and minimizing the administrative costs associated with re-issuing short-term contracts every year or two.  The Advanced Concepts Office (ACO) has reviewed existing contract vehicles and continues to review the number of contracts to minimize administrative overhead.  Instead of three contracts for program management, business line improvement, asset management, and financial management, there is now one small business program services contract that provides services across DISA.  Another acquisition initiative was the creation and publicizing of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit a wide range of vendor Research and Development participation and to provide a contracting path that minimizes contract lead time.  The BAA was successful in FY 2010 and ended in May 2011."

These guidance documents outline the basic objectives, schedule, and funding for the JCTD.  The JCTD model is to build it, allow the user to try it and provide comments, so that fixes can be made rapidly, which enables the capabilities to be delivered to the users earlier.  During the first year, the JCTD develops and documents the detailed objectives against which the Operational Sponsor (a COCOM) will assess military utility, as well as the detailed mechanisms by which military utility will be assessed and results measured.  Regular oversight is maintained through JCTD program managers who are the central point of contact for maintaining cognizance over cost, schedule, and performance and for managing program risk.  The program also incorporates internal processes to enhance financial reporting and track contractor spending.
