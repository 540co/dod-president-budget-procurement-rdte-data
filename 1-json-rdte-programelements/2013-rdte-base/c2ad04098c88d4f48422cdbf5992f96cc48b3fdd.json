            "val": "B-52 MODERNIZATION PROGRAMS\nPrior to FY13, all B-52 modernization programs were funded in a single BPAC, 675039 B-52 Modernization.  B-52 modernization is a comprehensive program to ensure B-52 viability to perform current and future wartime missions to include datalinks, navigation, sensors, weapons, and electronic warfare (EW) and training capabilities.  B-52 modernization (initiated in FY 2005) integrates and adds both tactical and global datalink communications for real time command and control, targeting, and intelligence.  It upgrades antiquated air traffic management (ATM) systems with those supported by three key functions using satellite technology:  Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS).  Modernization upgrades training devices to support aircrew and maintenance training with the latest B-52 capability.  In addition, modernization improves conventional warfare capability with additional MIL-STD-1760 smart weapons and improved weapons carriage and fully integrates advanced targeting pods with the offensive avionics system.  B-52 modernization upgrades or replaces legacy defensive EW systems to include the radar warning receiver, jammers, chaff and flare dispensers and situational awareness displays as well as integration of offensive EW such as the Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) and MALD-Jammer (MALD-J).   Lastly, B-52 Modernization replaces the current aging strategic radar capability with a state-of-the-art, non-developmental radar.\n\nCONECT \nThe B-52 Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) acquisition program supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with tactical datalink and voice communications capabilities along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. The CONECT upgrade includes new multi-functional color displays (MFCDs) and a digital interphone system, which will survive and function through the nuclear environment to enhance crew interaction and situational awareness. To enable net centric operations, the CONECT upgrade integrates:  on-board client\/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions;  UHF Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability via ARC-210 Warrior radio to exchange J-Series messaging within theater; Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR); limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link supporting e-mail and file transfers; and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink to significantly enhance close air support (CAS) missions. This integrated suite will provide the B-52 fleet with a machine-to-machine data transfer capability supporting aircraft re-tasking and re-targeting of Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile\/JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM\/JASSM-ER), and other J-series weapons across the range of B-52 military operations and missions. \n\nIn FY13, the CONECT program will be restructured and reduced to only replacing the current Multi-Function Displays (MFD\u2019s) located at each of the crew stations, making the temporary Evolutionary Data Link (EDL) modification permanent, and demoding the CONECT test aircraft as required.  However, the current CONECT development effort in FY12 will be completed as planned and the technical design\/baseline will be maintained in support of future budget decisions.\n\nAs the remaining requirement of the CONECT program restructure, the Multi-Function Display (MFD) Replacement will develop wire-harnesses and installation tray configurations for the MFDs in each of the 76 B-52 aircraft.  The existing legacy displays at each crew station will be removed and replaced with stock listed MFDs.  This effort will replace the current MFDs due to long standing obsolescence issues.  This configuration WILL NOT provide additional capability beyond what is currently available, but will retain growth potential for future upgrades.\n\nEvolutionary Data Link (EDL) was intended a bridge program to provide a secure voice\/datalink capability between ground combat personnel and the B-52 weapon system, providing situational awareness of where friendly forces are in relation to enemy forces during targeting efforts while using precision guided weapons in combat.  Originally fielded as a T1 Modification, the EDL 3.1 program will be finalized as a permanent modification, which entails procurement of sufficient Group B kits to modify the remainder of the fleet, along with procurement of spares and a long-term maintenance strategy with sufficient cover through the end of the aircraft's life cycle.  Additional full-up kits will also be required to modify aircrew and ground maintenance trainers.  Technical orders, operational procedure directives, and drawings will need to be generated from existing temporary documents.  No additional certification testing (DT\/OT) is anticipated, as at the end of EDL 3.1 fielding the program office will consider this a fielded, operational system.\n\nB-52 EHF \nThe B-52 Extremely High Frequency (EHF) program integrates and installs the B-52 fleet with the equipment needed to provide secure, survivable two-way EHF SATCOM link for Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) and report-backs to meet Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) nuclear protected Information Exchange Requirements (IERs). The B-52 EHF will install\/integrate the Family of Advanced Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Terminal (FAB-T) Airborne Wideband Terminal system developed and procured by Space and Missile Center (SMC) through PE 0303601F or other equivalent terminals\/solutions, as necessary to meet user requirements.  The B-52 EHF will also integrate a high data rate BLOS communication link supporting IP-based Global Information Grid (GIG) interoperability into the B-52 architecture. The B-52 EHF program is planned to be accomplished in two increments. Increment 1 preserves the existing B-52 capability to receive EAMs and report-backs via SATCOM to include an Environmental Control System (ECS) modification required to support the additional communication equipment.  Increment 2 provides GIG and net-ready capability as well as full integration with other-B-52 systems.\n\nThe B-52 EHF program will be terminated in FY13 for higher AF priorities.\n \nTRAINERS AND UPGRADES FOR CONECT, EHF & SR2  \nIn order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the CONECT, EHF & SR2 programs will update existing trainers or use computer-based training to add CONECT, EHF & SR2 functionality to meet user-training requirements and establish a system integration laboratory (SIL) for updates of the Weapon System Trainers (WST).  \nThe Trainer and upgrades for CONECT, EHF, and SR2 will be terminated in FY13 for higher AF priorities.\n\nSR2  \nThe B-52 Strategic Radar Replacement (SR2) program replaces the current AN\/APQ-166 Strategic Radar fielded in the 1960s and then upgraded in the 1970s and 1980s.  Although modified several times, it has never been totally replaced and several parts of the system remain from the original design, such as the antenna reflector, feed, and casting.  The legacy APQ-166 radar is becoming unsupportable with increasing signs of performance degradation and multiple DMS and materiel shortage issues. The SR2 program is a radar replacement program that may take advantage of the advanced capabilities of modern non-developmental radars, maximizing commonality with other platforms.  The B-52 SR2 Program will integrate, test, and field a modern radar system, which supports all weather targeting and navigation to support the requirements of keeping the B-52 combat capable for its extended service life.  Additionally, the remaining two legacy MFCDs will be upgraded to take advantage of the replacement radar's full capability.\n\nThe B-52 SR2 program will be terminated in FY13 for higher AF priorities.\n\n     \n\nENGINEERING STUDIES & ANALYSIS AND TEST & EVALUATION  \nB-52 modernization funds test activities at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), engineering and planning studies for potential future weapon system enhancements (weapons, sensors, avionics and EW) and emerging requirement on current programs, upgrades to the B-52 SIL, AISF and WSTs, and weapon system operational\/safety, supportability, reliability, and Total Ownership Cost (TOC) improvements.\n\n\nARMS CONTROL ACTIVITIES\nArms Control Activities under the New START Treaty drives the need to modify a number of B-52s to a conventional only role by removing the Code Enable Switch and associated equipment.  This effort requires a complete design to remove the equipment from the aircraft and install metal plates prohibiting reinstallation of removed equipment to comply with treaty protocols.\n\n\nADDITIONAL EFFORTS  \nB-52 modernization funds additional efforts that stem from the operation and maintenance of a 50-plus-year-old aircraft, such as parts obsolescence, DMS, and emerging requirements to add to or maintain the existing capabilities.  Examples include, but are not limited to upgrades to outdated avionics computers, mission planning interfaces to JMPS, Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS), and other mission planning systems (JMPS), upgrades to the EW suite, and studies and analysis.  All B-52 development programs support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases.  \n  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "Prior to FY13, all B-52 modernization programs were funded in a single BPAC, 675039 B-52 Modernization.\n\nB-52 MODERNIZATION PROGRAMS\nB-52 modernization is a comprehensive program to ensure B-52 viability to perform current and future wartime missions to include datalinks, navigation, sensors, weapons, and electronic warfare (EW) and training capabilities.  B-52 modernization (initiated in FY 2005) integrates and adds both tactical and global datalink communications for real time command and control, targeting, and intelligence.  It upgrades antiquated air traffic management (ATM) systems with those supported by three key functions using satellite technology:  Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS).  Modernization upgrades training devices to support aircrew and maintenance training with the latest B-52 capability.  In addition, modernization improves conventional warfare capability with additional MIL-STD-1760 smart weapons and improved weapons carriage and fully integrates advanced targeting pods with the offensive avionics system.  B-52 modernization upgrades or replaces legacy defensive EW systems to include the radar warning receiver, jammers, chaff and flare dispensers and situational awareness displays as well as integration of offensive EW such as the Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) and MALD-Jammer (MALD-J).   Lastly, B-52 Modernization replaces the current aging strategic radar capability with a state-of-the-art, non-developmental radar.\n\nCONECT \nThe B-52 Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) acquisition program supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with tactical datalink and voice communications capabilities along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. The CONECT upgrade includes new multi-functional color displays (MFCDs) and a digital interphone system, which will survive and function through the nuclear environment to enhance crew interaction and situational awareness. To enable net centric operations, the CONECT upgrade integrates:  on-board client\/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions;  UHF Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability via ARC-210 Warrior radio to exchange J-Series messaging within theater; Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR); limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link supporting e-mail and file transfers; and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink to significantly enhance close air support (CAS) missions. This integrated suite will provide the B-52 fleet with a machine-to-machine data transfer capability supporting aircraft re-tasking and re-targeting of Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile\/JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM\/JASSM-ER), and other J-series weapons across the range of B-52 military operations and missions. \n\nIn FY13, the CONECT program will be restructured and reduced to only replacing the current Multi-Function Displays (MFD\u2019s) located at each of the crew stations, making the temporary Evolutionary Data Link (EDL) modification permanent, and demoding the CONECT test aircraft as required.  However, the current CONECT development effort in FY12 will be completed as planned and the technical design\/baseline will be maintained in support of future budget decisions.\n\nAs the remaining requirement of the CONECT program restructure, the Multi-Function Display (MFD) Replacement will develop wire-harnesses and installation tray configurations for the MFDs in each of the 76 B-52 aircraft.  The existing legacy displays at each crew station will be removed and replaced with stock listed MFDs.  This effort will replace the current MFDs due to long standing obsolescence issues.  This configuration WILL NOT provide additional capability beyond what is currently available, but will retain growth potential for future upgrades.\n\nEvolutionary Data Link (EDL) was intended a bridge program to provide a secure voice\/datalink capability between ground combat personnel and the B-52 weapon system, providing situational awareness of where friendly forces are in relation to enemy forces during targeting efforts while using precision guided weapons in combat.  Originally fielded as a T1 Modification, the EDL 3.1 program will be finalized as a permanent modification, which entails procurement of sufficient Group B kits to modify the remainder of the fleet, along with procurement of spares and a long-term maintenance strategy with sufficient cover through the end of the aircraft's life cycle.  Additional full-up kits will also be required to modify aircrew and ground maintenance trainers.  Technical orders, operational procedure directives, and drawings will need to be generated from existing temporary documents.  No additional certification testing (DT\/OT) is anticipated, as at the end of EDL 3.1 fielding the program office will consider this a fielded, operational system.\n\nB-52 EHF \nThe B-52 Extremely High Frequency (EHF) program integrates and installs the B-52 fleet with the equipment needed to provide secure, survivable two-way EHF SATCOM link for Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) and report-backs to meet Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) nuclear protected Information Exchange Requirements (IERs). The B-52 EHF will install\/integrate the Family of Advanced Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Terminal (FAB-T) Airborne Wideband Terminal system developed and procured by Space and Missile Center (SMC) through PE 0303601F or other equivalent terminals\/solutions, as necessary to meet user requirements.  The B-52 EHF will also integrate a high data rate BLOS communication link supporting IP-based Global Information Grid (GIG) interoperability into the B-52 architecture. The B-52 EHF program is planned to be accomplished in two increments. Increment 1 preserves the existing B-52 capability to receive EAMs and report-backs via SATCOM to include an Environmental Control System (ECS) modification required to support the additional communication equipment.  Increment 2 provides GIG and net-ready capability as well as full integration with other-B-52 systems.\n\nThe B-52 EHF program will be terminated in FY13 for higher AF priorities.\n \nTRAINERS AND UPGRADES FOR CONECT, EHF & SR2  \nIn order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the CONECT, EHF & SR2 programs will update existing trainers or use computer-based training to add CONECT, EHF & SR2 functionality to meet user-training requirements and establish a system integration laboratory (SIL) for updates of the Weapon System Trainers (WST).  \nThe Trainer and upgrades for CONECT, EHF, and SR2 will be terminated in FY13 for higher AF priorities.\n\nSR2  \nThe B-52 Strategic Radar Replacement (SR2) program replaces the current AN\/APQ-166 Strategic Radar fielded in the 1960s and then upgraded in the 1970s and 1980s.  Although modified several times, it has never been totally replaced and several parts of the system remain from the original design, such as the antenna reflector, feed, and casting.  The legacy APQ-166 radar is becoming unsupportable with increasing signs of performance degradation and multiple DMS and materiel shortage issues. The SR2 program is a radar replacement program that may take advantage of the advanced capabilities of modern non-developmental radars, maximizing commonality with other platforms.  The B-52 SR2 Program will integrate, test, and field a modern radar system, which supports all weather targeting and navigation to support the requirements of keeping the B-52 combat capable for its extended service life.  Additionally, the remaining two legacy MFCDs will be upgraded to take advantage of the replacement radar's full capability.\n\nThe B-52 SR2 program will be terminated in FY13 for higher AF priorities.\n\n     \n\nENGINEERING STUDIES & ANALYSIS AND TEST & EVALUATION  \nB-52 modernization funds test activities at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), engineering and planning studies for potential future weapon system enhancements (weapons, sensors, avionics and EW) and emerging requirement on current programs, upgrades to the B-52 SIL, AISF and WSTs, and weapon system operational\/safety, supportability, reliability, and Total Ownership Cost (TOC) improvements.\n\n\nARMS CONTROL ACTIVITIES\nArms Control Activities under the New START Treaty drives the need to modify a number of B-52s to a conventional only role by removing the Code Enable Switch and associated equipment.  This effort requires a complete design to remove the equipment from the aircraft and install metal plates prohibiting reinstallation of removed equipment to comply with treaty protocols.\n\n\nADDITIONAL EFFORTS  \nB-52 modernization funds additional efforts that stem from the operation and maintenance of a 50-plus-year-old aircraft, such as parts obsolescence, DMS, and emerging requirements to add to or maintain the existing capabilities.  Examples include, but are not limited to upgrades to outdated avionics computers, mission planning interfaces to JMPS, Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS), and other mission planning systems (JMPS), upgrades to the EW suite, and studies and analysis.  All B-52 development programs support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases.  \n  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Boeing designed, developed, tested and procured the necessary equipment from their subcontractors; developed engineering drawings, logistic and technical data, and time compliance technical order (TCTO) for installation on the B-52.  The EMD effort included installing and testing CONECT equipment on a B-52 aircraft.  The B-52 EHF EMD prime contract was a sole source to Boeing DSS, Wichita, KS.  Boeing preserved the B-52 capability to receive EAMS and report-backs, upgraded current SIL and the environmental control system.  The Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort includes installing and testing the EHF equipment on a B-52 aircraft. \n\nThe B-52 ATP program software development contract is sole sourced to Boeing DSS, Wichita.  The ATP trainer development contract will be awarded by OO-ALC via their trainer contract.  \n\nThe 1760 Internal Weapons Bay program will acquire software development and hardware design via a sole-source contract to Boeing DSS, Wichita, KS.  Deliverables include an updated J-series weapon SMOs (software), a prototype modified CSRL, logistics support, ground and flight test support, and engineering drawings.  Production of IWIU, required for each modified CSRL, and will be sole source to Boeing.  The program will competitively procure the CSRL modification kits (cables, connectors, and mounting brackets).\n\nThe B-52 Anti-Skid program is a joint effort between OC-ALC and OO-ALC.  The modification will be implemented via Program Depot Maintenance (PDM) and Contract Field Team (CFT).\n\nThe B-52 Strategic Radar Replacement (SR2) Program was a sustainment upgrade to the B-52H fleet by leveraging existing technologies, designs, and radar components (e.g., line replaceable units (LRUs) already in production and fielded on other military platforms.  It used existing, mature, proven technologies and focused resources on identifying and reducing the risk associated with integrating a modern radar onto the B-52H platform.  The SR2 program was created to replace the AN\/APQ-166 radar and several components in the Offensive Avionics System (OAS) associated with managing the video chain. Closeout activities will begin in FY12 due to program termination beginning in FY13.\n\nThe Mode S\/5 IFF Program is in the initial stage of acquisition planning.  A detailed acquisition plan will be developed based on the results of the engineering studies being completed by Boeing, Wichita, KS.  \n\nThe Tactical Data Link (TDL) will be sole source to Boeing DSS, Wichita, KS for the integration of TDL based on the CONECT baseline.  \n\nThe Reconstitution of B-52 Nuclear Capability Study will be sole source to Boeing DSS."

This effort leverages the Integrated Weapons Interface Unit (IWIU) hardware developed under the Advanced Weapons Integration (AWI) program and previous work accomplished for a 2005 demonstration or developed using 2006 and 2007 Congressional Add funding. Production requirements include modification of 76 B-52 aircraft (Group A) and 44 CSRLs (Group B). No new CSRLs will be procured with this effort. This program will install MIL-STD 1760 interface cables and connectors on all B-52 aircraft, and will remove current munitions interface components, cables, connectors and mounting brackets from 44 CSRLs and replace removed items with MIL-STD 1760 capable components. Modified CSRLs will become \"Conventional Rotary Launchers (CRLs)\" and will lose their nuclear capability until integration of the MIL-STD 1760 Series II nuclear munitions and development and integration of a nuclear hardened IWIU. The sole line Replaceable Unit (LRU) for this modification is the IWIU, which is the same unit used for control of MIL-STD 1760-based munitions carried externally on the pylon.  Phase I of the program, which supports eight-carriage capability on the CRL, will procure and install 44 IWIU pairs (one pair per CRL). Phase 2 will provide carriage expansion on the CRL through a software modification, and will increase the number of weapon stations from 8 to 16. Phase II will occur after Phase I procurement and installation is complete, using RDT&E funding.  \n\nB-52 Advanced Weapons Integration (AWI) initiatives previously managed under MN-4260 are now managed under three separate modifications for clarity in effort, funding and schedule. The initiatives are now described in MN-4260 Advanced Weapons Integration, MN-4693 Avionics Midlife Improvements, and MN-6884 MIL-STD-1760."

Beginning in FY13, Project Number 675039 will be used for B-52 Modernization RDT&E funding only.\n\nMode S\/5 IFF\nMode S\/5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) is part of the Communication Navigation Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) effort and will develop and integrate modern technology into the B-52 to enable it to operate in the evolving air traffic environment.  This effort is driven by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandates to comply with performance standards to allow the B-52 to operate safely in controlled airspaces.  This program will also yield significant savings through more efficient flight routes and altitudes.  The Mode S\/5 portion includes upgrade of the current APX-64 with the APX-119 and will possess architecture to include in a future modification the simultaneous integration of Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) capability required for operations in European airspace by 2015 and CONUS airspace by 2020.  Data Guard is needed to prevent transmissions of classified data from the 1553 data bus. \n\nCNS\/ATM \nCapabilities identified under CNS\/ATM activities will include Frequency Management (FM) immunity, digital communications (voice and data), improved navigation accuracy such as Required Navigation Performance (RNP) or Global Positioning System (GPS) enhancements, Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM), Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), enhanced situational awareness such as Mode S\/Mode 5 IFF, Communications Management Unit, HF Data Link, 8.33MHz Very High Frequency (VHF), Auto Dependent Surveillance (both address and broadcast), and any follow-on activities to associated components\/systems resulting from modifications to CNS\/ATM systems.\n\nBA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The current CONECT development program will be completed as intended.\n\nThe B-52 Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) acquisition program supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with tactical datalink and voice communications capabilities along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. The CONECT upgrade includes new multi-functional color displays (MFCDs) and a digital interphone system, which will survive and function through the nuclear environment to enhance crew interaction and situational awareness. To enable net centric operations, the CONECT upgrade integrates:  on-board client\/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions;  UHF Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability via ARC-210 Warrior radio to exchange J-Series messaging within theater; Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR); limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link supporting e-mail and file transfers; and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink to significantly enhance close air support (CAS) missions. This integrated suite will provide the B-52 fleet with a machine-to-machine data transfer capability supporting aircraft re-tasking and re-targeting of Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile\/JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM\/JASSM-ER), and other J-series weapons across the range of B-52 military operations and missions. \n\nAs the remaining requirement of the CONECT program restructure, the Multi-Function Display (MFD) Replacement will develop wire-harnesses and installation tray configurations for the MFDs in each of the 76 B-52 aircraft.  The existing legacy displays at each crew station will be removed and replaced with stock listed MFDs.  This effort will replace the current MFDs due to long standing obsolescence issues.  This configuration WILL NOT provide additional capability beyond what is currently available, but will retain growth potential for future upgrades.\n\nEvolutionary Data Link (EDL) was intended a bridge program to provide a secure voice\/datalink capability between ground fighting personnel and the B-52 weapon system, providing situational awareness of where friendly forces are in relation to enemy forces during targeting efforts while using precision guided weapons in combat.  Originally fielded as a T1 Modification, the EDL 3.1 program will be finalized as a permanent modification, which entails procurement of sufficient Group B kits to modify the remainder of the fleet, along with procurement of spares and a long-term maintenance strategy with sufficient cover through the end of the aircraft's life cycle.  Additional full-up kits will also be required to modify aircrew and ground maintenance trainers.  Technical orders, operational procedure directives, and drawings will need to be generated from existing temporary documents.  No additional certification testing (DT\/OT) is anticipated, as at the end of EDL 3.1 fielding the program office will consider this a fielded, operational system.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The B-52 Anti-skid system prevents aircraft skidding by sensing the exact amount of brake pressure needed for safe braking under all runway conditions without tire damage.  Previous B-52 Anti-skid supportability analysis, completed in 2006 by General Atomics, indicated a supportability end date of 2011, based on parts obsolescence, a lack of test equipment and a lack of repair personnel.  Parts obsolescence continues to be a major supportability factor.  However, since the previous analysis, test equipment and new depot maintenance procedures to refurbish previously failed Anti-skid detectors have been put in place in order to provide spares until 2014\/2015 when the replacement will be available.  The Anti-skid Replacement program develops and installs a new system.  This effort includes an upgrade of the maintenance trainers."
