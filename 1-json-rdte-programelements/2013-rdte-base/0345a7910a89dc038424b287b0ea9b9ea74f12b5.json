Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements, a thorough market survey, and development of a viable acquisition strategy.  A seven-day Congressional notification of the intent to fund the most meritorious projects is required, prior to the issuance of funds to the Services and USSOCOM for execution.\n\nSince the program's inception in 1980, Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) has initiated 646 projects; 551 projects have been completed to date.  Of the 279 evaluations that met the sponsors' requirements, 231 led to procurements worth approximately $10.950 billion in FY 2011 constant year dollars.  With an Office of Secretary of Defense investment of about $1.128 billion, the FCT Program realized an estimated RDT&E cost avoidance of $7.800 billion in FY 2011 constant year dollars.\n\nThe FCT Program is a catalyst for teaming or other business relationships between foreign and U.S. industries.  Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of the qualified foreign item in the U.S.  Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the U.S. defense market and the resultant strengthening of the \"two-way street\" in Defense procurement.  The result often means the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies throughout the United States. To date, companies across 33 states benefited from FCT projects.\n\nFinal selection of FY 2013 FCT new start projects were determined in September 2012."

A unique manufacturing technique produces a multi-layered material that is rolled into sheet having a marine grade aluminum core with a corrosion resistant outer layer.  A particular concern is an aluminum alloy\u2019s susceptibility to sensitization, a micro-structural phenomenon that increases corrosion susceptibility, and provides an environment for stress corrosion cracking.  The primary output of this project is superior aluminum with multi-layered material that is corrosion resistant in a marine environment. This will provide increased survivability, sustainability, and operational readiness compared to current decking and bulkhead plate.  Estimations for CG repair and replacement costs due to sensitization and cracking of aluminum plate is between $1.000 million and $2.000 million per repair cycle. Extrapolating this cost across the fleet over the first repair cycle would translate to costs in excess of $22.000 million that would be saved using an aluminum plate material that is capable of meeting the service lifetime requirements of 35 years."

Of the 279 evaluations that met the sponsors' requirements, 231 led to procurements worth approximately $10.850 billion in FY 2011 constant year dollars. With an OSD investment of about $1.130 billion, the FCT program has realized an estimated RDT&E cost avoidance of $7.800 billion in FY 2011 constant year dollars. In FY 2011 FCT had a transition rate of 93 percent for completed projects, exceeding the objective of 30 percent for demonstration programs."
