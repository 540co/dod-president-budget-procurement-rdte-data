            "val": "The umbrella program to exploit automation technology for the conduct of combat operations is the Army Tactical Command and Control System (ATCCS) program which is a component of the Army Battle Command System (ABCS).  The ATCCS program provides automation in the five battlefield functional areas (BFAs) with the following specific systems: (1) Maneuver Control System (MCS); (2) Effects and Fires Command and Control Systems (EFCCS); (3) All Source Analysis System (ASAS) for Intelligence\/Electronic Warfare; (4) Forward Area Air Defense Command, Control and Intelligence System (FAADC2I); and (5) Battle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3). To provide an overall technically sound, cost effective, and operationally responsive approach, the design and development of ATCCS must be accomplished on a total systems basis.  The Technical Management Division (TMD) effectively manages the engineering, Enterprise and Integration efforts within the Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communication and Tactical (PEO C3T) portfolio of technology and across the capability enhancement packages to deliver efficient and effective cross-domain technical solutions.  TMD efforts will focus on \"Systems of Systems\" (SOS) engineering and integration for evolution of the network (Warfighter Information Network-Tactical, Joint Tactical Radio System) and associated services (Unified Battle Command, Joint Battle Command-Platform, Net-Enabled Command Capability, Network Service Center) with increased emphasis on immediate Warfighter needs as well as leveraging emerging technologies.  TMD efforts support working Army Network Modernization strategy and implementation to include: network integration; emerging technologies; coordination of network services; current and force integrated Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Combat Systems, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) network\/transport architectures; integrated developmental, technical, and operational test schedules\/documentation; and the tactical assessment and execution of the enterprise implementation and framework.  TMD synchronizes the integration of many Headquarter, Department Of The Army (HQDA) initiatives and also oversees the the technical analysis supporting the Army Common Operating Environment (COE) Assessment and implementation; an integrated test strategy, certification process, and integration efforts across the C3T portfolio of systems; Operational implementation of enterprise framework, tactical Host Based Security System (HBSS) and Advance Development (AD) tests\/implementations\/integration; development of capability set SoS architectures; server consolidation; integration of transport waveforms and development of Command Post and integrated Network Architectures.  This program element also includes the Central Technical Support Facility (CTSF) which is the Army's single strategic facility responsible for executing SoS Interoperability checkout, testing, physical system integration and configuration management of the Army's LandWarNet Baseline.  The Common Hardware Systems (CHS) program provides state-of-the-art, fully qualified, interoperable, compatible, deployable, and survivable hardware and computer networking equipment for command, control, and communications at all echelons of command for the United States Army and other Department of Defense (DoD) services. CHS services are provided through strategically located contractor-operated Regional Support Centers (RSC) for tactical military units and management of a comprehensive 5-year warranty and 72-hour turnaround for repairs. Common Software(CS) is the program through which the Army procures, develops, integrates and tests common software products and\/or components used for communication between ABCS, Joint and coalition Command and Control (C2) applications.  The CS project provides state-of-the-art software technologies and functionality that is used by numerous Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS) and joint systems to eliminate the need for service independent development and duplication of effort.  The CS project also manages and performs technology demonstrations of emerging technologies for future use by Army C2 systems.  The CS program is a cornerstone in the Army's digitization efforts.  Funding supports on-going development of common software solutions and the technical evaluation of previously developed software capabilities for integration into the computing environments of the Army COE architecture to include appropriate Mounted and Mobile Computing environments.  Efforts will include assessment of software maturity and readiness, development\/modification of software as necessary to integrate, integration with common computing environments, and validation. The JNN Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T Increment 1) is intended to replace MSE while moving the Army to a unified EOIP Communications System. JNN Testing is the Increment 1b Technical Insertion to"

An Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity firm fixed priced, full and open competition contract was awarded to General Dynamics in May 2003, for ruggedization and production.\n\nIn August 2011, CHS awarded, on a best value basis, the follow-on CHS-4 contract via full and open competition.

The CS project also manages and performs technology demonstrations of emerging technologies for future use by Army C2 systems.  The CS program is a cornerstone in the Army's digitization efforts.\n\nFunding supports on-going development of common software solutions and the technical evaluation of previously developed software capabilities for integration into the computing environments of the Army Common Operating Environment (COE) architecture to include appropriate Mounted and Mobile Computing environments.  Efforts will include assessment of software maturity and readiness, development\/modification of software as necessary to integrate, integration with common computing environments, and validation."

The product development funded under this R-Form is an integral part of the ABCS, a system of systems and will be accomplished primarily under a Project Manager, Mission Command (PM MC) system of systems contract approach which consists of multiple prime contracts awarded from a single solicitation that will require each specific development task be competed among primes whenever possible.  This strategy is designed to optimize opportunity for improved interoperability among the systems, to capture the benefits of competition and to ensure the rapid integration of new capability into warfighter systems.  This strategy is designed to reduce the physical footprint, logistics support requirements and increase operational efficiency.\n\nThe overall acquisition goal of the CS program is the improvement of life cycle costs by providing common products that are used horizontally across programs avoiding duplication of efforts by Army and Joint programs."

It is the Army's strategic facility responsible for supporting and conducting system engineering associated with integrating Army Battle Command System (ABCS) Weapon System architectures into a System of Systems, performing Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) testing and conducting configuration management for all operational and tactical level applications (individual systems, System of Systems, and families of systems) prior to fielding.  The CTSF provides validated test data to the Department of the Army and Joint agencies to validate interoperability certifications.  The current expansion of the distributed test environment of the CTSF will be accomplished through the Federation of Net-centric Sites (FaNS) construct.  This FaNS construct addresses distributed integration development and testing using the core infrastructure of the CTSF to harness AMC, Army, and Joint expertise\/resources.  Through these federated resources, the CTSF will execute interoperability development and certification testing of the Warfighter and Business mission areas, to include Brigade Combat Team Modernization spin-outs, as they digitize and become part of the Army's LandWarNet.  Projected relocation of CTSF to Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, anticipated not later than FY 2014."
