We obtain these benefits only after IAC opportunities are identified, explored, assessed, developed and IAs are negotiated and concluded. This PE provides funds to execute up-front IAC responsibilities, realize cooperative opportunities, assess allied technologies and generate sound, cost-effective cooperative programs between the USAF and our international partners.  Once these initiatives, programs, and projects are concluded IAs they are transferred to the appropriate technology or systems program office and are then funded by the program office."
