Project K15 matures and demonstrates capabilities to locate and exploit enemy communication systems including computer networks. Project K16 matures and demonstrates multifunctional EW capabilities (jamming) to enhance platform survivability and provide near real-time situational awareness to the commander through the detection, identification and geo-location of emitters of interest.\n\nWork in this PE is complimentary of PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science), and fully coordinated with PE 0603003A (Aviation Advanced Technology) and PE 0603313A (Missile and Rocket Advanced Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."
