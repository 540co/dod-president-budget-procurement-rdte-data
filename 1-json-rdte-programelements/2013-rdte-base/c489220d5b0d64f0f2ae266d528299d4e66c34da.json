            "val": "This program element supports the Navy's requirements in meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) space-based remote sensors.  These requirements include commitments to satellite, sensor, and operational demonstration\/development activities as well as the transition to fleet applications associated with three satellite programs: 1) the joint Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), 2) the jointly funded Coriolis satellite which includes Navy Satellite Based Wind Speed (WindSat) and Air Force Solar Mass Ejection Imager instruments, 3) the Geodetic\/geophysical Satellite (GEOSAT) Follow-On 2 (GFO-2) altimetry satellite funded entirely by Navy.\n  \nThe Navy METOC Space-Based Sensing Capabilities project provides for Navy participation in Navy\/Air Force cooperative efforts leading to DMSP sensor development, and specifically participation in the calibration and validation of instruments and delivery of satellite products to the fleet.  The passive microwave instruments carried on the DMSP satellites provide global and atmospheric data of direct operational relevance, including sea surface wind, sea ice, and precipitation.  WindSat is a partnered program that meets multiple naval remote sensing requirements and provides a significant risk reduction for the Joint Polar Orbiting Satellite System (JPSS) satellites' Microwave Imaging Sensor instrument.\n  \nThe GEOSAT Follow-On project, and GFO-2 program, will provide a polar-orbiting satellite that measures sea surface topography using a precise altimeter.\nBoth the GEOSAT Follow-On and Navy METOC Support (Space) projects fulfill Navy's obligation to develop naval service-unique, mission critical space-based METOC technology. \n\nStarting in FY12 the Navy has delayed all Geodetic\/geophysical Satellite (GEOSAT) Follow-On 2 (GFO-2) altimetry satellite development efforts until FY 2014.\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY:  BA-7: This program is funded under OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT because it encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for upgrade of existing, operational systems."

WindSat, an initiative begun in 1997, is a partnered program that meets multiple naval remote sensing requirements and provides a significant risk reduction for the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) satellites' Conical Microwave Imaging Sensor instrument. The passive microwave instruments carried on DMSP and future JPSS satellites provide global oceanic and atmospheric data of direct operational relevance, including sea surface wind speed, sea ice, and precipitation.\n \nThe METOC Space-Based Sensing Capabilities project ensures the naval service's operational requirements are satisfied primarily through demonstration of technologies for inclusion on operational constellations such as DMSP,  the JPSS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES).  These efforts fulfill naval service unique requirements that are not funded within the DMSP, JPSS or GOES programs, and are in accordance with current inter-agency agreements.\n\nThe primary focus of the FY 2013 request is begin assessment of other national, commercial, and foreign earth observing satellite system's sensor data for use in Navy Atmospheric and Oceanographic Prediction Models."

Mission data will be collected by the Spacecraft Operations Center and passed to the Payload Operations Center, and Altimetry Data Fusion Center, which are co-located at the Naval Oceanographic Office, Stennis Space Center, MS.  Mission data is used in global and regional scale ocean forecast models.  GFO-2 will provide a capability for precise mesoscale (e.g., fronts and eddies) and basin-scale oceanography.  This capability will support tactical anti-submarine warfare, mine warfare, naval special warfare mission planning, tactical decision aids, and sensor\/weapon performance prediction.  GFO-2 will also provide an undersea warfare battlespace characterization capability that supports submarine detectability, weapon settings, sound velocity profiles, tropical cyclone intensity, and track forecasts.\n \nGFO-2 data will be made freely available to other agencies, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, who value its input to studies involving global warming and climate change, including El Nino Southern Oscillation effects.  \nOcean topography data was previously provided by GEOSAT from 1985 until the satellite failed in January 1990.  The Geodetic\/geophysical Satellite Follow-On satellite was launched in February 1998 and deorbited in November 2008.  The GEOSAT GFO-2 will provide for the continuation of this capability. \n\nThe Navy has delayed all Geodetic\/geophysical Satellite (GEOSAT) Follow-On 2 (GFO-2) altimetry satellite development efforts until FY 2014."

GEOSAT Follow-On 1 demonstrated that a space based altimeter provided the equivalent of approximately a 500-fold increase in available subsurface observations and a  10-fold increase in available surface observations, critical to characterization of the ocean environment and oceanographic modeling.  War-gaming models show that this increased knowledge of the subsurface acoustic propagation resulting from one altimeter reduced the probability of losing a ship to subsurface attack from 80% to 20% for various scenarios."
