CIGTF provides independent test and evaluation of inertial, Global Positioning System, and integrated systems used for aircraft navigation and missile guidance systems, including vulnerability to electronic interference.  HHSTT capabilities include full-scale testing in flight environments, realistic live-fire simulations, test item and target fragment recovery, and precision trajectory analysis and high speed photography.  NRTF provides radar cross section (RCS) monostatic and bistatic amplitude and phase measurements, antenna pattern measurements, glint and near field measurements for low observable targets.  Det 1 provides the liaison function for coordinating and scheduling all US Air Force test and training operations at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR).  OL-AA provides test support for the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) Directed Energy Division.  The 586th Flight Test Squadron executes flight test and test support for advanced avionics and weapons development of joint, international and commercial test programs.  The 46 TG OL-AC includes the Landing Gear Test Facility (LGTF) with capabilities such as variable and fixed inertia dynamometers, compression\/tension load applicators, 4 drop towers, a burst pit and a dynamic load simulator.

Test facilities\/capabilities operated through this program include wind tunnels, rocket and jet engine test cells, hypersonic and subsonic testing, modeling and simulation, technology, limited space environmental simulation chambers, armament test ranges, hardware-in-the-loop test facilities, climatic test facilities, avionics test facilities, aircraft testbeds, dry lakebed landing sites, instrumented test ranges, and test aircraft maintenance, as well as USAF Test Pilot School.  Test and Evaluation (T&E) Support funds institutional test infrastructure activities including:  Command and supervisory staffs; supply stocks; maintenance, repair, and replacement of worn or obsolete test equipment and facilities; test infrastructure for data collection, transmission, reduction, and analysis; civilian salaries; temporary duty travel; range operations and material support contract costs for hardware and software engineering and maintenance; and minor improvement and modernization projects.  It also funds institutional test aircraft depot level maintenance such as:  Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM), the calendar-based cyclic scheduling of aircraft into depots for update\/inspection; modifications and any other depot level repairs required by the aircraft System Program Directors (SPD); engine overhauls; depot-provided area assistance; and assorted ground support equipment overhauls.  Three major Air Force test centers are supported by this project:  (1) Arnold Engineering and Development Center (AEDC), located at Arnold Air Force Base (AFB), TN, whose institutional test infrastructure supports operations of the largest complex of ground test facilities in the world (includes transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic wind tunnels;rocket motor and turbine engine test cells; space environmental test chambers, hyperballistic ranges; and other specialized facilities). Included are operations at the National Full-Scale Aerodynamic Complex (NFAC) located at NASA's AMES Research Center, California as well as operations at Tunnel 9 located at White Oak, Maryland.(2) Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), located at Edwards AFB, CA, whose institutional test infrastructure supports weapons system development and operational test and evaluation for aircraft, aircraft subsystems and aircraft weapon systems, aerospace research vehicles, unmanned miniature vehicles, cruise missiles, parachute delivery\/recovery systems, cargo handling systems, communications, information operations, and Electronic Warfare (EW) systems for DoD and allied forces.  The AFFTC mission includes the USAF Test Pilot School.  (3) Air Armament Center (AAC) 46th Test Wing (TW) located at Eglin AFB, FL, is a joint test and training complex of 724 square miles of land area, and approximately 123,000 square miles of water area.  AAC 46TW provides the institutional test infrastructure required to conduct developmental and operational test and evaluation of non-nuclear air armaments (including aircraft guns, ammunition, and air-to-surface and air-to-air guided munitions); Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence\/Surveillance\/Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems; target acquisition and weapon delivery systems; multi-service climatic simulation capability; and special operations aircraft systems.  AAC 46TW provides a scientific test process that supports the development, production, sustainment, and enhancement of munitions systems that support tri-service digital weapons development. T&E support services contracts are awarded on the basis of full and open competition. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts, and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, and test and evaluation."
