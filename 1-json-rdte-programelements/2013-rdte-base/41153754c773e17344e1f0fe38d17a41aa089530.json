JAWP often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.       JAWP resources underwrite a small dedicated staff of civilian military operation research analysts (currently hosted by the Institute for Defense Analysis - IDA).    Administered by the Joint Operations Support cell within OSD\/AT&L, the JAWP conducts an annual call for inputs from Combantant Command staffs elements  that formulate Capability Gap assessments and technology based initiatives .   Project selection is undertaken in consulatation  with the OSD staffs  serving AT&L and Policy and with lements of the Joint Staff."
