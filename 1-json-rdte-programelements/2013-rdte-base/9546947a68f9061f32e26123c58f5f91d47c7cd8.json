            "val": "Our military forces require resilient, reliable networks and computer systems to conduct effective operations. However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it urgent and critical to improve the cyber security of Department of Defense (DoD) networks to counter those threats and assure our missions. This program focuses on innovative and sustained research in both cyber security and computer network operations to develop new concepts to harden key network and computer components, design new resilient cyber infrastructures, increase the military\u2019s ability to fight and survive during cyber attacks, disrupt nation-state level attack planning and execution, measure the state of cyber security, and explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance. \n\nThe Cyber Advanced Technology Development program element is budgeted in the advanced technology development budget activity because it will focus on the maturation of successful applied research results and their development into demonstrable advanced cyber capabilities. The Cyber Advanced Technology\nDevelopment program will build on results of matured applied research from the Cyber Applied Research Program and other programs to develop technology demonstrations for potential transition into capabilities that support the full spectrum of computer network operations.  These approaches will include moving from cyber defense to cyber resilience by changing the defensive terrain of our existing digital infrastructure, identifying ways to raise the risk and lower the value of attack from an advanced, persistent cyber threat, and focusing on mission assurance. \n\nThis program focuses on integrating computer network defense and computer network operations, addressing the advanced persistent threat, and filling DoD technology gaps as determined by assessments conducted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research & Engineering (OASD(R&E)) over the past year."
