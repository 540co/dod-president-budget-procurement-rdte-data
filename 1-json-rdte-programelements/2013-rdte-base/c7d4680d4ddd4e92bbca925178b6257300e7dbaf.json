            "val": "This program element provides for recapitalization, continuing research and development, and integration of aircrew flight equipment\/airmen combat effectiveness equipment and subsystems to satisfy operational command requirements for improved\/enhanced airmen performance capabilities.  Aircrew flight equipment\/airmen combat effectiveness systems consist of human-centered programs that enable weapons systems to use more of their full mission envelopes, maximize combat capabilities, and protect airmen.  This includes, but is not limited to, the following projects: directed energy protective equipment, flight helmets and visors, oxygen breathing equipment for aviators, radios and locator beacons to include support equipment, nuclear flash blindness protection, night vision devices, noise reduction devices, anti-g suits, flame resistant\/retardant and blast protective gear, aircraft seating, impact protection, flotation devices, and personnel parachutes.  Program management support includes tasks to assess deficiencies of currently fielded equipment, evaluate and demonstrate feasibility of new technologies, provide for the transition of new technologies to development programs\/projects, conduct business case analyses, assess suitability of commercially available items, and support all current aircrew flight equipment\/airmen combat effectiveness programs.\n\nThe Integrated Aircrew Ensemble (IAE) develops a readily-configurable integrated flight ensemble to improve safety, survival, and performance using modern materials, and addresses full spectrum of aircrew requirements for manned non-space aircraft and foster commonality across most aircraft platforms.  IAE will replace the multiple layers of flight gear, to include the flight suit, g-suit, survival vest, and other equipment, used during flying operations.  The system will increase acceleration protection, maximize performance and reduce thermal burden throughout full range of military operations.  There are three proposed variants: ejection seat, rotary wing, and non-ejection seat aircraft.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

Aircrew flight equipment\/airmen combat effectiveness systems consist of human-centered programs that enable weapons systems to use more of their full mission envelopes, maximize combat capabilities, and protect airmen.  This includes, but is not limited to, the following projects: directed energy protective equipment, flight helmets and visors, oxygen breathing equipment for aviators, radios and locator beacons to include support equipment, nuclear flash blindness protection, night vision devices, noise reduction devices, anti-g suits, flame resistant\/retardant and blast protective gear, aircraft seating, impact protection, flotation devices, and personnel parachutes.  Program management support includes tasks to assess deficiencies of currently fielded equipment, evaluate and demonstrate feasibility of new technologies, provide for the transition of new technologies to development programs\/projects, conduct business case analyses, assess suitability of commercially available items, and support all current aircrew flight equipment\/airmen combat effectiveness programs.\n\nThe Integrated Aircrew Ensemble (IAE) develops a readily-configurable integrated flight ensemble to improve safety, survival, and performance using modern materials, and addresses full spectrum of aircrew requirements for manned non-space aircraft and foster commonality across most aircraft platforms.  IAE will replace the multiple layers of flight gear, to include the flight suit, g-suit, survival vest, and other equipment, used during flying operations.  The system will increase acceleration protection, maximize performance and reduce thermal burden throughout full range of military operations.  There are three proposed variants: ejection seat, rotary wing, and non-ejection seat aircraft.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."
