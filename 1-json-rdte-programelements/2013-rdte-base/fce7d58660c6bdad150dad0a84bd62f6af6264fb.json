Air Force A5XS ensures accurate representation of air, space and cyber space capabilities in joint activities, through modeling and simulation and wargaming activities. The primary activity this is accomplished with is the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force\u2019s Unified Engagement (UE) wargame series. UE is a two cycle of plan, execute, analyze and report of activities that include workshops, seminars, capstone event, senior leader seminar, and Building Partnership Capacity events. The capstone event includes over 400 Joint, other Agency, and coalition partners supported by cutting edge technology. The Wargaming Environment (WIE) evolves with each UE game cycle and is made up of three main parts GamePoint, ViewPoint, and Modeling and Simulation Tools.  GamePoint provides the latest collaboration and information throughout and during the wargame and associated events. ViewPoint provides users a simple method to visually view the information and conduct their own analysis. Modeling and Simulation provides integration of the latest modeling, simulation and analysis tools and also the infrastructure to support the WIE. This program is categorized in Budget Activity (BA) 07 because it supports the development efforts of operational systems."

Air Force A5XS ensures accurate representation of air, space and cyber space capabilities in joint activities, through modeling and simulation and wargaming activities. The primary activity this is accomplished with is the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force\u2019s Unified Engagement (UE) wargame series. UE is a two cycle of plan, execute, analyze and report of activities that include workshops, seminars, capstone event, senior leader seminar, and Building Partnership Capacity events. The capstone event includes over 400 Joint, other Agency, and coalition partners supported by cutting edge technology. The Wargaming Environment (WIE) evolves with each UE game cycle and is made up of three main parts GamePoint, ViewPoint, and Modeling and Simulation Tools.  GamePoint provides the latest collaboration and information throughout and during the wargame and associated events. ViewPoint provides users a simple method to visually view the information and conduct their own analysis. Modeling and Simulation provides integration of the latest modeling, simulation and analysis tools and also the infrastructure to support the WIE.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
