NG-ABIS provides a robust capability for distinguishing friend from foe in hot spots around the globe.  NG-ABIS enables near-instantaneous device-to-database communication and lays the foundation for enhanced device-to-device communication, reducing cycle and response times.  NG-ABIS receives submissions from existing QRC-based collection devices.  NG-ABIS also receives requests by authorized users to perform storage retrieval and searches of biometric data collection and matching results.  NG-ABIS provides a reliable and effective tool for overseas operations by allowing the Warfighter to make near real-time retention, capture, or release decision.\n \nThe NG-ABIS QRC will be the initial baseline capability for the BEC Program of Record (POR).  NG-ABIS becomes BEC Increment 0 at the Full Deployment Decision (FDD) in FY2012 when the POR will be established.  This was delayed from 3rd quarter FY2011 due to a delay in the enhanced NG-ABIS software deployment.\n \nThe BEC program has an associated Analysis of Alternatives that has been conducted in support of BEC Increment 1, a follow-on acquisition program that is conducting pre-Milestone B activities.  Milestone B is projected for FY2013."

On 06 July 2009, the USA AT&L issue an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) authorizing directing the Army to conduct an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for the Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) program. The Army published a BEC AoA report on 30 April 2010 that recommended an enhanced status quo acquisition approach for BEC.  This approach begins with establishing the current capability as BEC Increment 0 at a Full Deployment Decision currently scheduled in FY12.  This will be followed by BEC Increment 1, which will enter the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase of acquisition with a Milestone B in FY13.  BEC Increment 1 will provide new capabilities beyond the current DoD Automated Biometric Identification System (DoD ABIS).  To achieve these additional capabilities in a cost-effective and timely manner, the BEC Increment 1 evolutionary Acquisition Strategy will include agile acquisition processes approved by the PEO EIS that will allow the PM DoD Biometrics to provide multiple, rapid deliveries of incremental capabilities to the user for operational use and evaluation.  PM DoD Biometrics has prepared a forward-looking Acquisition Strategy for the BEC Increment 1 Program that is compliant with the Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.2 process, yet through tailoring is agile enough to provide rapid release of new capabilities to the user and Warfighter."
