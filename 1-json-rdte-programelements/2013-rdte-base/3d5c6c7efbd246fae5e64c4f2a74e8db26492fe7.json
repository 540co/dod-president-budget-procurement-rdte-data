            "val": "Explore alternative surface ship force structures, advanced surface ship and unmanned surface vehicles concepts, and the potential technologies for these force structures and advanced concepts in support of pre-acquisition mission needs analysis, mission area analysis, and planning. The objective is a more affordable, mission capable surface ship force including increased ship production capability; ships with reduce manning, reduced operating and support costs, and greater utilization of the latest technology. The program directly supports the Navy Shipbuilding Plan with state-of-the-art design tools and methods for surface ship force structure alternative studies, ship & unmanned vehicle concept studies, and the actual conduct of surface ship force structure alternative studies and advanced design concept studies for the ships that may become part of the shipbuilding plan.\n\nProject 2196 - This project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced ship concept studies, ship and ship systems technology assessments, and the development and upgrade of\nship concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria.\n\nProject 3161 - This project funds a prioritized portfolio of time-sensitive initiatives supporting NAVSEA Technical Authority through integrated efforts in Cross Platform Systems Development (CPSD), furthering Sea Enterprise through the development of support elements for Technical Warrant Holders and meeting relevant needs of the warfare community.  The areas of exploration for CPSD include surface ship concept advanced development, submarine concepts, next generation unmanned surface vehicle, high speed ships\/crafts, tool integration and technical data exchange, embedded interoperability engineering, and mission capability systems engineering.  The research products developed by this project directly support and influence both immediate fleet requirements and future acquisition programs by providing a range of technically acceptable alternatives and evaluation of emerging technologies.  \n\nIn particular, tasks within this project continue to directly support interoperability testing and certification for Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) and other platforms in deploying battle groups, development and certification of Safe Operating Envelope (SOE) tools for surface combatants (CG 47, DDG 51, DDG 1000), American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) pilot program to determine engineering-based combatant service life values based on fatigue and other structural analyses, implementation of Component Commonality in current Navy ship acquisition to reduce total ownership and maintenance costs, Total Ownership Cost (TOC) pilot programs, and development of specifications and processes to reduce production costs of platforms.  \n\nTasks within this project continue to directly support the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) execution for multiple ship classes including, LCS, JHSV, and DDG 1000 reducing Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E) costs, furthered validation of hydrodynamic simulation tool supporting DDG 1000 Hull Form Plan (HFP), have increased technology readiness level for aluminum combatants, developed tools to execute the CG 47 Cracking Task Force recommendations, increased situational awareness for deploying strike groups, and conducted feasibility studies of future Railgun capabilities.  This project supports NAVSEA's core mission and enhances its ability to conduct independent technical authority which allows for improved performance and reduced cost of current and future naval platforms."

It also supports the next step in the development of a transformed naval force by accomplishing the pre-milestone A (especially pre-concept decision) efforts for all potential surface ships and craft. These efforts are the required first step in the integration of total ship systems, including combat systems, weapons systems and Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&E) systems. Inadequate early planning and ship concept formulation can result in down-stream design, construction and operational problems. A more subtle and severely negative impact of neglecting this early effort is that the \"best\" concepts and technologies may never even be considered and our greatest potential ship design advances never realized. Designs and technologies must meet the threat. This project supports this requirement.\n\nThis project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced ship concept studies, ship and ship systems technology assessments, and the development and upgrade of ship concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria are also funded in this project.\n\nThis project accomplishes the following: (1) Develops alternative surface ship force structure concepts including the ships and unmanned vehicles; (2) Evaluates the mission capability effectiveness and costs for these alternative surface fleet architectures; (3) Performs fleet war fighting\/mission effectiveness assessment studies; (4) Identifies future surface ship requirements and characteristics necessary to meet future threats and support mission needs; (5) Investigates new affordable ship concepts and evaluates technologies necessary to support these concepts; (6) Provides design methods and automated design tools to develop and evaluate ship concepts; and (7) Supports development of Initial Capabilities Documents (ICD) and analogous early requirements documents for future ships. These efforts are done to support mission analysis; mission needs development and technology assessment in support of future fleet concepts and potential ship acquisition programs. These efforts are fundamental to the Navy's formulation of the future fleet.\n\nSupports concept exploration and mission needs assessment for potential future ship acquisition programs, however, these are not direct efforts for specific, authorized shipbuilding programs. This project supports and maintains this country's naval ship design and engineering capabilities in the area of very early stage (Concept Design) design tools, criteria, and methods."

The objective is the coordination of ongoing early-stage concept design and development efforts for cross-platform applicability to result in a more affordable, mission-capable, and interoperable surface ship and submarine forces including ships and submarines with reduced manning, increased ability to produce, reduced operating and support costs, and greater utilization of the latest technology.\n\nNAVSEA Tech Authority efforts under Project 3161, known as the Cross Platform Systems Development (CPSD) Program enhance ongoing efforts within Project 2196 and transition directly to early-stage ship design for Ship and Submarine Preliminary Design and Feasibility Studies and other Program Executive Office (PEO) ship and submarine design programs. While these efforts support concept exploration and mission needs assessment for potential future ship and submarine acquisition programs, they are not direct efforts for specific, authorized shipbuilding programs. This project is the only R&D effort (Government or commercial) that provides a coordinated, collaborative approach to the development of cross-platform naval ship, submarine, and weapon system design and engineering capabilities in the areas of design tools, criteria, and methods. This project also provides innovative solutions for current Fleet issues involving Technical Authority, such as current interoperability issues with new systems or platforms.\n\nNaval Ship System Engineering Tech Authority recapitalization and product development consolidates platform advanced concept development and design tool development in CPSD 1.0 (Platform Concept Advanced Development) and CPSD 2.0 (Platform Design and Certification Tools\/Engineering and Tech Data Exchange Development); and aligned standards and requirements development for modularity and system \/ component commonality within CPSD 3.0 (Ship Systems Engineering\/Modular Ship Systems Development). Program product areas support: platform-centric force architecture and concept development and tools (CPSD 1.0, CPSD 2.0), engineering products and system development (CPSD 3.0, CPSD 5.0), and system interoperability and mission capability for delivering ships and submarines (CPSDs 6.0, 8.0, 9.0). CPSD develops and transitions products to Technical Warrant Holder (TWH) community and develop prioritized plans and activities for future products from emerging cross platform technical requirements and associated capabilities."
