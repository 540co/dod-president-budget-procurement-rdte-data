Continued development and integration activities through  Build 10.8 until contract termination prior to qualification of software.  SOSCOE Build 10.7 through 10.8 included the following enhancements: 1) enhanced service discovery for the War fighter to access services offered by as many as 5000 BCT platforms on the battlefield, such as searching for available sensors to retrieve data from and connecting with unmanned platforms to control; 2) enhanced interoperability with AFATDS for coordinating fires support to engage enemy targets; the ability to tailor the size and tools provided by SOSCOE for resource-constrained platforms such as the Common Controller; 3) network Quality of Service (QoS) controls into SOSCOE for ensuring that more important information is given priority for being passed across the network; 4) dynamic (during the mission) platform reconfiguration for mission re-tasking and hardware failure recovery where the system is reconfigured to support a lesser mission capability; and 5) enhanced scalability of chat and whiteboard and directory data to ensure that Soldiers across the entire BCT can each collaborate with each other."

The SNP is the down sized version of the LNPv2 designed to bring the minimal network connectivity to BCT platforms like Trucks.  The MNIK converts the messages between radio networks, and routes the message to recipients on the second radio system.  This automated message handling creates an interoperable link between systems\/subsystems. The MNIK provides range extension, data mediation, proxy, filtering and profile management to the dismounted soldier's unit.  These functions enable the dismounted soldier's network to connect to a geographically remote mobile Command Post, a Commander's vehicle,  a Tactical Operations Center and\/or another MNIK System.
