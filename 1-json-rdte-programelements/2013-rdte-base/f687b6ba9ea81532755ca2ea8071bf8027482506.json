            "val": "A critical element in nearly all defense missions is the Decision Support System, which manages the accumulation of important data and provides tools to help commanders and other operational leaders make relevant decisions. These \u201cData-to-Decision\u201d systems have become increasingly more important as our operations have shifted from large-scale force-on-force engagements to asymmetric conflicts. Terrorists and insurgents are deeply buried within local populations and employ operational concepts that blend in with urban clutter. Subsequently, finding these asymmetric targets has driven an explosion in sensing capabilities and modalities. This exponential growth in sensing volume has so stressed our current technologies that the majority of data now collected is thrown away.  Additionally, because the targets are diffuse and rapidly adapt to countermeasures, there has been a rapid proliferation of decision support systems. At last count, the Research & Engineering Database had over 388 references to Decision Support programs.\n\nThe goal of this program is to develop an Information Open System Architecture (IOSA) that provides a common platform for rapidly developing and integrating new Data-to-Decisions systems. This IOSA will be based on a canonical decision support architecture and support a physical infrastructure for multi-source data management as well as user-driven innovation tools for analytics. The data management infrastructure will provide easy access and management of current and emergent data sources through plug-and-play modules. Data will be contextualized, indexed, conditioned and intelligently stored with approved formats to allow rapid search and retrieval of tactically relevant data sets. The effort will integrate existing analytics tools, and develop applicable new ones where gaps exist. A library of analytic tools will be built and research into end user programming methods will support new innovation models that mimic commercially successful products. The program consists of both applied research and technology development efforts focused on solving challenge problems each year with spiral developments to a prototype system."

This Data-to-Decision program builds on the FY 2010 and FY 2011 accomplishments with objectives and technology developments critical to on-going operations. The JDM program is described below and included two tasks as outlined in the accomplishments\/planned program section.\n\nAs the Department of Defense increases the capability and capacity to generate increasing amounts of data from numerous sensors in the battlespace, the issue of handling very large data sets has become more challenging. This is in part due to Department of Defense response to a changing threat environment where there is an expansion of the types of sensors deployed, new types of information collected, and different features used to classify these new threats. From a technical perspective, data creation speeds have outpaced the speed and ability to transport, store and process the data created. Science and technology (S&T) investigation into new and novel ways to manage and exploit this data is required to more efficiently use sensor assets and effectively use information in a timely fashion.\n\nThis advanced technology demonstration program establishes the demonstration and experimentation environment to conduct independent evaluations of research efforts that have the most potential of minimizing the impact of the increasing amount of information available and required to support military operational decision-making. The intent is to leverage existing research investments within defense S&T and provide proper evaluations and assessments to facilitate technology transition. These objective assessments will be conducted and coordinated across the defense research base and with other parts of government to include Director, National Intelligence and Department of Homeland Security. \n\nThe new Data-to-Decisions program builds on the JDM program by focusing on the development of open-architecture technologies for decision support systems to help reduce future development time and cost of data management, analytics and user interface subsystems. The program will use a spiral development model with four-steps. Each year Operational teams will choose a series of cross-service challenge problems dominated by a specific sensing modality. Representative data for each of those problems will then be collected for testing against that problem. A Development team will design algorithms and data management architectures using high-level languages and self test on controlled data sets to address those challenge problems. Independent assessment will occur with sequestered data sets, but each development tool will also be tested against new sensors not included in the self-testing to determine fragility and applicability. A Transition team will host the developed algorithms as services in a spiraling prototype system that will support rapid prototyping and transition. \n   \nThe Applied Research program concentrates on the Development portion of this collaborative effort, while the Advanced Technology Development program focuses on the infrastructure piece. This piece includes an Operational, Assessment and Transition initiative."

The focus this year was on developing a set of tools to assess progress on vehicle tracking.\n- Unclassified and Classified existing Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) and Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) data sets were gathered and prepared for use by the development team to build advanced trackers. Methods to declassify data sets were investigated for use by the academic members of the consortium. These methods include traffic simulators and detection-derived data sets.\n- The sanitization effort created options for methods to \u201csanitize\u201d an experimental dataset and reviewed the legal\/security approvals required to make the data public releasable.\n- Hosted two Analysis workshops to focused on challenge problems, data, and metrics to define end to end assessment methodologies."
