The project demonstrated the technical capability to exchange collection management data between U.S. and NATO systems. \n\nCommand and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C2ISR) Interoperability Assessment \u2013 Assessed correction of interoperability problems previously identified with imagery data exchange between the Global Command and Control System \u2013 Joint (GCCS-J) and Distributed Common Ground System \u2013Army (DCGS-A) via a DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) interface. \n\nEmpire Challenge 11 (EC11) \u2013 EC 11 was a joint ISR emerging technology demonstration sponsored by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (OUSD(I)). Completed assessments that identified capability issues discovered and recommended solutions to mitigate or resolve those issues associated with 18 assigned capabilities. \n \nCoalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration 2011 (CWID11) Selected Trial Assessments - CWID evaluates solutions aimed at enhancing interoperability and information sharing with multinational coalition partners. Provided assessment and engineering site support hosting 16 trails and conducting 9 warfighter utility assessments. The trials and assessments focused on C2 functions to improve CTF Commander situational awareness on air and missile defense systems, information-sharing portals, air and maritime situational awareness systems and network and management applications.  Of the eight assessments completed, five trials met Sponsor Defined Requirements, two were rated as unsatisfactory, and one was marginal. \n\nGlobal Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) Block V Post Implementation Review (PIR) Assessment \u2013 Completed data collection and analysis on behalf of the operational sponsor\u2019s sustainment and synchronization requirements for GCCS-J PIR to ensure the needs of the warfighter were met. Based on the information in the PIR Report, the Joint Staff Joint Command and Control senior leaders changed their recommended course of action for JC2 from \"maintain\" (e.g., keep the same functions as the GCCS-J currently has) to \"MODIFY\" (e.g., make the investment to improve, fix, modify) the JC2 to include fixing issues identified.  GCCS-J PIR fulfilled the Clinger-Cohen Act and A-300 requirements for providing information through the DoD CIO to support congressional review requirements for major systems.  \n\nJoint Integrated Air and Missile Defense Organization (JIAMDO) Joint Sensor Integration (JSI) Spiral 2 with Integrated Air and Missile Defense Common Operational Picture (IAMD COP) Assessment - Assessed data exchanges to enable improved, comprehensive identification within all combat systems' nodes, as they pertain to using an accurate common operational picture (COP) with enriched time sensitive targeting data.\n\nTactical Edge Data Solutions (TEDS) JCTD Assessments \u2013 Conducting interoperability assessments focusing on movement of information and data between U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps battalion-level tactical-edge systems and applications with Joint and Coalition systems.\n\nCommand and Control (C2) Central - Expanded C2 Central\u2019s comprehensive system descriptions; document library; images; architectures; analysis and visualization tools capabilities; yellow pages and interactive calendar of events and further refined search engine capabilities for the user.\n\nVisual Command and Control Capability Analysis and Tradeoff Suite (VCATS) \u2013 Developed an assessment framework and an interactive \u201cdashboard\u201d to demonstrate the ability to make C2 Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) tradeoffs and recommendations."
