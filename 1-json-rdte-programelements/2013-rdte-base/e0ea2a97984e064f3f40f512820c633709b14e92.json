JMETC conducted 2 Users Group meetings in FY 2011 with an average of 250 participants for all DoD Components.  Through the JMETC Users Group, the JMETC program office continued to develop and implement the distributed test tools evaluation for application by the DoD T&E community.\n-  Continued planning for the development of a JMETC wireless range extension to support the need for temporary local site installations.\n-  Continued to lead the coordination and implementation of DoD-wide improvements to the DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) throughout the DoD RDT&E community.  Appointed as a non-voting member of the DoD DIACAP Technical Advisory Group (TAG) and created a DIACAP Knowledge Service Forum for the DoD RDT&E community.\n-  Continued upgrade of the JMETC Reuse Repository to provide general program information; provided lessons learned from previous distributed LVC tests; opened access to software interfaces, tools, utilities, and test metadata; provided capabilities of each site on the JMETC infrastructure; provided all help-desk functions; and provided opportunities for collaboration by making all content and tools available to the DoD T&E community for reuse.\n-  Engaged\/planned with more than 27 customers (potential and active) providing acquisition programs and test ranges with technical assistance on JMETC capabilities, standards, interfaces, tools, available nodes, and expertise in planning and conducting distributed tests.\n-  Initiated the the DoD-wide T&E community needs analysis to define joint requirements for improving test data management for the distributed test capability."
