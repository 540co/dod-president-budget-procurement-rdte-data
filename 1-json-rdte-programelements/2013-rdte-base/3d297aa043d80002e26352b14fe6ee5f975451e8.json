            "val": "The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) is the principal staff advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics (USD(AT&L)) and the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense for research and engineering (R&E) matters.  In this capacity, the ASD(R&E) has the responsibility to conduct analysis and studies; develop policies; provide technical leadership, oversight and advice; make recommendations; and issue guidance for DoD R&E programs.  Additionally, the ASD(R&E) provides technical support to the USD(AT&L) on R&E aspects of programs subject to review by the Defense Acquisition Board, to include assessments of technology maturity consistent with DoD acquisition policy.  The mission of the DoD R&E program is to create, demonstrate, prototype, and apply technology that enables affordable and decisive military superiority.  Pursuing the R&E mission requires attention to: identification and development of new technological opportunities; insertion of new technologies into warfighting systems and operations; and management and evaluation of the effectiveness of technology programs.  This program element provides mission support to the Office of the ASD(R&E) (OASD(R&E)).  It covers a wide range of studies and analysis in support of the R&E program and it impacts the Department's decision to fund RDT&E efforts.  \n\nThe program element provides funding for the Defense Laboratory Office within the OASD(R&E)).  The Defense Laboratory Office advocates and invests in the DoD laboratory system in three areas: facilities and infrastructure; quality of workforce; and global insight of critical or strategic technologies important to the Department and the Nation.\n\nThe program element also provides engineering, scientific, and analytical support to the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research in its responsibility for direction, overall quality, and content of the science and technology (S&T) program and ensures that the technology being developed is affordable and minimizes system development risk.  The Defense Technology Analysis program conducts assessments and analysis to ensure maximum utilization of research and development funds to accomplish the overall objectives of the S&T program.  The Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) of 2009 expanded the role of the ASD(R&E) in acquisition decisions.  Full implementation of the Act requires increases in both the number and depth of technology maturity assessments.  Funds are required for technical, analytical and management support, equipment and supplies, travel, and publications.\n\nThe DoD's key expertise for reviewing and guiding R&E programs resides in the OASD(R&E).  The OASD(R&E) staff augment their responsibilities through their connections to technology experts in various fields throughout academia, industry, and government.  The Defense Support Teams project supports the directed responsibilities by building teams of technology experts to conduct program technical assessments.  The teams analyze the key engineering problem areas and offer adjustments in the development and test plan; alternate technical approaches; or new technologies that could enable successful development.  The teams constitute expert non-advocate reviews and gather advice from the Nation's leading technical experts."

The Defense Laboratory Office, in partnership with DTIC, developed a new data structure and architecture which facilitated the gathering and subsequent analysis of relevant information.

From the analysis, the Laboratory Office is able to track the status of the DoD laboratory enterprise\u2019s program performance in support of the CTCs.
