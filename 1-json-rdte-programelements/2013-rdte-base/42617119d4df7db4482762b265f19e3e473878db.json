This is a capability not currently provided by existing aircraft.  The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved capabilities in block increments.  The funding in this project supports these block increments as well as associated flight test support.  The Block 10 increment was completed in FY 2007, and the Block 20 increment started in FY 2008. \nBlock 10:  Integrate and test Directional Infrared Countermeasures, a system that protects against infrared guided missiles; design, integrate and validate the Troop Commander Situational Awareness Station to provide the embarked troop commander access to the CV-22's communication, navigation and mission management system; relocate the ALE-47 chaff and flare dispenser control head to allow any cockpit crew member to activate defensive countermeasures; add a second forward firing chaff and flare dispenser to provide an adequate quantity of consumable countermeasures for the extended duration of SOF infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply missions; and incorporate a dual access feature to the Digital Map System to allow both the pilot and co-pilot to independently access and control the digital map display from the mission computer.  \nBlock 20:  Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing.  This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.  Initial risk reduction and trade studies were initiated in FY 2006, and System Design and Development started in FY 2008.  FY 2011 RDT&E activities continued on Block 20 Increment 1 and 2, including Terrain Following Logic, Terrain Following less than 50 knots, Multi Mission Advanced Tactical Terminal, and Improved Crew Interface of Integrated Broadcast Service Data. Block 20 Increment 3 efforts were also initiated in FY2011, including Helmet Mounted Display and Digital Map Upgrade.  FY 2012 RDT&E activities continue and complete on Block 20 Increment 1, 2 & 3 efforts.  FY 2013 RDT&E activities continue on improvements to the Enhanced Situational Awareness package providing enhanced, correlated, fusion and display, threat response, training and simulation capabilities."

Block 10 capability is required for compliance with the Joint Operational Requirements Document and associated Milestone III Capabilities Production Document.
