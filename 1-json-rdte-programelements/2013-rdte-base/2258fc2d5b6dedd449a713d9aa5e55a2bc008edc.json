            "val": "The Air Force Senior Leader Command, Control, and Communications System - Airborne (SLC3S-A) provides executive airborne communications supporting world-wide command and control capabilities to US government Senior Leaders (i.e., the President of the United States (POTUS); Vice President of the United States (VPOTUS); Secretary of Defense (SECDEF); Secretary of State (SECSTATE); Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS); Unified Combatant Commanders (COCOMs); and their staffs as well as other government senior leaders). The SLC3S-A capabilities include secure and non-secure voice, data, and video connectivity into Defense Information System Network\/Global Information Grid, Defense Switched Network, Defense Red Switch Network, Voice Over Secure Internet Protocol Networks, National Security Council's Crisis Management System, and commercial networks up to the Top Secret\/Sensitive Compartmented Information security classification level. These capabilities are used daily by the Senior Leaders to carry out their duties and responsibilities. Currently, each Air Force Operational Support Aircraft and Very Important Person Special Airlift Mission (OSA\/VIPSAM) aircraft is configured with its own unique communications suite. National Senior Leaders require 100% secure voice, data, and video capability for all activities from general planning and strategy discussions to directing command decisions. The security, reliability, and availability of the AF SLC3S-A services determine America's victories or setbacks on the battlefield. The SLC3S-A Program will standardize the back-end communications architecture, off-board transmission systems, ground support networks, and Roll-on\/Roll-off assets. The C-37 Communications Package (CCP) will standardize the airborne local area network, add additional commercial SATCOM capability and increase the Mean Zero Fuel Weight (MZFW) across the fleet of C-37s. CCP activities also include studies and analysis to support execution of these modifications. The CCP program is pre-MDD. The SLC3S-A Transmission System (STS) Program will address the connectivity infrastructure between AF SLC3S-A aircraft internal communications\/information system (e.g., C-37 Communications Package) and Executive Airlift Communications Network (EACN) Air-to-Ground Gateway (A2G2). This effort will provide highly reliable, redundant, wideband communications paths off OSA\/VIPSAM aircraft and may include an implementation of wideband MILSATCOM and commercial SATCOM capabilities, modification of the ground infrastructure and development of a Black-side Network Operations Center. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. The STS program is pre-MDD. The CCP program is in budget activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) with a planned entry at Milestone B."

The SLC3S-A capabilities include secure and non-secure voice, data, and video connectivity into Defense Information System Network\/Global Information Grid, Defense Switched Network, Defense Red Switch Network, Voice Over Secure Internet Protocol Networks, National Security Council's Crisis Management System, and commercial networks up to the Top Secret\/Sensitive Compartmented Information security classification level. These capabilities are used daily by the Senior Leaders to carry out their duties and responsibilities. Currently, each Air Force Operational Support Aircraft and Very Important Person Special Airlift Mission (OSA\/VIPSAM) aircraft is configured with its own unique communications suite. National Senior Leaders require 100% secure voice, data, and video capability for all activities from general planning and strategy discussions to directing command decisions. The security, reliability, and availability of the AF SLC3S-A services determine America's victories or setbacks on the battlefield. The SLC3S-A Program will standardize the back-end communications architecture, off-board transmission systems, ground support networks, and Roll-on\/Roll-off assets. The C-37 Communications Package (CCP) will standardize the airborne local area network, add additional commercial SATCOM capability and increase the Mean Zero Fuel Weight (MZFW) across the fleet of C-37s. CCP activities also include studies and analysis to support execution of these modifications. The CCP program is pre-MDD. The SLC3S-A Transmission System (STS) Program will address the connectivity infrastructure between AF SLC3S-A aircraft internal communications\/information system (e.g., C-37 Communications Package) and Executive Airlift Communications Network (EACN) Air-to-Ground Gateway (A2G2). This effort will provide highly reliable, redundant, wideband communications paths off OSA\/VIPSAM aircraft and may include an implementation of wideband MILSATCOM and commercial SATCOM capabilities, modification of the ground infrastructure and development of a Black-side Network Operations Center. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. The STS program is pre-MDD. The CCP program is in budget activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) with a planned entry at Milestone B."
