            "val": "This system is an integral part of the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and will provide for an incrementally fielded Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control System\/capability for the Army Air and Missile Defense Battalions. Funding in this program element provides for the overarching Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) Architecture and Army IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) components necessary to produce an AIAMD capability. The AIAMD Program represents a shift from a traditional system-centric weapon systems acquisition to a component-based acquisition. This component-based acquisition will provide the most efficient way to acquire and integrate the components of the incremental AIAMD architecture. Unlike traditional acquisition programs that focus primarily on the development of a single system or platform, the AIAMD Program is structured to enable the development of an overarching system-of-systems capability with participating Air and Missile Defense (AMD) components functioning interdependently to provide total operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems. The AIAMD Program achieves this objective by establishing the incremental AIAMD architecture and developing the following products:  the IBCS, the Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN), and the Plug & Fight (P&F) Interface kits. The IBCS provides common Army IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) Engagement Operations Center (EOC) that replaces seven current weapon system unique Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) components in an AMD Battalion.  The IFCN provides fire control connectivity and enabling distributed operations. A P&F Interface kit enables the multiple sensor and weapon components for netted operations. AIAMD has been designated as the Army's Pathfinder for the development of a Joint Track Management Capability. \n\nThe Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) directed restructuring the AIAMD program to include AIAMD capability in the following systems: Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Air and Missile Defense Brigades (ADA Bde), Air and Missile Defense Commands (AAMDC), Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) within IFPC\/Avenger Composite Battalions and Air Defense and Airspace Management (ADAM) cells. The restructured program will include two Product Improvements. Product Improvement 1 will include placing Phased Array Tracking to Intercept of Target (PATRIOT) components directly on the Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) and employing a common set of C2 tools across Air Defense Artillery (ADA) formations with a First Unit Equipped (FUE) in FY 2019. Product Improvement 2 will integrate THAAD on the IFCN. An IBCS Critical Design Review (CDR) is planned for second quarter FY 2012, along with the contributing programs CDRs. AIAMD CDR is scheduled for third quarter FY 2012. The IBCS prototype is scheduled for delivery to the Government System Integration Laboratory (GSIL) in February FY 2012. Modeling and Simulation will be conducted throughout the program. The AIAMD original Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) was approved on 28 June 2010 and is being revised per ADM."

The assessment effort includes both radars and RF data links and will incorporate the latest threat information, comparable work being executed by the other services and conceptual EP solutions.  The conceptual solutions will be a combination of direct individual sensor mitigation techniques and multiple sensor network approaches. The tasks are:  (1) Conduct individual radar and RF guided missile digital simulations capable of assessing system performance when exposed to current and future deceptive EA techniques. (2) Purchase and modify commercial and military off-the-shelf DRFM injection units to insert actual high fidelity EA signals into the radar's and guided missile's receivers. (3) In conjunction with the Joint Electronic Protection for Air Combat (JEPAC) unit and the Army Research Laboratory's Survivability Assessment Directorate conduct and evaluate field tests of deceptive EA against Army air and missile defense systems.  Use results to formulate near term tactics, technique and procedures for immediate fielding and to identify the highest priority areas to concentrate future development efforts. (4) Develop and implement models of Army air and missile defense systems and electronic attack effects to be used to the Extended Air Defense Simulation (EADSIM) for initial assessment of deceptive EA effects on the overall defense capability and potential network-based solutions. (5) Based on the results obtained from the simulations and field tests initiate the development of countermeasure EP techniques for air and missile defense radars and guided missile seekers."

Funding in this program element provides for the overarching Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) Architecture and Army IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) components necessary to produce an AIAMD capability. The AIAMD Program represents a shift from a traditional system-centric weapon systems acquisition to a component-based acquisition. This component-based acquisition will provide the most efficient way to acquire and integrate the components of the incremental AIAMD architecture. Unlike traditional acquisition programs that focus primarily on the development of a single system or platform, the AIAMD Program is structured to enable the development of an overarching system-of-systems capability with participating Air and Missile Defense (AMD) components functioning interdependently to provide total operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems. The AIAMD Program achieves this objective by establishing the incremental AIAMD architecture and developing the following products:  the IBCS, the Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN), and the Plug & Fight (P&F) Interface kits. The IBCS provides common Army IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) Engagement Operations Center (EOC) that replaces seven current weapon system unique Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) components in an AMD Battalion.  The IFCN provides fire control connectivity and enabling distributed operations. A P&F Interface kit enables the multiple sensor and weapon components for netted operations. AIAMD has been designated as the Army's Pathfinder for the development of a Joint Track Management Capability. \n\nThe Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) directed restructuring the AIAMD program to include AIAMD capability in the following systems: Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Air and Missile Defense Brigades (ADA Bde), Air and Missile Defense Commands (AAMDC), Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) within IFPC\/Avenger Composite Battalions and Air Defense and Airspace Management (ADAM) cells. The restructured program will include two Product Improvements. Product Improvement 1 will include placing Phased Array Tracking to Intercept of Target (PATRIOT) components directly on the Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) and employing a common set of C2 tools across Air Defense Artillery (ADA) formations with a First Unit Equipped (FUE) in FY 2019. Product Improvement 2 will integrate THAAD on the IFCN. An IBCS Critical Design Review (CDR) is planned for second quarter FY 2012, along with the contributing programs CDRs. AIAMD CDR is scheduled for third quarter FY 2012. The IBCS prototype is scheduled for delivery to the Government System Integration Laboratory (GSIL) in February FY 2012. Modeling and Simulation will be conducted throughout the program. The AIAMD original Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) was approved on 28 June 2010 and is being revised per ADM. Beginning with FY11, this funding was transferred from the Army IAMD PE 0603327A, Project Code S34, to continue funding the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the program."

The AIAMD Program carried two competitive prototyping developmental contractors through an initial Preliminary Design Review (PDR) with a down select after Milestone B (MS B) in December 2009 to conduct the EMD phase.\n\nEach AIAMD capability increment follows the AIAMD Capability Development Document (CDD), JROC approved on 17 May 2010 via JROCM 073-10, and is defined as:\n-  Increment 1 is a User-executed capability increment focused on realignment of current force systems into an AMD Battalion (BN) organizational construct. (not part of the materiel development program) \n-  Increment 2 provides the first increment of an integrated materiel solution, and is the initial acquisition program to develop the threshold AIAMD capability\n\nThe AIAMD incremental development approach provides the opportunity for technology insertions into the program throughout each increment as high-payoff technologies mature and are ready for integration.  This enables an orderly and cost-effective migration from the current system-centric architecture to the AIAMD architecture.  \n\nKey principles of the AIAMD acquisition approach are the following:\n-  Migrate from system-based acquisition to component-based acquisition\n-  Use system-of-systems acquisition approach with collaboration among AIAMD, PEO MS, PEO C3T, and Brigade Combat Team (BCT) Modernization Component Project Offices, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), and other Service Project Offices to network enable weapons and sensor components\n-  Develop and procure common Army IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) Engagement Operations Center (EOC) that replaces seven weapon system unique Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) components\n-  Establish product lines used to evaluate and select, modify and integrate modular open systems Hardware (HW) and Software (SW) common configuration items\n-  Conduct architecture-based System Engineering, Integration and Test (SEI&T) activities for an incremental fielded configuration of the AIAMD Integrated Fire Control (IFC) Network-compatible IBCS EOC, weapons and sensor system components"
