By establishing the premise that a human is never intended to step on board at any point in the operational cycle, ACTUV concepts can take advantage of an unexplored design space that eliminates or modifies conventional ship design constraints such as internal arrangement, reserve buoyancy, and dynamic stability in order to achieve disproportionate speed, endurance, and payload fraction.  The resulting unmanned naval vessels must possess sufficient situational awareness and autonomous behavior capability to operate in full compliance with the rules of the road and maritime law to support safe navigation for operational deployments spanning thousands of miles and months of time.  When coupled with innovative sensor technologies, the ACTUV system provides a low cost unmanned system with a fundamentally different operational risk calculus that enables game changing capability to detect and track even the quietest diesel electric submarine threats.  Key technical areas include unmanned naval vessel design methodologies, ship system reliability, high fidelity sensor fusion to provide an accurate world model for autonomous operation, novel application of sensors for ASW tracking, and holistic system integration due to unique optimization opportunities of the ACTUV system."

Sea Change focus areas include platform concepts to increase operational capability and efficiency of maritime systems and development of standoff technologies for rapid defeat of anti-access mines through a hydroacoustic anti-mine array.  The hydroacoustic anti-mine array effort will explore the technical feasibility of a novel mine clearance approach using coordinated high energy density acoustic sources to deliver standoff clearance of mines throughout the water column and on the ocean bottom.  By eliminating all explosive neutralizers and maintaining effectiveness with uncertain mine identification and location, the hydroacoustic anti-mine array concept has the potential to achieve dramatic reductions in area mine clearance timelines."

Given the unique physical challenges and stressful environmental conditions, Arctic operations today are mainly limited to expeditions requiring specialized platforms, support infrastructure, and preparation.

The program seeks to create an open-source development infrastructure for the aggregation of designer inputs applicable to complex electromechanical systems as well as software, and to exercise this infrastructure with a series of design challenges, leading to prize awards and builds of winning designs in a foundry-style, rapidly configurable manufacturing facility.  The design challenges will culminate in a complete build of a next generation infantry fighting vehicle to a requirements set loosely analogous to an existing program of record -but executed on a roughly one-year timescale.  Additionally, the program will pursue an explicit outreach activity to high school-age students to teach the principles of model-based design and distributed foundry-style manufacturing to build a next-generation cadre of manufacturing innovators.  Initial ground vehicle design work is funded under the META program in PE 0602303E, Project IT-02."

Once developed, Avatar will allow soldiers to remain out of harm's way while still leveraging their experience and strengths to complete important missions such as sentry\/perimeter control, room clearing, combat casualty recovery, and, eventually, dismounted combat maneuver.

Threat identification and localization is accomplished in sufficient time to enable both automatic and man-in-the-loop responses.  Phase I of the program focused on initial development and testing of the Crosshairs sensor system.  Phase IA culminated with a static live fire test to determine the most effective candidate sensor system.  During Phase IB, enhancements were made to the sensor system for on the move performance, and on the move testing against multiple threats was conducted.  DARPA and the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) entered into an MOA for Phase IIA.  Phase IIA consisted of a moving demonstration of the hardened, packaged, and enhanced Phase I sensor system on two networked HMMWVs, integration with candidate response systems, and testing and evaluation of the complete systems in relevant environments.  In Phase IIB, the Crosshairs sensor system was integrated with the Iron Curtain Active Protection System (IC-APS) on four up-armored vehicles.\n\nDARPA worked with the Army REF and the Project Manager Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles to validate the capabilities and initiate transition to combat forces."

These fiber-laser arrays will be sufficiently lightweight, compact, and electrically efficient to be fielded on a variety of platforms with minimal impact to the platform's original mission capabilities.  Each array element will possess an adaptive-optic capability to minimize beam divergence in the presence of atmospheric turbulence, together with wide-field-of-view beam steering for target tracking.  With each Excalibur array element powered by high power fiber laser amplifiers (at up to 3 kilowatts (kW) per amplifier), high power air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements will be enabled that were previously infeasible because of laser system size and weight.  In addition, this program will also develop kilowatt-class arrays of diode lasers which will provide an alternate route to efficiently reaching mission-relevant power levels, and they will test the ultimate scalability of the optical phased array architecture.  Excalibur arrays will be conformal to aircraft surfaces and scalable in size and power by adding elements to the array.  By defending airborne platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles against proliferated, deployed, and next-generation man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), Excalibur will enable these reconnaissance platforms to fly at lower altitude and obtain truly persistent, all-weather ground reconnaissance despite low-lying cloud cover.  Proliferated and emerging threats will be evaluated for the potential of developing a near-term capability utilizing a single high-power fiber laser amplifier.  Further capabilities include multichannel laser communications, target identification, tracking, designation, precision defeat with minimal collateral effects as well as other applications.\n\nThe Excalibur Budget Activity 2 program will develop the core set of laser components for efficiently driving elements of high-power electronically steerable optical arrays, namely, high-power coherently- and spectrally-combinable fiber laser amplifiers, high-brightness laser diodes for efficiently pumping the fiber laser amplifiers, and kW-class single-mode laser diode arrays.  In addition, advanced techniques (packaging, thermal and power management, beam control, target tracking, etc.) will be developed for light-weight (300-500 lb), high power (3 kW - 10 kW) fiber-laser based and podded High Energy Laser Countermeasure (HELCM) systems enabling near-term options for low-altitude self-defense against MANPADS.  The vulnerabilities of MANPADS and their potential to incorporate counter-countermeasures to HELCM systems will also be measured and assessed.  These techniques and measurements will be designed to work in tandem with and to support the HELCM prototype subsystems developed under the Budget Activity 3 Excalibur program in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.\n\nThe Excalibur Budget Activity 2 program will also conduct several analytical studies relevant to scaling and applications of high-efficiency (30% - 40% wall plug efficient) high power electric lasers, that will examine: the potential to scale the output power of diode pumped alkali lasers (DPALs) to tactical and strategic levels (100's kW - MW class); the potential for integrating low-cost, high-sensitivity, wide-field-of-view imaging seekers and directional acoustic cueing into extended-altitude MANPADS; and the potential to use high power fiber lasers for long range target identification and tracking."

With a weight goal of <5 kg\/kW, HELLADS will enable high energy lasers (HELs) to be integrated onto tactical aircraft, and will significantly increase engagement ranges compared to ground-based systems, enabling high precision, low collateral damage, and rapid engagement of fleeting targets for both offensive and defensive missions.  The HELLADS program has completed the design and demonstration of a revolutionary prototype unit cell laser module.  That unit cell demonstrated power output and is demonstrating optical wavefront performance that supports the goal of a lightweight and compact 150 kW high energy tactical laser weapon system.  Two unit cell module designs with integrated power and thermal management systems were fabricated and tested; they demonstrated an output power exceeding 34 kW.  Based on the results of the unit cell demonstration, additional laser modules will be replicated and connected to produce a 150 kW laser that will be demonstrated in a laboratory environment.  The 150 kW laser will then be integrated with beam control, prime power, thermal management, safety, and command and control subsystems all based upon existing technologies to produce a ground-based laser weapon system field demonstrator.  The capability to shoot down tactical targets such as surface-to-air missiles and rockets and the capability to perform ultra-precise offensive engagements will be demonstrated in a realistic ground test environment.  Additional funding for this integration effort will be provided for HELLADS testing in Project NET-01, PE 0603766E.  The HELLADS laser will then be transitioned to a tactical platform for performance demonstration of ground, sea, or airborne precision engagements."

In order to achieve a large field-of-regard, current optical turret designs protrude into the flow.  This causes severe optical distortions in the aft field-of-regard due to turbulence in the wake and the unsteady shock movement over the aperture.  These distortions decrease the power flux on target (the measure of lethality for a directed energy system) and consequently limit the utility of directed energy systems to targets in the forward field-of-regard.  This program will optimize flow control strategies for pointing angles in the aft field-of-regard.  The program will also explore the ability to synchronize the flow control system with adaptive optics.  This effort will initially focus on wind tunnel testing to prove the feasibility of steady and periodic flow control techniques to reduce or regularize the large scale turbulent structures surrounding an optical turret.  These tests will culminate in a hardware-in-the-loop demonstration utilizing flow control with an adaptive optics system in a full-scale wind tunnel test for the turret.  Following successful wind tunnel demonstrations, a preliminary design of a flight test turret incorporating flow control will be undertaken.  Completion of detailed design and fabrication will be carried on under the HELLADS program budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01."

Because the system is scalable and distributed, a warfighter can practice by himself, in a small group, or with as many other warfighters as needed for the mission over a local or distributed network, and across all relevant platforms (dismounts, vehicles, helicopters, and fast movers).  Most important is the understanding that RealWorld is not a static simulation; it is a simulation builder with applications across the spectrum of modern kinetic and non-kinetic warfare.  The program created tools that allow warfighters to rapidly and easily build their own missions through the introduction of new methodology for building simulation software.  This methodology and adherence to a highly modular approach has resulted in a fundamental paradigm shift in the acquisition, as well as the construction, of DoD modeling and simulation products."

The primary focus of this program is to demonstrate the ability to build a ground vehicle that is capable of configuring into a VTOL air vehicle that provides sufficient flight performance and range, while carrying a payload that is representative of four troops with gear.  The enabling technologies of interest include hybrid electric drive, advanced batteries, stowable wing structures, ducted fan propulsion, lightweight materials, and advanced sensors and flight controls for stable transition from vertical to horizontal flight.  TX vehicles could be dispatched for downed airman recovery, for evacuating injured personnel from difficult-to-access locations, or to resupply isolated small units.  TX will also be suitable for enhanced company operations concepts which would provide the warfighter\/team increased situational awareness for operations in an urban environment."

Social network theory has emerged in recent years as a promising approach for understanding groups of individuals connected through a variety of shared interests and collaborative activities.  For the military, social networks provide a promising model for understanding terrorist cells, insurgent groups, and other stateless actors whose connectedness is established not on the basis of shared geography but rather through the correlation of their participation in coordinated activities such as planning meetings, training\/mission rehearsal sessions, sharing of materiel\/funds transfers, etc.  The Nexus 7 program will develop and apply emerging methods for edge finding and cluster analysis to detect, characterize, and predict the dynamics of social networks.  The resulting capabilities have important application in tactical contexts to aid analysts and operators in connecting the dots amid complex, conflicting, and incomplete data sets.  They also establish a foundation for cultural intelligence - understanding the stability, governance, and economic indicators of a region - and the capability to better focus stability, security, transition, and reconstruction operations on high-payoff initiatives.  The Nexus 7 program is an outgrowth of the data analysis tools explored in the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) program and previous information integration work in the cognitive computing and transformative sciences areas."

These goals depend on the ability of users to speak freely without fear of reprisal and to participate in public referendums with privacy protections.  CAS will create technology to enable safe discourse and trustworthy elections over the internet.  This will require addressing all three elements of the traditional security triad - confidentiality, integrity, and availability - while also providing for new auditing mechanisms such as the capability for individuals to confirm their vote was correctly recorded and for stakeholder organizations to confirm only legitimate votes were counted.

Currently, video analysis is very labor intensive, limited to metadata queries, manual annotations, and \"fast-forward\" examination of clips.  The software tools developed under VIRAT will radically improve the analysis of huge volumes of video data by: 1) alerting operators when specific events or activities occur at specific locations or over a range of locations and; 2) enabling fast, content-based searches of existing video archives.  The final product of the VIRAT program is a system that can be transitioned to an integrated, operational military system, such as the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS)."

ICEWS will also develop a collaborative, open-source testbed that will facilitate the integration and evaluation of alternative, operationally relevant social theories.  Natural language processing is required to identify and extract information that is predictive from text and speech-based media and to distill that information into a form that is actionable by civilian and military leadership.  ICEWS will develop a large body of test cases (source data and outcomes) against which the social science theories can be evaluated.  When integrated, these tools will allow combatant commanders and their staff to understand and anticipate conditions that precipitate instability and conflict while there is still time to influence them.  ICEWS will also help commanders anticipate unintended consequences of actions taken to influence or remediate situations, consequences that may be delayed by months or years."
