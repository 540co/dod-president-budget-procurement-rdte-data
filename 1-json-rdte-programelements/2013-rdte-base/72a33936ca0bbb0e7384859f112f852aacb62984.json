JFIIT collects and analyzes data and provides observations, findings, conclusions, and recommendations to identify Joint doctrine, training, and material solutions and products that promote capability improvement.  Accurate data is necessary to effectively develop solutions to identified problems.  JFIIT provides a truth-based data collection capability to support a holistic approach to the overall improvement of Joint fires.  Evaluations range from small, single-focus events to large, multi event\/ venue exercises.\n\nJFIIT conducts assessments in conjunction with Service and Combatant Command (COCOM) exercises, experiments, and test & evaluation events.  The emphasis of this JFIIT effort is assessing Joint fires and combat identification capabilities to ensure that Services and Agencies field interdependent and interoperable systems and training.  JFIIT Assessment efforts include verifying an accurate Joint environment is provided for realistic training that exercises one or more Joint tasks, assessing Joint context and Joint task execution while addressing the effectiveness of a Joint training program and identifying the need for continued support of Joint fires tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) and doctrine.  JFIIT assessments provide input to acquisition processes and enhance Joint development as programs are funded and developed.\n\nThe primary outputs and efficiencies include:\n- Improvement in the Services\u2019 ability to employ Joint Fires.\n- Improved Joint Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and integrated Air to Ground training at Home Station and the Combat Training Centers.\n- An enhanced Joint operational environment at the Combat Training Centers that supports the execution of Joint tasks during service training and enhances JFIIT\u2019s ability to conduct assessments.\n- Recommended solutions integrated within the Joint Staff Joint Capabilities Integration Development System (JCIDS) and OSD Joint C2 Capability Portfolio Manager (JC2 CPM) processes.\n- Identification of specific key performance parameters (KPPs) and key system attributes (KSAs) for new systems that meet Joint warfighter operational requirements to ensure Services and Agencies field interdependent and interoperable systems.\n- Published doctrine and Joint Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) to efficiently and effectively employ Joint forces at the tactical level.\n- Increased effectiveness and confidence in combat identification and a reduction in fratricide."
