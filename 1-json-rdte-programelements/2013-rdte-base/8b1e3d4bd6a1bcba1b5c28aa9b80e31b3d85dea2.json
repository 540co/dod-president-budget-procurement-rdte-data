            "val": "This program will produce a net-centric collaborative environment, enhance and modernize space surveillance capabilities, create decision relevant views of the space environment, and enable efficient distribution of data across the space surveillance network.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nJMS is responsible for Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and command and control (C2) of space forces. SSA includes the knowledge of all aspects of space related to operations to thoroughly assess threats to U.S. space assets and develop options, military and diplomatic, to counter them and to establish contingency plans to ensure U.S. forces can maintain access to space assets.  JMS will access intelligence on adversary space operations, process surveillance of all space objects and activities, maintain detailed reconnaissance of specific space assets; fuse space environmental data, maintain awareness of cooperative space assets, and allow the Joint Functional Component Command for Space (JFCC-Space) to conduct space forces integrated command, control, communications, processing, analysis, dissemination, and archiving activities.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nNear-term focus is to provide a sustainable net-centric environment with a highly accurate, responsive, and robust SSA system migration from the rapidly aging and sustainment-challenged Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) system (design end of life was 2002). JMS will provide integrated space knowledge\/information for the Commander, JFCC-Space to plan, direct, coordinate, and control operations of assigned forces. JMS will provide the ability to: monitor status, activities, and environment for assigned\/attached space forces; assess how space forces support the battle space, provide impacts of changes to force status, and impacts of enemy forces on space assets; plan space operations to support theater and national operations; and execute Joint space tasking, track task performance, adapt tasking to changing situations, and conduct technology forecasting for emerging needs. JMS will also develop improved information capabilities for integration across SSA sensors through data exposure accomplished via the Net Centric Sensors and Data Sources effort (Project 65A012) in the SSA Systems PE (0604425F) for RDT&E and SSA Operations PE (0305940F) for OPAF funding."

Research, design, and development will provide SSA space catalog applications, services, space surveillance observation processing, and sensor tasking.

This effort will define and implement the operational concept, technical architecture, and support concept to provide data to enable rapid, responsive decisions by the Commander, US Strategic Command\u2019s Joint Functional Component Commander for Space and other space capability users to ensure protection of US space assets from proliferating adversary threats.  This effort is vital to JSpOC modernization.  The Extended Space Sensor Architecture Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ESSA ACTD) is an example how disparate and legacy space sensors network data can be translated into a net-centric environment. This effort will build upon those lessons learned and ensure success thorough participation in Data Management Working Groups (DMWGs) and the Command and Control Space Situational Awareness Community of Interest (C2 SSA COI)\n\nDue to JMS restructure, funding for data integration for FY12 & FY13 was reallocated to Mission Apps and Infrastructure to focus on priority of developing capabilities needed to migrate off of the aging and increasingly unsupportable legacy SPADOC system. Necessary data integration efforts to include net-centrically exposing data of legacy sensors and non-traditional data sources are being conducted under the Net-Centric Sensors and Data Sources effort (Project 65A012) in RDT&E AF PE 0604425F, SSA Systems."
