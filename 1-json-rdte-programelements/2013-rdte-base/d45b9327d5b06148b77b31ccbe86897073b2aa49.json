The initial systems in the DMO\/LVC environment; F-15C, AWACS, F-16 Block 40\/50 and F-15E, all required new training systems.  In addition, the Operations and Integration capability had to be created.  The Training Simulation Service (TSS) acquisition strategy was used to meet a portion of these requirements.  In the TSS approach, the contractor owns and provides the simulator equipment, maintains simulator concurrency with weapon systems, and has incentives to keep the equipment up to date with simulator and network technologies.  The FY07 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) specifically limited the Air Force\u2019s ability to acquire military flight simulators with service contracts.  As a result, training capability currently provided on the F-16 Mission Training Center (MTC) is being replaced under a separate program with training provided with procured flight simulators.  (Acquisition of the F-16 Block 40\/50 MTCs is detailed under the Project 655354 in this document.)  The FY08 NDAA language allows continued use of the service contract approach on systems where it was already in use.  Currently fielded and projected Air Force-owned Flight and Mission Training Systems without DMO\/LVC capability will be modified using Full Combat Mission Trining (FCMT) funds to ensure compatibility with the DMO-LVC environment.  Additional DMO capable trainers will be acquired for those systems where current quantities are inadequate to meet training requirements using FCMT funds."
