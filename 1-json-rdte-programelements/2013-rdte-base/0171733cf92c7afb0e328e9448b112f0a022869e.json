It is an integrated Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) system capable of supporting all echelons of the US military command structure.  GCCS solves C4I interoperability problems between Service components by establishing a Common Core Operating Environment supporting net-centric objectives.  The GCCS-Air Force program provides C2, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), Cyber, and operational information to the Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) for planning and execution, air space deconfliction, targeting, weaponeering, and many other applications supporting air operational command and control, and fully supports the Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept. \n\nThe Air Force is responsible for integration of Air Force unique mission applications with the Common Core Operating Environment.  Integration efforts are directed towards future aerospace C2 concepts supporting requirements for the AOC, including ISR, and intended to automate operational systems with an objective of providing the right people with the right information at the right time while reducing the overall footprint of the system.  As they migrate to the GCCS Joint  (GCCS-J) core environment, GCCS-AF will integrate applications into the WINx environment satisfying warfighter requirements for the Common Operational Picture (COP), Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN), Joint Targeting Toolbox (JTT), Logistics Feasibility Analysis Capability (LOGFAC), Deliberate Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segment (DCAPES) capabilities, and other information assurance mechanisms.  \n\nFunding will also support development and systems engineering activities, to include (1) facilitating improvements to system effectiveness through efficient segregation of mission capabilities (apps, services, applications) from underlying networking, middleware and computing infrastructures by using common architecture, standards, and services, and (2) employing a rapid\/agile IT acquisition process to effectively deliver capabilities to the warfighter.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  The GCCS-AF program is actively supporting planning for transition of functionality to DOD's emerging next generation joint C2 enabler.  The GCCS-AF funding will be used to implement evolving Joint and Air Force GCCS functional capability as well as facilitate transition, development and delivery of functionality to DoD's next generation joint C2 enabler. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The GCCS-Air Force program provides C2, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), Cyber, and operational information to the Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) for planning and execution, air space deconfliction, targeting, weaponeering, and many other applications supporting air operational command and control, and fully supports the Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept. \n\nThe Air Force is responsible for integration of Air Force unique mission applications with the Common Core Operating Environment.  Integration efforts are directed towards future aerospace C2 concepts supporting requirements for the AOC, including ISR, and intended to automate operational systems with an objective of providing the right people with the right information at the right time while reducing the overall footprint of the system.  As they migrate to the GCCS Joint  (GCCS-J) core environment, GCCS-AF will integrate applications into the WINx environment satisfying warfighter requirements for the Common Operational Picture (COP), Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN), Joint Targeting Toolbox (JTT), Logistics Feasibility Analysis Capability (LOGFAC), Deliberate Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segment (DCAPES) capabilities, and other information assurance mechanisms.  \n\nFunding will also support development and systems engineering activities, to include (1) facilitating improvements to system effectiveness through efficient segregation of mission capabilities (apps, services, applications) from underlying networking, middleware and computing infrastructures by using common architecture, standards, and services, and (2) employing a rapid\/agile IT acquisition process to effectively deliver capabilities to the warfighter.\n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  The GCCS-AF program is actively supporting planning for transition of functionality to DOD's emerging next generation joint C2 enabler.  The GCCS-AF funding will be used to implement evolving Joint and Air Force GCCS functional capability as well as facilitate transition, development and delivery of functionality to DoD's next generation joint C2 enabler. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
