            "val": "The Proliferation, Prevention and Defeat program reduces Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) proliferation and enhances WMD defeat capabilities through advanced technology development.  To accomplish this objective, seven project areas were developed: RA - Systems Engineering and Innovation, RE - Counter-Terrorism Technologies, RF - Detection Technology, RG - Counter WMD Weapons & Capabilities, RI - Nuclear Survivability, \nRM - WMD Battle Management, and RT - Target Assessment Technologies.  This supports technology requirements in line with the Joint Functional Concepts (Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01).  The missions and plans of these projects are described below and in the R-2a Budget Exhibits.  \n\nProject RA provides the research and development both for systems engineering and analysis support across all other projects and innovative counterproliferation research and technical reachback support.\n\nProject RE provides research and development support to Joint U.S. Military Forces, specifically U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), in the areas of Explosive Ordnance Disposal Device Defeat; counter-WMD technologies for warfighters; the USSOCOM Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction \u2013 Terrorism Support Program (SCSP) ; and oversight of counterproliferation (CP) research and development resources sent directly to USSOCOM for warfighter-unique CP technologies.\n\nProject RF develops technologies, systems and procedures for post-detonation nuclear forensics, and to detect, identify, track, tag, locate, monitor and interdict strategic and improvised nuclear and radiological weapons, components, or materials in support of Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for combating terrorism, counterproliferation and nonproliferation, homeland defense, and international initiatives and agreements.  \n\nProject RG develops advanced technologies and weapon concepts and validates their applicability as counter WMD weapon systems.\n\nProject RI provides the capability for DoD nuclear forces and their associated control and support systems and facilities in wartime to avoid, repel, or withstand attack or other hostile action, to the extent that essential functions can continue or be resumed after the onset of hostile action.  \n\nProject RL develops nuclear and radiological assessment modeling tools to support military operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design decisions.  Related funding for this project can be found in the WMD Defeat Technologies: 0602718BR, budget exhibit.\n\nProject RM provides (1) full-scale testing of counter WMD weapon effects, sensor performance, and weapon delivery optimization, (2) weapon effects modeling, and (3) the Defense Threat Reduction Agency Experimentation Lab.  \n   \nProject RR provides a unique national test bed capability for simulated Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) facility characterization, weapon-target interaction, and WMD facility defeat testing to respond to operational needs by developing and maintaining test beds used by the Department of Defense (DoD), the Services, the Combatant Commanders, and other federal agencies to evaluate the implications of WMD, conventional, and other special weapon use against U.S. military or civilian systems and targets.  Related funding for this project can be found in the WMD Defeat Technologies: 0602718BR, budget exhibit.\n\nProject RT provides the Combatant Commands and the Intelligence Community with technologies and processes to find and characterize hard and deeply buried targets and then assess the results of attacks against those targets."

The systems engineering effort provides research and development with requirements, technology, architecture analyses and proof-of-principle capability necessary for making decisions on strategic planning, research and development investments, new initiatives, cooperation, ventures with new customers, and accomplishment of high-level, short notice special projects.  This includes analysis of National, Department of Defense (DoD) and other Federal agencies' strategic guidance and plans in the combating WMD, Combating Terrorism and Homeland Defense arenas through analytical political-military and technical studies, workshops and conferences.  It also provides the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) on-site support to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers, Europe (SHAPE) with a current primary focus on support to U.S. European Command (USEUCOM), NATO, and SHAPE in combating WMD and maintaining the NATO nuclear deterrent.  A significant element of this project includes support to Command Elements and the warfighting Combatant Commands (COCOMs) on strategies for reducing\/countering the WMD threat in the COCOMs Areas of Responsibility.  This project also provides for the solution to the Secretary of Defense mandate for DTRA to account, maintain, report, and track the National Nuclear Weapons Stockpile & Nuclear Weapon-Related Materiel during peacetime, crisis, and wartime.  In support of national requirements necessary to maintain a viable nuclear deterrent, the Defense Integration and Management of Nuclear Data Services provide a platform to ensure continued sustainability and viability of the nuclear weapon stockpile. \n\nThe FY 2012 to FY 2013 decrease is predominately due to the net effect of a one time increased investment for the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES) in FY 2012 and a realignment of funding from Program Element (PE) 0603160BR to PE 0602718BR for information technology test and engineering program for Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) 3."

                            "val": "The Counter-Terrorism Technologies project is an over-arching project that develops and transitions a full spectrum of new technologies to counter emergent Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) thus enabling warfighters to improve their ability to detect, disable, interdict, neutralize, and destroy chemical, biological, nuclear production, storage, and weaponization facilities.  This project supports Joint U.S. Military Forces, and in particular, the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  This research and development support to USSOCOM is one of the highest priority mission areas in the National Security Strategy, the National Strategy to Combat WMD, the National Military Strategy to Combat WMD, the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the Guidance on the Employment of the Force, and therefore a top priority for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).  The following efforts are included in this project:\n\nProvide oversight for Counterproliferation (CP) research and development resources sent directly to USSOCOM that are used to develop warfighter-unique technologies in support of USSOCOM\u2019s Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation (CT\/CP) mission.  New CT\/CP technologies are developed under USSOCOM management that provides warfighters with the operational capability to counter WMD threats.\n\nThe Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Device Defeat effort develops innovative technologies, energetic materials, and software programs to identify, defeat, contain, and mitigate WMD capable Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).  DTRA has been delegated the responsibilities and the authority to act as Task Lead on behalf of the Department of Defense (DoD) to provide leadership, integration, development, and testing as the primary U.S. Government coordinator for the National Implementation Plan WMD-Terrorism Task 5.4.4.  The EOD Device Defeat effort adds targeted rapid development of tools, techniques, and procedures for the access and advanced diagnostics and defeat of WMD systems and IEDs.  The focus of the activity is prototype development and transition of promising technologies to the warfighters for procurement.\n\nThe USSOCOM Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction \u2013 Terrorism Support Program (SCSP) addresses Commander USSOCOM responsibilities under the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Unified Command Plan (UCP) for integrating and synchronizing Defense-wide operations and activities to prevent terrorists from developing, acquiring, proliferating, or using WMD.\n\nThe Counter WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) technologies program builds upon collaborative efforts with the warfighter.  One portion of this program involves a proof of concept and subsequent advancements in research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) and provides multi-mission capabilities that may be applied throughout the entire spectrum of warfare while significantly eliminating collateral damage.  The CWMD-T technologies program is developing technologies to enable the warfighter to locate, identify, characterize, and access WMDs, their production and storage facilities, and associated enablers along multiple nodes concurrently or simultaneously within the terrorist pathway to disrupt, delay, degrade, destroy, or deny Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) WMDs while minimizing risk to U.S. forces in support of CT\/CP offensive operations.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to decreased investment for CWMD-T testing and defeat programs."

This is directly linked to the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) priority objectives to prevent and deter conflict and prepare to defeat adversaries and succeed in a wide range of contingencies, and the key missions of deter and defeat aggression in anti-access environments; and prevent proliferation and counter weapons of mass destruction.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of advanced technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating those technologies into the weapons and delivery systems most relevant to the COCOMs\u2019 WMD Defeat CONOPS for their AOR.  The primary focus of current efforts is defeating an adversary's WMD capability protected in the confines of hardened and protected bunker and tunnel facilities.  Included in this program is the development of offensive defeat capabilities, WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation  of the next generation capability as well as the advanced modeling and simulation necessary for ensuring optimum weapon solutions are achieved based on this technology.  The program addresses requirements delineated in the QDR and Strategic Planning Guidance as codified in Joint Capability Integrated Development (JCID) documents, Service requirements documents, and COCOMs and Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal C-WMD capability.  The efforts contained in the program further develop, mature, and demonstrate technology and weapon system concepts that greatly enhance the warfighters' capability to defeat the spectrum of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs) and elsewhere throughout the lifecycle functions from production to weaponization, storage, and employment.\n\nThe program\u2019s investment approach is based on a strategic top-down analysis of threat vulnerabilities and aligned with stated organizational core competencies and lines of operations aimed at the defeat of (1) the chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat materials, (2) the ability to deliver the same, and (3) the support networks, both physical and non-physical, enabling both.  The program places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within some mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials.  Our end-state is to provide COCOMs with accurate and timely WMD defeat expertise, tailored technologies, and customized solutions that provide offensive weapons and capabilities to combat WMD in any target while mitigating collateral contamination effects.  Without these capabilities our nation cannot effectively hold at risk our adversaries\u2019 WMD capabilities thus giving them strategic advantage.\n \nThe increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to increased investment in Counter WMD Hard Target Defeat Weapons Development to mature and demonstrate innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon capability for the physical or functional defeat of the WMD structures, functions, and\/or the agents themselves with a minimum of collateral effects from incidental release of agent."

It leverages fifty years of testing expertise to investigate weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferant nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD (nuclear, biological and chemical).  The project maintains testing infrastructure to support the testing requirements of warfighters, other government agencies, and friendly foreign countries on a cost reimbursable basis.  It creates testing strategies and a WMD Test Bed infrastructure focusing on the structural response of buildings and Hard & Deeply Buried Targets that house nuclear, biological, and chemical facilities.  It provides support for full and sub-scale tests that focus on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include aboveground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels.  This capability does not exist anywhere else within the DoD and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Combat WMD.

                            "val": "For some hard and deeply buried targets, physical destruction is neither possible, nor practical, with current conventional weapons and employment techniques.  It may be possible, however, to achieve target defeat objectives by denying or disrupting the mission or function of the target facility.  Functional defeat, however, requires more information, more detailed analysis of the target.  The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining its vulnerabilities to available weapons, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and if necessary, suppressing reconstitution efforts and re-attacking the facility.  Target Assessment Technologies provides the Combatant Commands and the Intelligence Community with technologies and processes to find and characterize Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) targets located in underground facilities and then, in near-real-time, assess the results of attacks against those targets.  Overall objectives are to develop new methodologies, processes and technologies for detecting, locating, identifying, physically and functionally characterizing, modeling, and assessing new and existing hard and deeply buried targets to support physical or functional defeat.  Extending this activity and applying these processes to WMD time-dependent target characterization and threat analysis presents the next technical challenge.  The Target Assessment Technologies project consists of three subordinate and related activities: (1) Targeting and Intelligence Community Technology Development; (2) Find, Characterize, Assess Technology Development; and (3) Counter-WMD Analysis Cell (C-WAC) Technology Support.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to decreased investment in Counter-WMD Analysis Cell collaboration with the National Counterproliferation Center (NCPC) and the Intelligence Community."
