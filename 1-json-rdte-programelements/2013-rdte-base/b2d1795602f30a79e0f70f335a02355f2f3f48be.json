In addition, during FY 2012 and FY 2013 the office will expand a maritime portfolio focused on irregular warfare capabilities in that domain as a complement to the existing maritime technology demonstrator and ground and Inteligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) portfolios.

Recent projects conducted by RRTO have highlighted a significant gap in maritime capability against non-traditional challenges, which this portfolio addresses.  Stiletto is a maritime demonstration platform designed to assist in the rapid transition of technologies applicable across the range of military operations to higher Technology Readiness Levels.  The 88-foot long boat is an experimental, all carbon fiber craft originally built to explore the scalability of non-mechanical dynamic lift, composite carbon fiber construction, and high-speed performance for military operations.  The craft was purposefully designed to rapidly acquire, deploy, and employ new capabilities to explore the military utility of emerging technologies and concepts of operation for special and expeditionary forces.  Both the craft and its systems were designed to be flexible, modular, and re-configurable to enable near \u201cplug-and-play\u201d installation of C4I equipment used as part of experimentation.\n\nThe Stiletto program, managed in partnership with the Naval Surface Warfare Center\u2019s Combatant Craft Division and the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division\u2019s Warfare Innovation Cell, streamlines the experimental process and helps facilitate the rapid demonstration, exploration, and risk reduction of emerging technologies and capabilities.  The craft\u2019s simple application process for experimentation is intended to provide low cost access for industry, government and academic organizations to install and prove their systems in a realistic maritime environment.  The demonstration process also encourages system developers to engage directly with the warfighter in the maritime environment to rapidly adapt technologies around warfighter needs.  The Stiletto vessel is homeported in Norfolk, Virginia."

The project will demonstrate the technical maturity of a scalable vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.  Key technologies to be demonstrated include a buoyancy management system to enable ballast-independent operations, composite lightweight rigid external structure to reduce environmental restrictions, a responsive low-speed\/hover control system with associated control algorithms, and a ground handling subsystem to enable operations on unimproved landing surfaces.\n\nThe program objective is to mitigate long-term technical risk by integrating and demonstrating a suite of technologies with the potential to reduce operational constraints on future heavy-lift, buoyant-aircraft development programs.  If successful, the prototype will enable the rapid development of a nascent class of air vehicle which will radically reduce the energy use per ton-mile of airlift operations, permit high-payload operations directly into and out of austere regions with little infrastructure, and enable long-endurance manned or unmanned air operations.\n\nRAVB aircraft appear to be potentially scalable to payloads of 500-1,000 tons (compared with payloads in the 125-ton range for the largest current U.S. cargo aircraft).  With cruise speeds of 80-100 knots, RAVB aircraft could surpass by several times the speed of fast sealift.  With the potential to operate from land or water with very little infrastructure, RAVB aircraft may also drastically reduce the need for intermodal transportation as cargo moves from origin to point of need, with corresponding reduction in delivery times.\n\nUsing a two step process, the project has been reduced to a four year program.  Step one, in FY 2011, consisted of Assistant Secretary of Defense (ASD) Research and Engineering (R&E) providing an additional $6.000 million to the program (new total FY 2011 $14.000 million) to fund acceleration of the actions needed for early completion.  These actions consisted of finalizing vehicle design, analysis, and subsystem prototyping\/testing.  Step two of this process was to roll some of the requested FY 2013 funding ($5.000 million) into FY 2012 to fund systems integration and construction plus ground and flight testing.  This project is an interagency effort between the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Research Center, and the USAF Research Laboratory."

Projects of particular interest include efforts to fill gaps in tools and capabilities that support the National Counterterrorism Strategy and the Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) Abroad Framework by developing measures of effectiveness, social media analysis, and counter-narrative capabilities.  Specific support to COCOM needs will be coordinated through the Director for Information Operations in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict (SO\/LIC)."

The update will focus on existing and needed technical capabilities to respond in a systemic, rapid, sustained and measurable way to adversarial narratives being used to undermine our military and security efforts.  It will also look at technologies to rapidly analyze and respond to those narratives in the information environment.  The update will identify gaps in seven areas to guide future project developments: analytical tools, production, content delivery, research, planning, training, and evaluation tools.  Utilizing this gap analysis, several projects will be funded in FY 2012 to support Information Operations and CVE needs in partnership with SO\/LIC, the COCOMs, State Department\u2019s Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications, USAID, and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s S&T and Human Factors programs.  Specific emphasis will be placed on capabilities beneficial to the priority countries identified by the National Security Staff."
