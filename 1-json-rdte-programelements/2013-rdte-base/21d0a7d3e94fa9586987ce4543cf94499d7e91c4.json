MSS provides an integrated suite of enhancements to the combat vehicle crew member and commander to address identifiable capability gaps in their ability to fight, communicate, and maneuver across the full spectrum of operations.  MSS consists of lightweight, modular, and misison tailorable equipment and Command, Control, Communications and Computer (C4) devices worn, carried, or used by mounted crew members in performance of their missions.  Congressionally added funding in FY10 for Soldier Power efforts has been applied to the Soldier Power project line.  NW provides unparalleled situational awareness and understanding to the dismounted leader allowing for faster and more accurate decisions in the tactical fight.  This translates into Soldiers being at the right place, at the right time, with the right equipment making them more effective, more lethal, and more survivable in the execution of their combat mission."

These improved systems enable the warfighter to sustain themselves for extended mission duration.  An advanced, integrated Soldier power system provides the Soldier with a worn power capability that is significantly more efficient and lighter than carrying separate batteries for each device.  Soldier Power Systems address the power and energy gap created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier portable power consumers, such as Situational Awareness (SA) (Displays), Global Positioning System (GPS) Navigation, Weapon Sensors, and Radio Command and Control Communications. This effort began as a Congressional plus up for development and system improvements to the M-25 fuel cell and Acid Alkaline (AA) batteries, and continues to develop a line of power sources and solutions suited for not only the individual Soldier, but for the Team and Squad. These power solutions include, but are not limited to individual Soldier worn systems, integrated power vests, wireless power technology, and small unit charger\/power supplies; all intended for use in the most austere operating environments. A Portable Power System will equip the Squad with power to the forward edge.  Soldier portable power platforms reduce the weight and logistical risk and burden associated with moving fuel and primary (disposable) batteries.  It enables Infantry Squads to operate independently for longer durations without being tethered to a large generator, vehicle, or supply train. This effort is in support of the March 2011 Soldier Protection Capability Development Document (CDD), the December 2011 Operational Energy Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the Army Chief of Staff's Squad: Foundation of the Decisive Force initiative, and the December 2011 Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) Operational Energy directives specified by GEN Allen."

The system provides unparalleled situational awareness and understanding to the dismounted leader allowing for faster and more accurate decisions in the tactical fight. This translates into Soldiers being at the right place, at the right time, with the right information making them more effective, more lethal, and more survivable in the execution of their combat mission. The NW program focuses on the integration and evaluation of commercial smart devices for the MC\/SA system, improved navigation, and reduced fratricide through the visualization of friendly forces.  The development and integration process employs combat veteran for Soldier integration and feedback enhancing the human factors and fightability. NW also develops supporting power systems aimed at achieving NET ZERO power balance in the expeditionary environment. This project funds the following: 1) the yearly developmental and operational test of the NW with continually advancing commercial smart device technology inserted, (2) the software development for planned updates, 3) integration with Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), including vehicle power integration, 4) and government led integration and system engineering and program management.  Note this is the continuation of work performed in Program Element (PE) 0603827A\/S49."

The NW MS C is executed in 2QFY12 followed by a low rate Capability Set (CS) 14 production award.  Conduct Developmental Test and Evaluation planned for 4QFY12-1QFY13, followed by 1QFY13 Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) as well as hardware, software, integration and program management.  The Developmental and Operational tests are validation of the system utility, supportability, and austere-environment power production and regeneration strategy-leading to a production decision in the 2QFY13 to procure the CS14 quantity of NW systems and support. NW also continues to reduce size, weight and power through a semi-annual integration and evaluation and test of commercial smart device technologies which evolve continuously."
