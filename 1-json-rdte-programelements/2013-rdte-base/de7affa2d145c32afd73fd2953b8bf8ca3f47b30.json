JPIv2 development will be informed by prototype collection capabilities.  U.S. forces are currently operating unilaterally or in combination with joint, multinational, and interagency partners, to identify unknown individuals and verify the identity of person(s) across the full spectrum of military operations.  Capabilities proposed for JPIv2 will be configurable for multiple operational mission environments.  JPIv2 planned development employs integrated software and sensors to capture multimodal information in an interoperable system facilitating the use of biometrics.  JPIv2 captures an individual's identity utilizing the person's unique physiological, and\/or behavioral features and linking this identity to the individual's past activities, earlier encounters, and previously used identities.  The operating environment includes anywhere military forces may operate.  The JPIv2 will interoperate with a variety of other biometric collection, database, and information systems and adhere to applicable technical standards.\n\nFY2013 Core funding supports the planning, development and preparation for a Milestone B decision in FY2013. Funds will also support development activities under an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract for JPIv2 program of record.  EMD efforts include: defining system of systems functionality and interface requirements; complete preliminary design to include both hardware and software; define and develop system maturity, reliability and technical performance measures; develop operational deployment sustainability, suitability and survivability plans; and conduct technical reviews consistent with required system capability.  Additionally, funding will support government civilian labor and operations to include travel, training, supplies, infrastructure, and facility costs.  Funds will also support Test and Evaluation (T&E) activities under an EMD contract for JPIv2 program of record.  EMD T&E efforts include: development of test plans against system requirements; conducting preliminary testing of system of systems functionality; production of test reports to inform developmental activities; and providing T&E support to scheduled technical reviews."

This approach will entail selecting and integrating commercial off the shelf (COTS) products to meet the warfighter's needs based on a Capabilities Development Document (CDD).  In line with this recommended approach, the Acquisition Strategy for DoD Biometrics JPIv2 program is scheduled to begin development with a Milestone B decision in FY 2013.  The current Biometric Automated Toolset-Army Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) will be supported and maintained to include continued sustainment and enhancement while the JPIv2 capabilities are developed.  In FY2013, BAT-A will be sustained with Overseas Contingency Operations funding."
