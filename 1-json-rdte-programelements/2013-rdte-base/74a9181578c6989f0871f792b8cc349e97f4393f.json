TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions.  TDLs increase mission effectiveness, providing enhanced situational awareness, positive combat identification of aircraft in the network, correlation of on- and off-board sensor data, digital machine to machine target and threat information sharing; enabling time critical targeting and other mission assignment tasking. TDLs are used by all Service Theater Command and Control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors.  TDLs include, but are not limited to: Link 16, Link 11, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Variable Message Format (VMF), Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), and other Advanced Tactical Data Link technologies, such as Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT), and Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL).  \n\nThis effort provides critical capability and enhancements to the Aerial Layer Network by creating common development, integration and interoperability among all Air Force fighter platforms including but not limited to A-10, F-15A-E, F-16 Blocks 30\/40\/50, F-22A, and F-35 aircraft.  The funds associated with the Fighter TDL PE ensure the Air Force (AF) fighter fleet maintains standardization; develops interoperable data link exchanges; and enables Global Strike (GS), Global Persistent Attack (GPA), Offensive and Defensive Counterair (OCA and DCA), Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD), and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) missions.  Incorporation of TDLs on the fighter fleet also expands Line of Sight (LOS) and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) data link connectivity. Additional efforts aimed at maintaining interoperability amongst the platforms in this portfolio include: AF and Joint interoperability certification testing, waveform crypto modernization, updates to the Link-16 message standard (MIL-STD-6016D) and integration of applicable Interface Change Proposals (ICPs) within platform Operational Flight Programs and incorporating Interoperable Systems Management and Requirements Transformation (iSMART); a process which enables network centric interoperability assessments to be made more quickly and effectively.     \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nFighter Tactical Data Link program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

TDLs increase mission effectiveness, providing enhanced situational awareness, positive combat identification of aircraft in the network, correlation of on- and off-board sensor data, digital machine to machine target and threat information sharing; enabling time critical targeting and other mission assignment tasking. TDLs are used by all Service Theater Command and Control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors.  TDLs include, but are not limited to: Link 16, Link 11, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Variable Message Format (VMF), Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), and other Advanced Tactical Data Link technologies, such as Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT), and Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL).  \n\nThis effort provides critical capability and enhancements to the Aerial Layer Network by creating common development, integration and interoperability among all Air Force fighter platforms including but not limited to A-10, F-15A-E, F-16 Blocks 30\/40\/50, F-22A, and F-35 aircraft.  The funds associated with the Fighter TDL PE ensure the Air Force (AF) fighter fleet maintains standardization; develops interoperable data link exchanges; and enables Global Strike (GS), Global Persistent Attack (GPA), Offensive and Defensive Counterair (OCA and DCA), Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD), and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) missions.  Incorporation of TDLs on the fighter fleet also expands Line of Sight (LOS) and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) data link connectivity. Additional efforts aimed at maintaining interoperability amongst the platforms in this portfolio include: AF and Joint interoperability certification testing, waveform crypto modernization, updates to the Link-16 message standard (MIL-STD-6016D) and integration of applicable Interface Change Proposals (ICPs) within platform Operational Flight Programs and incorporating Interoperable Systems Management and Requirements Transformation (iSMART); a process which enables network centric interoperability assessments to be made more quickly and effectively.     \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nFighter Tactical Data Link program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
