            "val": "Through the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) and Pegasus (formally GRIFFIN), the Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS) Program enables secure sharing of operational and intelligence information and enhances collaboration amongst United States forces, their most trusted allies and additional multinational partners in the ongoing war.  This effort also increases overall combat effectiveness by leveraging capabilities and information from all partners and reducing the possibility of fratricide.  These coalition information sharing systems are in direct support of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD\u2019s) strategic goals to \u201cWin our Nation\u2019s Wars\u201d and \u201cDeter conflict and promote security\u201d.  In addition, they are aligned with DISA\u2019s strategy to \u201caccelerate operational effectiveness and efficiency\u201d and \u201cenable sharing of information while staunchly defending it.\u201d  The MNIS program currently supports five Combatant Commands (COCOMs) with connectivity in 89 nations and North America Treaty Organization (NATO), 11 Bilateral agreements and 150 sites with in excess of 80,000 users worldwide.  The MNIS also evaluates new technologies and develops tactics, techniques and procedures that facilitate the transition of technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability enhancements.  This is accomplished through the Combined Federated Battle laboratory Network (CFBLNet) and is in direct support of both CENTRIXS and Pegasus.  \n\nAs a planned improvement to the CENTRIXS coalition network, Common Mission Network Transport (CMNT) will provide a distinct and permanent CMNT backbone capabilities; thus enabling NETOPS centers to manage individual networks more efficiently.  CMNT provides a common transport for encrypted traffic to meet mission partner communication requirements and establishes a \u201cblack core capable\u201d network to facilitate the movement of Virtual Private Network traffic between segments.  This capability supports DoD instruction 8110.1 guidance of integrating CENTRIXS and other operational networks into existing DoD general service communications infrastructure as a separate network servicing all DoD MNIS requirements.   \n\nThe MNIS emerging capability, Unclassified Information Sharing (UISS), extends U.S. information sharing capabilities to its Mission Partners (MPs) and beyond, providing an efficient, effective, enterprise-level solutions that allows Combatant Commands to share unclassified information with other U.S. Government (USG) agencies, host nations (HNs), intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), nongovernmental organizations, and other non traditional partners. The employment concept for the UISS capability is to implement an Internet-based capability (IBC) approach in making its capability available to as broad a community as needed to support Combatant Command mission operations. The UISS Capability will enable multi-lateral exchanges of tangible and intangible value and ad-hoc communications through shared communities of interest and issue-specific groups among and across organizations and individuals using a Web-based, \u201cnon-mil\u201d, information sharing and collaboration tool that may be accessed anytime, from anywhere, by any user with an Internet connection, and including web-enabled mobile personal devices."

There are multiple, cryptographically-isolated CENTRIXS enclaves serving various communities of interest (COI) that support multinational efforts to include the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and counter-narcotics operations. CENTRIXS is regionally focused and combatant command (COCOM) centric. The MNIS Program Management Office (PMO) provides selected centralized services from two Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs) for five of the 40+ CENTRIXS networks\/ COIs, and engineering support for standardized solutions.  The DISA Campaign plan requires cross enclave and cross domain sharing environments that exploit enterprise and web based service capabilities by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2014. CENTRIXS does not offer the type and level of functionality required to support cross-COI mission requirements. The CENTRIXS enhancement, Common Mission Network Transport (CMNT), provides a common transport for encrypted traffic to meet mission partner communication requirements and establishe a \u201cblack core capable\u201d network to facilitate the movement of Virtual Private Network traffic between segments.  This capability supports DoD instruction 8110.1 guidance of integrating CENTRIXS and other operational networks into existing DoD general service communications infrastructure as a separate network servicing all DoD MNIS requirements.   \n\n-Second, Pegasus, (formerly GRIFFIN)\/Improved Connectivity Initiative (ICI), interconnects the national Command and Control (C2) systems of Combined\nCommunications Electronics Board (CCEB) Nations, (to include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States), using Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) security appliances and Cross Domain Solutions (CDS) that enable information sharing to facilitate situational awareness and operational planning\/execution. Pegasus has a strategic focus and is member nation centric. The name GRIFFIN\/ICI changed to Pegasus in June 2010.\n\n-Third, the Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network (CFBLNet) provides a controlled coalition Research, Development, Trials and Assessment (RDT&A)\ncoalition information sharing \u201csandbox\u201d for the United States, CCEB Nations, NATO, and invited nations. This sandbox is used to evaluate new technologies and to develop tactics, techniques and procedures that facilitate the transition of promising technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability enhancements. Its direct customers are the CCEB nations\u2019 military operational and intelligence entities led by their US counterparts at the Combatant Command and Agency levels. It is being used for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstrations, NATO missile defense initiatives, and by the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) community to test their capabilities prior to deployment.\n\n-Fourth, the Unclassified Information Sharing (UISS), extends U.S. information sharing capabilities to its Mission Partners (MPs) and beyond, providing an efficient, effective, enterprise-level solutions that allows Combatant Commands to share unclassified information with other U.S. Government (USG) agencies, host nations (HNs), intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), nongovernmental organizations, and other non traditional partners."
