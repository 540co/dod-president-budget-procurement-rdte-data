The Defensewide IO Program Review revalidated the need for a suite of automated data analysis and decision support software tools to facilitate joint-IO.  The advent of critical Cyberspace Operations mandate Cyber Technologies be assessed in a like environment.  In addition, joint warfighter requirements are driving the need for the integration of intelligence and operations capabilities\/capacities.  This program enables users to accomplish Joint Intelligence Preparation of the Operational Environment (JIPOE), develop effective IO, Cyber, and operational strategies and candidate campaign targets, plan missions, and monitor and assess execution of operations.  The objectives of this program are to create a flexible, seamless and persistent environment enabling Combatant Commanders to achieve the same level of confidence and expertise in employing IO and Cyber capabilities that they have in kinetic weapons; to lead the development of joint IOI capabilities and capacity that facilitate operational and intelligence planning activities by the Services and COCOMs; and to transform IO, Cyber, and IOI activities to support  joint IO training, education, and exercises."

The Defense-Wide IO Program Review revalidated a requirement for an integrated range supporting \u201cexercises, testing, and development of IO capabilities.\u201d  Further direction by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) identified the need for an \u201cintegrated IO test and evaluation capability to assess IO technologies and tactics in a representative operational environment against realistic targets.\u201d The 2006 National Security Strategy identifies \"Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent Attacks Against Us and Our Friends\", which involves significant Information Operations (IO) and Cyber operations as a goal.  Through the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) and the Integrated Priority Lists, COCOMs repeatedly state the need to expand IO\/Cyber training and education for the developing cadre of IO\/Cyber professionals and provide an environment for analysis, testing, training, combat assessments, and measures of effectiveness for more reliable IO\/Cyber capabilities.  Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum on the IO Range established the requirement for creating a cooperative IO range among the Military Services.  \n\nThe IO Range provides a secure, flexible, and seamless environment for the Military Services and Joint warfighters to test, train, develop tactics, and exercise selected IO\/Cyber capabilities.  The basis of the functional structure of the IO Range is the integration of existing ranges, laboratories, information warfare centers, and other Government facilities that currently support IO\/Cyber test, training, exercise, and experimentation events.  Capabilities at the selected sites are securely connected and integrated into the IO Range.  A key feature of this concept is a persistent, secure connection that links the sites together, allowing the exchange of data and the visualization of effects as we employ capabilities.  Creation of a \u201cvirtual range\u201d based on persistent connections significantly reduces the amount of lead-time required to set up each new warfighter event.  The long-term goal for the IO Range is to be a full spectrum IO\/Cyber Range supporting: operations security (OPSEC), computer network operations (CNO), electronic warfare (EW), military information support operations (MISO), and military deception (MILDEC).  This environment enables the  warfighters to visualize non-kinetic weapons effects, understand the intricate and interactive effects generated by kinetic and non-kinetic weapons and achieve the same level of confidence and expertise in employing IO\/Cyber capabilities as they have with kinetic capabilities."
