Basic research lays the foundation for future developmental efforts by identifying fundamental principles governing various phenomena and appropriate pathways to exploit this knowledge.  The ILIR program serves as a catalyst for major technology breakthroughs by providing laboratory directors flexibility in implementing novel research ideas, by nurturing promising young scientists and engineers, and is used to attract and retain top doctoral degreed scientists and engineers.  The ILIR program also provides a source of competitive funds for peer reviewed efforts at Army laboratories to stimulate high quality, innovative research with significant opportunity for payoff to Army warfighting capability.  \n\nThis PE supports ILIR at the Army Materiel Command's (AMC) six Research, Development, and Engineering Centers (Project 91A); at the six Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC) laboratories (Project 91C); at the Corps of Engineer's seven laboratories at the US Army Engineer Research, and Development Center (ERDC) (Project 91D); at the Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI) (Project 91E); and at the Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) Technical Center (Project F16).\n\nWork in the PE provides a foundation for applied research initiatives at the Army laboratories and research, development and engineering centers.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the AMC, Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD, MRMC, Ft. Detrick, MD, the ERDC, Vicksburg, MS, the ARI, Arlington, VA, and the SMDC, Huntsville, AL."
