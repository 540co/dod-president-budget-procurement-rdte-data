This program will provide, validate and transition technology to all new weapon developments and priority weapon systems and enable production of munitions insensitive to these stimuli with no reduction in combat performance. The Insensitive Munitions (IM) Program is the Navy's focused effort on propellants, propulsion units, explosives, warheads, fuses and pyrotechnics to reduce the severity of cook-off and bullet\/fragment impact reactions, minimizing the probability for sympathetic detonation, both in normal storage and in use, increasing ship survivability and satisfying performance and readiness requirements. Each technology area is divided into subtasks addressing specific munition\/munition class IM deficiencies. Energetic materials producibility is demonstrated to assure national capability to produce and load munitions systems. The program leverages are being closely coordinated with other Military Departments, North Atlantic Treaty organization (NATO) and allied countries to eliminate redundant efforts and maximize efficiency. A joint service IM requirement has been developed and through the IM Strategic Planning process, all PEO's are implementing IM in their priority munitions. Insensitive munitions are identified as a DoD critical technology requirement and considered as part of a weapon design. The Insensitive Munitions Advanced Development (IMAD) program matures the technology developed by a variety of Science and Technology (S&T) sources for program management integration into weapons systems to meet the IM technical deficiencies documented in the PEO IM Strategic Plans. IMAD provides the link between S&T programs and the PMs by optimizing IM technologies to meet Navy requirements. IMAD offers risk mitigation for the PMs in terms of IM technical knowledge, expertise and manpower with the State of the Art expertise across IM products. Each technology area is divided into subtasks addressing specific munition and munition class IM deficiencies."
