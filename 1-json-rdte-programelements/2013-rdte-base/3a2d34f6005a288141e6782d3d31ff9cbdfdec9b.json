Metrology research and development provides technology to support systems in all phases of development and acquisition, as well as Air Force R&D laboratories, test ranges, ground test facilities, and operational weapons systems support. Rapidly changing technology requires continuing research and development of measurement standards and calibration equipment to ensure modern weapon systems meet Air Force readiness objectives. This program addresses all metrology disciplines and includes the technology areas of laser, infrared, microwave, millimeter wave, optical, physical, mechanical, electrical, electronic, and ionizing radiation measurements. Metrology is a technical discipline devoted to the science of measurements and to the study and improvement of measurement technology.  Measurements are the foundation of military system development, quality assurance, hardware conformance testing and system readiness tests.  The integrity of these tests is assured through calibration and traceability assurance schemes.  The capability to measure and calibrate must parallel the emergence of new technology, new ranges, and new capabilities of military systems.  Lack of new measurement capability impedes or blocks the successful exploitation of new technologies, especially in the movement from development laboratory to production to deployment.  R&D efforts are essential within the DoD to pace these requirements, otherwise, these same new systems will suffer time delays, excessive cost, and increased risk due to unreliable test results in all phases of development, production, deployment and operation.    \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
