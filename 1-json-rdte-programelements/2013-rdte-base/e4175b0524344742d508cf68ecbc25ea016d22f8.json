            "val": "The JE Program Element provides funding for the Department\u2019s Joint Experimentation (JE) effort, carried out by the JCD&E Enterprise.   The JCD&E Enterprise includes the combatant commands, the military services, the National Guard Bureau, the Joint Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and several Defense agencies.  Intra-government agencies and coalition partners often participate in JCD&E processes and projects.  The Joint Staff J7 executes the JE program and leads the JCD&E Enterprise.  \n\nTo ensure the program focuses on needs of the warfighters, joint experiments originate from an annual call for nominations from combatant commands and Services, and from assessment of combatant command identified critical warfighting capability gaps articulated in combatant command Integrated Priority Lists and Joint Urgent Needs documents submitted, to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS).  JE nominations undergo preliminary analysis by the JCD&E Enterprise to confirm suitability for experimentation, alignment to strategic guidance and, where feasible, to associate closely related subjects for economy of effort.  The resultant list is termed Warfighter Challenges (WFCs), and constitutes experimentation efforts eligible for design and execution.  These efforts are prioritized and approved by the combatant command and Service members of the Executive Council.  \n\nExperimentation plans are developed in consultation with JE partners, and consolidated into an annual program of joint experimentation, known as the JCD&E Campaign Plan.  The Executive Council meets regularly to review and approve the progress of the efforts in the campaign plan.  The JCD&E Campaign Plan allows the Department to synchronize experimentation efforts over multiple years to avoid duplication of effort and to create synergy among the defense experimentation entities.    \n\nJE experiments and activities examine potential solutions for combatant command operational needs through targeted Doctrine, Organizational, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) improvements.  JE tackles joint concept and capability issues demanding sophisticated analysis, innovative design and complex execution.  JE addresses topics that would prove difficult for individual combatant commands and Services to capture in the context of their immediate operational and force generation responsibilities.  Experiments and efforts produce a range of outcomes inclusive of fundamental joint doctrine, inputs to major policy documents such as the Quadrennial Defense Review and the Defense Planning and Programming Guidance (DPPG). In partnership with the combatant commands and Services, JE mitigates operational risk by establishing procedural models to conduct emergent concepts like Irregular Warfare, Integrated Financial Operations and Joint Operational Access that are not yet instantiated in conventional force generation.  The results are briefed to Functional Capability Boards who integrate solutions into their functional investment plans."
