            "val": "Today, the Department of Defense (DoD) faces many challenges.  The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) provides cost effective tools the Department needs to address the most difficult defense problems.  These tools include modern high performance computing hardware, parallel software, wide area networking services and the expertise to use them.  The HPCMP helps enable DoD personnel to:\n\n-  Conduct basic research into areas such as materials, fuels, turbulence, proteins, electromagnetic fields, signal image relationships, structural response, blast effects, and combustion;  \n-  Conduct applied research into areas such as aerodynamics applied to fighter and transport manned and unmanned aircraft; automated target recognition; hydrodynamics applied to new hull forms, structural performance of new armor and penetrator concepts; and explosives performance;\n-  Design elements of weapon systems such as the Hellfire missile, F-35, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle, C-17, the Javelin missile, and directed energy weapons systems;\n-  Test and evaluate weapons system performance on systems such as F-16, F-22, F-35, C-17, FCS, AIM-9X, GBU-39 and Striker;\n-  Immediately support urgent operations for efforts such as counter Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), Hurricane Katrina related flood modeling, and the 2010 Gulf oil spill migration modeling.\n\nHigh Performance Computing (HPC) has been identified as a key enabling technology essential to achieving the DoD's research development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) objectives.  Validated requirements collected across the DoD reflect the needs of 4,400 scientists and engineers located at hundreds of locations (DoD Laboratories, Test Centers, academic institutions and commercial businesses).  The integrated HPCMP consists of DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs), the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and Software Application Support.  DSRCs are responsible for as much of DoD`s RDT&E computational workload as feasible.  DSRCs provide extensive capabilities to address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments.  Dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) augment the DSRCs to form the total HPCMP computational capability.  DHPIs address critical HPC requirements that cannot be met at DSRCs, such as real-time and near real-time computing requirements, and leverage significant HPC and mission expertise located at these remote sites.  All elements of the HPCMP are interconnected with all science and technology and test and evaluation user sites via the DREN.  DREN provides the flexible wide area network fabric needed by the RDT&E community to support technology demonstrations and distributed test and evaluation events in addition to providing access to the supercomputing centers.  The Software Application Support component develops critical common DoD applications programs that run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, supports technology transition activities with academic and commercial institutions, trains users, and builds collaborative programming environments.  The Computational Research and Engineering Acquisition Tools and Environments (CREATE) produces supercomputer-based engineering design and test tools, improving the acquisition process for major weapons systems."

                            "val": "The Department of Defense (DoD) High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) supports the needs of the warfighter for technological superiority and military dominance on the battlefield by providing advanced computational services to U.S. weapons system scientists and engineers.  By exploiting continuous advances in high performance computing (HPC) technology, the defense research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) community is able to resolve critical scientific and engineering problems more quickly and with more precision.  The results of these efforts feed directly into the acquisition process by improving weapons system designs through an increased fundamental understanding of materials, aerodynamics, chemistry, fuels, acoustics, signal image recognition, electromagnetics, and other areas of basic and applied research.  As such, HPC has been identified as a key enabling technology essential to achieving the objectives of the DoD's RDT&E.\n\nThe program primarily provides supercomputing services through DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs).   Additionally, support for specialized programs is provided through dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs).  DHPIs support a one-time need and have no support tail within the HPCMP.  Centers and DHPIs directly support the DoD RDT&E laboratories and test centers and are accessible to local and remote scientists and engineers via high-speed network access.  An integral part of the program is providing for the adaptation of broadband, widely used applications and algorithms to address RDT&E requirements, along with continued training of users as new system designs and concepts evolve.  The program pursues continuous interaction with the national HPC infrastructure, including academia, industry, and other government agencies to facilitate the sharing of knowledge, tools, and expertise.\n\nAnnually validated requirements, collected across the DoD, reflect the needs of 4,400 scientists and engineers located at hundreds of locations (DoD Laboratories, Test Centers, academic institutions and commercial businesses), and help drive program decisions.  The integrated HPC program consists of DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs), the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and Software Application Support.  DSRCs are responsible for as large a fraction of DoD`s science and technology (S&T) and test and evaluation (T&E) computational workload as feasible.  DSRCs provide extensive capabilities to address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments.  DHPIs augment the DSRCs to form the total HPCMP computational capability.  DHPIs address critical HPC requirements that cannot be met at DSRCs, such as real-time, and near real-time computing requirements, and leverage significant HPC and mission expertise located at these remote sites.  All elements of the HPCMP are interconnected with all S&T and T&E user sites via the DREN.  Additionally, the Software Application Support component develops critical common DoD applications programs that run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, supports technology transition activities with academic and commercial institutions, trains users, and builds collaborative programming environments.\n\nTrue modernization of DoD`s HPC capability and fulfillment of the program's vision and goals requires an on-going program strategy that addresses all aspects of HPC.  While advancing the level of hardware performance is critical to success, the higher objective is to enable better scientific research, T&E environments, and technology development for superior weapons, warfighting, and related support systems.  The Program goals are to (1) acquire, deploy, operate and maintain best-value supercomputers; (2) acquire, develop, deploy and support software applications and computational work environments that enable critical DoD research, development and test challenges to be analyzed and solved; (3) acquire, deploy, operate and maintain a communications network that enables effective access to supercomputers and to distributed S&T\/T&E computing environments; (4) continuously educate the RDT&E workforce with the knowledge needed to employ computational modeling effectively and efficiently; and (5) promote collaborative relationships among the DoD computational science community, the national computational science community and minority serving institutes.\n\nThe DREN provides wide area network (WAN) connectivity among the Department's S&T and T&E communities.  The DREN is implemented through an Intersite Services Contract awarded to MCI (WORLDCOM) during FY 2002.  A new DREN network services contract is planned to be awarded in FY 2011.  DREN currently provides services to sites throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and can be extended overseas where necessary.  A Secret DREN using common Secret systems high key with NSA certified Type-1 encryptors that can transport classified traffic at OC-3 (155 Mbps) has also been deployed.  The HPCMP employs state-of-the-art WAN security and strong host and user security creating a defense-in-depth security architecture."

Two DHPIs at the NAVAIR's Air Combat Environment Test and Evaluation Facility, Patuxent River, MD and at the Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD were competitively awarded and fully funded in FY 2011.  Two DHPIs at the AFRL-RD, Kihei, HI and at the NRL-MRY, Monterey, CA were competitively awarded and partially funded in FY 2011 will follow-on funding planned for FY 2012.   Computational services were provided to over 4,000 scientists and engineers located at over 200 DoD Laboratories, Test Centers, academic institutions and commercial businesses.  These services enabled basic research, applied research, design elements of weapon systems, test and evaluation of weapons system performance. \n\nA program adjustment provided in the FY 2011 Appropriation was used for accelerated portal development and \"green computing\" projects."
