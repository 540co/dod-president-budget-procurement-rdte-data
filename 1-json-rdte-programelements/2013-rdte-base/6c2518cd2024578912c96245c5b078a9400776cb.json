The JAGM system is a common air-to-ground precision guided missile for use by Joint Service manned and unmanned aircraft.  The JAGM program will extend the Technology Development (TD) Phase 27 months to address affordability and reexamine requirements with the warfighter. The continued TD Phase will include a delta-Preliminary Design Review (PDR), developmental testing, qualification, and design reviews of the guidance section, and U.S. Government led all-up round qualification.  After the completion of the design reviews in FY13, a Configuration Steering Board will be held to review capabilities desired for the first JAGM increment developed and fielded in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase.  At the conclusion of all qualification testing, the JAGM Program will conduct government controlled ground flight testing to validate all up round integration.  The government plans to award two fixed-priced contracts to the both prime contractors from the previous TD Phase that concluded in December 2010."
