Service Receive Suites and the integration into service networks are funded in other Program Elements.  GBS broadcast data includes video (especially from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), imagery, logistics, weather data, maps and operational orders.  The GBS space segment includes transponders on operational Navy satellites, currently Ultra High Frequency Follow-On (UFO) 8 and UFO 10, augmentation by commercial leased Ku-band transponders, and now the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) System.  \n\nCurrently, the GBS broadcast segment consists of Satellite Broadcast Managers (SBMs) for the broadcast build and Primary Injection Points (PIPs) for the broadcast uplink, and the Transportable Satellite Broadcast Managers (TSBMs) for the broadcast build in theatre.  The SBMs and PIPs, together known as Transmit Suites, are located at Navy facilities.  The Theatre Injection Point (TIP) is a ground mobile satellite terminal suite transportable via two heavy High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV) consisting of the TSBM and the Army Phoenix terminal.  \n\nDuring FY09-13, the broadcast creation transitions to existing Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs). This transition addresses SBM hardware\/software obsolescence issues.  The DECC transition contract was awarded on 15 May 09.  This effort was designated as an ACAT III program and funding was realigned (i.e., a separate project was created) to delineate between the current ACAT I GBS program and the ACAT III SBM Transition program.    \n\nIn FY13, this effort completes SBM transition\/upgrade to DECCs, as well as systems transmission security, test, information assurance, program office support and Operational Requirements Document (ORD) III studies.\n\nFunding is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, since program is fielding pre-production equipment."

Service Receive Suites and the integration into service networks are funded in other Program Elements.  GBS broadcast data includes video (especially from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), imagery, logistics, weather data, maps and operational orders.  The GBS space segment includes transponders on operational Navy satellites, currently Ultra High Frequency Follow-On (UFO) 8 and UFO 10, augmentation by commercial leased Ku-band transponders, and now the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) System.  \n\nCurrently, the GBS broadcast segment consists of Satellite Broadcast Managers (SBMs) for the broadcast build and Primary Injection Points (PIPs) for the broadcast uplink, and the Transportable Satellite Broadcast Managers (TSBMs) for the broadcast build in theatre.  The SBMs and PIPs, together known as Transmit Suites, are located at Navy facilities.  The Theatre Injection Point (TIP) is a ground mobile satellite terminal suite transportable via two heavy High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV) consisting of the TSBM and the Army Phoenix terminal.  \n\nDuring FY09-13, the broadcast creation transitions to existing Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs). This transition addresses SBM hardware\/software obsolescence issues.  The DECC transition contract was awarded on 15 May 09.  This effort was designated as an ACAT III program and funding was realigned (i.e., a separate project was created) to delineate between the current ACAT I GBS program and the ACAT III SBM Transition program.    \n\nIn FY13, this effort completes SBM transition\/upgrade to DECCs, as well as systems transmission security, test, information assurance, program office support and Operational Requirements Document (ORD) III studies.\n\nFunding is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration, since program is fielding pre-production equipment."
