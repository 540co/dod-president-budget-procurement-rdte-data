CVLSP core missions are to provide nuclear weapon convoy escort, 24\/7 adverse weather capable InterContinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) emergency security response\/operational support, and mass passenger transport\/Operational Support Airlift (OSA) in the National Capital Region. Other assigned missions include Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) OSA, survival school support, test and range support, and combat aviation advisor training.\n\nThese funds provide for missionization of an in-production, non-developmental, Government Off-The-Shelf or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (GOTS\/COTS) aircraft including flight testing, Live Fire Test and Evaluation, and airworthiness certification.  Funding also provides for development or conversion of COTS training systems, technical data, support equipment, and logistics elements as required for use in an operational environment.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fielding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
