This project will focus specifically on the usability and human robot interface (HRI) design issues. The end result will be a UI that provides a common look and feel across the family of UGVs, fully supports the operator in accomplishing the most common EOD mission tasks and functions, and in general makes the EOD operator\u2019s job easier rather than more difficult. Although this effort is focused on the EOD mission, many of the resulting lessons, UI design techniques, and the underlying software will be applicable to a wide range of UGV systems and missions.\n       -  Identified and documented Human-Robot Interface software requirements\n       -  Define user interface screens and controls\n       -  Update Multi-robot Operator Control Unit (MOCU)\n       -  Usability test for HRI system\n       -  Final Delivery of MOCU\n2)  High Speed Small Tele-operation Command & Control - The purpose of this project is to develop and demonstrate an advanced system to employ UGV-based stability technologies, low latency operator control and feedback, and necessary autonomy to support high speed assisted-tele-operation for small UGVs. High speed tele-operation is defined here as greater than 25 kph on improved surfaces and 15 kph on unimproved surfaces.  This project addresses the problem of sub-optimized robotic performance during military operations due to a lack of operator situational awareness.\n       -  Capstone Demonstration of the system\n3)  Automated Mobile Communication Relay - This project will develop an automated communications relay on a man-portable robot. The lead robot will be outfitted with sensors that detect pertinent elements in the environment, and communicate them to the communications robot, all transparent to the EOD technician. The initial effort will focus on a robust single relay and then explore extending the approach to include additional relays, perhaps on smaller platforms.  This project is expected to start in FY2012.\n4)  Non-Radio Frequency Communication for Small UGVs \u2013 This project will research, develop, and evaluate alternative methods to RF communications small UGV.\n      -  Completed Interrogator Fabrication\n      -  Completed Interrogator field tests\n      -  Completed Interrogator Demonstrations\n      -  Completed Modulating Retro-Reflector Fabrication\n      -  Finalized Pod Relay Fabrication\n      -  Finalized Pod Relay Mount Fabrication\n      -  Held System Demonstration and Delivery"
