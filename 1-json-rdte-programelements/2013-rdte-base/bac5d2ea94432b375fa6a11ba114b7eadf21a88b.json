            "val": "The Joint Program Office (JPO) for IBS Terminals supports all Services and Special Operations Command (SOCOM). The Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) is the worldwide Department of Defense (DoD) standard network for transmitting time-sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence and targeting data to all echelons of Joint Service operational users. The JPO's role is to consolidate and replace existing IBS terminal functionality and capability, and to expedite execution of the IBS Technical Transition Plan (TTP). The JTT family of systems currently consists of the JTT-Senior and JTT-IBS. The TTP is a comprehensive refresh effort of the entire IBS network focused on rearchitecting the broadcast from its current multi-broadcast, multi-data format structure, to a single broadcast (Common Interactive Broadcast - CIB) and single data format (Common Message Format - CMF). The JTT family of systems is a critical component of the TTP as these systems are the only IBS receiver\/transceiver devices in the DoD being modernized to support both the new consolidated broadcast architecture and the National Security Agency's (NSA) crypto modernization mandate. The JTT upgrades must execute the over-the-air broadcast portion of the TTP in the near term to avoid a complete cessation of IBS data flow via the existing over-the-air IBS broadcast networks. The JTT will be the official IBS producer system, ensuring continued IBS interoperability to a variety of tactical receivers across DoD and the services throughout the TTP implementation period and beyond. This program funds the integration and evaluation of JTT hardware and software modules, as well as implementing performance enhancements to the family of JTT equipment. This is necessary to ensure crypto modernization compliance and to facilitate migration to a rearchitected CIB and CMF-based IBS broadcast structure.  \n\nFY13 Funds of $.096 million support the final testing of the Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) waveform migration to the IBS Intelligence Data Enterprise.  The JTT technical insertion transitions to sustainment by the end of FY12. During the November 2010 POM brief, a zero-sum request was submitted to shift $1.5 million of FY13 Base Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation dollars to FY13 Base Procurement dollars to sustain support for DoD customers."
