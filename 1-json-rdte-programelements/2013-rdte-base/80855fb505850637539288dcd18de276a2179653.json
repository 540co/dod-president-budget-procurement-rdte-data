The Enhanced Command, Control, Battle Management and Communication (EC2BMC) Program develops and demonstrates technologies which improve the ability of BMDS to counter raids and integrates early intercept experiments for the Phased Adaptive Approach Architecture. The Advanced Research Program develops new early intercept capabilities by leveraging industry and university research. This program also manages the selection process and administers the Missile Defense Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program Element, 0605502C. The SBIR Research Areas for FY 2012 include Test Instrumentation, Aegis, Command Control Battle Management Communication (C2BMC), Radar, Infrared, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Targets and Countermeasures, Israeli Program, Modeling and Simulation, Anti-Tamper, Standard Missile-3 Block IIB, Directed Energy, and Quality, Safety and Mission Assurance. The Advanced Technology Modeling and Simulation program develops integrated simulations to enable planning and assessment of the BMDS Phased Adaptive Approach architectures and designs methods for assessing integrated hardware and software performance in representative Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) threat scenarios."
