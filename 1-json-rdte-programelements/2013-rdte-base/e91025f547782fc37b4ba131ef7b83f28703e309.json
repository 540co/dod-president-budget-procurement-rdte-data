            "val": "Communication, Navigation, Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM): This Air Force (AF) program centralizes engineering and technical expertise for CNS capability acquisitions and modifications to ensure that all AF aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) comply with appropriate CNS\/ATM and Navigation Safety performance standards and requirements enabling access to U.S. and international nation\/state managed airspace. The Aerospace Management Systems Division (AMSD) supports AF aircraft and UAS CNS\/ATM acquisitions as the AF's centralized focal point (Center of Excellence) for identifying, analyzing, and evaluating internationally accepted civil aviation authority operational airspace rules, procedures and requirements worldwide. This group of experts identifies, analyzes, and evaluates the technical performance standards and requirements of the prescribed CNS capabilities and supports platform program offices in the design and integration of the capabilities required to ensure access to civil airspace worldwide. Department of Defense policy states that military platforms conducting peacetime operations will conform to applicable rules to ensure interoperability and transparency within national and international airspace. AMSD verifies that the system's end-to-end performance for each CNS capability integrated into AF platforms complies with these internationally accepted rules and standards.  AMSD will develop and maintain CNS\/ATM performance matrices used to identify specific CNS\/ATM requirements and will provide acquisition and engineering support services through the entire acquisition management system. Furthermore, AMSD will develop and award Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity contracts for centralized procurement of CNS\/ATM and Nav Safety products. AMSD will also participate in the development of Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness assurance and Airworthiness Certification Plans. Dual-use capabilities of avionics to satisfy both civil CNS\/ATM and military unique capability requirements will be explored as well as interoperability enhancements to expand net-centric concepts. AMSD will facilitate and participate in development and testing of CNS box-level prototypes. AMSD conducts studies and prototyping efforts to ensure AF aircraft are postured to meet current and evolving civil standards leading to the concept of \"free flight.\" AMSD also provides acquisition and engineering support to the DoD Lead Service Office for the interagency Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) initiative. As the formally designated NextGen Joint Program Office, the AMSD will be responsible for coordinating DoD activities related to the NextGen effort, facilitating technology transfer for those R&D activities with potential NextGen application, and advocate for DoD interests, requirements and capabilities in NextGen.  The AMSD will develop and coordinate NextGen architectures and equipage roadmaps with interagency partners and other regulatory agencies to allow aircraft, UAS and RPA unrestricted access into global civil airspace.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

AMSD verifies that the system's end-to-end performance for each CNS capability integrated into AF platforms complies with these internationally accepted rules and standards.  AMSD will develop and maintain CNS\/ATM performance matrices used to identify specific CNS\/ATM requirements and will provide acquisition and engineering support services through the entire acquisition management system. Furthermore, AMSD will develop and award Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity contracts for centralized procurement of CNS\/ATM and Nav Safety products. AMSD will also participate in the development of Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness assurance and Airworthiness Certification Plans. Dual-use capabilities of avionics to satisfy both civil CNS\/ATM and military unique capability requirements will be explored as well as interoperability enhancements to expand net-centric concepts. AMSD will facilitate and participate in development and testing of CNS box-level prototypes. AMSD conducts studies and prototyping efforts to ensure AF aircraft are postured to meet current and evolving civil standards leading to the concept of \"free flight.\" AMSD also provides acquisition and engineering support to the DoD Lead Service Office for the interagency Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) initiative. As the formally designated NextGen Joint Program Office, the AMSD will be responsible for coordinating DoD activities related to the NextGen effort, facilitating technology transfer for those R&D activities with potential NextGen application, and advocate for DoD interests, requirements and capabilities in NextGen.  The AMSD will develop and coordinate NextGen architectures and equipage roadmaps with interagency partners and other regulatory agencies to allow aircraft, UAS and RPA unrestricted access into global civil airspace.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
