            "val": "Software is key to meeting the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD\u2019s) increasing demand for high-quality, affordable, and timely national defense systems.  Systemic software issues are significant contributors to poor program execution, and reliance on software-intensive mobile and net-based products and systems has been increasing (e.g., Joint Tactical Radio System, DDG-1000, Joint Strike Fighter, F-22, and Army Modernization).  As stated in the 2010 National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences report entitled Critical Code, \u201cIt is dangerous to conclude that we are reaching a plateau in capability and technology for software producibility.\u201d  The report notes that software is \u201c\u2026unconstrained by traditional physical engineering limitations\u2026\u201d and what we can accomplish is derived \u201c\u2026from [the] human intellectual capacity to conceptualize and understand systems\u2026\u201d  With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Program Element (PE) addresses the critical need to research, develop, and rapidly transition state-of-the-art technology and best practices to improve the engineering, management, fielding, evolution, and acquisition of software-intensive DoD systems.  The SEI PE\u2019s program of work seeks to coordinate across the Department and the Services and leverages expertise in industry and academia to enable the development of Joint capabilities.\n\nSoftware is more pervasive than ever, and computer programs are growing in size and complexity.  Designing, managing, and securing integrated, complex, and large-scale mission-critical systems are abilities that the DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) have not yet been mastered.  P781 of this PE funds the SEI Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  The SEI FFRDC is an institute which enables the exploitation of emerging software technology by bringing engineering, management, and security discipline to software acquisition, development, and evolution, focusing on software technology areas judged to be of the highest payoff in meeting defense needs.\n\nPrivate sector investment has created rapid advances in information technologies, but the pace of transition to DoD applications is often very slow or the commercial applications do not meet DoD-unique needs (e.g., high assurance software or large scale integrated systems). The DoD needs to create opportunities to discover emerging technologies, to evaluate their potential to fit DoD needs, and, where appropriate, conduct critical tests of the technologies under DoD conditions.  P783 of this PE includes the Software Producibility Initiative and Technology from Non-Traditional Sources (TNTS) Initiative.  The Software Producibility Initiative seeks to research and transition software science and tools to model and evaluate the performance and control complexities of software-intensive systems.  It also seeks to improve the design and sustainment of those systems.  The TNTS Initiative seeks to facilitate early interactions between innovative companies and DoD users to accelerate the application of emerging technical solutions addressing DoD needs, reduce development costs, avoid technological surprise, and understand how commercial developments impact DoD programs."

The mission of the SEI is to provide technical leadership and innovation through research and development to advance the practice of software engineering and technology in support of DoD needs.  The Center works across government, industry, and academia to improve the state of software engineering from technical, acquisition, and management perspectives; engages in applied research and development of critical software technologies and tools, and collaborates with the larger software engineering research community; facilitates rapid, value-added transition of software engineering technologies into practice; and evaluates and calibrates emerging software engineering technologies to determine their potential for improving the development and evolution of software-intensive DoD systems.  Since its inception, the SEI has helped to transform the fields of software engineering and acquisition, network security, real-time systems and software\/system architecture and construction, and software engineering process management."

The Initiative maintains a portfolio of work relevant to the Warfighter and DoD needs by periodically evaluating technology development efforts, retiring those that are under performing, and starting new efforts based on a risk-reward priority list.\n\nIn addition, obtaining an early, accurate understanding of the technological advances emerging from small, innovative companies has been problematic for the DoD due to these companies often avoiding or failing to notice federal sales opportunities.  Redoing work that is being conducted in the private sector does not effectively utilize resources.  The Technology from Non-Traditional Sources (TNTS) Initiative identifies and selectively funds experimentation with innovative, emerging technologies to evaluate their potential for DoD application, with the ultimate goal of accelerating the delivery of capabilities to the Services and the Warfighter."
