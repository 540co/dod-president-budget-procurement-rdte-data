The ESO's efforts are to coordinate the ongoing electric power efforts of the PEOs and Office of Naval Research, establish the technical basis and strategic direction for Naval power system architectures, develop decision making tools, and establish technical standards.  \n\nIn October 2009, SECNAV outlined a set of specific objectives supporting U.S. Navy energy reform including several aimed at significantly reducing Fleet fuel consumption and improving our energy security posture.  The ESO supports the DON Energy Goals by employing an integrated approach to develop and transition more affordable technologies that satisfy increasing shipboard power demands and high operational tempo while improving energy efficiency, reducing fuel consumption, and reducing Total Ownership Cost. \n\nThis PE funds the development of specific and future electric surface ship technologies for all future ships, with the focus on integrated power systems, which provide total ship electric power, including electric propulsion, power conversion and distribution, and combat system and mission load interfaces to the electric power system."

                            "val": "This project supports the Integrated Power Systems (IPS) program. IPS provides total ship electric power, including electric propulsion, and power conversion and distribution. The DDG 1000 will be an electric drive ship with an integrated power architecture. USS MAKIN ISLAND (LHD 8) integrates an electric auxiliary propulsion motor for low speed operations and mechanical drive for higher speed operations.  IPS reduces acquisition and operating costs of naval ships and increases military effectiveness. IPS leverages investments in technologies that will be useable by both military and commercial sectors.  The IPS project develops and transitions technologies that implement the DON Energy Goals to reduce ship platform consumption of fossil fuels thereby reducing dependence upon foreign petroleum sources and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIPS has the potential to revolutionize the design, construction, and operation of U.S. naval ships by using electricity as the primary energy transfer medium aboard ship. The flexibility of electric power transmission allows power generating modules with various power ratings to be connected to propulsion loads and ship service in any arrangement that supports the ship's mission at lowest overall cost. Systems engineering in IPS is focused on increasing the commonality of components used across ship types and in developing modules which will be integral to standardization, zonal system architectures, and generic shipbuilding strategies. The purpose of increased commonality is to reduce the total cost of ship ownership by using common modules composed of standard components and\/or standard interfaces.\n\nIPS addresses ship platform program goals through: reduced ship acquisition cost through integration of propulsion and ship's service prime movers; lower ship operational costs resulting from more flexible operating characteristics and more efficient components; reduced ship construction costs by allowing more extensive modular construction of power generation, distribution, and loads; improved ship survivability and reduced vulnerability through increased arrangement flexibility and improved electrical system survivability; reduced manning through improved power management systems and reduced on-board maintenance requirements; improved ship signature characteristics; improved design adaptability to meet future requirements of multiple ship types or missions; integrating power management and protection by fully utilizing the power electronics in the system to perform fault protection as well as power conversion and load management functions; simplified technology insertion which allows new technologies to be installed within IPS much less expensively than presently possible; and, reduced machinery system acquisition costs through utilization of commercially shared technologies and components."
