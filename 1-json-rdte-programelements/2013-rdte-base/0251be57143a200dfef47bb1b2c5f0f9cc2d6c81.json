            "val": "This program addresses applied research associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by Program Managers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus insuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.\n\nMunition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining five, ten, and fifteen year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate Program Executive Officers (PEOs) for insertion in their Insensitive Munitions (IM) Strategic Plans \/ Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs \/ FATGs and IM \/ fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy laboratory representatives and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction and priorities during its annual meeting.\n\nThe IM effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.\n\nUnder the JIMTP, investments are focused on five Munition Areas:  High Performance Rocket Propulsion, Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, Blast and Fragmentation Warheads (BFW), Anti-Armor Warheads (AAW), and Large Caliber Gun Propulsion (LCGP).  MATGs, under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area, that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.\n\nThe Enabling Fuze Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force (GDF), the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&T) communities.  In this way, promising multi-point initiation architectures, high reliability fuze architectures, survivable components, modular fuze packaging, and components produced based on ease of manufacturing can be integrated into a munition configuration and its ability to address required capability needs can be validated.  Mature fuze technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing program costs and schedule risk and facilitating their spin-off into other munitions within their portfolios.\n\nUnder the Joint Fuze Technology Program, investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and will be validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service S&T communities. These four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, 4) and Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture."

Using technology available today, the Department has incrementally improved the IM response of our current munitions.  New munitions which have fully implemented current IM technology and design practices have been able to achieve IM compliance.  However, these have been the most easily solved problems.  Without new technology, future variants of current weapon systems will have the same, or worse, response to IM stimuli.  New weapon developments will face similar challenges. \n\nThe JIMTP, investments are focused on five Munition Areas:  High Performance Rocket Propulsion, Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, Anti-Armor Warheads, and Large Caliber Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  The program is structured around these five areas with clear cross-cutting tasks."

Operating conditions may be controlled or widely varying in both temperature and vibration.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, rocket propellant ingredients (including synthesis, characterization and scale-up), reduced smoke or smokey propellants (including formulation, characterization and scale-up), rocket motor case design, materials for active and passive thermal mitigation, shock mitigation materials and techniques, passive and active coatings, active and passive venting techniques for motor cases or containers, ignition systems, sensors and thrust mitigation techniques.

The development and demonstration of gun propulsion technologies, that when applied to munition systems, will improve munition IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and at least maintaining munition performance.  Topics include but are not limited to gun propellant formulations, ingredients for gun propellant formulations (including synthesis, characterization and scale-up), cartridge case and packaging design, active and passive venting techniques, reduced sensitivity primer propellant and primer systems and robust primers for insensitive propellants.  Applications vary, but include both large and medium caliber munitions.  Operating requirements vary, and other factors such as barrel life and operation over varying environmental conditions may be critically important depending on the intended munition application.  The five, ten, or fifteen year goals of the LCGP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of gun propulsion munitions to Fragment Impact, Shaped Charge Jet, and Slow Cookoff threats."
