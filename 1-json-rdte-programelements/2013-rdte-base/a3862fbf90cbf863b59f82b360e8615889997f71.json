            "val": "The Special Tactics (ST) System Development project focuses on modernization developments for the Battlefield Airmen Operations (BAO) Kit.  The project is a program within the overarching Battlefield Airmen Modernization (BA-Mod) Program.  The BAO Kit will develop and modernize the existing Family of Systems (FoS) that provides a state-of-the-art Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) suite for Air Force Special Operations Command's (AFSOC's) ST Battlefield Airmen. Efforts in the ST System Development project focus on reducing the risk of fratricide through C4ISR technology advances and substantially reducing the weight and bulk of the equipment carried by the ST Battlefield Airmen operator through four core capabilities: Human Machine Interface (HMI), Non Line of Sight (XLOS) targeting, Line of Sight (LOS) targeting, and Machine to Machine C4ISR System.  \n\nThis program will develop and enhance technologies for ST Battlefield Airmen to recognize, identify, range and designate targets during both day and night operations.  The BAO Kit significantly reduces the time required to find, fix, track, target and engage the enemy by providing highly accurate target coordinates in three dimensions, (distance, direction, elevation) generating vital imagery both pre and post-strike, and transmitting critical data to Command and Control centers.  The BAO Kit system enables the ST Battlefield Airmen to employ lethal combat airpower effectively due to each system being light, compact and portable.  FY13 funding of the BAO Kit will build upon HMI, XLOS targeting, LOS targeting, and Machine to Machine C4ISR System efforts which will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted ST Battlefield Airmen through dramatic weight reduction and increased situational awareness across the full spectrum of conflict.\n\nThe Special Tactics (ST) System Development activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "The Special Tactics (ST) System Development project focuses on modernization developments for the Battlefield Airmen Operations (BAO) Kit.  The project is a program within the overarching Battlefield Airmen Modernization (BA-Mod) Program.  The BAO Kit will develop and modernize the existing Family of Systems (FoS) that provides a state-of-the-art Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) suite for Air Force Special Operations Command's (AFSOC's) ST Battlefield Airmen. Efforts in the ST System Development project focus on reducing the risk of fratricide through C4ISR technology advances and substantially reducing the weight and bulk of the equipment carried by the ST Battlefield Airmen operator through four core capabilities: Human Machine Interface (HMI), Non Line of Sight (XLOS) targeting, Line of Sight (LOS) targeting, and Machine to Machine C4ISR System.  \n\nThis program will develop and enhance technologies for ST Battlefield Airmen to recognize, identify, range and designate targets during both day and night operations.  The BAO Kit significantly reduces the time required to find, fix, track, target and engage the enemy by providing highly accurate target coordinates in three dimensions, (distance, direction, elevation) generating vital imagery both pre and post-strike, and transmitting critical data to Command and Control centers.  The BAO Kit system enables the ST Battlefield Airmen to employ lethal combat airpower effectively due to each system being light, compact and portable.  FY13 funding of the BAO Kit will build upon HMI, XLOS targeting, LOS targeting, and Machine to Machine C4ISR System efforts which will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted ST Battlefield Airmen through dramatic weight reduction and increased situational awareness across the full spectrum of conflict.\n\nThe Special Tactics (ST) System Development activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
