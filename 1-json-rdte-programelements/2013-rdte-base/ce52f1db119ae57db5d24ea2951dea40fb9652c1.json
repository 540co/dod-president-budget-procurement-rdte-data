The system provides unparalleled situational awareness and understanding to the dismounted leader allowing for faster and more accurate decisions in the tactical fight. This translates into Soldiers being at the right place, at the right time, with the right information making them more effective, more lethal, and more survivable in the execution of their combat mission. The NW program focuses on the integration and evaluation of commercial smart devices for the MC\/SA system, improved navigation, and reduced fratricide through the visualization of friendly forces. The development and integration process employs combat veteran for Soldier integration and feedback enhancing the human factors and fightability. NW also develops supporting power systems aimed at achieving NET ZERO power balance in the expeditionary environment."

The technology development contracts have been completed. The NW MS C is executed in 2QFY12 followed by a low rate Capability Set (CS) 14 production award.  The RDT&E and Production dollars in FY12-13 pay for Developmental Test and Evaluation planned for 4QFY12-1QFY13, followed by 1QFY13 Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) as well as hardware, software, integration and program management.  The Developmental and Operational tests are validation of the system utility, supportability, and austere-environment power production and regeneration strategy-leading to the full 10 BCT set CS14 in the 2QFY13. NW also continues to reduce size, weight and power through a semi-annual integration and evaluation and test of commercial smart device technologies which evolve continuously. The development and integration process employs combat veteran for Soldier integration and feedback enhancing the human factors and fightability. NW also develops supporting power systems aimed at achieving NET ZERO power balance in the expeditionary environment."

The Air SS provides improved safety, survivability, and human performance that amplifies the Warfighter's effectiveness and facilitates full-spectrum dominance of Army aircraft. The Air SS addresses capability gaps identified during combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan including the effects of weight and bulk, limited situational awareness, and lack of functionally integrated aircrew member life support equipment. The Air SS follows an evolutionary acquisition approach with two sub-increments that integrate mature technologies to build to the full capability. Each sub-increment progressively reduces overall weight and bulk of aircrew equipment, increases situational awareness, and enhances aircrew mobility. This funding provides advanced development for the Air SS in technology areas supporting improved environmental cooling, integrated power, flexible display technologies, lightweight protective clothing, and miniaturized communication devices."

Small arms systems include weapons ranging up to 40 millimeter in caliber. Current and future efforts focus on improvements designed to enhance lethality, target acquisition, fire control, training effectiveness and reliability of weapons to include ammunition when developing and\/or evaluating standard and non-standard weapons. Focus areas include the maturing of technology through testing and evaluation of sub-system components or system prototypes which demonstrates light weight materials, wear resistant\/protective coatings, observation\/situational awareness improvements and equipment enhancements.  Benefits include continuous improvements to small arms weapons, fire control equipment, optics, gun barrels, training devices, suppressors, component mounts, weapon mounts, and weapon\/ammunition interface."
