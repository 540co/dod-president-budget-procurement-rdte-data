The disciplines are: Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering; Biosciences; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry; Civil Engineering; Cognitive, Neural, and Behavioral Sciences; Computer Science; Electrical Engineering; Geosciences; Industrial and Systems Engineering; Information Sciences; Materials Science and Engineering; Mathematics; Mechanical Engineering; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering; Nuclear Engineering; Oceanography; Operations Research; and Physics.  Upon completion of their degree, students fulfill a service commitment to the DoD on a one-to-one payback per year of education funded.\n\nManagement of the SMART program falls under the Research Directorate (RD) within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&E)).  Two types of individuals participate in the program: retention scholars who are current DoD employees, and recruitment scholars who are college students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs and who represent new talent for the Department.\n\nSince 2005, ~1,150 students have participated in SMART at ~160 sponsoring facilities and several other DoD components.  As of September 17, 2011, ~380 SMART scholars of the ~1,150 have transitioned into the service commitment phase.  To date, scholars have transitioned into the following DoD components: ~140 at Air Force facilities, ~120 at Army, ~105 at Navy, and ~10 at other DoD components.  Among those who transitioned to employment, 92 had completed their service commitment.  Of these, 82% continue to serve beyond their commitment."
