Two competitive contracts have been awarded to design, develop, and deliver all hardware and the associated operating system, virtualization and other commercial software needed to deliver a functional network. As the program accomplishes Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), a down-select will be conducted to choose the best design for Limited Deployment (LD). At the completion of LD, a separate full and open contract will be awarded for Full Deployment (FD)."
