These efforts provide the Warfighter with highly accurate, timely cargo\/payload delivery and resupply in all terrain and weather conditions.  Precision delivery\/resupply reduces vulnerability of ground soldiers, aircraft and crew. Precision aerial delivery supports remote warfare with activities such as placement of battlefield sensors, reduction of Soldier load and initial delivery of key expeditionary base camp assets.

This project demonstrates combat feeding equipment with reduced logistics (in component parts, weight, volume, fuel, and water) and labor requirements, while improving the quality of food service. The project, a Department of Defense (DoD) program for which the Army has Executive Agent responsibility, provides technology development for Joint Service Combat Feeding. The DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board provides oversight for this project.  Demonstrated field feeding equipment transition to Product Manager (PM)-Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS).\n\nEfforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nWork in this project complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602787A (Medical Technology).\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n \nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA."

Expeditionary Base Camp (EBC) systems (or remote command outposts) provide an operational capability for Small Combat Units (battalion and below) and Soldiers which are rapidly deployable\/re-locatable and require no Military Construction and limited materiel handing support.  The need for this technologically enabled capability has arisen as a result of new tactics, techniques and procedures used in austere, remote, and challenging environments in which stability operations, counterinsurgency operations and peace keeping missions are conducted.  This project integrates mature technologies to create mission specific lab demonstrators and evaluates the performance capabilities using metrics and methodologies developed under PE 0602786\/\/Project VT4.   \n\nEfforts in this program element support the Army science and technology Soldier portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nWork in this project is led, performed and\/or managed by the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA and fully coordinated with PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0602784A and 0603734A (Military Engineering) PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology)."
