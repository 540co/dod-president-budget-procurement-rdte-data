The program uses a national team with coordination between the Services, Agencies and national research laboratories to pursue integrated portfolio objectives leading to the acquisition and operation of a CPGS system.   This program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, guidance systems, and mission planning and enabling capabilities, with the goal of competitive acquisition beginning in FY 2013 or 2014.  Timing will be driven by the outcome of flight events and DoD budgets.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues. Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives.  As a result of flight tests and supporting activities, there are several boost-glide concepts available in preparation for a competitive acquisition.  In FY 2012, funding for the individual service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager."

The program uses a national team with coordination between the Services, Agencies and national research laboratories to pursue integrated portfolio objectives leading to the acquisition and operation of a CPGS system.   This program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, guidance systems, and mission planning and enabling capabilities, with the goal of competitive acquisition beginning in FY 2013 or FY 2014.  Timing will be driven by the outcome of flight events and DoD budgets.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues. Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives.  As a result of flight tests and supporting activities, there are several boost-glide concepts available in preparation for a competitive acquisition.  In FY 2012, funding for the individual service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager."

The program uses a national team with coordination between the Services, Agencies and national research laboratories to pursue integrated portfolio objectives leading to the acquisition and operation of a CPGS system.   This program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, guidance systems, and mission planning and enabling capabilities, with the goal of competitive acquisition beginning in FY 2013 or FY 2014.  Timing will be driven by the outcome of flight events and DoD budgets.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues. Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives.  As a result of flight tests and supporting activities, there are several boost-glide concepts available in preparation for a competitive acquisition.  In FY 2012, funding for the individual service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager."

The program uses a national team with coordination between the Services, Agencies and national research laboratories to pursue integrated portfolio objectives leading to the acquisition and operation of a CPGS system.   This program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, guidance systems, and mission planning and enabling capabilities, with the goal of competitive acquisition beginning in FY 2013 or 2014.  Timing will be driven by the outcome of flight events and DoD budgets.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues. Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives.  As a result of flight tests and supporting activities, there are several boost-glide concepts available in preparation for a competitive acquisition.  In FY 2012, funding for the individual service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager."
