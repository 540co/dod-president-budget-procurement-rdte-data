Key elements of DOT&E oversight authority  were identified in Calendar Year 2011 Office of the Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List.  \n\nInformation Assurance and Interoperability Evaluations\n \nInformation assurance and interoperability assessments were performed during 23 FY 2011 COCOM and Service exercises, or during real-world operations.  Warfighter responses to computer network attack (ability to protect, detect, react, and restore) were captured in all information assurance events.  Portrayal of advanced threats were included in several events.  Interoperability assessments were guided by a more rigorous process that includes expanded research and linkage to warfighter mission threads.  In partnership with Joint Staff J8 (previously the Joint Forces Command J8), two interoperability assessments were planned and executed with emphasis on the systems and capabilities contained in the Joint Forces Command C2 Optimum Capability Mix Study.  Assessment support to units deploying to theaters of operation was completed for four assessments, resulting in enhancements to their network defense postures.  Fiscal year 2011 information assurance and interoperability evaluations included trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across COCOMs.  Critical findings were transmitted to Service and DoD leadership for their awareness and remediation actions, as appropriate.  The Joint Information Operations Range supported two assessment events for added operational realism and required higher-level security during exercise assessments."

Portrayal of selected advanced-cyber threats will be included in most events, in accordance with the CJCS Red Team EXORD, and interoperability and mission accomplishment in representative threat environments will be examined.  In partnership with US CYBER Command, DoD Red Team capabilities will be enhanced to reflect DIA assessments, and application of these teams will be synchronized across Cyber Command and DOT&E assessment priorities.  In partnership with the Joint Staff J8, focused interoperability assessments will be planned and executed in two events with emphasis on the systems and capabilities contained in the C2 Optimum Capability Mix Study.  Assessment support to units deploying to theaters of operation will continue as needed.  Fiscal year 2012 information assurance and interoperability evaluations will include trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across COCOMs.  Critical findings will be transmitted to Service and DoD leadership for their awareness and remediation actions, as appropriate.  The Joint Information Operations Range will support events across multiple COCOMS for added threat realism and required security during exercise assessments."

FY 2013 funds will provide Operational Test and Evaluation inputs for Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary Reports for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&E and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD(AT&L)).  Key elements of DOT&E oversight authority are identified in Calendar Year 2013 Office of the Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List.\n\nInformation Assurance and Interoperability Evaluations\n\nApproximately 25 information assurance and interoperability assessments will be planned and executed during FY 2013 COCOM and Service exercises.  Full assessment of warfighter responses to computer network attack (ability to protect, detect, react, and restore) will be captured in all information assurance events.  Portrayal of advanced-cyber threats will be included in all events, in accordance with the CJCS Red Team EXORD, and interoperability and mission accomplishment in representative threat environments will be examined.  In partnership with US CYBER Command, DoD Red Team capabilities will be enhanced to reflect DIA assessments, and application of these teams will be synchronized across Cyber Command and DOT&E assessment priorities.  In partnership with the Joint Staff J8, focused interoperability assessments will be planned and executed in four events with emphasis on the systems and capabilities contained in the C2 Optimum Capability Mix Study.  Assessment support to units deploying to theaters of operation will continue as needed.  Fiscal year 2013 information assurance and interoperability evaluations will include trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across COCOMs.  Critical findings will be transmitted to Service and DoD leadership for their awareness and remediation actions, as appropriate.  The Information Operations Range with Red Teams portraying advanced cyber adversaries will support the majority of COCOM exercises for added threat realism and required security.  \n\nAs a result of the Department's recognition of the importance of enhanced cyber assessment capabilities, additional resources and emphasis were added in fiscal year 2013.  These enhancements will include expanded threat assessments of the advanced cyber adversary, more representative portrayal of the cyber adversary by Red Teams, and improvements to the Joint Information Operations Range that will support more operationally realistic and threat representative assessment and training events."
