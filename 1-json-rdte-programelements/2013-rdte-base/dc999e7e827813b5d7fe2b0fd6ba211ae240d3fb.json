The MSSET will review Service Program of Record (PoRs) and MDA systems based upon operationally validated JIAMD requirements and Prioritized Capabilities List (PCL) needs. It will then recommend engineering changes (e.g., Interface Control Documents (ICDs), common standards, and\/or specifications) that can provide incremental improvements in Joint war fighting capability, as described in the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-validated Joint IAMD operational requirements, information exchange requirements, as well as other war fighter-approved requirements.  The MSSET scope will encompass the collaborative efforts to provide the war fighter the ability to effectively and efficiently utilize all available resources to counter the complete air, cruise missile, and ballistic missile threats. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.\n\nThe objective of the MSSET is to recommend incremental improvements in fielded capabilities within the construct of Service and MDA PoRs.  The following list includes several, priority Family of Systems (FOS) engineering tasks. These tasks go beyond the expected scope of engineering efforts conducted by an individual Service and MDA in their POR for IAMD:\n\n\u2022 Conduct the engineering activity to develop coordinated Joint IAMD Department of Defense (DoD) Architecture Framework (DODAF) products (e.g., System Views) while maintaining and deriving common standards.\n\u2022 Develop, recommend, and document as necessary overarching JIAMD technical\/performance requirements.\n\u2022 Perform Joint IAMD FOS engineering and related analyses, and develop recommendations for incrementally implementing Joint IAMD capabilities. \n\u2022 Develop Joint IAMD FOS engineering and Capability Validation Plans and strategies.\n\u2022 Recommend updates to the Joint Staff IAMD Operational Views as necessary.\n\u2022 Ensure that Joint engineering tasks are conducted in a logical sequence and in a timely manner to provide the Services and MDA the most benefit and adequate time to consider engineering recommendations derived by the MSSET.\n\u2022 JPEO act in the role of Secretariat for the AMD Integration Standing-Committee to Missile Defense Executive Board (MDEB).\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."

It will then recommend engineering changes (e.g., Interface Control Documents (ICDs), common standards, and\/or specifications) that can provide incremental improvements in Joint war fighting capability, as described in the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-validated Joint IAMD operational requirements, information exchange requirements, as well as other war fighter-approved requirements.  The MSSET scope will encompass the collaborative efforts to provide the war fighter the ability to effectively and efficiently utilize all available resources to counter the complete air, cruise missile, and ballistic missile threats. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.\n\nThe objective of the MSSET is to recommend incremental improvements in fielded capabilities within the construct of Service and MDA PoRs.  The following list includes several, priority Family of Systems (FOS) engineering tasks. These tasks go beyond the expected scope of engineering efforts conducted by an individual Service and MDA in their POR for IAMD:\n\n\u2022 Conduct the engineering activity to develop coordinated Joint IAMD Department of Defense (DoD) Architecture Framework (DODAF) products (e.g., System Views) while maintaining and deriving common standards.\n\u2022 Develop, recommend, and document as necessary overarching JIAMD technical\/performance requirements.\n\u2022 Perform Joint IAMD FOS engineering and related analyses, and develop recommendations for incrementally implementing Joint IAMD capabilities. \n\u2022 Develop Joint IAMD FOS engineering and Capability Validation Plans and strategies.\n\u2022 Recommend updates to the Joint Staff IAMD Operational Views as necessary.\n\u2022 Ensure that Joint engineering tasks are conducted in a logical sequence and in a timely manner to provide the Services and MDA the most benefit and adequate time to consider engineering recommendations derived by the MSSET.\n\u2022 JPEO act in the role of Secretariat for the AMD Integration Standing-Committee to Missile Defense Executive Board (MDEB).\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support, because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and\/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation."
