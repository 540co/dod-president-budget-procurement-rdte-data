            "val": "Biometric technology is revolutionizing critical military operations by providing the warfighter with the ability to verify an individual\u2019s claimed identity; and, when combined with additional intelligence and\/or forensic information, establish an unknown individual\u2019s identity, which strips away his anonymity.  These emerging technologies provide Department of Defense (DOD) warfighters and commanders with an important capability that supports such missions as base access, force protection, maritime intercept and counter-piracy operations, counterintelligence screening, humanitarian assistance, and displaced persons management.  Additionally, the biometrics and identity information collected during DOD missions are shared with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and the Department of Justice, to support homeland defense, law enforcement, and other national interests.  \n\nIn Oct 2006, the Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) as Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for biometrics, followed in April 2011 with the designation of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) as the PSA for forensics.  The PSAs for biometrics and forensics have the responsibility to fully address and exercise control over all facets of the Department\u2019s biometrics and forensics programs, initiatives, and technologies.  A central role of the Biometrics and Forensics Program is to support each respective PSA in addressing the technology gaps that preclude our ability to quickly and accurately identify anonymous individuals who threaten our interests and provide the ability to attribute enemy activity to a specific individual.  \n\nThe Biometrics and Forensics Program develops an annual comprehensive science and technology (S&T) plan and implements multiple projects to advance capabilities in both biometrics and forensics.  This S&T plan includes a portfolio of emerging technologies that will support the evolving capabilities required by the commanders and warfighters in ongoing and future military operations."

The payoff is to produce a system deployable at Forward Operating Bases (FOB) which will be supported by two wide-area surveillance cameras mounted on portable masts to look at an overview of the area, as well as four pan\/tilt\/zoom (PTZ) cameras mounted on rugged tripods at the corners of each FOB.  The wide-area and PTZ cameras work together to provide automated tracking and face recognition of observed targets at distances up to 40 meters.  In addition, two long range, manually controlled cameras are provided for extending facial recognition range to 100 meters. The outcome of this project is  a stand-off force protection capability and operational test data to inform future investments."

The Speckle Imaging for Fingerprint Technology (SIFT) enhances ridge details in fingerprints by optically sensing periodic variations in the surface slope in the neighborhood of ridges.  SIFT leverages a low-power, eye safe laser beam to scan the finger and detect the ridges.  The innovative use of a laser allows for contactless capture of the fingerprint as opposed to traditional fingerprint sensors, which must be in contact with the finger.  The outcome of this effort will provide a proof-of-concept for 10 meter stand-off fingerprint capture.  Non-contact fingerprint scanning technology will improve force protection at DoD installations by making the process of fingerprint collection and identification faster and easier for the end user while avoiding long lines."

Six projects were focused on biometrics and transitioned to the Army as the Executive Agent for Biometrics.  Two of the projects were focused on forensics and were transitioned to the Army as the Executive Agent for Forensics.  Additional development will be required for these prototypes prior to selection for production.  The Biometrics transition rate of 100% for FY 2011 exceeds the 30% benchmark established by DOD Strategic Objective 4-2D.\n\nIn addition, project performance metrics specific to each effort are identified in the project plan, and individual project success will be monitored through these metrics.  The metrics include items such as target dates from project work break down schedules, production measures, production goals, production numbers and demonstration goals and dates."
