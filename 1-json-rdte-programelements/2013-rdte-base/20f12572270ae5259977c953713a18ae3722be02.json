            "val": "This Program Element is budgeted in the applied research budget activity because it will focus on medical related technology, information, processes, materials, systems, and devices encompassing a broad spectrum of DoD challenges.  Biowarfare defense includes the capability to predict and deflect pathogen evolution of natural and engineered emerging threats and therapeutics that increase survivability within days of receipt of an unknown pathogen.  Continued understanding of infection biomarkers will lead to developing a detection device that can be self-administered and provide a faster ability to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater.  Other battlefield technologies includes a soldier-portable hemostatic wound treatment system, capability to manufacture field-relevant pharmaceuticals in theater, and a rapid after-action review of field events as a diagnostic tool for improving the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection.  Improved medical imaging will be approached through new physical properties of cellular metabolic activities.  New neural interface technologies will reliably extract information from the nervous system to enable control of the best robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  To allow medical practitioners the capability to visualize and comprehend the complex relationships across patient data in the electronic medical record systems, technologies will be developed to assimilate and analyze the large amount of data and provide tools to make better informed decisions for patient care.  In the area of medical training, new simulation-based tools will rapidly teach increased competency in an open and scalable architecture to be used by all levels of medical personnel for basic and advanced training.  Advanced information-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare and the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).   This project will also pursue the applied research efforts for dialysis-like therapeutics."

Uncontrolled blood loss is the leading cause of preventable death for soldiers on the battlefield.  While immediate control of hemorrhage is the most effective strategy for treating combat casualties and saving lives, currently no method other than surgical intervention can effectively treat intracavitary bleeding.  A focus in this thrust is the co-development of a materials-based agent(s) and delivery mechanism capable of damaged tissue-targeted hemostasis and wound control.  This system will effectively treat compressible and non-compressible wounds regardless of geometry or location.  Additionally, rapid response to emerging biological threats on the battlefield is impacted by logistical delays of delivering the necessary therapeutics.  Creating a \"pharmacy on demand\" will enable far-forward medical providers to manufacture and produce small molecule drugs and biologics in order to ensure that the therapeutics are available when they need them.  This project will also develop new algorithms, protocols, and methods to allow registration and comparison of disparate sources of data in biology (across species, experimental systems, hierarchies and populations)."

The goal of the Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program is to develop the technology and systems needed to reliably extract information from the nervous system at the scale and rate necessary to control state-of-the-art high-performance prosthetic limbs.  The program will increase the channel-count (amount information) of reliable peripheral-nervous-system interfaces and increase the operational lifetime (reliability) of central-nervous-system interfaces.  In support of these efforts, the RE-NET program is developing methods to quantitatively assess, model, predict, and accelerate the leading causes of neural interface degradation and failure.  Through this focus on reliability, the RE-NET program will enable clinically relevant technology transitions in support of wounded warriors."

PREVENT will use a variety of modeling techniques based on in-theater conditions to assess potential TBI caused by blast in the absence of penetrating injury or concussion.  Research will create a model that can be directly correlated to the epidemiology and etiology of injury seen in returning warfighters, and attempt to determine the physical and physiological underpinnings and causes of the injury.  The program will combine raw data collected from in-theater blast gauges with medical and event reports to conduct a complete analysis.  As part of the mitigation and treatment strategy, candidate therapeutics are being tested in order to alleviate inflammation from both acute and chronic injury.  This program continues efforts previously funded in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02."
