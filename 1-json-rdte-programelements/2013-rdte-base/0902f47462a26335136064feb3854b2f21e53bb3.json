This work provides the analytical basis for integration and prioritization of overall military capability requirements and acquisition programs in support of executing the Naval Capability Development Process and development\/delivery of Mission Capability Packages, Naval Capability Packages, and Integrated Strategic Capability Plans for Chief of Naval Operations.\nThis project supports detailed mission, capability, and technical analysis of future naval war fighting requirements. This work provides the analytical basis for integration and prioritization of overall military capability requirements and acquisition programs in support of executing the Naval Capability Development Process and development and delivery of Mission Capability Packages, Naval Capability Packages, and Integrated Strategic Capability Plans for the Chief of Naval Operations.\nConcept formulation for ships, boats and unmanned maritime vehicles must be continuously exercised to remain viable. It takes years to train competent practitioners, and knowledge currency is quickly lost without practice. Evolving threats and technologies drive concepts (and the tools, processes, and skills needed to produce them) towards obsolescence without constant attention. Capability Based Assessments (CBAs) and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) timelines are insufficient for establishing potential material solution cost versus capability relationships without significant concept formulation work beforehand. Active collaboration between OPNAV requirement sponsors, Program Offices, and the various System Command (NAVSEA, NAVAIR, and SPAWAR) engineers is critical for fully exploring the trade space by conducting analysis for affordability, effectiveness and risk.  \nThe majority of Total Ownership Cost (TOC) is locked into a design before it is even a program. In the later stages of a program it becomes much more costly to make changes that will significantly impact TOC. Investment up front in concept design can have a high payoff in TOC reduction over the life of a platform class.\nThis project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship and associated platform force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced platform concept studies and systems technology assessments will be conducted as will the development and upgrade of concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria.\nOutputs include concept costing and performance parameterization for comparative assessment against capability objectives and synthesis to quantify overall (Fleet) capabilities. These products (expressions of cost vs. capability) will serve as the basis of requirements and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) analysis, define the trade space for Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) efforts, and underpin discussion of force architecture\/structure during Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), Long Range Shipbuilding Strategy (LRSS) builds, and JROC reviews."

Proactively participated in capability sponsors' integrated processing teams. Presented opposing analytically based points of view to the CNO and Navy senior leadership. Provided analytically based decision recommendations to CNO for both warfighting and support areas. Developed CNO investment strategy recommendations and performed assessments for program review and Program Objective Memorandum (POM). Conducted Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) capabilities-based assessment (CBA) that provided a rapid and scalable process to utilize a concept of operation and developed investment strategy and a capability roadmap. Conducted tactical aircraft recapitalization alternatives and theater ballistic missile defense cost capability tradeoff assessments. Conducted independent assessment of anti-submarine warfare. Conducted weapons safety and sea basing capabilities assessments. Conducted intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance (ISR) and meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) assessment to determine the optimal mix of Naval ISR and METOC sensors, platforms, and processing, and analysis and fusion disposition to support major combat operations (MCOs), the OCO, and intelligence preparation of the environment for both MCOs and OCO.

Produce and deliver Analytical Agenda briefings and assessments.\n\nPortfolio Management Decision Support System (PMDSS) is an analytic Portfolio Management Methodology used to aid Navy leadership with both investment and divestment programming decisions. This methodology provides an assessment process that fosters informed, understandable, repeatable investment decisions with consistent, pedigreed, and retrievable information. The focus of this effort is to refine the system to identify programs as potential candidates for divestment. It provides leadership and resource sponsors with a starting point for their offset decision process as well as an issue ranking capability. PMDSS will include linkage of programs to N3\/N5 strategic imperatives, programs mapped to warfare areas, program interdependencies annotated, and balance factors that can be adjusted to reflect Navy Leadership Priorities. The effort expands on PMDSS by capturing and mapping issues\/funding adjustments, and providing a system capable of identifying fiscal interdependencies and consideration to risk in order to increase accuracy in calculating programmatic risk.\nCONFORM - Complete one technical study annually in support of emerging or planned capabilities."

This PE supports research of both Naval Postgraduate School faculty and students, and in FY10 began the formulation of focused economic research, to include behavioral economics.  This focus will provide continuing analysis and research to facilitate the data gathering and synthesis to provide consistent and timely update to economic indicators to use in the numerous models that support management decisions within the MPTE arena that have significant impact on the efficient use of the nearly $27B Manpower & Personnel, Navy budget.  The economic research will consolidate the data necessary to perform elasticity estimations and maintain this data for subsequent estimations.  To gather the data necessary to perform such estimations, would conservatively cost more than $300K on each such occasion.  The MPTE enterprise uses dozens of models, most of which require elasticity updates.  Consolidating the data repository to support this analysis will result in a cost avoidance of more than $1M and this does not include any of the actual model revisions."
