        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "As part of the total Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), the Test Program Element (PE) brings the BMDS element capabilities together for an integrated system-level test approach. Based on the Systems Engineering assessments of realistic threat scenarios, test events demonstrate capability of the evolving integrated layered missile defense system in a simultaneous test and operations environment. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) employs a systematic review of BMDS testing that establishes a convention for setting test objectives that go beyond simply exercising newly delivered elements of the system. The BMDS Test Program establishes and documents in the Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP) the test requirements for the BMDS with specific focus on collecting the data needed for the verification, validation and accreditation (VV&A) of the BMDS models and simulations (M&S). The BMDS performance evaluation strategy is to develop M&S of the BMDS and compare predictions to empirical data collected through comprehensive flight and ground testing to validate accuracy. Critical Engagement Conditions (CECs) and Empirical Measurement Events (EMEs) are the conditions and events which define or describe the data to be obtained from flight and ground tests in order to anchor M&S. CECs and EMEs are utilized to design a test to further advance the understanding and confidence of the M&S tool set that will be used to evaluate all possible engagements. MDA testing is based on an integrated developmental and operational test program. The MDA Test Program is based on a commitment to deploy technology that is proven, cost-effective, and adaptable to an evolving security environment. MDA, in full collaboration with its IMTP stakeholders: Combatant Commands; Service Operational Test Agencies (OTAs); Director, Operational Test & Evaluation; and Director, Developmental Test and Evaluation, develops and approves the IMTP which aligns the BMDS Test Program to the PAA phases for proven capability delivery. This PE provides consolidated MDA-wide capabilities and resources for the planning, design, execution, provision of infrastructure, and management of BMDS testing. This PE also provides funding to the Operational Test Agencies (OTA), which are active in all phases of test planning, execution and post-test analysis, to include the development of the IMTP. Also including in this PE is funding to the Targets and Countermeasures (TC) program office for the development and procurements of ballistic missile targets and countermeasures for the BMDS in support of the MDA flight test program. Targets are representative of feasible future threats and flight test requirements are derived from the CECs and EMEs and are documented in the Agency`s IMTP. \n\nThe Test and Targets PE is grouped into two major areas: Test and Evaluation; Targets and Countermeasures. This PE also includes the test related program content: Concurrent, Test, Training, and Operations (CTTO); Engineering Test Analysis; Facilities, Siting, and Environmental Management; and Fielding and Integration. \n\nBMDS Test Program Functions: \n-Directs the testing required to verify, validate, and accredit (VV&A) MDA`s models and simulation (M&S).\n-Plans tests according to BMDS and Element objectives.\n-Develops MDA test policy. \n-Executes BMDS ground and flight tests. \n-Ensures appropriate data is collected at the necessary fidelity. \n-Collects data for BMDS analysis and manages MDA data centers. \n-Provides BMDS and Element performance results for IMTP stakeholders. \n-Provides final target system integration, target mission logistics and launch execution for BMDS test target systems.\n-Provides test resources to support flight and ground tests. \n\nMajor Test Program Goals: \n-Direct planning, execution, analyses, and reporting of BMD system test events to support system verification.\n-Improve test execution and discipline for on-time, successful testing. \n-Integrate Element test processes into BMDS processes. \n-Develop Element Lessons Learned and Best Practices to support BMDS test design. \n-Provide required infrastructure and environmental compliance for robust BMDS testing. \n-Ensure test readiness, realism, and accuracy and improve test execution quality. \n\n\nTargets and Countermeasures element level testing is funded as part of a developmental program and reflected in this Program Element (PE) submission. This PE also provides Targets and Countermeasures participation in the consolidated MDA-wide System Test Program and the resources for the planning, design, execution, and management of Targets and Countermeasures in BMD System testing in accordance with the BMDS Test Policy. This applies to all Flight, Integrated, Ground, and Distributed Ground Tests and Post-Test Analysis and reconstructions listed in the IMTP. \n\n\nBMDS Targets and Countermeasures Functions: \nThe Targets and Countermeasures (TC) program office is responsible for executing the development and procurement of targets to support testing of the BMDS. The multiple targets (3 types) provided by TC are across four target classes: Short Range Ballistic Missiles (SRBM), Medium Range Ballistic Missiles (MRBM), Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBM), and Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM). It provides targets representative of feasible future threats for use in BMDS testing to verify models and simulations, as well as to verify BMDS performance across a broad range of operational conditions. TC has realized past and future savings by centralized competition and management of targets and countermeasures using efficient procurement and lot buys resulting in economies of scale and cost savings. \n\n\nTargets and Countermeasures Contribution to the BMDS: \n-Type-1 Targets are simple, baseline configurations\n-Type-2 Targets have increased capability or complexity\n-Type-3 Targets have a unique configuration and are procured in low unit quantities \n-Provides the BMDS risk reduction through measurements of flight testing to include technology demonstration algorithms, model validation, and threat and countermeasures characterization.\n-Collects and provides test data in order to support effectiveness, suitability, and interoperability assessments. \n\nMajor Targets and Countermeasures Goals: \n-Provide cost effective, reliable targets representative of feasible future threats; target performance planning; and BMDS modeling and simulation to the MDA test and engineering community. \n\nMD40 Program-Wide Support (PWS) consists of essential non-headquarters management costs in support of the MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS)."

With the evolution of the BMDS, testing needs have expanded beyond those of the individual Elements to include testing of BMDS Critical Engagement Conditions (CEC) and Empirical Measurement Events (EME) to anchor models and simulations. \n\nThe Directorate for Test (DT) is responsible for all BMDS testing which relies on BMDS Systems Engineering to provide the system test objectives to define the test architecture. DT plans and executes BMD system test events and develops the necessary test policy, test plans, and test infrastructure to conduct an effective test program. \n\nTest activities are grouped into four major areas: 1) Support to Operations, which provides for the Test Functional Management Office, flight and ground testing support, target launch operations, and Operational Test Agency assessments; 2) Infrastructure Support to Flight Test and Ground Test Programs, which sustains, and modernizes the core infrastructure assets required to support the BMDS System and Element-level flight and ground testing; 3) Flight Test and Ground Test Infrastructure Development, which provides for Integrated Master Test Plan infrastructure development, auxiliary sensors development, and component ground test lab development; and 4) Common Test Support, which provides for test planning and design, test data management, ground test lab support, test readiness and training, and the Pacific Range Support Team (PRST). \n\nThe goals of this budgetary project are to support and improve a robust testing program and to enhance modeling and simulation efforts to provide, in conjunction with flight and ground testing, confidence to the Combatant Commanders that the missile defense system works. \n\nThe MDA test program, along with the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Operational Test Agencies (OTA), conducts a rigorous review of BMDS models and simulations (M&S) to determine the data needed to verify, validate, and accredit the M&S efforts. Working with the Services, OTA, and with the support of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E), the test program was restructured to improve confidence in the missile defense capabilities under development and ensure the capabilities transferred to the Warfighter are operationally effective, suitable, and survivable. \n\nTest Engineering supports the analysis process by providing event leadership, tools, and processes to conduct pre- and post-mission system level analysis for all BMDS flight and ground test events. Analysis is performed and reported using the Joint Analysis Team (JAT) process. Pre-mission analysis provides essential risk reduction analysis used to optimize conditions for successful accomplishment of the primary mission objectives. Post-mission analysis is performed to assess the primary and secondary test objectives and to identify mission-specific performance enhancements or failures that were observed. The BMDS performance assessment strategy is to develop M&S and compare their predictions to empirical data collected. The data collected through flight and ground testing is used to validate M&S accuracy, rather than physically testing all possible combinations of BMDS configurations, engagement conditions, and target phenomena."

Based on the Systems Engineering assessments of realistic threat scenarios, the targets and countermeasures program designs, develops, builds, and supports the launch of Short Range Ballistic Missile (SRBM) targets, Medium Range Ballistic Missile (MRBM) targets, Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) targets, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) targets, and the associated common payloads and components to test, verify, and validate the performance of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). This project provides funding to the Targets and Countermeasures program office for the development and procurement of ballistic targets and countermeasures for the BMDS in support of the MDA flight test program. Target requirements are derived from the Critical Engagement Conditions (CECs) and Empirical Measurement Events (EMEs) and are documented in the Agency`s Integrated Master Test Plan. Targets and countermeasures are developed and built at multiple locations including: Courtland, AL; Orlando, FL; Chandler, AZ; and Albuquerque, NM. Storage and maintenance facilities are also located throughout the country including: Huntsville, AL; White Sands, NM; Ogden, UT; Camp Navajo, AZ; Hawthorne, NV; and Kodiak, AK. \n\nFunding for the TC program supports the continuation of activities which include the requirements definition and design of BMDS targets, associated payloads, and flight missions. It also supports the maintenance, aging surveillance, refurbishment, and routine testing of existing government furnished equipment boosters and target components, as well as the purchase of long lead material assets and asset management items for short, medium, intermediate, and long-range target components. \n\nTC is responsible for executing the development and procurement of targets to support testing of the BMDS and its components. The multiple targets (3 types) provided by TC are across four target classes: Short Range Ballistic Missiles (SRBM), Medium Range Ballistic Missiles (MRBM), Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBM), and Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM). It provides targets representative of feasible future threats for use in BMDS testing to verify models and simulations, as well as to verify BMDS performance across a broad range of operational conditions. \n\nTarget Types:\nType-1 Targets are simple, baseline configurations\nType-2 Targets have increased capability or complexity \nType-3 Targets have a unique configuration and are procured in low unit quantities \n\n\nThe TC program consists of three major areas: Program Operations, Target Support, and Target Hardware."

These are Systems Engineering\/Program Management, Logistics, and Support Equipment. \n\nSystem engineering\/program management effort includes activities by Targets and Countermeasures (TC) prime contractors as well as non-prime systems engineering efforts. This effort provides target program technical direction to meet program requirements while balancing cost, schedule, performance, and risk. It conducts functional requirements allocation to product lines, defines product line specifications\/interfaces, and follows guidelines for design reviews. It performs target system analysis to verify system performance, defines target program baselines, controls flight test configurations, and conducts pre and post-flight analysis. It identifies treaty and environmental issues and develops plans for issue resolution. Efforts not on the prime contracts in support of the TC program include Single Stimulation Framework (SSF)\/Objective Stimulation Framework (OSF) compatible Modeling and Simulation (M&S) execution and improvements to evolve TC M&S capability; trajectory analyses; signature analyses and characterization; studies to assess alternative target and platform solutions; assessments of risk and mission assurance; and design approval of government furnished equipment. \n\nTC Logistics efforts provide the Missile Defense Agency with target storage, aging surveillance, and transportation of TC hardware in support of BMDS testing. These efforts are essential in providing a dependable and reliable target system that enables MDA to build more operational realistic targets to emulate known threats or potential threats. This effort includes integrated logistics support for all TC material including facilities, inventory maintenance, spare parts, aging surveillance, disposal, and special testing for government furnished equipment target rocket motor propellants and other hazardous material handling. This task provides all required facilities and monitoring for explosive storage and Foreign Materiel Acquisition (FMA). Finally, this task manages and oversees accountability of all government furnished equipment and contractor acquired property. \n\n\nSupport equipment effort provides for the development and build of common support equipment for launch vehicles, re-entry vehicles, associated objects, and all up integrated target rounds. It also supports launch site activations through the transportation of support equipment to various test sites. \n\n\nFY 2011 Accomplishments:\nSystem Engineering and Program Management: Performed program management and systems engineering functions including: specialty and production engineering; acquisition, production, logistics management; modeling and simulation; and tests. \n\n\t-Continued Program Management and Business Operations for target components to provide a framework for overall management of the Targets program \n\t-Continued Information Technology support for Other Government Agencies (OGAs) so that subject matter experts could be used to support Target requirements \n\t-Continued Special Studies and associated analyses of future target Launch Vehicles, Re-Entry Vehicles, and launch platforms to ensure targets representative of future feasible threats technology is being incorporated into the Targets program \n\t-Continued Quality\/Mission Assurance to include Pedigree Reviews to ensure high probability of mission success \n\t-Continued information technology and classified network support to ensure sensitive target information is not compromised \n\t-Continued Software Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) for targets, including the Extended Medium Range Ballistic Missile (eMRBM) and Launch Vehicle-2 (LV-2), and Medium Range Ballistic Missile Type 3 (MRBM T3) to provide risk reduction of flight missions \n\t-Continued Missile Defense Agency Engineering Directorate targets and countermeasures requirements support to ensure targets accurately represent the threat \n\nLogistics and Sustainment: Provided maintenance, transportation, utilities, storage, license fees, aging surveillance, disposal and material handling for targets, target components, re-entry rebuilds, associated objects, and support equipment. Targets and Countermeasures (TC) utilized storage to acquire and preserve existing booster motors; and other target hardware from DoD inventory to build future targets with existing, flight qualified components, which helped reduce future development and manufacturing costs to include: \n\n\t-C4 Motors - Storage, disposal, transportation, aging surveillance, and static fire support \n\t-Castor IVB - Storage support \n\t-Lance - Missile sustainment, telemetry van sustainment and facilities sustainment support \n\t-M-57 - Storage, disposal, transportation, and aging surveillance support \n\t-Orbus 1A - Missile sustainment support \n\t-SR-19 - Storage, disposal, transportation, aging surveillance, and static fire support \n\t-Multi-Class Inventory storage, aging surveillance, and transportation support \n\t-Multi-Class Other - Vehicle support, ordnance inventory reduction planning, small ordnance, x-ray, refurbishment, transportation, and modification support \n\t-Single Integration Capability Facility -Storage, target integration and logistics support"

                            "val": "The Missile Defense Agency`s (MDA) Targets and Countermeasures Program Office (TC) provides for the development and procurement of ballistic missile targets and countermeasures for the Ballistic Missile Defense System in support of the MDA`s flight test program. Target requirements are derived from the Agency`s Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP). \n\nBased on the Acquisition Plan for TC`s Prime Contract (9 July 2003), MDA competed and awarded a prime contract to Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC) on 9 December, 2003 for the development of the Flexible Target Family (FTF). Targets in the short, medium, and intermediate range as well as reentry vehicles are procured using this contract. \n\nBased on the TC`s Medium Range Targets Acquisition Plan (6 June 2008), TC awarded a sole source firm fixed price contract to the Orbital Sciences Corporation ground launched MRT\/RV targets in June 2008. This award was based upon the requirement for target consistency resulting in a unique target\/RV configuration to support testing of the Aegis Weapon System. A total of three targets have been procured on this contract with one asset remaining in inventory. \n\nBased on TC`s Acquisition Plan (3 November 2009), TC competitively awarded a prime contract to Orbital Sciences Corporation on 7 March 2011 for the design and development (cost plus) and delivery (fixed-price incentive fee) of eight air-launched Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) targets. This award includes two follow-on options; one for eight IRBM targets and one for one to six IRBM targets. \n\nThe Sounding Rocket Program 3 (SRP-3) contract is managed by the US Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, Space Development and Test Directorate at Kirtland AFB, NM to provide air launched target systems. The SRP-3 contract has 4 prequalified vendors (Orbital Sciences Corporation, Alliant Tech Systems, L-3 Communications - Coleman Aerospace (Coleman), and Space Vector Corp) that are able to compete for new task orders to develop targets on this contract. To date, Coleman is the only vendor that has been awarded task orders on this contract. \n\nThe Solid Rocket Motor Technical Services Contract was awarded to Alliant Tech Systems in May 2005 and provides aging and surveillance, refurbishment, transportation, testing, and sensitivity studies for MDA TC solid rocket motors to include A3, C4, Orbus 1\/1A, GEM, and Castor IV variants. A follow-on, sole source contract was awarded 30 September 2011. \n\nThe Aegis Readiness Assessment Vehicle (ARAV) target effort is managed by TC and the Naval Surface Warfare Center Port Hueneme Division White Sands (NSWC PHD WS). NSWC PHD WS has unique sounding rocket expertise and access to existing contracts managed by White Sands Missile Range that makes this a beneficial relationship for both parties. TC provides targets funding via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Orders that NSWC PHD WS expends on its hardware development and engineering contracts. In addition, TC provides funding to Sandia National Labs in support of the Attitude Control Module (ACM) development effort for the ARAV Group C target. NSWC PHD WS manages the integration of the ACM onto the launch vehicle. The MDA Test Directorate (DT) is responsible for funding all launch services of these targets in support of the IMTP. \n\nTargets and Countermeasures (TC) is currently in various stages of planning or execution for procurement of ballistic missile targets by range class: Short Range (SRBM), Medium Range (MRBM), Intermediate Range (IRBM), and Intercontinental Range (ICBM). These targets will be procured using a Target Performance Specification to support flight test requirements as identified in the Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP). Each target class will be solicited, evaluated, and awarded independently in IMTP ``need date`` priority order. \n\nWithin each target class, capabilities are further segregated and designated as a class type. Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 capabilities are defined as follows: \n\nType 1: A Type 1 target is the baseline (simple) configuration for the class. A Type 1 target satisfies the minimum target requirements to provide the baseline capability for each target class. The baseline configuration represents the complete vehicle stack-up and includes: 1-n boosters, attitude control system, test object, flight termination system, housekeeping and environmental instrumentation, and telemetry. For example, the basic configuration of an LV-2 target is representative of a Type 1 configuration in the intermediate range class. \n\nType 2: A Type 2 target requires more advanced or complex performance capabilities. Type 2 capabilities may be included in the baseline Type 1 configuration or provided as configuration kits that can be added to the baseline configuration. Type 2 kits may include the following: countermeasures and associated deployment capability, enhanced targeting and aimpoint accuracies, selectable booster and test object dynamics, tailored separation debris, temperature sensors, hit location and miss distance instrumentation, onboard sensors, deployable fly along sensors, and\/or lethality payloads. For example, the LV-2 target with countermeasures or additional payloads is representative of a Type 2 configuration in the intermediate range class. \n\nType 3: A Type 3 target is a unique configuration procured in low unit quantities. Type 3 targets encompass unique threat characteristics or test conditions (i.e. Ground Based Midcourse Defense high velocity engagement scenario) not achievable with a Type 1 or Type 2 configuration. For example, a mobile launched ICBM Type 1 or Type 2 target is representative of a Type 3 configuration in the intercontinental range class. \n\nTC is in the process of transitioning from a `just-in-time` approach to delivering unique targets to meet specific flight test requirements to more of a production based strategy geared towards building an inventory of product lines able to meet multiple test requirements. Work under existing contracts\/orders will run to completion rather than being transitioned to a new contractor(s). \n\nFuture targets may be procured under the new acquisition competitive Request for Proposals unless the new acquisitions would result in higher cost, delivery delays, or less capable targets. TC will procure pre and post mission planning, data products, support to modeling and simulation and ground test, inventory sustainment and management, and flight test execution."

In addition, includes Global Deployment personnel and support performing deployment site preparation and activation. Other costs included provide facility capabilities for MDA Executing Agent locations (with the exception of Federal Office Building 2 after FY 2011), such as physical and technical security, legal services, travel and agency training, office and equipment leases, rents and utilities, data and unified communications support, supplies and maintenance, logistics and central property management of equipment, and similar operating expenses. Also includes legal settlements, and foreign currency fluctuations on a limited number of foreign contracts. \nIn keeping with congressional intent, PWS is allocated on a pro-rata basis and therefore, fluctuates by year based on the total MDA budget."
