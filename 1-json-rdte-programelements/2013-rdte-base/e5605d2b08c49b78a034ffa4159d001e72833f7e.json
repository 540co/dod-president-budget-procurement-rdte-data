        "ProgramElementMissionDescription": {
            "val": "Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) \n\nWith the successful launch of two (STSS) demonstration satellites in 2009, the agency has on-orbit capability to validate remote sensor and fire control integration to inform the design and operation of the Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS), to characterize contribution of space data into the BMDS architecture, and to provide sensor measurements and background data supporting trade studies and analyses for PTSS and Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) IIB development. Lessons learned from the two STSS demonstration satellites are guiding decisions on the development of a fiscally sustainable, continuously available, operational PTSS constellation and ground communications\/processing system. \n\nBeginning FY 2013, funding in this element is provided for STSS on-orbit operations which includes contractor operation of the STSS Demonstration Satellites and software maintenance, Government costs, BMDS Level Testing, Data Collection and Analysis activities, and the NFIRE satellites tests and experiments. Funding availability for NFIRE will be determined as the health and utility of the satellite is assessed for FY 2013. \n\nSTSS is providing risk reduction for PTSS models, algorithms, sensors and spacecraft development by providing background and clutter scene characterization, complex target signatures, interface definition, communications architectures, and performance across acquisition, tracking, and discrimination. STSS is also providing definition to BMDS Concept of Operations, timelines and performance requirements for sensor cuing and weapons engagement such as Aegis Launch On\/Engage On from remote space sensors. \n\nSTSS will emphasize continued research and development to address the more sophisticated threats we expect to encounter in the far term. The greatest protection against missile defense threats of all ranges remains a highly available early missile tracking capability from space. Space sensors provide the most cost effective and operationally suitable means of providing global persistent surveillance and engagement, directly addressing the number one missile defense priority need for Combatant Commanders. STSS is a capability development activity for the demonstration of technologies to support development and future capability delivery of the BMDS space layer, PTSS. For example, during Aegis Intercept Flight Test (FTM-15), STSS demonstrated the capability to receive an external cue and transmit that cue to the out-of-view STSS satellite, resulting in stereo midcourse tracking. This provided significant risk reduction for PTSS by closely emulating a communication, cuing, and track reporting chain for an operational engagement. In addition, the STSS Demonstration Satellites have demonstrated the ability of a space sensor to provide high precision, real time tracking of missiles and midcourse objects, thus enabling simultaneous regional, theater, and strategic missile defense systems to be cued to track well beyond their organic detection capability. Data from on-going Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) testing has validated the ability to track cold, midcourse objects from space and close the fire control loop with BMDS interceptors. During several MDA Flight Tests, STSS has provided data in real-time that has met the Aegis Missile Defense Systems Quality of Service (QoS) data requirements for Remote Engagement Authorized (REA). In FY 2013, STSS will provide real-time data to Aegis during a live fire test that will culminate in an actual Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) launching against the target using STSS data to initiate the engagement. Finally, STSS provides a new infrared sensor phenomenology for the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) that will demonstrate the benefit of the Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS) when combined with radars that will provide robustness against current and advanced countermeasures. \n\nMDA has developed, and is testing, two STSS Demonstration Satellites to demonstrate key functions of space sensors in support of PTSS risk reduction. STSS Element Level testing is funded as part of a capabilities development program and reflected in the Program Element submission. Element testing is based on an integrated, comprehensive, and phased test program. Element systems, subsystems, and components were tested early in development and this testing was necessary prior to conducting BMD level testing. Key data from the STSS Demonstration Satellites efforts continue to provide lessons learned as MDA pursues longer term space sensor needs with PTSS. \n- Space sensors extend BMDS sensor coverage to a global level. The STSS has demonstrated the capability of satellites to track ballistic missiles and the ability to provide accurate tracking information to the BMDS battle manager to close the fire control loop with BMDS interceptors, thus extending the effective range of BMDS interceptors and other sensors. \n- Space-based sensors are not limited by basing rights issues or deployment decisions, and will allow cost effective coverage of countries and large areas not accessible from ground based sensors. \n- Space based visible and Infrared (IR) sensors will complement radars and contribute to a sensor architecture more robust to countermeasures \n- Space-based sensors will enable near continuous threat observation and tracking from launch to intercept, covering threats by augmenting the coverage of the BMDS radars, and providing state vectors to Command and Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) to enable interceptor fire control via multiple BMDS assets (Aegis, Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)) \n\nGoals for STSS \n- Risk reduction for PTSS \n- Risk reduction for SM-3 IIB interceptor sensor trades \n- Demonstrate C2BMC interfaces, sensor registration, communication chains and latencies to support PTSS concept of operation development \n\nNear Field Infrared Experiment (NFIRE) \nThe NFIRE technology project was designed to collect near field phenomenology data for use in plume to hard body handover algorithms for boost phase interceptor programs. MDA used this data to validate the models and simulations that are fundamental to developing the guidance and endgame homing algorithms. NFIRE is now focused on PTSS and SM-3 IIB development support by collecting background, clutter, and target signatures for modeling and algorithm development and validation. A secondary objective of the experiment has been to collect hyper-temporal short wave infrared and visible data for assessing early launch detection and tracking capability. The experiment includes three plume signature mission types: targets of opportunity, dedicated fly-bys, and ground observations. The dedicated fly-by experiments have been accomplished. The NFIRE satellite also carries a Laser Communication Terminal, which has been and continues to be used to conduct communication experiments with the German Terra SAR-X satellite. These experiments test low earth orbit satellite-to-ground and satellite-to-satellite capabilities of the terminal for potential incorporation into the BMDS. Data products are utilized by multiple programs to improve missile engagement performance. \n\nGoals for Near Field Infrared Experiment (NFIRE) \n- Conduct multiple data collection missions from the Missile Defense Space Development Center (MDSDC) against ground, air, space and ballistic missile targets of opportunity \n- Conduct low earth orbit satellite-to-satellite and satellite-to-ground laser communication experiments \n- Provide data to validate models and simulations that are fundamental to developing the navigation, guidance and control, and endgame homing algorithms, as well as laser communication proof of concept \n\nMD40 consists of Program-Wide Support (PWS) non-headquarters management costs in support of MDA functions and activities across the entire Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS)."

                            "val": "Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) \nThe STSS Demonstration Satellites provide two on-orbit satellite assets with visible and infrared sensors in low earth orbit for testing with other Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS) elements. These two satellites provide valuable risk reduction for acquisition, tracking, and discrimination functionality to include stereo data fusion, cueing radars over the horizon and over-the-horizon fire control. The program is demonstrating the functions and interfaces required for space data delivery to the BMDS, validating the data quality necessary for interceptors to launch and\/or engage on STSS sensor data. The two Demonstration Satellites are operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week from the ground station processing center at the MDSDC with a government and contractor team. On-orbit, STSS Demonstration Satellites continue data collection and analyses in FY 2012 and beyond striving to view all available Targets of Opportunity (TOOs) to include participation with other BMDS target and flight tests that provide demonstration of the MDA Space Layer capabilities and allow collection of future system risk reduction information. \n\nThe satellites are demonstrating key functions of missile tracking with space sensors in support of Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS) risk reduction. On-orbit sensor operations are collecting invaluable background, scene and target signatures to support PTSS and Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) IIB sensor development trade studies. STSS activities support PTSS development by integration of space-based missile tracking (midcourse phases); sensor and weapons cueing (such as Aegis and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)) via Command and Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC); features and discrimination; and hit\/impact point assessments into C2BMC. STSS risk reduction for PTSS will enable early capability assessment of the Warfighter`s need for a highly available early missile tracking capability from space providing an operationally suitable means of global persistent surveillance and engagement. Capabilities being assessed for PTSS include detecting and acquiring ballistic missiles; tracking ballistic missiles and their deployed objects; emerging threat detection and tracking; performing autonomous acquisition-to-track handover within a satellite; performing tracking handover to a satellite from a ground cue; performing uplink and downlink of mission, health, and status data both directly and via crosslink between two satellites; reporting ballistic missile and intercept event to close the fire-control loop; filtering reports to C2BMC; providing near real-time object data to external users; and providing a System Performance Evaluation Tool model. As such, the demonstration of these activities will support future PTSS capability development and will enable meeting a Warfighter`s requirements to include tracking missile threats and objects of interest; provide post-launch sensor cueing; integrate, fuse and correlate sensor data; engage\/re-engage ballistic missile threats; and provide system modeling tools. \n\nMDA Element testing is based on an integrated, comprehensive, and phased test program. Element systems, subsystems, and components are tested early in development and are necessary prior to conducting Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) level testing. The Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) Element Level testing is funded as part of a capabilities development program and reflected in this Program Element (PE) submission. The STSS Demonstration Satellites demonstrate key functions of space sensors. MDA will continue planning for and conducting integrated BMDS intercept tests based on track data passed from the STSS Demonstration Satellites through Command and Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) to Aegis, Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), or other interceptors. \n\nNear Field Infrared Experiment (NFIRE) \nThe NFIRE satellite is operated from the Missile Defense Space Development Center (MDSDC) and continues to collect environmental background characterization (regional\/seasonal atmospheric radiance variability, day-night, land-sea clutter, clouds, auroral measurements, etc) for the Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS) sensor and Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) IIB seeker development programs, hyper-temporal short wave infrared data to support research and development of early launch detection and tracking capabilities, and earth limb radiance measurements to support improvement of environmental models. The NFIRE satellite also carries a Laser Communication Terminal to conduct communication experiments with the German Terra SAR-X satellite. These communications experiments test low earth orbit satellite-to-ground and satellite-to-satellite laser communications capabilities for potential incorporation into the BMS. The laser communication experiments will be conducted on a non-interference basis with other MDA missions. MDA will continue to assess the health\/utility of the NFIRE satellite on an annual basis to determine whether to continue NFIRE operations and testing. \n\nLessons learned and data gathered from the STSS program and the NFIRE program will continue to provide valuable information for PTSS modeling and simulation activities in assessing the capability of a low earth orbit constellation to complement sensor coverage and missile detection and tracking capabilities provided by Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) sensors."

The contract for the STSS Demonstration Satellites effort was awarded in third quarter FY 2002. This contract implements MDA`s capability-based acquisition strategy by using existing satellite hardware as a low risk opportunity, building upon the lessons learned from previous development efforts, and establishing a series of planned enhancements to bring added capability to the BMDS. \n\nThe acquisition strategy shifted from the launch phase to the operations and testing of the STSS Demonstration satellites. Options for Operations and Testing were definitized April 2011."

These products optimize performance at the system level and further ensure that the assessment of the designed BMD System is based on sufficient ground and flight testing. Compliance of the Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) to BMD System level requirements is monitored in a series of requirements and design reviews both at the system and element levels. Systems Engineering support is provided by Aerospace directly to the Demonstration Satellites effort. STSS Support to Missile Defense Space Development Center (MDSDC) funds support cost associated with the satellite operations conducted at the MDSDC. This support is obtained through the Joint National Integration Center (JNIC) Research and Development Contract (JRDC). NFIRE funding will be forwarded to several contractors and government organizations to include, but not limited to Orbital Sciences Corporation (formerly General Dynamics) and the Air Force Research Laboratory. Funding covers support for operations, testing, and analysis activities. The Target Value of Contract above for the NFIRE Prime Contract reflects continuing pending negotiation to extend operations, testing, and support for the NFIRE satellite based on health and utility assessment of the satellite."

In FY 2013, testing begins to transition from dedicated, first-time efforts to missions collecting data to verify earlier results and further strengthen BMDS-related modeling and simulation as well as supporting development of future systems design and concept of operations. Funding for the STSS Demo Analysis Center maximizes return on investment to further the development of the future BMDS space layer. Costs covered include the purchase and maintenance of software tools for mission planning and simulation, data management and Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) data analysis as well as test engineering and analysis support for BMDS testing and collection of scientific data for refinement of BMDS-relevant models. BMDS Integration-Test Engineering and Resources funding covers: test engineering to conduct pre-mission planning, execution, and post-mission analyses for testing events associated with STSS participation in BMDS flight tests. Funding for Systems Engineering is allocated to Aerospace to provide independent test engineering to: assist in requirements definition; mission planning and tasking capability for BMDS missile flight tests and targets of opportunity; analyze mission results and prepare detailed reports; analyze data for use in anchoring and validating the modeling and simulation tool System Performance Evaluation Tool (SPET) and other MDA models; aid in issue resolution; support interface with design engineers to understand and develop operating and test procedures; and support interface with other government agencies. Element Integration and Testing: Funding for Ground Support for Acquisition Line-of-Sight (LOS) Calibration goes to the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to provide laser ground source to perform line-of-sight calibration of acquisition sensors on board the two STSS Demonstration Satellites. The STSS Capability Based R&D-Test Support funding covers costs associated with the STSS Prime Contractor providing satellite functionality testing and calibration support. As the level of specific, dedicated test support transitions into data collection testing to further support and refine BMDS-related modeling and simulation, the satellite functionality testing and calibration will be included as part of the satellite operations captured above in the Capability Based R&D effort performed by the STSS Prime Contractor under Product Development."

In addition, includes Global Deployment personnel and support performing deployment site preparation and activation. Other costs included provide facility capabilities for MDA Executing Agent locations (with the exception of Federal Office Building 2 after FY 2011), such as physical and technical security, legal services, travel and agency training, office and equipment leases, rents and utilities, data and unified communications support, supplies and maintenance, logistics and central property management of equipment, and similar operating expenses.
