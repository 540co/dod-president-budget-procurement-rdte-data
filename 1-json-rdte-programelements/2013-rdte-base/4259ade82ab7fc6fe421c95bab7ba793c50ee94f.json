            "val": "Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) ensures the protection of Navy and joint cyberspace systems from exploitation and attack. Cyberspace systems include wired and wireless telecommunications systems, Information Technology (IT) systems, and the content processed, stored, or transmitted therein. ISSP includes protection of the Navy's National Security Systems and Information (NSSI). \n\nISSP is the Navy's implementation of statutory and regulatory requirements specified in Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA, 44 U.S.C. section 3541),  the Computer Security Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-235), Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. section 552a, Public Law No. 93-579), National Security Act of 1947 (Public Law 235),  Comprehensive National Cyber security Initiative (CNCI) National Security Presidential Directive 54\/Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23 (NSPD-54\/ HSPD-23), National Security Directive 42, Presidential Decision Directive 63, Executive Order 13526, Appendix III of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130 Revised, Committee for National Security Systems (CNSS) Policy 22, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Instructions 6510.01F and 6510.02D, and Department of Defense (DoD) Directives 8500.01E, O-8530.01, and 8570.01. \n\nISSP activities address the risk management of cyberspace defined in \"The National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations\", Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dec 2006, and of defensive Information Operations (IO) defined in Joint Publication 3-13; including the capabilities to protect, detect, restore, and respond. ISSP supports the entire Naval cyberspace domain from the mobile forward-deployed subscriber, through the ashore supporting critical information infrastructure, and the interconnection with other cyberspace domains. The interconnectivity of naval and joint networks, connections to allied and coalition partners, connections to the public information infrastructure, and their use in naval and joint war fighting means that Navy cyberspace is a higher value and  more vulnerable target. Navy cyber systems face advanced attacks involving malicious changes to critical  information, changes to the functionality of critical systems, denial of service (including jamming), and the destruction of systems and networks. Since many Naval cyber systems are  based on commercially available technologies, an adversary often has access to the technologies they want to exploit. \n\nRapid changes in the underlying commercial and government cyber infrastructures makes cyber security an increasingly complex and dynamic problem. ISSP provides the Navy's war fighter the essential information trust characteristics of availability, confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. Information Assurance (IA), a key supporting cyber security activity, must evolve quickly to meet the rapidly evolving threats and vulnerabilities. Implementing ISSP requires rapid acquisition approaches to stay ahead of nation-states, terrorists, and criminal organization adversaries, among others. \n\nThe ISSP program provides the Navy with the following cyber security elements: (1) defense of NSSI; (2) assured separation of information levels and user communities, including allied, coalition, non-Governmental, Defense Industrial Base, and other public partners; (3) technologies supporting the Navy's Computer Network Defense Service Providers (CNDSP) operations; (4) assurance use of the Navy's telecommunications infrastructure and the wireless spectrum; (5) assurance of joint user cyberspace domains, using a defense-in-depth architecture; (6) assurance of the critical computing base and information store; and, (7) supporting assurance technologies, including a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The ISSP program must be rapid, predictive, adaptive, and tightly coupled to cyberspace technology. Through modeling and simulation of Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial cyberspace systems evolution, the ISSP program provides architectures, products, and services based on mission impacts, information criticality, threats, vulnerabilities, and required defensive countermeasure capabilities.\n\nAll ISSP RDT&E efforts comply with the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-113) as implemented through Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-119 of February 10, 1998, DoD Instruction 4120.24, Defense Standardization Program (DSP), and DoD Instruction 4120.3-M, Defense Standardization Program Policies and Procedures. The predominant commercial standards bodies in ISSP-related matters include International Organization for Standardization, American National Standards Institute, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Internet Engineering Task Force, World Wide Web Consortium, and National Institute of Standards and Technologies. The joint interoperability required in today's telecommunications systems makes standards compliance a must and the ISSP RDT&E program complies with the joint technical architecture. The FORCEnet architecture and standards documents reflect this emphasis on interoperable standards. \n\nThe connection of FORCEnet with the DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) requires all ISSP RDT&E activities to adopt a minimum standard of \"best commercial IA practices.\" The ISSP program examines commercial technologies to determine their fit within Navy architectures, provides feedback to vendors about what the Navy requires, and participates in the standards bodies themselves. When necessary to protect mission critical systems specified in the Clinger\/Cohen Act, ISSP RDT&E develops or tailors commercial and government technologies, standards, and processes to meet Navy-unique requirements; prototypes systems or portions of systems and examines their utility in operational Navy settings; and, provides Information Assurance (IA) expertise and engineering to Navy and joint information system developments. All ISSP technology development efforts endeavor to solve specific Navy and joint IA problems using techniques that speed transition to procurement as soon as possible. \n\nMaritime Operations Center (MOC) will respond to new technologies and advanced hardware and software tools to support the development and deployment towards automated autonomous Computer Network Operations (CNO) Network Operations  (NetOps). \n\nJustification for Budget Activity: This program is funded under Operational Systems Development because it encompasses engineering and manufacturing development for the upgrade and integration of existing, operational systems. This includes cryptographic systems required to protect information defined in Title 40 United States Code (USC) Chapter 25 Sec 1452, and implements requirements in Executive Orders 12333 and 12958 and National Security Decision Directive 145. \n\nMajor focus areas in FY13: \n\nComputer Network Defense (CND) - Continue to ensure that security of Navy networks meet the mandates and initiatives of DoD for securing the Global Information Grid (GIG).  Continue to develop, integrate, and test defense-in-depth and situational awareness technologies for knowledge-empowered CND operations for afloat and ashore platforms. Continue to develop new capabilities into the Navy's Command and Control (C2) architecture via (Maritime Tactical Command and Control (MTC2)) and provide technical guidance to ensure CND requirements are met by Consolidated Afloat Network Enterprise Service (CANES). Continue the development and integration of DoD defined tools and capabilities including automation of reporting, monitoring, analysis and response as well as providing modernized patch management and host based security agent tools. For Maritime Operation Center (MOC) efforts in FY13, CND will leverage the Ozone Widget framework and the US Cyber Command Cyber Pilot architecture to deliver visualization and analysis tools in support of a NetOps COP at the C10F MOC. \n\nCND: Maritime Operations Center (MOC) - Assess the cyberspace network operations information dominance roadmap and as is architecture. Research government and industry automated autonomous information environment NetOps Common Operational Picture (COP) set of tools to provide the MOC the ability to maintain Command and Control (C2) of secure Communications Systems (CS) and conduct C2 Cyberspace NetOps.  Integrate Cyberspace NetOps in the \"to be\" Navy C2 architecture.\n\nCryptographic (Crypto)\/Crypto Modernization - Continue the Link-22 Modernized Link Level Communications Security (COMSEC) (MLLC), Very High Frequency (VHF)\/Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Wideband Tactical Secure Voice Cryptologic Equipment (VINSON)\/Advanced Narrowband Digital Voice Terminal (ANDVT) Cryptographic Modernization (VACM), and Link-16 CM development efforts, and start the Suite B Navy  implementation, Crypto Priority (Red) List, Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Awareness for devices (e.g., iApp development), and Navy Crypto Future Requirements development efforts. Continue development of a crypto modernization plan for transmission security (TRANSEC) with National Security Agency (NSA) and other services. \n\nKey Management Infrastructure (KMI) - Continue KMI transition planning, strategy and requirements definition for incorporation of other KMI roles into Navy architecture.  Begin capability, engineering development and verification testing support to KMI Capability Increment (CI)-2 Spiral 2 Spin 2. Continue supporting KMI transition working group meetings, Working Integrated Product Teams (WIPTs), Joint Working Groups (JWG), and developing white papers and supporting documentation for KMI. Provide requirements definition support of the next generation fill device and KMI CI-3. Investigate alternative KMI architecture implementations for submarine and other communities within the Navy.  Provide engineering and analysis to a centralized configuration management and Crypto unit inventory tracking tool which will  improve Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) and Crypto product management. Provide engineering and analysis to the intermediary Application (iApp) which will enhance KMI secure communications.\n\nPublic Key Infrastructure (PKI) - Continue to develop Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) PKI solutions, including the SIPRNet Validation Authority and Hardware Token. Research and test Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) enhancements for certificate authentication in the Navy afloat and ashore environments.

                            "val": "The Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) Research Development Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) program provides Information Assurance (IA) solutions for the Navy forward deployed, highly mobile information subscriber.  FORCEnet relies upon an assured information infrastructure, and the ISSP RDT&E program architects, engineers, and provides the level of robustness consistent with risks faced.  The ISSP addresses engineering design, development, modeling, test, and evaluation for the unique Information Assurance (IA) challenges associated with the highly mobile, dispersed, bandwidth limited, and forward-tactical connected US Navy communications systems. \n\nISSP RDT&E works closely with the Navy's Information Operations - Exploit (signals intelligence) and Information Operations - Attack (information warfare) communities. ISSP RDT&E developed systems dynamically change the Navy's current information assurance posture, based upon operational indications and warnings. To ensure interoperability, ISSP RDT&E integrates fully with the FORCEnet and maritime cryptologic architectures. ISSP RDT&E developed systems can provide the trigger for offensive warfare activities. \n\nThis project includes a rapidly evolving design and application engineering effort to modernize national security-grade (Type-1) cryptographic equipment and ancillaries with state-of-the-art replacements in order to counter evolving and increasingly sophisticated threats, in accordance with The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6510 requirements. Communication Security (COMSEC) and Transmission Security (TRANSEC) evolution are from stand-alone dedicated devices to embedded modules incorporating National Security Agency (NSA) approved cryptographic engines, loaded with the certified algorithms and key, and interconnected via industry-defined interfaces. This includes the Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) capability requirements document for the development of Content Based Encryption (CBE) continuing through FY2013. \n\nIn addition to protecting national security information, ISSP RDT&E must provide enterprise-wide assurance for statutorily protected information under the Privacy Act of 1974, Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, Medical Records Confidentiality Act of 1995, Model State Public Health Privacy Act, 45 Code of Federal Regulation subtitle  A sub-chapter C, parts 160-164, 1999, and the Federal Education Records Privacy Act. ISSP RDT&E efforts must also provide assurance to the broad spectrum of Sensitive-but-Unclassified information such as financial, personnel, contractor proprietary, and procurement sensitive. \n\nThe ISSP today includes more than legacy COMSEC and network security technology. IA or defensive information operations exist to counter a wide variety of threats.  ISSP activities  cover all telecommunications systems, and RDT&E projects must provide protection, detection, and reaction capabilities to the operational commander. ISSP RDT&E provides dynamic risk managed IA solutions to the Navy information infrastructure, not just security devices placed within a network. \n\nFew technology areas change as fast as telecommunications and computers, and IA must keep pace. This results in the continuing need to evaluate, develop, and\/or test IA products and approaches. Technology-based efforts include developing or applying: (1) new secure voice prototypes; (2) technology for a new family of programmable COMSEC and TRANSEC modules; (3) security appliances and software for switched and routed networks; (4) technology to interconnect networks of dissimilar classification, known as Cross Domain Solutions; (5) techniques for assuring code and data residing in and transiting the Navy's computing base and information store; and (6) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and associated access control technologies such as SmartCards and similar security tokens; (7) Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) devices (Simple Key Loaders (SKL), COMSEC Material Work Stations (CMWS)) and Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) equipment (Client Management (MGC)\/Advanced Key Processor (AKP) MGC\/AKPs, High Assurance Protocol Equipment) and Next Generation devices. \n\nThe resulting expertise applies to a wide variety of Navy development programs that integrate IA technology. Unlike traditional single-product development programs, the ISSP RDT&E holds a unique Navy-enterprise responsibility.\n\nISSP efforts conclude with continuously monitored, certified and accredited systems supported within Navy cyber operational environment. Achieving and maintaining this milestone requires: \n\n* Evolving techniques for defense of National Security Systems and Information against advanced persistent threats, including process, control, and sensor layers; \n* Approved techniques for the assured separation of information levels and user communities, including allied, coalition, non-Governmental, Defense Industrial Base, and other public partners; \n* Rapid deployment of technologies supporting the Navy's Computer Network Defense Service Providers (CNDSP) operations; \n* Hardware and software to assure end-to-end resilience of the Navy's telecommunications infrastructure and availability of the critical wireless spectrum resource; \n* High robustness interfaces with joint user and platform cyberspace domains, using a defense-in-depth architecture;\n* Communications Security (COMSEC) and process isolation techniques for securing the critical computing base and information store. \n\nThe cyberspace domain has virtually eliminated the traditional distinction between telecommunications and information systems. Because cyber security is a cradle-to-grave enterprise-wide discipline, this program applies the set of best practices embodied within the Committee on National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) 1253. \n\nOf special note is the Navy's cyber security role in the joint Cryptographic Modernization Program, required by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instructions (CJCSI) 6510.02D, providing high assurance and other cryptographic technologies protecting cyber systems. The parallel Security Management Infrastructure (SMI) program develops, evaluates, and applies new emerging technologies and enhanced capabilities to the Electronic Key Management System (EKMS)\/Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). \n\nAdditional efforts will focus on the architecture, design, and development of systems to manage the security parameters (e.g., cryptographic keys) necessary to the operation of the systems developed by the secure data and secure voice portions of the ISSP. This includes the application of PKI and Certificate Management Infrastructure technology, and the development of improved techniques for key and certificate management to support emerging, embedded cryptographic technology. \n\nISSP RDT&E management will direct a program that:\n \n* Ensures the Navy's cyber domain implements a consistent joint and Federal Enterprise cyber security architecture; \n* Rapidly develops, deploys, and versions cyber security measures across all seven layers of the ISO Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model and for all CNSSI 1253 Information Assurance (IA) controls (best practices); \n* Ensures that all data within Navy Enterprise is protected in accordance with its classification and mission criticality, as required by law; \n* Provides 10th Fleet and Fleet Cyber Command (FLTCYBERCOM) with integrated tools and techniques to protect, detect, restore, and respond to cyber events and incidents;\n* Supports the Navy Computer Network Defense (CND) provider by enabling cyber situational awareness;\n* Defends against and detects the unauthorized modification or disclosure of data outside Navy cyber domain, such as in the WikiLeaks incident;\n* Provides a risk-managed means of selectively allowing information to flow across the enclave boundary while ensuring proper marking and provenance;\n* Provides strong authentication of users accessing services from Navy cyberspace;\n* Defends against the unauthorized use of a host or application, particularly operating systems, control and process systems, and supervisory control and data acquisition systems;\n* Maintains cyber security configuration management of all hosts to track patches and system configuration changes;\n* Ensures adequate defenses against subversive acts of trusted people and systems, both internal and external;\n* Provides a Communications Security (COMSEC) infrastructure that supports key, privilege, and certificate management; and that enables positive identification of individuals utilizing network services; and,\n* Provides a continuous monitoring, analysis, assessment, situational awareness, and response infrastructure. \n\nMaritime Operations Center (MOC) networks will operate and share information with multiple partners and in varying circumstances. The MOCs will receive integrated tools to maintain a Network Operations (NetOps) Common Operational Picture (COP) and support Command and Control (C2) of the Communications Systems (CS) through the ability to analyze and develop Courses of Action (COA's) to manage C2 cyberspace operations. This includes CYBER Surveillance, bandwidth monitoring, INTEL situational awareness tools, and network health monitoring. NetOps COP will provide a proactive view and enhanced security tool for use by CYBER network managers. NetOps COP ensures validity of the COP, network health,  and provides operator synchronization with Information  Operations (IO), and situational awareness of the cyber battle space.  A combination of software tools, interoperable enabling hardware and processes to monitor and visualize network traffic to provide a locally generated, fused situational awareness picture for battle watch decision-making will be provided. NetOps COP provides the Commander with near immediate risk assessment, actionable intelligence and immediate mitigation courses of action and attribution of on-going CS Protection events in order to enable the apportionment of forces with exacting control in response to national objectives. \n\nFY 13 Highlights for Information Systems Security Program (ISSP),\n\nComputer Network Defense (CND) - Continue to implement Department of Defense (DoD)\/Enterprise-wide IA and CND Solutions Steering Group (ESSG) tools into Outside the Continental US Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-Net), Information Technology for the 21st Century (IT-21), and other networks (e.g., CARS) as requried.

NSA is the lead for the joint EKMS effort and has been developing and certifying EKMS devices and capabilities in an evolutionary approach. EKMS Phase V is a major component evolving to KMI Capability Increment 2.\n\nKey Management Infrastructure (KMI) - KMI is the next generation EKMS system that is net centric in nature, providing the infrastructure for management, ordering and distribution of key material as well as directly supporting the key requirements of all Crypto modernization efforts. Navy will continue to provide and refine Navy unique requirements into the NSA KMI CI-2 Spiral 2 Spin 2 capability. In parallel, KMI will continue to define Navy operational architecture and requirements for roll out of this new capability in the Fiscal Year 2013. Provide and refine Navy unique requirements into the NSA KMI CI-3 Capability Development Document (CDD). Investigate alternative KMI architecture implementations for submarine and other communities within the Navy.\n\nCryptographic Modernization (CM) - The procurement and fielding of Modernized Crypto devices such as the KG-3X Inc 2, KG-45A, AN-PYQ-20(v)(c) (formerly KL-51M), KW-46M, KG-175D, KG-175A, KG-3X Suites, K02 Replacement, Very High Frequency (VHF)\/Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Wideband Tactical Secure Voice Cryptologic Equipment (VINSON)\/Advanced Narrowband Digital Voice Terminal (ANDVT) Cryptographic modernization (VACM), Common Submarine Radio Room (CSRR), Walburn, and Communications Security (COMSEC) Crypto Serial Replacement will provide replacements of legacy crypto in accordance with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) mandate (CJCS Instruction 6510) as well as the NSA's planned decertification, which improves the security of the Navy's data in transit.\n\nComputer Network Defense (CND) - The CND program procures equipment to secure Navy network information systems. Procurements within the CND equipment line include: Firewall components which provide protection for networks from unauthorized users, Virtual Private Networks (VPN's) which provide encrypted \"Point-to-Point\" virtual communication networks, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), Administrator Access Control, Network Security tools and Filtering routers. CND procurements will also include Department of Defense (DoD)) Information Assurance (IA) certification and accreditation process end-to-end certification and accreditation support tool, to provide enterprise-wide visibility into security posture.  The rapid advance of cyber technology requires an efficient process for updating CND tools deployed to afloat and shore platforms. Recognizing the need for future CND capability improvements, CND will be implementing an evolutionary acquisition strategy that delivers CND capability in multiple increments and functionality releases that address validated requirements. \n\nMaritime Operations Center (MOC) - This Research Development Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) line supports an incremental acquisition strategy. MOC utilizes a System of Systems (SoS) and incremental approach in achieving global network of Navy Maritime organizations through Builds as defined by OPNAV N2\/N6F41\/C10F."

                            "val": "The goal of the Navy Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) is to ensure the continued protection of Navy and joint information and information systems from hostile exploitation and attack. ISSP activities address the triad of Defense Information Operations: protection, detection, and reaction. Evolving attack sensing (detection), warning, and response (reaction) responsibilities extend far beyond the traditional ISSP role in protection or Information Systems Security (INFOSEC). Focused on the highly mobile forward-deployed subscriber, the Navy's adoption of Network-Centric Warfare (NCW) places demands upon the ISSP, as the number of users explodes and the criticality of their use escalates. Today, the ISSP protects an expanding core of services critical to the effective performance of the Navy's mission.\n\nThe rapid rate of change in the underlying commercial and government information infrastructures makes the provision of security an increasingly complex and dynamic problem. Information Assurance (IA) technology mix and deployment strategies must evolve quickly to meet rapidly evolving threats and vulnerabilities. No longer can information security divorce the information infrastructure. The ISSP enables the Navy's war fighter to trust in the availability, integrity, authentication, privacy, and non-repudiation of information. \n\nThis project includes funds for advanced technology development, test and evaluation of naval information systems security based on leading edge technologies that will improve information assurance (e.g., situational awareness and information infrastructure protection) across all command echelons to tactical units afloat and war fighters ashore. This effort will provide the research to develop a secure seamless interoperable, common operational environment of networked information systems in the battle space and for monitoring and protecting the information infrastructure from malicious activities. This effort will provide naval forces a secure capability and basis in its achievement of protection from unauthorized access and misuse, and optimized IA resource allocations in the information battle space. This program will also develop core technology to improve network infrastructure resistance and resiliency to attacks; enable the rapid development and certification of security-aware applications and information technologies in accordance with the Common Criteria for IA and IA-enabled information technology products by the National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Instructions; and measure the effectiveness and efficiency of IA defensive capabilities under naval environments.\n\nThe program will develop common architectural frameworks that facilitate integration of network security capabilities, enable effective seamless interoperation, and contribute to a common consistent picture of the networked environment with respect to information assurance and security. This effort will address the need for a common operational picture for IA, as well as assessment of security technology critical to the success of the mission. Initiate requirements definition for situation awareness capabilities to support computer network defense in highly distributed, homogeneous, and heterogeneous networks including mobile and embedded networked devices. This effort also includes the architectural definition of situational awareness and visualization capabilities to support active computer network defense and support underlying data mining and correlation tools. This includes addressing the capability to remotely manage and securely control the configurations of network security components to implement changes in real time or near real time. Initiate requirements definition for secure coalition data exchange and interoperation among security levels and classifications. Ensure approaches address various security level technologies as well as emerging architectural methods of  providing interoperability across different security levels. Examine multi-level aware applications and technologies including databases, web browsers, routers\/switches, etc. Initiate infrastructure protection efforts as the Navy develops network centric architectures and warfare concepts, ensuring an evolutionary development of security architectures and products for IA that addresses Navy infrastructure requirements. Ensure the architectures evolve to provide proper protection as technology, DoD missions, and the threat all evolve. Include defensive protections as well as intrusion monitoring (sensors), warning mechanisms, and response capabilities in the architecture. Ensure the unique security and performance requirements of tactical systems, including those operating various security levels are addressed. Initiate the efforts to conceptualize new network centric warfare technology to protect our assets, such as secure network gateways and routers, and components and tools that improve the survivability of Navy networks. Provide systems security engineering, certification and accreditation support for high-confidence naval information system and ensure certification and accreditation approaches are consistent with Navy and DoD requirements.\n\nMajor focus area in FY13:  Continue development of new network security addressing nation state level sponsored activity.  Incorporate security services to thwart DNS attacks, distributed denial of service, botnet and other sophisticated attacks."
