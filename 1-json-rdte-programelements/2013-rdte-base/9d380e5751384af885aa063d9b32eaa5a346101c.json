            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Science and Technology (S&T) Strategic Plan approved by the S&T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis PE is organized into nine activities which are represented as seven Expeditionary Warfighting Capability Areas, as well as Future Concepts, Technology Assessment and Roadmapping, and the Littoral Combat\/Power Projection (LC\/PP) FNC.  The primary objective of this PE is to develop and demonstrate the technologies needed to meet the Marine Corps' unique responsibility of training and equipping the Marine Air\/Ground Task Force (MAGTF) for Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare.  In the post-September 11 world, irregular warfare (IW) has emerged as the dominant form of warfare confronting the United States, its allies and its partners; accordingly, this PE has been structured to account for distributed, long-duration operations, including unconventional warfare, counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and stabilization and reconstruction operations.  IW emphasizes the use of indirect, non-conventional methods and means to subvert, attrite, and exhaust an adversary, or render irrelevant, rather than defeat him through direct conventional military confrontation.   IW in now institutionalized in the Marine Corps' planning, investment, and capability development.  This PE provides the knowledge base to support Advanced Technology Development (6.3) and is the technology base for future expeditionary warfare capabilities.  This PE supports the Expeditionary Force Development System of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) and responds directly to the Marine Corps Science and Technology (S&T) process as well as supporting related Littoral and Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare capabilities developed by the Navy's Mission Capability Program.  The Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) process is supported and funds are programmed accordingly.  The FNC program explores and demonstrates technologies that enable Sea Strike, Sea Shield, Sea Basing, FORCEnet and Force Health Protection pillars, Space, Naval Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and the Enterprise and Platform Enablers.  The FNC program is composed of Enabling Capabilities (ECs) which develop and deliver quantifiable products (i.e., prototype systems, knowledge products, and technology improvements) in response to validated requirements for insertion into acquisition programs of record after meeting agreed upon exit criteria within five years. The core 6.2 program also supports Discovery and Invention (D&I) and Innovation and Transformation (I&T).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve key transformational capabilities required by the Sea Power 21 Pillars, as well as enable Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM), Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

This broad, multi-year (through the FYDP) initiative will expand existing technology integration and increase\/spur the application of more fundamental technologies to force and platform protection.  The goal is multiple broad phased force protection applications and technologies, with off-ramps for fielding successes; therefore, funding associated with this DoD initiative is reflected throughout the PE.  \n\nIn FY 2011 efforts continue in areas of technology that are ready for major, integrated technology demonstration.  All technical work is being coordinated throughout DoD on these demonstrations.  In areas such as vehicle technology demonstrations, the goal is to deliver multiple classes of advanced technology ground vehicle demonstrations leading to new classes of protective, efficient, ground vehicles.\n\nSchedule: Not applicable."

In conjunction with the Concepts Based Capabilities System and the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, unique and novel concepts for advanced warfighting are developed and validated.  Effectiveness analyses are conducted to identify the synergistic effects that can be achieved through the integration of emerging technology with innovative tactics, doctrine, and techniques.  Technology assessments are conducted to determine the supporting technologies that have the highest impact across the warfare areas, and warrant further investment within this PE.  Technology Roadmapping is conducted to help identify opportunities to leverage technology development within the Department of the Navy and the Department of Defense, as well as, with the commercial sector and university communities.  The resultant technology investment strategy is developed and used to guide out-year technology development efforts.\n\nThe increase in Funding from FY2011 to FY2012 is due to the initiation of two new assessments: A Cargo Unmanned Aerial study focused on developmental technologies for expeditionary operations to include ground autonomous capabilities and an assessment of Unmanned Ground Systems Affordability, Experimentation and Rapid Prototyping Investments and roadmapping."

It provides the capability for the demonstration and transition of technologies developed through the related Marine Corps S&T programs directly to an acquisition program of record.\n\nThe funding profile reflects the alignment of the FNC program investments into ECs.  Funding for each EC is aligned to a 6.2 or 6.3 Budget Activity (BA) as appropriate.  The focus of the ECs within this PE will be on technology related to Urban, Asymmetric, Littoral and Expeditionary Operations.  The related science and technology development is of the highest importance to Marine Corps operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and the OCO.  The technologies associated with these gaps are being pursued as part of an overall effort that addresses Sea Strike, Sea Shield, Sea Basing and FORCEnet and Expeditionary Maneuver warfare Capability Gaps.  Warfighter Capability Gaps are made up of ECs and supporting products.  This activity includes support to the Urban, Asymmetric Operations-related EC's for IED's, Modular Scalable Effects Weapons, Advanced Naval Fires Technology, Dynamic Target Engagement, Position Location Information, Transparent Urban Structures, Hostile Fire Detection and Response, Lightweight Protective Systems, and Lightening the Load of Dismounted Combatants."

This thrust aims at capturing emerging and \"leap ahead\" technologies in the areas of mobility, materials, propulsion, survivability, durability, signature reduction, modularity, and unmanned systems.  Special emphasis on survivability technologies for the defeat of small arms, IEDs, mine blast, and RPGs continue to be incorporated into this thrust area.  Efforts also continue in the development of modeling and simulation tools that integrate many different physics based modeling systems with rigorous operational analysis simulations to accurately define a system's performance characteristics.  These tools will aid in defining the trade space for emerging technologies and assist in providing the program manager insight and guidance into pursuing future technologies.  Finally, this technology thrust area also seeks to develop technologies to enhance combat vehicle crewman effectiveness and situational awareness through the incorporation of advanced autonomous vehicle functions triggered directly by the cognitive state of the operator. \n\nFY 2011 to FY 2012 funding increase is for initiation of programs to address maneuver capability gaps in survivability such as efforts to begin development of Advanced Blast Mitigation techniques and more effective Active Protection Systems; and to address gaps in mobility such as efforts to improve vehicle fuel efficiency through improvements in drive train and engine efficiencies and the development of alternative fuel capabilities to enhance tactical mobility in support of Distributed Operations."

The Marine Corps instantiation of FORCEnet is Marine Air Ground Task Force Command and Control (MAGTF C2), with technologies to exchange data and information with and among distributed tactical forces. (2) Developing decision support systems that enable warfighters to take advantage of the FORCEnet and MAGTF C2 and tactically extend Net-Enabled Command and Control (NECC) for shared situational awareness.  (3) Providing effective combat identification of enemy combatants, friendly forces, and non-combatants.  Activities in this activity provide technologies for secure, robust, self-forming, mobile communications networks distributed computing to support information dissemination to all echelons; and sensors, software and data processing to support formation of appropriate common picture.  Marine Corps specific efforts include power management, low detect ability, size and weight constraints, and interoperability within the joint environment."
