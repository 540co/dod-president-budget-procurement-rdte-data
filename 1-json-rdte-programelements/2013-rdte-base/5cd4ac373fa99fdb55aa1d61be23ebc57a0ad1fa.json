            "val": "This program provides for capabilities to: a) overcome performance limitations and reduce the life cycle cost of shore facilities and, b) provide protection against terrorist attacks for shore installations and their operations. The program focuses on technical and operational issues of specific Navy interest, where there are no unbiased test validated Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) solutions available, and where timely capabilities may not materialize without specific demonstration or validation by the Navy. Additionally, the program completes the development of technologies originating from Navy, DOD and other sources of Science and Technology programs, including the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Department of Energy (DOE). Validated technologies are implemented in the Navy's Military Construction (MILCON) and Facilities, Sustainment Restoration and Modernization (FSRM) program, and Antiterrorism and Force Protection (ATFP) Other Procurement, Navy (OP,N) program. \n\nProject 0995 addresses the following Navy facilities requirements during FY 2011 through FY 2017: Advance Technology for Waterfront Facilities Repair and Enhancements, Facilities Technologies to Reduce the Cost of Facilities Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization for reducing the total ownership cost (TOC) of future and existing Facilities and addressing seismic risk of Naval Waterfront Facilities. This project is consistent with recommendations of two National Academy of Sciences Reports: \"The Role of Federal Agencies in Fostering New Technology and Innovation in Building\" and \"Federal Policies to Foster Innovation and Improvement in Constructed Facilities.\" \n\nStarted in FY2006 the Force Protection Ashore Project 3155 addresses selective topics in modeling, and material technologies to reduce the vulnerability of installations; and reduce the acquisition and operating costs of protective technologies. The demonstrations and validations provide the independent, technical and operational test data for the development of competitive performance specifications to acquire the required capabilities. The ATFP project is coordinated with other DOD programs."

The program focuses available RDT&E resources on satisfying facility requirements where the Navy is a major stakeholder or where there are no test validated Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) solutions available, and a timely solution will not emerge without a Navy sponsored demonstration and validation. The program completes the development and validation of facility technologies originating in Navy science and technology programs, plus a variety of other sources which includes the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Validated technologies are implemented in the Navy's Military Construction (MILCON) and Facilities Sustainment Restoration and Modernization Programs (FSRP). The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of 2009 laid down very specific guidelines for the correction of corrosion deficiencies in DoD shore facilities which is estimated to be $1.9B (DOD Annual Cost of Corrosion for the Department of Defense Facilities and Infrastructure July 2010). \n\nProject 0995 addresses two Navy facilities requirements: 1) waterfront facilities repair, upgrade and service life extension; and, 2) validation testing\/performance monitoring of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) pads for JSF (F-35B), testing and evaluation of the performance of alternative materials, and surfacing concepts, and, methods and corrosion technologies to reduce the cost of Facilities, Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (FSRM). \n\nWaterfront facilities, repair, upgrade and service life extension:\nAn urgent requirement exists for early identification of strategies and solution recommendations for Seismic Risk at Naval Facilities, and especially nuclear capable waterfront facilities. Recent Pacific Rim earthquakes have heightened anxiety levels on perceived huge risks to Navy waterfront facilities in the region. The sub-project will provide analysis and solution recommendations for facilities impacted by seismic risk. Waterfront facilities repair and upgrade: About 75% of the Navy's waterfront facilities are over 45 years old. They were designed for a service life of 25 years and to satisfy the mission requirements existing at that time. The over aged reinforced concrete requires costly and repetitive repairs. In addition, to accomplish more pier side ship maintenance and thus reduce dry dock costs, these piers must be strengthened to support concentrated crane loads up to 140 tons when piers were originally designed for no concentrated loads. At the time piers were designed to service one, possibly two particular ship classes, berthing flexibility is now limited by mooring and utility arrangements. This sub-project addresses new materials design methods, and retrofit methods to extend the service life of existing waterfront facilities by an additional 15 or more years. The project also addresses updating the mission based service, environmental, and protection loading requirements imposed by changes in platforms, operations and threats. Other initiatives include: leveraging Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology to provide for enhanced facilities management processes and waterfront utilities service enhancements using models to achieve flexible berthing arrangements consistent with current and future platform mooring configurations and hotel service requirements including Facilities and Infrastructure Integrated Logistics Support for ACAT Programs.\n\nTechnologies to reduce the cost of Facilities Sustainment Restoration and Modernization (FSRP):\nTechnologies to reduce the cost of FSRM: SRM issues of high operational significance are addressed on a priority basis. The Navy portion of corrosion deficiencies in DoD shore facilities is estimated to be $433M (DOD Annual Cost of Corrosion for the Department of Defense Facilities and Infrastructure July 2010). Current Navy FSRM funding levels are insufficient to prevent the continued growth of the backlog of mission and safety critical maintenance and repairs. This effort will demonstrate and validate the cost and reliability of advanced corrosion technologies in order to assure their acceptance and implementation in traditionally conservative public works and construction industries. The effort will accelerate the validation, commercialization, and wide-spread implementation of the facility corrosion technologies urgently required to reduce the cost of correcting the deficiencies in the Navy FSRM backlog. Estimated returns on these investments are better than 60 to 1. The sub-project includes the continuing effort to validate, test and conduct performance monitoring of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) pads for JSF (F-35B)."

Program currently being evaluated are the inclement weather sensors for detecting intruders, intelligent video (VEW Maritime) in waterside security systems and over-the-water analytics,  Command, Control, and Communications (C3) capabilities for emergency operations, and identifying and interdicting malevolent threats - watercraft, swimmers, divers, unmanned underwater vessels (UUVs) to reduce injury and death to the war fighter.  \n\nThrough demonstration and validation of risk modeling and simulation models, the potential of emerging technologies will be evaluated and installation security strategies that reduce manpower and other costs will be formulated.  \n\nInstallation protection concepts against attacks from the air will be identified and jointly demonstrated.  These demonstrations and validations derive from advanced technology from science and technology programs of government academia and industry.  The technology produces data for performance specifications for competitive procurement. \n\nAll work will be coordinated with other programs and through industry forums as appropriate."
