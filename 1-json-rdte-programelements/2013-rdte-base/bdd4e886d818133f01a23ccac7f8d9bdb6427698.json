It also includes National Security Systems as defined in section 5142 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.  The GIG supports all DOD, National Security, and related Intelligence Community missions and functions (strategic, operational, tactical and business), in war and in peace.  The GIG also provides capabilities from all operating locations (bases, posts, camps, stations, facilities, mobile platforms, and deployed sites).  Finally, the GIG provides interfaces to coalition, allied, and non-DOD users and systems."

Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) provides focus and visibility into resolving joint, coalition, and national civil authority C4 interoperability issues and provides organizing principles, techniques, and procedures for achieving information superiority as envisioned by Joint Vision 2020. The GIG stresses interoperability and CWID leverages the rapid pace of C4 technology advancements. CWID is a Chairman\u2019s annual event that enables the US combatant commands, national civil authorities, and international community to investigate command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) solutions that focus on relevant and timely objectives for enhancing coalition interoperability and exploring new partnerships. CWID is conducted in a simulated operational environment to provide context for warfighter and national civil authorities\u2019 validation of those solutions. Interoperability Trials (ITs) are the activities used to address the core coalition and interagency interoperability objectives selected each year. ITs strive to address warfighter requirements and interoperability deficiencies. The selection of trials is dependent upon the annual overarching objectives, the host combatant command\u2019s priorities, Coalition\/State\/Agency desires to partner in a proposed trial, interagency participation, and the desires of invited coalition participants. CWID is an integral component of the JV 2020 conceptual template."
