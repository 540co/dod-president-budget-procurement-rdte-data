The Logistics R&D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that will provide a significantly higher level of support at lower costs, than would be otherwise attainable.  The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits.  One example is the Department of Defense (DOD) Electronic MALL (EMALL).  DOD EMALL was the first web based, distributed architecture on-line ordering capability.  It has been adopted by the Army, Navy and the Department of Homeland Security.  DLA\u2019s overall Log R&D program has demonstrated positive net present value and a positive return on investment."

It also enables authoritative data sources distributed throughout the Enterprise to be leveraged, and reduces unnecessary replication of data repositories.  The Netcentric Framework limits ad hoc design, discourages stove-pipe development, and reduces the development lifecycle of web services.  It also adds a metrics logging capability to provide feedback on the value of web services and identify future enhancements of the capability.  In May 2011, the Netcentric Framework was transitioned to the Defense Medical Logistic Standard Support Wholesale (DMLSS-W) team.  \n\nDefense Medical Logistics Transformation (DMLT) \u2013 Developed enterprise architecture (EA) products to support the business process reengineering project on Medical Equipment Life Cycle Management.

Efforts to transition Peak Policy and the Next Generation Inventory Model (Next Gen) for R items included participation in two different Forecastability Assessments, wherein the two models performed better than all competing approaches in both. Requirements were successfully developed for an integrated stocking model that integrates Next Gen for R items and the Peak Policy for N items with a more effective method of managing the movement of items between the R and N categories, and the results were delivered to the Planning Process Owner.  An effort was initiated to support the roll out of Inventory Policy Optimization (IPO) to the Air Force through a range of analyses to better understand the software, resolve problems and improve its performance. Efforts to develop new projects in the Planning Process area were initiated working with the Process Owner and Sub Process Owners.\n\nTechnical\/Quality Process Improvement:  The FY 2010 projects dealing with the piloting of new business processes containing specific review procedures for assessing PQDRs to identify systemic quality issues so that the root causes can then be evaluated, and the effort to define process improvements for specific notifications to customers of quality alerts were successfully completed and transition planning and support activities undertaken. Efforts were initiated to transition the recommendations resulting from the Counterfeit Parts strategic roadmap project into daily use within the DLA Aviation, Land & Maritime, and Troop Support sites, as well as HQ. The Parts Management\/Data Sharing project initiated in FY 2010 was completed and transitioned through creation of a new DoD process for component standardization, with the first step being formation of a Connectors Working Group. The CAGE Hopping analysis effort was completed with a number of business process improvement recommendations that the T\/Q process owner accepted and incorporated into a new Decision Support Pilot project. A project was initiated to demonstrate the feasibility of product marking with DNA to prevent introduction of counterfeit parts in the supply chain. The project to develop a DLA-wide approach for enhancing customer service by the Product Test Centers was completed and the recommendations accepted by the T\/Q Process Owner.  A new Product Verification Process project was initiated to transition those recommendations into daily policy and processes.\n\nProcurement Process Improvement:  The project to assess the feasibility of using RFID or other automatic identification technology to improve GFP inventory accuracy was completed and the results transitioned to J-74.  The Wide Area Workflow (WAWF)-focused project initiated in FY2010 was completed to understand issues with receipt and destination acceptance for Direct Vendor Delivery (DVD) and Industrial Product-Support Vendor (IPV) shipments as they impact DOD\u2019s ability to correctly pay supplier invoices and recommend alternatives to address those issues, and the recommendations delivered to J-33. A Decision Support Pilot project was initiated to evaluate the capabilities of a number of commercially available tools to detect fraudulent practices early \u2013 before award if possible. The results of the pilot will include definition of requirements for a DLA-wide decision support capability."

Plans include completing data collection and web design for three additional MILSPEC tents, complete modifications, and develop web-based training capability.  \n\nExtension of Supply Chain Simulation project:  This represents additional tasking for an existing project.  The project will simulate the capability of the tent supply chain to surge production under varying conditions and requirements.
