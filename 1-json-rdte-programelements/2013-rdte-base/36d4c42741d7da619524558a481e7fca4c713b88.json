            "val": "Provides funds for the development of sensor systems to improve present airborne reconnaissance capabilities.  These developments are driven by evolving collection requirements and technology advances.  The developments allow for the necessary changes required to meet an integrated, objective airborne reconnaissance architecture as defined in the Integrated Airborne Reconnaissance Strategy (IARS) and amplified in the Airborne Reconnaissance Information Technical Architecture.  The Advanced Sensors Development Program implements successful proof-of-concept efforts accomplished in the Advanced Technology Program, other Service\/Agency developments, and Congressionally-funded initiatives leading to producible sensor systems for airborne platforms.  Upon successful sensor prototype demonstration, technology sensor developments are turned over to the Services for procurement and platform integration.  This effort focuses on developments, which support sensor system interoperability and standardization of multi-Service and multi-platform applications.   In addition, funds provide for the development\/integration and operational assessment of components for the EP-3E and P-3 Special Projects Aircraft and follow-on candidate aircraft. \n\nThere are two primary objectives for the Advanced Technology funding:  (1) to evaluate the utility and maturity of technology for airborne reconnaissance applications and (2) to reduce the risk of employing emerging technologies in system upgrades, new system acquisitions, or Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations, by integrating and exercising them in developmental and operational tests.  These technologies help satisfy the requirements of the objective architecture set forth in the IARS. These technology investments are also identified in the Airborne Reconnaissance Technology Program Plan, published in November 1994. \n\nExhibits reflect Congressional Adds currently being executed as follows:\n\nFY11 Congressional Add of $49.945 is for sensor improvements on the EP-3E with applications for the follow-on Family of System (FoS) sensors and platforms.  The funds are responsible for the development, integration and test of FoS Signal Intelligence sensors, data links, data relays, and ground systems for incorporation on the FoS platforms and the development of Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination operations.\n\nFY12 Congressional Add of $20.000 is for a Central Command (CENTCOM) and Navy resourced Limited Objective Experiment (LOE) for a Joint Combat Validation (JCV) to investigate the potential usefulness\/requirement and demonstrate the mission utility (Multi-Intelligence, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Light Weaponization) and cost effectiveness of a Turbo Prop aircraft to support both General Purpose Forces (GPF) and Special Operations (SPECOPS) in ongoing Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) combat operations and other Expeditionary roles and missions far from conventional support infrastructure such as large concrete runways and fuel supplies."
