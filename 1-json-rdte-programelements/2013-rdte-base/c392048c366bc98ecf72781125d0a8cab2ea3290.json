For the design and validation of targets under development, the UARC will provide engineering studies in areas such as structures, controls, guidance, and propulsion.  For those hardware and software items presently under development by commercial vendors, the UARC will provide oversight and validation of vendor design and development approach.\nAs to specific harware development, this project includes:\n- Subsonic Targets.  Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) development.  The SSAT primarily represents subsonic anti-ship cruise missile threats in direct support of the test & evaluation (T&E) of major combat weapons systems programs and of fleet training.  \n- Supersonic Targets.  Supersonic Sea Skimming Target (SSST), Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (designated the ZGQM-173A), and supersonic high-diver capability development.  The family of supersonic target capabilities represents supersonic anti-ship cruise missile threats in direct support of Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E), Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) and Live Fire Test and Evaluation of major combat weapons systems programs in development.\n- TC and TA\/AS development.  TC provides command and control of targets to enable the execution of threat-representative mission profiles.  TA\/AS enables each target to be uniquely configured for specific mission profiles. TA\/AS-configured targets are used for radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement and testing, radar cross section evaluation, decoy-effectiveness testing, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare evaluation, warhead-effectiveness testing and evaluation of fleet tactics.  TA\/AS scoring capabilities include both surface and airborne scalar and vector scoring systems."

The ZGQM-173A will have a subsonic bus stage vehicle which will tumble and fall into the sea, and a supersonic sprint stage vehicle which continues flight to impact. The fielded system will provide threat representation in support of DT&E and OT&E and will identify deficiencies in shipboard air defense systems. Funding will also continue GQM-163 SSST upgrades\/evolutionary development to keep pace with evolving threat characteristics. Efforts include continuing to establish operational capability at Pacific Missile Range Facility, developing performance envelope characteristics to include flight termination performance, and continuing development of high-diver capability."
