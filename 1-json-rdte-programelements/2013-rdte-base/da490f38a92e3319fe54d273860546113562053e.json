            "val": "Rapid Cyber Acquisition (RCA) provides combatant commanders (CCDRs) with the ability to adequately and rapidly respond to emerging cyber needs that cannot be serviced via the JUON\/UON process and cannot wait for the normal DoD acquisition process to address.   It provides rapid fielding capability to secure the United States Air Force (USAF) portion of the DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) in response to threat, technology and\/or environmental changes.  It creates unique cyber capabilities through innovation and integration to provide critical interim cyber capabilities during the long-term acquisition of the next-generation network\/cyberspace infrastructure.  RCA refines operations by creating synergies and seamless cyber capabilities between independent offensive and defensive cyber efforts.  It fields operationally responsive cyber capabilities in mission-relevant timeframes and provides network defense to DoD GIG gateways, USAF base boundaries, and to Command and Control, operations and security centers.  It also generates network attack and cyber exploit capabilities in response to time-critical CCDR needs through all phases of warfare.\n\nRapid Cyber Acquisition is a combination of organizations and processes used to coordinate and manage programs, projects, and activities to deliver cyber capabilities to the 24th Air Force (24 AF) warfighter in mission-relevant timeframes.  RCA is the only organization dedicated to addressing the \u201crapid\u201d tier of the 3-tier agile cyber acquisition and sustainment construct to deliver capability when needed.  The other tiers are \"foundational acquisition\" and \"real-time ops and innovation.\"  RCA provides capabilities in support of US national security interests, to counter future cyber threats, and to enhance the nation's ability to operate in cyberspace.  It expedites development of USAF and DoD cyber capabilities to provide solution sets for cyberspace operations: attack, defense, exploitation, critical infrastructure support, combat support, command and control, information, and weapon systems.  RCA provides integration and technical support to other service and government agency activities to leverage select Air Force developed technologies and\/or operational capabilities.  RCA will perform hardware and software developmental and non-developmental rapid prototyping, integration, transition, and sustainment support activities as modifications to existing Air Force cyber infrastructure.  Primary activities include, but are not limited to:  development of software\/hardware; integration and transition of cyber capability to warfighter to include operationally fielded capabilities, test and evaluation and program management administration costs; and maintain and sustain cyber capability until either the capability becomes a Program of Record or until its intended purpose has been achieved and the capability is no longer required.  Secondary activities include, but are not limited to:  studies and analysis, risk reduction.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

It provides rapid fielding capability to secure the United States Air Force (USAF) portion of the DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) in response to threat, technology and\/or environmental changes.  It creates unique cyber capabilities through innovation and integration to provide critical interim cyber capabilities during the long-term acquisition of the next-generation network\/cyberspace infrastructure.  RCA refines operations by creating synergies and seamless cyber capabilities between independent offensive and defensive cyber efforts.  It fields operationally responsive cyber capabilities in mission-relevant timeframes and provides network defense to DoD GIG gateways, USAF base boundaries, and to Command and Control, operations and security centers.  It also generates network attack and cyber exploit capabilities in response to time-critical CCDR needs through all phases of warfare.\n\nRapid Cyber Acquisition is a combination of organizations and processes used to coordinate and manage programs, projects, and activities to deliver cyber capabilities to the 24th Air Force (24 AF) warfighter in mission-relevant timeframes.  RCA is the only organization dedicated to addressing the \u201crapid\u201d tier of the 3-tier agile cyber acquisition and sustainment construct to deliver capability when needed.  The other tiers are \"foundational acquisition\" and \"real-time ops and innovation.\"  RCA provides capabilities in support of US national security interests, to counter future cyber threats, and to enhance the nation's ability to operate in cyberspace.  It expedites development of USAF and DoD cyber capabilities to provide solution sets for cyberspace operations: attack, defense, exploitation, critical infrastructure support, combat support, command and control, information, and weapon systems.  RCA provides integration and technical support to other service and government agency activities to leverage select Air Force developed technologies and\/or operational capabilities.  RCA will perform hardware and software developmental and non-developmental rapid prototyping, integration, transition, and sustainment support activities as modifications to existing Air Force cyber infrastructure.  Primary activities include, but are not limited to:  development of software\/hardware; integration and transition of cyber capability to warfighter to include operationally fielded capabilities, test and evaluation and program management administration costs; and maintain and sustain cyber capability until either the capability becomes a Program of Record or until its intended purpose has been achieved and the capability is no longer required.  Secondary activities include, but are not limited to:  studies and analysis, risk reduction.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
