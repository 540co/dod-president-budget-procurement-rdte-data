            "val": "Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) lessons learned and daily operations indicate that current distribution and logistics processes remain outdated and are rarely capable of providing required warfighter support in an agile, efficient and economical manner.  Designation of United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) as the Distribution Process Owner (DPO) and shift within the Department to transform the distribution and logistics processes, demands the examination and improvement of the entire supply chain.  Unpredictable and extended global distribution routes, limited visibility of sustainment requirements, force packaging limitations, lift constraints, anti-access\/aerial denial, complex supply chains, as well as non-networked battlefield command and control (C2), planning, and decision support tools impede timely warfighter logistical support.  The centralization of distribution and logistics intermodal research and development facilitates the development\/fielding of transformational enhancements to validated distribution capability gaps.  The USTRANSCOM Research, Development, Test, & Evaluation (RDT&E) program explores and matures promising technologies to enhance support to combatant commanders and other customers of Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD\u2019s) distribution and transportation systems."

Current planning, forecasting and collaboration capabilities do not permit full synchronization of people, processes and assets to execute planned operations. Automated tools must be able to dynamically analyze\/predict demand and provide input to advanced distribution planning systems.  Transportation information exchange across the DOD is inhibited by disparate systems, multiple data standards and insufficient interfaces.  The ability to maintain situational awareness of movements at macro\/micro (drill down) levels, with associated force and sustainment cargo on board; to track force packages progress, and rapidly determine the impact of any delays or changes to sailing progress and arrival at port of debarkation; and to conduct \"what -if\" impact assessment of possible changes to delivery asset\u2019s course, speed or departure\/arrival information as it relates to force or force package delivery\/impact of any change on the closure of force packages in theater is required.
