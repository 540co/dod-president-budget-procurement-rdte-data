This need has been filled by ground transportation (truck convoys)\nand with manned assault support cargo rotary wing assets. Both alternatives expose unnecessary risk to Marine Corps personnel, and impact the availability of the aviation assets for other combat support missions. The Cargo UAS service will apply to the deployed I Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF), Forward, deployed in Afghanistan. The current concept of operations is to provide support from one Main Operating Base to three FOBs.\n\nCurrent combat operations have highlighted the vulnerability and effectiveness of existing modes of resupply. To mitigate this threat, it is imperative that alternative methods to resupply remote Spokes (also called the FOBs) be employed. A vertical lift Cargo UAS is required to augment existing resupply methods in Afghanistan and is required immediately to fulfill war fighter needs. Special Operations Command will monitor the program to help determine their future requirements.\n\nA Cargo UAS is comprised of air vehicles, Ground Control Stations and associated spares and support equipment. The system will support the I MEF, Forward while operating from selected FOBs. The air vehicles and remote terminal control stations are procured by the government, and the Cargo UAS is operated as a Government Owned, Contractor Operated\nsystem.\n\nThe Cargo UAS was granted Rapid Deployment Capability program status by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition on 17 May 2010.  The contracts were competed and comprised of the Lockheed Martin KMAX and the Boeing Hummingbird air vehicles.  A down-select was conducted resulting in KMAX deploying and commencing Afghanistan operations in December 2011.  Cargo UAS Afghanistan operations are funded via Operations and Maintenance, Navy (O&MN) Overseas Contingency Operations funding in FY12 and the Marine Corps will support as required in future years."
