The new focal area \u201cBiometrics and Forensics\u201d has been allocated $11.000 million to resource emerging technologies as DoD seeks to attribute enemy activity to specific individuals. The new focal area \u201cUrban Characterization\u201d has been allocated $5.000 million to resource development of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), electronic warfare, kinetic and other capabilities needed for future military operations in a wide range of urban areas. \n\nThe remaining factor relative to the FY 2012 to FY 2013 increase reflects the restoral to baseline of a FY 2012 budget reduction and DoD's continued emphasis on QRSP's proven ability to expedite development and transition of new technologies to the warfighter."

            "val": "The QRSP Program supports five separate projects that provide rapid funding to expedite development and transition of new technologies to the warfighter.  The projects that are part of the QRSP are the Quick Reaction Fund (QRF), the Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF), the RDT&E Architecture and Integration (RAI) program, Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support, and Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) support.  QRSP provides the flexibility to respond to emergent DoD issues and address technology surprises and needs within the years of execution outside the two-year budget cycle. \n\nP826:    Projects supported by Quick Reaction Funds (QRF) focus on responding to emergent conventional warfare needs during the execution years that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies.  Examples of the types of projects that are envisioned include:  force protection projects to enhance anti-access and area denial capabilities, and broad electronic warfare capabilities.  QRF focuses on maturing technologies critically needed for the combatant commands and produces prototypes or demonstrates capabilities for evaluation within 12 months. \n\nP828:    The Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) objectives are to leverage the DoD science and technology base and those of the other federal departments; stimulate interagency coordination and cooperation; accelerate the fielding of capabilities and concepts to counter emerging threats; and provide feedback to the S&T community to guide long term developmental strategies.  The RRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  RRTO works to anticipate adversaries' exploitation of new technologies and advanced capabilities and develop counters to those capabilities.  Additionally, the office works to leverage technology developed outside of DOD in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas and small, non-traditional businesses to expose them to specific DoD needs areas as identified by Combatant Commanders, Military Service organizations and other Defense Agencies and interagency organizations. The typical length of an RRTO program falls within a six to twelve month range in order to more effectively aid the warfighter. RRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 30 percent for demonstration programs (DOD Strategic Objective 4-3).  \n\nP830:    The RDT&E Architecture and Integration program objectives are to enhance and expand Yuma Proving Grounds rapid technology assessment capability in general and to enhance the Joint Experimentation Range Complexes (JERCs) venue in particular.  This include:  improving the broad-spectrum of evaluations to include analysis of a cohesive Forward Operating Base (FOB) defensive architecture; emerging homemade explosives (HME); future Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs); counter IED capability development; and, characterization of evolving electro-magnetic environments.  These focal align under the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) focal area \u201cInstitutionalizing Rapid Acquisition Capability\u201d and its third tenant \u201cAssessing Alternatives and Executing a Solution (Acquisition).\u201d\n\nP831:  The Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) objectives are focused on responding to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) that have been submitted by Combatant Commanders and validated by the Joint Staff.  The JRAC\u2019s objective is to manage the delivery of capability as requested by the Combatant Command (COCOM) in a time frame acceptable to the COCOM.  The JRAC manages the overall effort to fulfill JUONS.  Efforts, in most instances, are conducted outside of the processes described for the Defense Acquisition System in DoD Directive 5000.1 and utilize contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.\n\nP833:  The objective of the Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) Cell is to support all COCOMs, Joint Force Commanders and all other government agencies by assessing complex operational\/technical challenges which require multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the United States Government, academia and the private sector, the SMA cell develops solution options to COCOM generated challenging problems and informs the command\u2019s senior leadership.  Each SMA effort is initiated at the request of senior COCOM leadership.  Products are typically produced within six months and directly contribute to the decision making process of COCOM\u2019s senior leaders."

More specifically, initiatives that address the following interest areas:  Anti-Access\/Area Denial,  Base Protection; Electromagnetic Bandwidth and Spectrum Enhancement; Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); Newly Emerging National Threats; Directed Energy Capabilities; Low-Cost Precision Engagement Capabilities; Operational Field Demonstrations; Unmanned and Robotics Systems; Over the Horizon-Radar Technologies; and Counter-Electronic Warfare Technologies.\n\nIn FY 2012 and FY 2013 QRF will continue to identify and fund new projects that are best equipped to respond to critical operational needs and new technology opportunities.  Current and future efforts that show significant effectiveness can be leveraged by additional investments in order to accelerate transition of capabilities."

This effort culminated in a robust, lightweight system capable of charging military batteries from a liquid fuel source.  The performer developed a 150-Watt portable generator based on solid oxide fuel cells.  This generator used hydro-treated renewable jet fuel or de-sulfurized JP8 as fuels and will be capable of operating as a battery charger or direct power unit.  With a mass of less than six kilogram (14 pounds), the battery charger-based system fits within a backpack, saves 60 percent of the weight of current solutions, and saves more than 80 percent of the weight of primary batteries."

The RRTO was stood up to provide rapid response to enhance operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other theaters in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO); and, to accelerate the transition of high-potential science and technology projects into operationally useful products in the execution years.  RRTO leverages the Department of Defense (DoD) science and technology base and those of the other Federal Departments; stimulates interagency coordination and cooperation; accelerates the fielding of capabilities and concepts to counter emerging threats; and, provides feedback to the Science & Technology (S&T) community to guide long term developmental strategies.  RRTO anticipates adversaries' exploitation of technology, including available and advanced commercial capabilities.  In prior years, RRTO has explored methods and approaches of persistent surveillance stimulation for counterinsurgency; developed alternate power sources for sensors and systems; expanded human, social and cultural knowledge; increased small unit situational awareness; advanced the interface between law enforcement and military operations; developed biometrics and forensics capabilities; supported denied area operations; strategic multi-layer assessment; and, established an innovation outreach cell that is facilitating better interactions with small companies with emerging technologies that do not normally do business with the DoD.  In FY 2012 and FY 2013, RRTO will continue to explore new and emerging capabilities to support irregular warfare operations while working to support Under Secretary of Defense (Advanced Technology & Logistics) (USD (AT&L)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) (ASD(R&E)) goals.  With project selection occurring during the execution year, potential focus areas for FY 2012 and FY 2013 Rapid Reaction Technology Office projects include:  Forward Operating Base (FOB) protection; persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) architecture; ISR sensors; interface of law enforcement and military operations; biometrics and forensics; autonomous operations; data processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED); cyber security; exploitation of new and emerging cell phone technologies; support to border patrol initiatives; counter proliferation initiatives; capabilities to exploit denied areas; strategic communications and multi-layer assessments; and nontraditional approaches to leverage innovative businesses.  The typical length of a RRTO project falls within a six to twelve month range in order to more effectively aid the Warfighter."
