The Program exists to optimize U.S. forces\u2019 ability to perform population-centric sensing, understand behaviors driven by social and cultural variables, and take effective courses of action in the full range of military operations. Program research will enhance intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for understanding the Irregular Warfare environment and meeting the challenges of instability and violent extremism. In three integrated program elements (PEs), the Program will conduct applied research, mature and demonstrate advanced technology, and develop transitionable  methods, technology, tools and prototypes. Work under PE 0602670D8Z  will focus on developing an applied science base, to include validated theory and methods, along with knowledge products and resources to support sociocultural behavior data collection, analysis and forecasting of sociocultural behavior, course of action planning, and effects analysis. Research will address needs in two areas: modeling, and data. It will develop and validate theoretical constructions, generate knowledge products, and develop stand-alone computational models of sociocultural behavior; and develop improved methods for valid collection of quality sociocultural data that will facilitate subsequent model development and validation. The Program will ensure that supported research is clearly tied to warfighters and their needs. \n\nHuman behavior based theory, knowledge products, and stand-alone models will support development of software to help users represent, understand, and forecast sociocultural behavior at strategic, operational, and tactical levels.\n\nImproved data collection methods will help build the sociocultural science base and facilitate subsequent model development and validation and address emerging data types and sources, such as social media."
