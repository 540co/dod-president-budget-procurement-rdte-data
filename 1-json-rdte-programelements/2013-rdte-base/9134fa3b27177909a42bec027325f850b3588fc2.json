Research in this area has the ultimate goal of demonstrating the potentially significant advantages of quantum mechanical effects in communication and computing.  Expected applications include: new improved forms of highly secure communication; faster algorithms for optimization in logistics and wargaming; highly precise measurements of time and position on the earth and in space; and new image and signal processing methods for target tracking.  Technical challenges include: loss of information due to quantum decoherence; limited communication distance due to signal attenuation; limited selection of algorithms and protocols; and larger numbers of bits.  Error correction codes, fault tolerant schemes, and longer decoherence times will address the loss of information.  Signal attenuation will be overcome by exploiting quantum repeaters.  New algorithm techniques and complexity analysis will increase the selection of algorithms, as will a focus on signal processing.  The QIS program is a broad-based effort that will continue to explore the fundamental open questions, the discovery of novel algorithms, and the theoretical and experimental limitations of quantum processing as well as the construction of efficient implementations."

Additionally, the integrated phase control will provide the unprecedented ability to rapidly change the number of simultaneous beams, beam profile, and power-per-beam, thus opening a whole new direction in operational capability.  Key technical challenges include the ability to achieve the needed facet density (facet pitch should be on the order of a wavelength or two), control the relative phase across all facets equivalent to 9-bits, and efficiently couple and distribute coherent light to facets from a master laser oscillator with an integrated waveguide structure.  Related projects and studies have pointed to the significant system-level pay-offs of the new proposed technology."

Compared to conventional RF receivers, AIC-based designs will increase receiver dynamic range and frequency band of regard while reducing data glut, power consumption and size.  Likewise, limitations of current art power amplifier technology in simultaneously achieving high operational bandwidth, linearity, efficiency and power has resulted in well documented instances of electronic fratricide.  This program will overcome these limitations by converting digital signals directly to high power RF analog signals, thus eliminating the traditional high power amplifiers that are limited by the above-mentioned tradeoffs.

FY 2011 and FY 2012 incorporates the COSMOS program into DAHI.\n\nIn the Applied Research part of this effort, high performance RF\/optoelectronic\/mixed-signal SoCs for specific DoD transition applications will be developed as a demonstration of the DAHI technology.

Specifically, LEAP offers foundry access at a substantially reduced cost for CMOS technology nodes of 45 nanometers (nm) and below.  Currently much of the IC design work performed using advanced technology nodes, including that done for the DoD, uses off-shore facilities in Asia and Europe.  This results in substantial intellectual property (IP) development outside the U.S. and creates a number of difficulties for technology transition of DoD-critical applications.  This program will stimulate U.S.-based advanced design research, providing top researchers early and partially subsidized access to validate and test innovative ideas and facilitate a more natural transition of these ideas."

This technology promises to effectively mitigate dependence on Global Positioning System (GPS) or any other external signals, and enable uncompromised navigation and guidance capabilities.  The program will enable positioning, navigation and timing functions without the need for external information updates by employing on-chip calibration, thereby overcoming vulnerabilities which arise in environments where external updates are not available such as caves, tunnels, or dense urban locations.  The technologies developed will enable small, low-power, micro-gyroscopes capable of operating in both moderate and challenging dynamic environments; chip-scale primary atomic clock standards; and on-chip calibration systems for error correction.  Advanced micro-fabrication techniques allow a single package containing all the necessary devices (clocks, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and calibration mechanisms) to be incorporated into a volume the size of a sugar cube.  The small size, weight and power of these technologies and their integration into a single package responds to the needs of guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and individual soldiers.\n\nThe successful realization of a Micro PN&T device is dependent on developing fundamentally new batch microfabrication processes, gaining an understanding of the sources and effects of error at the micro-scale, and exploring new combinatorial physics.  Innovative 3-D microfabrication techniques will allow co-fabrication of different materials and devices on a single chip.  Clocks, gyroscopes, accelerometers, calibration stages, and 3D structures could be integrated into a small, low power architecture.  This co-location of different inertial and timing devices opens the possibility for utilization of combinatorial physics in a single micro-system, enabling fast start-up time, increased bandwidth and long-term stability, thus effectively providing very accurate navigation devices.  Advanced research for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-12."

The MPD program will focus on development of fast, small, reliable, carrier dense, microplasma switches capable of operating in extreme conditions such as high-radiation and high-temperature environments.  Specific focus will be given to methods that produce efficient, high-pressure (up to or even beyond atmospheric pressure) generation of ions, radio frequency energy, and light sources.  Applications for such devices are far reaching, including the construction of complete high-frequency plasma-based logic circuits, and integrated circuits with superior resistance to radiation and extreme temperature environments.  It is envisaged that both two and multi-terminal devices consisting of various architectures will be developed and optimized under the scope of this program.  MPDs will be developed in various circuits and substrates to demonstrate the efficacy of different unique approaches.\n\nThe MPD applied research program is focused on transferring the fundamental scientific advances funded by PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 to produce complex circuit designs that may be integrated with commercial electronic devices.  It is expected that the MPD program will result in the design and modeling tools, as well as the fabrication capabilities necessary to commercially manufacture high-performance microscale plasma device based electronic systems for advanced DoD applications."

Development of wafer scale IR sensor and coolers for low cost manufacturing will provide a price point that will allow them to be deployed to each warfighter.  The emphasis on a small form -factor (<3.5 cm3) will naturally enable new opportunities such as surveillance with micro-UAVs, networked handheld devices with fused imaging capabilities to share tactical information at troop level, and intelligence for rapid decision\/action.  The phenomenology of different infrared wavelengths will be exploited for targets of interest and only relevant data will be transmitted, thus reducing data burden over the network.  Having the capability of PIXNET at the soldier level will increase situational awareness and will enable more effective tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP).  PIXNET will take advantage of small computing platforms such as Android cell phones API to integrate and demonstrate digital image data distribution and signal processing via wireless connectivity.

The objective of the program was to enhance sensitivity, resolution, and effectiveness of electromagnetic sensors beyond what is classically possible.  In the initial effort, the types of sensors that propagate entangled light out to and back from a target were proven to be ineffective when realistic scattering and absorption occur between the source and the target.  Sensors that propagate classical light to the target but use non-classical effects only in the receiver were shown to provide qualitative advantages over their classical counterparts.  These include compensation for soft aperture losses using squeezed vacuum injection and compensation for detectors' quantum inefficiency using noiseless amplification."

The RPT program aimed to efficiently capture all RF signals of interest by developing broad-band (>10 gigahertz) high-linearity (>70 decibels dynamic-range) optical components and microsystems.  RPT enables linear broadband microsystems such as remote links, channelizers, and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).
