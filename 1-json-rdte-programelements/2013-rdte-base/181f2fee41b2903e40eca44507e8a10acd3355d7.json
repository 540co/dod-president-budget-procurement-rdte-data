That ICD was updated as the Distributed Common Ground\/Surface System (DCG\/SS) Enterprise ICD, and approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 27 Feb 2009. The Army requirements were refined in the DCGS-A Capabilities Development Document (CDD), and approved by the JROC 31 Oct 2005. The DCGS-A program is currently in the Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase and was designated as a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) in OSD (AT&L) Memorandum, 29 Mar 2010. \n\nDCGS-A is following an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop and field system capabilities over time to satisfy the requirements of the DCGS-A Capability Development Document (CDD). Following this approach, the first increment was defined and a Capability Production Document (CPD) was created with full consideration of all of the preceding supporting documents and analysis. As part of its initial staffing, a Cost Benefit Analysis was completed in support of the DCGS-A CPD. This analysis projected a significant cost avoidance\/savings over the life cycle by not limiting the hardware configuration to a one size fits all unit types design but rather integrating the DCGS-A SW capabilities into common servers and other IT components fielded at that echelon. This approach was included in the CPD and updated DCGS-A Acquisition Strategy. The CPD was approved by the JROC on 20 Dec 2011.\n\nThe DCGS-A System Engineering Plan (SEP) updated the current development plan and was approved by OASD (R&E) on 5 Dec 2011. The DCGS-A Revised Acquisition Strategy (AS) is awaiting approval by the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE). It is anticipated the DCGS-A Acquisition Program Baseline will be approved in 2Q12. The DCGS-A program is currently preparing for a milestone C in 2Q12 and an operational test in 2Q-3Q12 and subsequent FDD decision in 4Q12.  \n\nPM DCGS-A has been designated as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead for PEO IEW&S. As such, DCGS-A is currently aligning it's architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This alignment is in accordance with the G-3\/5\/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision. Our acquisition strategy supports this initiative as we continue to collapse PORs and reduce footprint following our capability migration path and iterative development approach in support of an \"IT Box\" requirements prioritization process. As we continue the path to DSB 1.0 and beyond, each release will focus on the COE and continually align the Command Post activities with DCGS-A Cloud, Edge Node, and POR migration activities."
