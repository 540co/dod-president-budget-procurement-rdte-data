Also this Project provides for the JPEO-CBD Software Support Activity (SSA).\n\nThe JEM is DoD's only accredited model for predicting hazards associated with the release of contaminants into the environment.  JEM is being developed in separate increments and is capable of modeling hazards in a variety of scenarios including: counterforce, passive defense, accident and\/or incidents; high altitude releases, urban Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC) environments; building interiors, and human performance degradation.  Battle space commanders and first responders must have a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) hazard prediction capability in order to make decisions that will minimize risks of CBRN contamination and enable them to continue mission operations.  JEM operates in an integrated fashion with operational and tactical Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, and in a standalone mode.  JEM interfaces and communicates with the other programs such as JWARN, weather systems, intelligence systems, and various databases.\n\nThe Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) will provide the Joint Forces with a comprehensive Integrated Early Warning, Analysis and Response capability to minimize the effects of hostile CBRN attacks, as well as accidents and incidents.  It will provide the operational capability to employ CBRN warning technology which will collect, analyze, identify, locate, report, and disseminate warnings.  JWARN will be compatible and integrated with Joint Service C4ISR Systems.  JWARN will transition from platform specific Common Operating Environment (COE) standards to a Web-based Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).  JWARN will also provide an expansion of sensors that will connect to JWARN, increased automation of message handling, improved false alarm filtering, integration of route-planning calculator, and interoperability with additional C2 systems.  JWARN will be located in Command and Control Centers at the appropriate level and will be employed by CBRN defense specialists and other designated personnel.  This employment will transfer data automatically from existing and future sensors to provide commanders with the capability to support operational decision making in a CBRN environment.  JWARN will provide additional data processing to support the production of plans and reports, and access to specific CBRN information to improve the efficiency of limited CBRN personnel assets.  JWARN will integrate existing sensors into a sensor network or host C2 system, but does not provide the sensors that will be employed in the operating environment.  The JWARN capability described above will be developed utilizing an incremental approach based on Service requirements and host system architecture.    \n\nThe JPEO-CBD SSA is a JPEO-CBD enterprise-wide, user developmental support and service organization focusing on development assistance and net-centric interoperability.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Integrated Architectures, Information Assurance, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) and Data Management; interoperable and integrated net-centric, Service-oriented, composable solutions for CBD; and infusion of latest technologies into programs of record.  CBRN user community and related communities of interest have need for CBRN \"plug and play\" capability to allow interoperability and re-configurability across the enterprise.  The requirement for net-centric, composable solutions provides the near term foundation for the Warfighter's ability to communicate CBRN solutions and interoperate with other Service operational systems.  It also supports a longer term ability to interoperate with related agencies and to reduce the Warfighter's CBRN footprint as technologies improve."

JEM is now being fielded in increments of capabilities.  Each increment will retain the functionality of the preceding increment.  The JEM development effort will be aligned with the evolving Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) architectures and technologies, as well as, with Service Command and Control (C2) systems.  JEM will develop three distinct increments of software.  JEM is a web-services based application and has been granted an Interoperability Certificate by the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC).  The program plans to award competitive contracts using fixed price or cost-plus as appropriate.\n\nJWARN\n\nJWARN will develop and provide Integrated Early Warning capabilities to specified (Common Operating Environment (COE-based)) operational-level Service Command and Control (C2) systems at the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) level, extend the integration effort into the Service tactical (non COE-based) C2 systems, provide connectivity to legacy and newly developed sensors, and complete the development of JWARN. \n\nJWARN will extend these baseline capabilities to emerging, net-centric, Service C2 systems and Service CBRN sensors and detectors as they are developed and fielded.  JWARN will also ensure CBRN warning and reporting capabilities remain synchronized with the changing demands of the Warfighter while keeping pace with evolving C2 systems and their architectures, and will further evolve by integrating next generation sensors, detectors and emerging Medical and Biological Surveillance requirements into the CBRN Enterprise.\n\nSSA\n\nThe JPEO-CBD Software Support Activity (SSA) is a JPEO-CBD user support organization spanning and supporting all Joint Project Managers (JPMs) and JPEO-CBD Directorates.  The SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all JPEO-CBD Programs of Record (PORs) that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS) across the JPEO and all JPMs.\n\nPhase 1a identifies JPEO-CBD JPMs and programs that deal with data or software, and have an IT component.  This will be followed by coordination with the JPMs and programs to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  (BA5 - System Development and Demonstration).\n\nPhase 1b established management and control measures for tracking and reporting progress of the various elements described in Phases 1 and 2.  This includes establishing, tracking, and performing configuration management of inventories and databases of IT systems and their states of interoperability and information assurance compliance.  (BA5 - System Development and Demonstration).\n \nPhase 2 will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.

JBAIDS is a commercial off-the-shelf development\/production effort started in August 2003 that focused on rapid development and fielding efforts to deliver a critical capability to identify bacteria and virus agents in environmental surveillance sample types.  By 2005, 16 biological warfare (BW) agent surveillance detection kits were fielded along with the first JBAIDS in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  JBAIDS currently has seven IVD kits cleared by the FDA, e.g. Anthrax, Plague, Tularemia, Q-Fever, H5 Avian, Influenza A&B, etc.  An expanded influenza detection panel covering six new assays were cleared on Sept 13, 2011.  Additionally, the JBAIDS Platinum Path Extraction Kit (PPEK) Bridging Study contract was awarded on Oct 20, 2011; this study will allow the PPEK to be used on the Anthrax, Plague, and Tularemia IVD kits.  JBAIDS achieved full operational capability (340 systems delivered all Services) in July 2011.  Future JBAIDS efforts in 2012-2016 using MB7 RDT&E funding, will focus on adding new surveillance food and water pathogen detection assays and starting the Glanders (Burkholderia) IVD kit effort.  Also the development team will focus on completing two Pre-Emergency Use Authorization (Pre-EUA's) packages annually for FDA review.  These sustainment RDT&E funds will also be used to conduct software security information assurance (IA) updates on fielded software and monitor analyzer\/laptop parts obsolescence."
