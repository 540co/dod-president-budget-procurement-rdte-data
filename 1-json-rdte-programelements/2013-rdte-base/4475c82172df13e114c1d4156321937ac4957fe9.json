            "val": "The Information Systems Security Program Element provides cradle-to-grave research, development, acquisitions, supply, sustainment, depot maintenance and demilitarization of the Air Force (AF) cryptographic and key distribution\/management systems.  Additionally, it funds the AF operation one of two US National Security Agency Tier 1 key distribution centers, the AF Public Key Infrastructure System Program Office, the AF Call Sign function, and a special computer security program designated, Firestarter.\n\nThe overall focus of the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) efforts within this program is two-fold.  The major focus is transforming electronic key delivery and DoD cryptographic devices to meet the next generation warfighting requirements. This focus is driven by the National Security Agency\u2019s tenets calling for (1) a totally \"man-out-of-the-loop\" electronic crypto key distribution system from the actual generation of the key in the key processor all the way into the using End Crypto Unit (ECU) (eliminates the current key vulnerability to compromise by individuals transporting or loading the key); and (2) an inventory of cryptographic devices that are more robust, modular, scalable, capable, net-centric, and durable (allows more effective and efficient performance including reduced inventory, expanded data rates, simplified upgrades, and ensured global information grid-compatibility).  The second focus is to rapidly provide new\/improved capabilities to 24 AF-led forces further enabling them to protect and defend USAF Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and Weapon Systems from Information Warfare (IW) attacks and to ensure affected system recovery from such attacks. To this end, the project does research and development of information protection tools and transitions them to operational systems.  These efforts not only provide AF passive Net Defense capabilities but also an increasing share of the active Net Defense capabilities. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

(The National Security Agency [NSA] acts as the Executive Agency for the DoD EKMS Program.) AFEKMS, in concert with the overarching DoD EKMS program, provides a secure and flexible capability for the electronic generation, distribution, accounting, and management of key material, voice callwords, and communications security (COMSEC) publications for the current generation of DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) and for current generation of weapon systems.  DoD EKMS replaced the previous manual distribution and management system providing cryptographic keying material for U.S. DoD Information Assurance. Information Assurance emphasizes confidentiality, access control, multi-level secure databases, trusted computing and information integrity. DoD EKMS has a three-tier hierarchical structure. This tiered structure provides capability to distribute, manage and account for COMSEC keying material. Tier 1 installations comprise the key material general and control capability. Tier 2 installations comprise the local distribution network (COMSEC accounts) and Tier 3 is where keying material is transferred from the EKMS infrastructure to the consumers End Cryptographic Units (ECUs).\n\nEKMS improved protection of national security-related information by substantially enhancing confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation characteristics over the legacy manual key management systems. EKMS has and continues to greatly accelerate availability of crypto key materials through electronic transmission through Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) versus the manual handling and shipping of materials. While the current EKMS level-of-effort is directed at enhancing current and developing systems, the ultimate goal is for it to seamlessly transition to the net-centric DoD Key Management Infrastructure (KMI), currently scheduled to begin in FY2012. The AFEKMS Program continues to provide software development to support emerging requirements during the KMI transition period. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.\n\nNOTE:  Software development (e.g., Data Management Device - DMD, Common User Application Software - CUAS, and Simple Key Loader - SKL) is rolled up into Tier 2\/Tier 3 Development. Software upgrades can be bundled and tracked as a unit, thereby allowing less management overhead and more focus on configuration management and control."

                            "val": "The Cryptographic Modernization Program modernizes cryptographic devices protecting critical information across the cyber domain operations and national security. In September 2000, the Defense Review Board (DRB) tasked National Security Agency (NSA) to evaluate the security posture of the cryptographic inventory. Systems with aging algorithms, those approaching non-sustainability, and those generally incompatible with modern key management systems were identified. Priority systems that required immediate replacement were also identified. In addition, NSA documented the need to modernize the cryptographic inventory with capabilities designed to enable network-centric operations. Replacements\/Modernization of the near term vulnerable systems must occur within the timeframe specified in Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Notice (CJCSN) 6510. The DoD Cryptographic Modernization Program was established to develop a modern cryptographic base that provides assured security robustness, interoperability, advanced algorithms, releasability, programmability, and compatibility with the future Key Management Infrastructure (KMI).  The program supports an integrated effort across the cyber domain to transform  to next generation cryptographic capabilities providing U.S. forces and multinational and interagency partners the security needed to protect the flow and exchange of operational decision making information in accordance with national and international policy\/standards, the validated operational requirements of the warfighters, and the Intelligence Communities.\n\nThe Cryptographic Modernization Program is a collection of projects accomplished in three phases: replacement, modernization, and transformation. The replacement phase of the program focused on updating and\/or replacing out-of-date algorithms along with unsustainable cryptographic products. The modernization phase provides crypto devices with common solutions that are more robust, modular, scalable, and provide the durability to existing cryptographic end items, as well as updating mid-term aging\/unsupportable crypto equipment. Manpower and logistics requirements will be reduced and manpower efficiencies gained, while incremental capability enhancements and footprint reduction are provided. The third phase of the Cryptographic Modernization Program, transformation, provides common joint solutions which enable secure transparent network-centric capabilities across the cyber domain. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

(The National Security Agency [NSA] acts as the Executive Agency for the DoD KMI Program.) AF KMI, in concert with this overarching DoD KMI Program, will provide a secure and flexible capability for the electronic generation, distribution, accounting, and management of key material and other communications security (COMSEC) materials for all DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) and for the Services' weapon systems. KMI represents a broad-scale replacement of the current Electronic Key Management System (EKMS). The new KMI will provide capabilities that will allow networked operation in consonance with the Global Information Grid (GIG) and other DoD, fellow Service, and AF enterprise objectives. It thereby will assure a viable support infrastructure for future weapons and C4I programs to incorporate key management into their system designs.\n\nThe DoD KMI will greatly improve protection of national, security-related information by substantially enhancing confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation characteristics over the legacy Electronic Key Management System. KMI will greatly accelerate the availability of crypto key materials through electronic transmission versus shipping of materials, will enhance mission responsiveness and flexibility, and will eventually take the man \"out-of-the-loop\" in the distribution of crypto key materials.\n\nThe AF KMI Program in concert with the DoD KMI Program is transitioning the Air Force from the legacy EKMS to modern DoD KMI and building the AF KMI Last Mile architecture.  This R&D effort includes system engineering and testing to successfully accomplish the transition and defining of the AF KMI Last Mile architecture. AF KMI Transition is supporting the DoD KMI program as it progresses through the development, testing, and production and fielding phase of the DoD KMI Program. AF KMI efforts includes the transitioning of existing key management capabilities to KMI.  The AF KMI Last Mile program is a holistic solution integrating the legacy and new and evolving cryptographic programs, materials, products, sources and consumers. The AF KMI Last Mile capabilities include distribution, management, and load of cryptographic materials from the KMI (COMSEC account) to the End Crypto Units (ECUs). It builds the linkage interfaces that will allow KMI systems to communicate and integrates other related developments to meet operational needs. AF KMI Last Mile is currently performing early system engineering and risk reduction activities supporting those capabilities including analysis of existing equipment and developing technologies, concept refinement studies, and prototyping of existing technologies. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. \n\nIn parallel with AFKMI, DoD and the Services are developing a new generation of End Crypto Units (ECUs) under the Joint Crypto Modernization Initiative that will be capable of direct interaction with the KMI. (PE0303140F, BPAC 675100, Cryptographic Modernization, supports this initiative). In some cases these new ECUs, although needing to be supported by KMI, will not be KMI network-connected. \"Last mile\" transport of black (aka benign, or encrypted) and red (unencrypted) keying material from a KMI client to a new generation ECU or current legacy ECU will need to be handled in the early years by one of two data transfer devices.   \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyber operations; computer and network systems security; damage assessment and recovery; cyber threat recognition, attribution, and mitigation; and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment.  These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development in the areas of: cyberspace surveillance; cyber indications and warning (CI&W); high-speed and host-based network intrusion detection; fusion and correlation of cyber intelligence; decision support; recovery; digital forensics; active response, etc.  Current Air Force systems, such as the Combat Information Transport System\/Base Information Protection (CITS\/BIP) leverage this technology to meet their information assurance needs\/requirements.  Additionally, this program utilizes IA and cyber technology investments by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force IA and cyber requirements.  \n\nThis program coordinates and cooperates with 24th AF (AF component to Cyber Command (CYBERCOM)), Joint Task Force - Global Network Operation (JTF-GNO), Strategic Command (STRATCOM), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA) and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) IA requirements are being met.  Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber technology into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, these budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
