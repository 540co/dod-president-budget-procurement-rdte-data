Due to the rapid advances in electronic attack technology, the EC-130H COMPASS CALL was designed to be easily modified and must continue to modernize and evolve to keep pace with adversary tactics and emerging technologies.  Continuous system development is required to maintain battlespace superiority.  \n\nThe EC-130H COMPASS CALL program employs an incremental development and fielding strategy IAW AFPD 63-1 that puts capability into the warfighters hands as soon as practical and ensures each iteration of the weapon system is effective against the highest priority threats.  To sustain that process requires a steady stream of system development funds.  Development funds are required to accomplish subsystem additions and improvements such as the digital signal analysis and exciter subsystem (AXE), the Special Purpose Emitter Array (SPEAR), Integrated Modern Communication Receiver, the Human-to-Machine Interface (HMI), network centric operations, phased array transmit and receive apertures and other classified hardware and software developments necessary to counter military and commercial communications evolutions, command and control operations enhancements, and new\/emerging sensor developments.  Funding in FY13 is required to support RDT&E efforts for Baseline 3 (BL3) upgrades to the EC-130H COMPASS CALL fleet.  The BL2 and BL3 programmed requirements have advanced significantly over the two previously fielded baselines.  BL2 and BL3 upgrades will help cover the electronic attack shortfall in the coming years.  Obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) are addressed with each baseline upgrade as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.  \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

Continuous system development is required to maintain battlespace superiority.  \n\nThe EC-130H COMPASS CALL program employs an incremental development and fielding strategy IAW AFPD 63-1 that puts capability into the warfighters hands as soon as practical and ensures each iteration of the weapon system is effective against the highest priority threats.  To sustain that process requires a steady stream of system development funds.  Development funds are required to accomplish subsystem additions and improvements such as the digital signal analysis and exciter subsystem (AXE), the Special Purpose Emitter Array (SPEAR), Integrated Modern Communication Receiver, the Human-to-Machine Interface (HMI), network centric operations, phased array transmit and receive apertures and other classified hardware and software developments necessary to counter military and commercial communications evolutions, command and control operations enhancements, and new\/emerging sensor developments.  Funding in FY13 is required to support RDT&E efforts for Baseline 3 (BL3) upgrades to the EC-130H COMPASS CALL fleet.  The BL2 and BL3 programmed requirements have advanced significantly over the two previously fielded baselines.  BL2 and BL3 upgrades will help cover the electronic attack shortfall in the coming years.  Obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) are addressed with each baseline upgrade as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.  \n\nActivities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
