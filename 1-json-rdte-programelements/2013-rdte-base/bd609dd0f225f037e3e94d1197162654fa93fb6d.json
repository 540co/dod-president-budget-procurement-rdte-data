This system will create centralized storage and access between Headquarters and its five subordinate laboratories.  MeRITS is an integral part of an overall USAMRMC effort to enhance its laboratories performance, efficiency, and accountability and will be completed in FY11 with sustainment starting in late FY 2012."
