Commercial technologies are continuously investigated and leveraged where possible. Project 779 researches and develops C2 software, algorithms, protocols and devices that enable management of information across the tactical and strategic battle space; provides automated cognitive reasoning and decision making aids; and allows timely distribution, presentation\/display and use of C2 data on Army platforms. Project H92 supports research in communications components, software, algorithms and protocols which potentially allow field commanders to communicate on-the-move to\/from virtually any location, through a seamless, secure, self-organizing, self-healing network.\n\nWork in this PE is complimentary of PE 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), PE 0603008A (Electronic Warfare Advanced Technology), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology), and is fully coordinated with PE 0602120A, (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602783A (Computer and Software Technology), and PE 0602874A (Advanced Concepts and Simulation).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communications -Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD."
