The heavy use of test resources by all Services demonstrates the importance of these assets. The Navy has been very successful in executing all of its major programs, and to date has had no major technical problems.\n\nThe Electronic Warfare Environment Simulation project is unique because it is the only program within the Department of Defense which develops and provides Naval anti-air warfare threat assets for Test and Evaluation (T&E).\n\nThis project directly supports the T&E resource requirements for all Naval Air EW development programs, to include multi-spectral situational awareness and countermeasures. Programs in development and future programs include: Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile, ALR-67  (v) 3, Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures Suite ALQ-214, the AAR-47 (v) 3, AVR-2, Advanced 6\" Expendable, Advanced Strategic Tactical Expendable, ALQ-144A, Joint and Allied Threat Awareness System, Joint Strike Fighter, EA-18G, LR700, Low Band Transmitter, P-8A, and the Next Generation Jammer.\n\nThis project provides for the development of an Integrated Air Defense T&E capability to be fielded at each of the three sites comprising the Navy's Tri-Center complex: Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake and Point Mugu in CA, and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD."

The project primarily supports the introduction of modern, effective shipboard and offboard EW systems, and tactics for the Surface Navy.  The heavy use of ENEWS resources by Naval Sea Systems Command, Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) Force, Special Operations, and other EW Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (T&E) agencies speaks to the overall importance of this project.  The project provides support for EW system design Engineering Test (ET), Development Test (DT), Operational Test (OT), and the development of utilization tactics.  Its quick reaction capabilities have had great impact on crisis situations such as the Lebanon and Libyan crises, Iran Harpoon threat, Persian Gulf crisis, and Operation Desert Shield\/Storm.  Simulation Display is another ENEWS modeling tool that was developed to support T&E.  The display has been adopted by most Department of Defense (DoD) T&E and training ranges to provide visualization of T&E and training scenarios.  The primary threat to surface ships is Anti-Ship Capable Missile systems.  The ENEWS Project is unique in that it is the only project within DoD dedicated to developing and providing realistic Anti-Ship Capable Missile assets to test and evaluate the effectiveness of shipboard EW systems and tactics against these type threats.  The ENEWS Project is a critical part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Master Plan.  This plan employs many of the ENEWS assets for planning, analysis, testing, and verification of shipboard and offboard EW systems techniques and tactics.  As part of its normal activities, ENEWS provides Development Test and Evaluation (DT&E), OT&E, and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E) support to the surface Navy for all ship classes.  DT, OT and FOT&E support includes AN\/SLQ-32 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), R17.OX NULKA, Rapid Anti-ship Integrated Defense System, all MK245 Giant tests, advanced InfraRed (IR) decoys, decoy placement, ship IR signature and radar cross section measurement of DDG-51, LPD-17, DD-21 and PC class ships, High Power Microwave program, and other ship self-defense initiatives, including T&E of Future Naval Capability process.  In addition, ENEWS assets are regularly employed to test the effectiveness of North Atlantic Treaty Organization ships' EW systems in joint allied exercises. ENEWS assets also support Joint EW exercises that are conducted with Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) nations."
