            "val": "The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) was created by Congress in 1983.  The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&E of the program is complete.  DOT&E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&E's oversight authority include: \n\n-\tThe approval of component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS).\n-\tThe approval of component OT&E Test Plans (TPs).\n-\tOversight of Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.\n-\tReporting results of OT&E that supports BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.\n\nDOT&E also oversees and resources OT&E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report. \n\nThis Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support in performing the described tasks, travel funds to carry out oversight of the OT&E program, funds for Service teams performing information assurance and interoperability assessments during exercises, and contractor support related to the conduct of operational test and evaluation and exercise assessments."

Warfighter responses to computer network attack (ability to protect, detect, react, and restore) were captured in all IA assessments and several included the portrayal of advanced cyber threats.  A more rigorous process, including expanded research requirements and linkage to mission threads, was instituted for IOP assessments.  Fiscal year 2012 IA and IOP evaluations included trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across CCMDs.  Critical findings were transmitted to Service and DoD leadership for their awareness and remediation actions, as appropriate.  DOT&E initiated efforts to support implementation on the CJCS EXORD as part of the assessment planning process, including development of threat assessments of the advanced cyber adversary and alignment Red Teams with these threat assessments.  A DOT&E issue paper to the FY13 program review resulted in additional funds for enhanced threat assessments and Red Team portrayal (FY13-FY17).

Funding for FY 2014 will provide Operational Test and Evaluation inputs for Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Operational Assessment Reports, and Defense Acquisition Executive Summary Reports for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&E and OUSD(AT&L).  Key elements of DOT&E oversight authority are identified in Calendar Year 2014 Office of the Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List.  \n\nInformation Assurance (IA) and Interoperability (IOP) Evaluations\n\nDOT&E will oversee and resource approximately 15 CCMD level IA and IOP assessments in FY 2014.  Full assessment of warfighter responses to computer network attack (ability to protect, detect, react, and restore) will be captured in all IA events.  Portrayal of advanced-cyber threats will be part of all assessments.  In accordance with the CJCS Red Team EXORD, and assessments will focus on the accomplishment of critical operational mission in representative threat environments consistent with the scope and purpose of the specific exercise.  In partnership with US Cyber Command, DoD Red Team capabilities will be enhanced to reflect DIA cyber threat assessments, and application of these teams will be synchronized across Cyber Command and DOT&E priorities.  Assessment support to units deploying to theaters of operation will continue as needed.  Fiscal year 2014 IA and IOP evaluations will include trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across CCMDs.  Critical findings will be transmitted to Service and DoD leadership for their awareness and remediation actions, as appropriate.  The Joint Information Operations Range and other cyber range assets with Red Teams portraying advanced cyber adversaries will support the majority of CCMD exercises for added threat realism and required security."
