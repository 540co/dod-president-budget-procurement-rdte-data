            "val": "The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan, approved by the S&T Corporate Board (Sep 2011).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThe Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research Program addresses technology needs associated with Naval platforms for new capabilities in EO\/IR Sensors, Surveillance, Electronic Warfare, Navigation, Solid State Electronics, Vacuum Electronics Power Amplifiers, and Nanoelectronics. The program supports development of technologies to enable capabilities in Missile Defense, Directed Energy, Platform Protection, Time Critical Strike, and Information Distribution. This program directly supports the Department of Defense Joint Warfighter Plan and the Defense Technology Area Plans. Activities and efforts within this Program have attributes that focus on enhancing the affordability of warfighting systems. The program also provides for technology efforts to maintain proactive connectivity and collaboration between Department of the Navy (DON) Science and Technology (S&T) and Joint, Navy, and Marine Corps commands worldwide.  \n\nAlso included in this PE is the Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signatures against Integrated Sensors (NEMESIS) Innovative Naval Prototype (INP).  NEMESIS technology addresses the need to generate the appearance of a realistic naval force to multiple adversarial surveillance and targeting sensors simultaneously. \n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

These Future Naval Capability (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (EC's) span across the Electronics, EW, Radar, Communications, and other technology areas supporting Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR).  This R2 activity also appears in PE 0603271N.  For Enabling Capabilities (EC) receiving funding from both PE's the PE 0602271N portion is generally focused on component design and development while the funding from PE 0603271N is focused on integration and demonstration.  \n\nThe specific objectives of the current EC's are:\n\na) Next Generation Airborne Electronic Attack: Develop and demonstrate advanced capability Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) sub-systems (e.g., broadband exciters, power amplifiers, and transmitter arrays) that provide Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD), deliver Non-Kinetic Fires, counter Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), and provide suppression of Command, Control & Communications (C3) links and data networks.\n\nb) Countermeasures Technologies for Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles (ASCM) and Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles (ASBM) Defense: Improve ship survivability by disrupting the terminal engagement phase of hostile anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles, including improvements to both onboard (Enhanced Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program,(SEWIP)) and offboard (Nulka) radio frequency (RF) Electronic Attack systems.\n\nc) Next Generation Countermeasure Technologies for Ship Missile Defense: Develop and demonstrate the fundamental technologies required to conduct next generation, persistent Electronic Warfare (EW) in support of ship, sea base, and littoral force missile defense operations in a distributed, coordinated manner across the entire battlespace.\n\nd) Long Range Detection and Tracking: Develop capability for simultaneous, full volume radar coverage of contacts at long ranges and in a dense contact environment.\n\ne) Affordable Electronically Scanned Array Technology for Next Generation Naval Platforms: Develop and demonstrate electronics components technologies using wide bandgap semiconductors, mixed signal analog and digital, RF, microwave, millimeter wave and associated passive components thus enabling high efficiency transmitter element chains for arrays.\n\nf) Affordable Common Radar Architecture (ACRA): Develop a common, affordable, scalable, open radar architecture that provides affordable capability improvements and addresses total ownership cost challenges for 5 different radars.\n\ng) SATCOM Vulnerability Mitigation: Develop technologies for mitigating SATCOM vulnerabilities using a wideband, airborne and air-to-surface infrastructure.  Technologies include approaches for development of ultra-low cost phased arrays and techniques for mitigating multi-path and scintillation issues on communications links.  Architecture and application development will include surface-to-air communications in the 14-17 gigahertz (GHz) band, and air-to-air communications in the millimeter wave bands.  Additionally, advanced techniques for the use of the ultra high frequency (UHF) spectrum will be developed, which include beam forming techniques and alternative waveform designs that are used to support high bandwidth infrastructure establishment and control.\n\nh) Radar Electronic Attack Protection (REAP): Develop single platform, precision, passive electronic support measure (ESM) and electronic protection (EP) techniques and technology to counter hostile use of modern electronic attack (EA) self protection jammers.\n\ni) Data Exfiltration Nanosatellite Innovative Space Enabler (DENISE)(formerly known as Global Applications for Data Exfiltration(GLADEX)): Develop a nano-sat satellite bus with all its requisite structural, power, thermal, control, and separation subsystems and a nano-satellite compatible payload and ground terminal for monitoring and relay of unattended sensor data for global situational awareness.\n\nj) Joint Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (JCREW) 3.3: Develop integrated RF communications and RF jammer capability that addresses the electromagnetic interference (EMI) issue to enable interoperability.\n\nk) Wide Area Surgical and Persistent Surveillance (WASPS) Capabilities For Tier 2\/3 UAVs:  Develop and integrate enhanced capability interactive autonomous, small, lightweight EO\/IR SAR, SIGINT sensors and integrate into an upgraded, smaller, lightweight, stabilized gimbal designed for 24\/7 persistent surveillance applications.\n\nl) Submarine Survivability-Electronic Warfare: Develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide submarines an EA capability against surveillance radar systems through EW payloads integrated with submarine masts, as well as networked offboard platforms.  These capabilities will improve the submarine's survivability in a hostile RF environment by providing a non-kinetic strike capability against enemy Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors\n\nDecrease in funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is due to transfer of FNC efforts addressed in this PE to a new PE titled Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research (PE 0602750N).  This is to enhance the visibility of the FNC Program by providing an easily navigable and consolidated overview of all 6.2 FNC investments in a single PE."

                                        "val": "The overarching objective of this activity is to develop higher performance components and subsystems for all classes of military RF systems that are based on solid state physics phenomena and are enabled by improved understanding of these phenomena, new circuit design concepts and devices, and improvements in the properties of electronic materials.  An important subclass are the very high frequency (VHF), ultra-high frequency (UHF), microwave (MW), and millimeter wave (MMW) power amplifiers for Navy all-weather radar, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic attack, communications, and smart weapon systems.  Another subclass are the analog and high speed, mixed signal components that connect the electromagnetic signal environment into and out of digitally realized, specific function systems.  These improved components are based on both silicon (Si) and compound semiconductors (especially the wide bandgap materials and narrow bandgap materials), low and high temperature superconductors, novel nanometer scale structures and materials.  Components addressed by this activity emphasize the MMW and submillimeter wave (SMMW) regions with an increasing emphasis on devices capable of operating in the range from 50 gigahertz (GHz) to 10 terahertz (THz).  The functionality of the technology developed cannot be obtained through Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, linearity, operational and instantaneous bandwidth, weight, and size.  Effort will involve understanding the properties of engineered semiconductors as they apply to quantum information science and technology. \n\nThis activity also includes Anti-Tamper development of innovative techniques and technologies to deter the reverse engineering and exploitation of our military's critical technology and critical program information in order to impede technology transfer and alteration of system capability and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems. The current specific objectives are:\n\na) Solid State Transistors and Devices: Develop solid state transistors and devices for high frequency analog and digital operation.\n\nb) High Efficiency, Highly Linear Amplifiers: Develop high efficiency, highly linear amplifiers for microwave, millimeter-wave, low-noise, and power applications.\n\nc) Superconducting Electronics: Develop components for RF systems utilizing superconducting and other technologies which are designed to deliver software defined, wide band, many simultaneous signal functionality over a wide range of frequencies, in increasingly field-ready packaging and demonstrate the ability of these components to be combined into chains to deliver superior functionality in conventional system contexts, including, but not limited to, SATCOM, Electronic Warfare (EW), signal intelligence (SIGINT), and communications.\n\nd) Control, Reception, Transmission, and Processing of Signals: Develop electronics and photonics technology that provides for the control, reception, transmission and processing of signals.\n\ne) Novel Nanometer Scale Logic\/Memory Devices and Related Circuits and Architectures: Develop novel nanometer scale (feature size at or below 10nm) logic\/memory devices and related circuits and architectures to deliver ultra-low power, light weight and high performance computational capability for autonomous vehicles and individual warfighters.\n\nf) Anti-Tamper: Develope innovative techniques and technologies to deter the reverse engineering and exploitation of our military's critical technology and critical program information in order to impede technology transfer and alteration of system capability and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems. \n\nThe increase of funding from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to the progression of Anti-Tamper Technology research from Basic to Applied Research.  \n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."

The technology developed cannot, for the most part, be obtained through commercial off the shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, bandwidth, weight, and size.  Responding to strong interests from the various user communities, efforts are focused on the development of technologies for high-data-rate communications, electronic warfare and high-power radar applications at MMW and upper-MMW regime.  The emphasis is placed on achieving high power at high frequency in a compact form factor.  Technologies include utilization of spatially distributed electron beams in amplifiers, such as sheet electron beams and multiple-beams, and creation of simulation based design methodologies based on physics-based and geometry driven design codes.\n\nThe current specific objectives are:\n\na) High Power Millimeter and Upper Millimeter Wave Amplifiers: Develop science and technology for high power millimeter and upper millimeter wave amplifiers including high current density diamond cathodes, sheet and multiple electron beam formation and mode suppression techniques in overmoded structures.\n\nb) Lithographic Fabrication Techniques: Develop lithographic fabrication techniques for upper-millimeter wave amplifiers.\n\nc) Accurate and Computationally Effective Device-Specific Multi-Dimensional Models for Electron Beams: Develop accurate and computationally effective device-specific multi-dimensional models for electron beam generation, large-signal and stability analysis to simulate device performance and improve the device characteristics.\n\nThe following are non-inclusive examples of accomplishments and plans for projects funded in this activity."
