            "val": "This program funds the RAND Arroyo Center, the Department of the Army's Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) for studies and analysis.  The Arroyo Center draws its researchers from RAND's staff of nearly 700 professionals trained in a broad range of disciplines.  Most staff members work in RAND's principal locations-Santa Monica, California; Arlington, Virginia; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The RAND Arroyo Center provides for continuing analytical research across a broad spectrum of issues and concerns, grouped in four major research areas:  Strategy, Doctrine, and Resources; Military Logistics; Manpower and Training; and Force Development and Technology.  The RAND Arroyo Center research agenda is primarily focused on mid\/long-term concerns.  Results and analytical findings directly affect senior leadership deliberations on major issues.  Arroyo Center research is sponsored by the Chief of Staff, Vice Chief, the Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the Army; the Army Assistant Secretaries; and most of the Army's major commands.  The Arroyo Center is provided guidance from the Army through the Arroyo Center Policy Committee (ACPC), which is co-chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology).  The ACPC reviews, monitors, and approves the annual Arroyo Center research plan.  Each project requires General Officer (or SES equivalent) sponsorship and involvement on a continuing basis.  RAND Arroyo provides the Army with a unique multidisciplinary capability for independent analysis."
