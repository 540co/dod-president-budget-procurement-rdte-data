The SUGV provides an unmanned capability for those missions that are manpower intensive or high-risk such as Urban Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions in a MOUT environment, and investigating Improvised Explosive Devices and Chemical\/Toxic Materials reconnaissance missions without exposing soldiers directly to the hazard. The SUGV will be used to obtain information on situational awareness at the squad level.\n\nSUGV Planned Product Improvements (Increment 1 Follow on) designated as the XM1216E1:  The SUGV configuration for a competitive Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) moving to Full Rate Production (FRP) is based on the SUGV IBCT Capability Production Document Threshold Requirements. It will weigh 35 pounds and is capable of carrying up to 4 lbs of payload weight.  The SUGV will have the following capabilities: a hardened militarized Electro Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) sensor to meet stringent day & night detection of enemy personnel & systems, a National Security Agency (NSA) compliant radio from the Joint Tactical Radio System program, improved hand controller, the capability to provide grid location of the enemy, and the following capability to mount payloads: tether spooler; manipulator arm; Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) suite; and Embedded-Tactical Engagement Simulation System (E-TESS).\n\nThe POM\/BES 2014-2018 removed all funding for SUGV OPA and RDTE.  The Program Manager briefed the Army Acquisition Executive on 10 Aug 12 and 04 Oct 12 resulting in a decision that the Army would cease work on the SUGV RDTE program and close out all efforts by May 2013."

The competitive LRIP will utilize the Technical Data Package (TDP) procured under the EMD contract. The EMD effort will integrate and test SUGV product improvements that utilize a point-to-point datalink, provide increased Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability with the integrated militarized Electro Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) head, and also provide increased functionality in the form of a modular payload system that includes the fiber optic tether data link capability, manipulator arm, and Embedded-Tactical Engagement Simulation System (E-TESS). Conduct Contractor and Government testing on the seven SUGV Production prototypes to evaluate performance: environments, platform mobility, radio performance for latency and range, EO\/IR performance for personnel detection, payloads, shock\/vibration, Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM), Logistics and Training. Conduct LUT to assess operational utility and performance of the SUGV. The Informal Qualification Test and LUT testing will provide data to support the production decision that the fully integrated SUGV meets CPD requirements for mobility, payloads, EO\/IR detection and National Security Agency\/Information Assurance (NSA\/IAS) compliance. Develop and provide all documentation, technical manuals and training products to support logistics, supportability and training requirements required to field the SUGV."
