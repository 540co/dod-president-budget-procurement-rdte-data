            "val": "This PE focuses USAF efforts on long endurance platforms which allow days, months, or years of endurance, as well as their associated sensors and communications suites.  Efforts include, but are not limited to, optionally piloted airships, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) or more standard aircraft structures which could be flown as manned or unmanned. \n\nThe Integrated Sensor IS Structure (ISIS) project was planned to develop a radar which is fully integrated into a station-keeping, stratospheric airship. ISIS supports the nation's need for persistent wide-area surveillance, tracking, and engagement of time-critical air and ground targets. Automated surveillance and tracking includes air targets to the radar horizon of 600 km and all ground targets to a range of 300 km. The radar aperture is intended to provide track data directly to users in-theater. The objective system was planned to launch from CONUS locations with a multi-year operational life.\n\nThe Blue Devil Block 2 (BD2) project was an Air Force-led single ship technology and concept demonstration of multi-intelligence, cross-platform tipping and cueing of fused SIGINT, wide area and high-definition (HD) EO\/IR motion imagery on a persistent lighter-than-air (LTA) airship.  BD2 was intended to employ a payload integration infrastructure (PII) with a Command and Control (C2) and Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) Ground Station in mid FY 2012 through FY 2013.  The development effort was stopped in the 3rd Quarter of FY 2012 and all BD2 equipment was packed and shipped to the 645 AESG (BIG SAFARI) managed short term storage facility in Greenville, TX during the 4th Quarter of FY 2012. \n\nThe Medium Altitude Global ISR and Communications (MAGIC) project develops a multiple day, medium altitude ISR unmmanned aircraft system (UAS) to provide long endurance surveillance with a multiple sensor payload.  This concept was initiated by OSD\/DD&R as a Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) in the 3rd Quarter FY 2010 with a competition between five defense industry partners.  Aurora Flight Sciences' Orion remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) concept was chosen as the JCTD candidate by OSD\/DDR&E per the recommendation of the Combatant Commands.  The MAGIC\/Orion RPA initiative was subsequently released from the JCTD process and transitioned to the Air Force as the sponsor of this developmental initiative in the 3rd Quarter FY 2011.  The Air Force is scheduling the first flight series for Aurora Flight Sciences' Orion RPA, as a proof of concept for air worthiness; this flight test is projected to take place at NAWS China Lake, CA in the 3rd Quarter of FY 2013.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

BD2 was being developed to employ a payload integration infrastructure (PII) with a Command and Control (C2) and Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) Ground Station.  This effort would have directly supported multiple validated CENTCOM urgent operational needs, and contributed directly to force protection and counter Improvised Explosive Device (IED) missions for coalition Forces.  BD2 was a rapid acquisition technology demonstration that was initiated under an Army contract in the 1st Quarter of FY 2010.  \n\nThe BD2 project development was stopped by the Air Force, with concurrence from DEPSECDEF, in the 2nd Quarter of FY 2012 due to multiple technical challenges and the Air Force determination that the BD2 airship could not reliably be delivered and employed within acceptable cost, schedule and performance risks.  All previously planned efforts on this project were stopped after the release of a Congressional Defense Committees notification memo signed by the DEPSECDEF on 27 March 2012.  The BD2 assets developed and acquired to date, to include the government furnish equipment (GFE), have been packed and shipped to a short term facility in Greenville, TX managed by the 645 AESG (BIG SAFARI SPO).  Disposition of the BD2 stored assets and components will be made available to other projects, programs or initiatives; how, what, and when aspects have not been determined to date.     \n\nThis program was in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity included development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "The Medium Altitude Global ISR and Communications (MAGIC) project is an Air Force led technology and concept development to test the ability for a remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) to stay aloft in the medium altitude structure for a multiple day duration with a minimum of 1,000 pounds payload capacity of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance sensor sytems.  The MAGIC concept was initiated by OSD\/DDR&E in FY 2010 in response to five COCOMs ranking this type of initiative as the highest priority for a joint concept and tecnology demonstration (JCTD).   In FY 2011, the Air Force accepted this initiative as the sponsor and MAGIC was subsequently removed from consideration as a JCTD and transitioned into the Air Force as a developmental project.  \n\nData gathered from the development of the MAGIC project will support end-to-end long endurance ISR planning.  Persistent ISR supports both regular and irregular warfare.  The challenge to supporting regular and irregular warfare is the integration of legacy ISR architectures with emerging end-to-end infrastructures.  The MAGIC project will provide the USAF with  critically needed data regarding sensor and aircraft performance parameters at a multiple day duration at medium altitude flight.  This data will augment the Persistent ISR study completed by ACC and AFMC in 2nd Quarter FY 2011 and the AF\/A9 Endurance UAV study completed in 3rd Quarter of FY 2012.  This project is designed to address the requirement laid out in two separate joint urgent operational needs (JUON) for long dwell and persistent ISR.  The objectives laid out in the JCTD competition and selection is being honored by the Air Force which will test the MAGIC project on an RPA for a flight duration of five days (120 hours) with a minimum sensor payload of 1,000 pounds at 20,000 feet altitude.\n\nIn FY 2010, OSD\/DDR&E (now ASD\/R&E) provided $5M of initial funding to AFRL to initiate the MAGIC project.  In FY 2011, ASD\/R&E provided an additional $5M to keep the MAGIC project development moving forward.  The Air Force followed suit and provided $10M of FY 2011 below threshold reprogramming (BTR) to allow the Aurora Flight Sciences' RPA development team to set up an operational endurance engine bench test and software integrations lab in preparation for an inflight five-day duration demonstration of the Orion RPA at a later date.  \n\nThe last week of January 2012, Aurora Flight Science performed a 123 hour duration endurance engine bench test.  In December 2012, Aurora Flight Sciences assembled all the aircraft components of the Orion RPA at their Manassas, VA facility to begin a series of ground testing efforts in preparation for the first flight series of tests projected to be conducted at NAWS China Lake, CA in the 3rd Quarter of FY 2013.  As of February 2013, the majority of the electrical and avionics continuity checks to include multiple engine runs have been completed.  Slow speed taxi tests are the next milestone in their master schedule and they should commence and complete in March 2013.  First flight series testing is projected for 3rd and 4th Quarters of FY 2013 at NAWS China Lake, CA."

Current status of this initiative, contracted with Aurora Flight Sciences and their Orion RPA, are:  the completion of the studies analysis, development of a prototype air vehicle, bench testing of engines and other aircraft components, ground continuity testing of select avionics, flight controls, and engine components and slow speed ground taxi.  Next milestone for this initiative will be to determine airworthiness by flight testing the Orion RPA in a series of short duration flights in 3rd Quarter FY 2013.  Those results will determine if the Air Force continues this development effort to a follow-on 120-hour duration flight test demonstration projected for 2nd Quarter FY 2014.  Concurrent efforts will continue through FY 2013 between the Aurora Flight Sciences production and management teams and the BIG SAFARI SPO to identify best of bred sensor systems and the availability of government furnished equipment (GFE) to fulfill the proposed payload configurations for this developmental project."
