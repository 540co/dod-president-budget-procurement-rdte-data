Block 10 RDT&E funding was sent from USSOCOM to NAVAIRSYSCOM to be placed on contract with the V-22 prime contractor.  Block 10 capability is required for compliance with the Joint Operational Requirements Document and associated Milestone III Capabilities Production Document.  Block 20 and subsequent block upgrades are planned to follow the same acquisition strategy, with NAVAIRSYSCOM PMA-275 ensuring the integration of SOF-unique systems with the ongoing basic vehicle improvements supporting both the CV-22 and the Marine Corps MV-22."
