The development of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s \u201cForces for Unified Commands\u201d Memorandum Assignment Tables has historically been a labor intensive staffing process conducted annually.  The Automated GFM Toolset is the first downstream consumer of force structure data resident in the seven organization (org) servers that are made available by the GFM DI effort.  CIRT has streamlined force management, increased common understanding of force assignment, and supported timely force management decisions.  The objective is to automate the generation of the Global Force Management Implementation Guidance (GFMIG) and Forces For Unified Commands (Forces For) Assignment, Apportionment and Allocation tables.  These efforts will flatten, streamline, and automate the current process while providing high fidelity data and transparency and enhance Combatant Commander risk assessment to operational plans.  \n\nFailure to fund for this effort negatively impacts the ability of the Services, CCMDs, JS and OSD to efficiently manage force structure resources.  Without continued funding, the current FY13 Forces For staffing cycle will rely on manual, inefficient, less-timely spreadsheets to develop the Assignment and Apportionment Tables.  Additionally, this initially successful CIRT and AGT will fail and negatively impact the use of authoritative force structure data in GFM DI Next Steps."
