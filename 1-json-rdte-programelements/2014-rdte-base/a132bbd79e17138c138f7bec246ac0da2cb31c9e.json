            "val": "Replacement of the legacy KC-135 fleet will take place in three stages, known as the KC-X (now the KC-46), KC-Y, and the KC-Z.  The initial KC-46 increment will replace roughly a third of the current capability with the purchase of 179 aircraft.  The Air Force completed an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in Apr 2006 to determine the most appropriate strategy to recapitalize the aging fleet of KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft.  Based on this analysis, the Air Force concluded that a strategy of full and open competition to select a commercial derivative replacement tanker aircraft would result in a best value tanker contract.  To initiate the first phase of the KC-135 replacement, the KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010, and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010.  The KC-46 program held a Milestone B Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) from OSD AT&L on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 EMD contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft.  \n\nThe KC-46 will provide fuel to joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will also augment the airlift fleet with cargo, passenger and aeromedical evacuation capabilities.  The KC-46 will be able to operate in day\/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment, employment, sustainment and redeployment of U.S. joint, allied, and coalition forces.  The KC-46 will have communication, navigation and surveillance equipment for world-wide operations; will have the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; will have the capability to operate in low-to-medium threat areas and near-high threat areas with self-defense\/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and will have necessary battle space awareness to mitigate survivability threats.\n\nThe KC-46 development effort will also procure the necessary ground and flight test assets to support development\/operational test.  The program plans to procure four RDT&E aircraft for integration and demonstration of capability that will ultimately be operationally fielded after a successful operational test phase.  In addition, aircrew and maintenance training systems will be developed and procured using KC-46 funding.  The Aircrew Training System (ATS) entered source selection on 31 May 2012.  The Maintenance Training System (MTS) is scheduled to enter source selection in FY2014. A business case analysis will also be conducted to determine if the engines for the production aircraft will be government furnished or contractor furnished.  Initial training and sustainment efforts will be provided via Interim Contractor Support (ICS).  KC-46 funding will also support various studies and analyses including the five-nation Future Technology for Aerial Refueling (FTAR) project, and KC-Y\/KC-Z planning activities. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 05, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

The KC-46 program held a Milestone B Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) from OSD AT&L on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 EMD contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft.  \n\nThe KC-46 will provide fuel to joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will also augment the airlift fleet with cargo, passenger and aeromedical evacuation capabilities.  The KC-46 will be able to operate in day\/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment, employment, sustainment and redeployment of U.S. joint, allied, and coalition forces.  The KC-46 will have communication, navigation and surveillance equipment for world-wide operations; will have the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; will have the capability to operate in low-to-medium threat areas and near-high threat areas with self-defense\/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and will have necessary battle space awareness to mitigate survivability threats.\n\nThe KC-46 development effort will also procure the necessary ground and flight test assets to support development\/operational test.  The program plans to procure four RDT&E aircraft for integration and demonstration of capability that will ultimately be operationally fielded after a successful operational test phase.  In addition, aircrew and maintenance training systems will be developed and procured using KC-46 funding.  The Aircrew Training System (ATS) entered source selection on 31 May 2012.  The Maintenance Training System (MTS) is scheduled to enter source selection in FY2014. A business case analysis will also be conducted to determine if the engines for the production aircraft will be government furnished or contractor furnished.  Initial training and sustainment efforts will be provided via Interim Contractor Support (ICS).  KC-46 funding will also support various studies and analyses including the five-nation Future Technology for Aerial Refueling (FTAR) project, and KC-Y\/KC-Z planning activities. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 05, System Development and Demonstration (SDD) because it has passed Milestone B approval and is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."

                            "val": "The KC-46 Program acquisition strategy is to procure an existing commercial, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified aircraft modified to meet USAF requirements.  The KC-46 program released a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on 24 Feb 2010, and entered source selection on 9 Jul 2010.  The KC-46 program held a Milestone B Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) on 23 Feb 2011, received approval to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) from OSD AT&L on 24 Feb 2011, and awarded the KC-46 contract to Boeing on 24 Feb 2011 to develop and procure 179 KC-46 aircraft.  The KC-46 contract procurement was conducted via a full and open competition per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, and resulted in a FY 2011 EMD Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) contract.  The EMD phase will develop, build, and test four KC-46 aircraft, and will qualify receiver aircraft.  \n\nProduction will begin in FY 2015 with the first of two Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) lots (Firm Fixed Priced (FFP)) and then Full-Rate Production (FRP) options (FFP with Not to Exceed (NTE) + Economic Price Adjustment (EPA)).  The LRIP and FRP options will be exercised following successful completion of Operational Assessments (OAs) for the LRIP decisions, and a successful completion of Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) for the FRP decision.  \n\nThe Government plans to compete the development, deployment, and sustainment of both the aircrew and maintenance training systems separately.\n\nBased on the market research and a cost effectiveness analysis, the engines will be procured as contractor furnished equipment (CFE) for EMD.  Following EMD, the Government will assess the potential of breaking out the engines as a separate procurement based on an updated market analysis.  \n\nThe KC-46 Program is responsible for the development, testing, and production of a drogue-equipped, wing-mounted refueling system to meet Capability Development Document (CDD) thresholds and objectives, for simultaneous refueling of two probe-equipped receivers.  The system can be installed or removed from the KC-46 as mission needs dictate.\n  \nThe long-term support concept for the KC-46 is organic two-level maintenance (2LM):  organization level (O-level) and depot level (D-level).  For the purposes of this program, all maintenance other than O-level shall be referred to as D-level.  The product support strategy will use a Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) to provide interim support (Interim Contractor Support (ICS)), during the transition to a Government organically managed maintenance and supply support capability.  Performance Based Logistics (PBL) solutions will be evaluated during EMD as viable approaches to facilitate the transition.  \n\nThis acquisition strategy requires sufficient aircraft to be designed, tested, and delivered to meet a Required Assets Available (RAA) date of 78 months after contract award.  RAA is defined as 18 aircraft meeting final production configuration with all required training and support in place.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) will be attained when the Commander, Air Mobility Command (AMC\/CC) determines the unit is operationally war ready. AMC has not yet determined an IOC date.  Full Operational Capability (FOC) is expected approximately 24 months after IOC."
