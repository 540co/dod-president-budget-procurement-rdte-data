            "val": "This program supports the design, development, acquisition, integration and fielding of realistic mobile threat simulators and realistic threat simulation products utilized in Army training and developmental and operational tests.  While this project originally funded simulators representing Soviet equipment, the changing world order has expanded the scope of this program to address other world threats.  Army Threat Simulator and Threat Simulation products are utilized to populate test battlefields for U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), to conduct developmental and operational tests, and to support Program Executive Office (PEO) required user testing in System Integration Laboratories and hardware\/simulation in-the-loop facilities.  Army threat simulator and threat simulation products developed or fielded under this program support Army-wide, non-system specific threat product requirements. Each capability is pursued in concert and coordination with existing Army and tri-service capabilities to eliminate duplication of products and services, while providing the proper mix of resources needed to support Army testing and training. These battlefield simulators represent systems (e.g. missile systems, command, control and communications systems, electronic warfare systems, etc.) that are used to portray a realistic threat environment during testing of U.S. weapon systems. Simulator development is responsive to Office of the Secretary of Defense and General Accounting Office guidance for the Army to conduct operational testing in a realistic threat environment. Actual threat equipment is acquired when appropriate (in lieu of development) and total package fielding is still required (i.e., instrumentation, operations and maintenance, manuals, new equipment training, etc.). Threat simulator development is accomplished under the auspices of the Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, Threat Simulator Investment Working Group."

The TIEW ENV integrated Threat IO (Electronic Attack, Electronic Support, Computer Network Operations) models into the One Semi-Automated Force (OneSAF) baseline. The models' representative effects were also integrated through use with Communications Effects Servers. Integration of OneSAF with the Integrated Threat Force (ITF) enabled the Live and Constructive T&E environments to interface.  To date the program had completed numerous models to include Communications Jamming (simulates frequencies, ranges, spot, barrage, and other behaviors); Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) Jamming (can jam GPS frequencies in variety of ways by adjusting the parameters and can emulate real GPS jammers); GPS Repeater Jammer (offset GPS signals so as to provide false location reports.  Had several adjustable behavioral parameters); Spoofer Jammer (offsets GPS signals so as to provide false location reports with several adjustable behavioral parameters); and Signal Intelligence\/Direction Finding (SIGINT\/DF) (detector models that work with each other to triangulate and then report on emissions of various frequencies and was parameter adjustable).  The program continued to develop the Computer Network Operations (CNO) cyber model which build CNO entities (hacker entities, systems, networks, etc.) that can be attacked, defended, and exploited (Disruption, Delay, Denial of Service, Destruction, and Injection) as well as allowed live attacks to interact with the constructive environment for large enterprise asset emulation cyber attacks, all within OneSAF.  The program also began the development of the Threat Cellular Network Model (TCNM) which was building the threat cellular and landline interfaces needed to emulate the communications systems often found in theater as used by enemy combatants.  The TIEW ENV program also integrated the capability to communicate, via the ITF, with live assets including the CICADA jammer, Threat Signal Injection Jammers (TSIJ), Wideband Configurable Controlled Jammer (WCCJ) and the Networked Electronic Support Threat Sensors (NESTS)."

The program establishes analytical services needed to identify and correlate data of historical and real time malicious activity within the Army Land Warrior Network (LWN) and external to the DoD.  This program also establishes services and near real-time processing of information needed to develop threat targeting packages that accurately profile the cyber enemy, types of systems they attack, frequency of attacks, their intent, doctrine, training, techniques, tools and operational tactics.
