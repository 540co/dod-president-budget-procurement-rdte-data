The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning and targeting capability.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, and the Defense Information & Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed and Mobile configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced capabilities are developed and tested, annual software releases are integrated into Army Common\/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process.\n\nThe Army Acquisition Executive designated to PEO IEW&S and DCGS-A as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead.  As such, DCGS-A is defining the architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3\/5\/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments.\n\nDCGS-A consolidates, enhances, and modernizes the Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TPED) capabilities formerly found in nine Army intelligence programs of record and two Quick Reaction Capabilities.  DCGS-A provides these technologically advanced PED capabilities in tailored and scalable mobile and fixed configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  The program also will develop software packages to be embedded in mission command and other select systems to provide required ISR\/analytic capabilities.  DCGS-A is a key component of the DoD ISR Task Force modernization efforts and a critical Army priority.\n\nDCGS-A software will be tailored by echelon and scalable to each unit's mission.  DCGS-A provides commanders and staffs the ability to maintain an accurate and up to date understanding of the operational environment.  DCGS-A's contributions to commanders' visualization and situational awareness, rapid planning, and the synchronization of all warfighting functions, enable Army units to operate within the enemy's decision cycle.  This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from humanitarian to major combat operations.\n\nThe DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a Cloud Processing Architecture.  Main Cloud nodes are placed in data centers strategically located across the globe, while tactical edge Cloud nodes will be integrated within select existing equipment currently on units' Modified Tables of Organization & Equipment (MTOE).  The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment\/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers, where the data is stored.  This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems.  The first DCGS-A Cloud node reached its initial operating capability in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in FY11.  Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12\/Full Deployment Decision in 1QFY13, DCGS-A Increment 1 Release 1 Software Baseline capability will be deployed throughout the Army.\n\nFY14 Base funding in the amount of $27.622 million will be used for the development and testing of the DCGS-A Increment 1 Software Releases as well as the continued development and testing of the of the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) as it fits into the Army's overarching Common Operating Environment (COE) construct.

                            "val": "The Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) program was created in response to the Department of Defense (DoD) Distributed Common Ground\/Surface System (DCGS) Mission Area Initial Capabilities Document (MA ICD) dated 13 Aug 2004, which captured the overarching requirements for an Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Family of Systems (FoS) that will contribute to Joint and combined Warfighter needs. That ICD was updated as the Distributed Common Ground\/Surface System (DCG\/SS) Enterprise ICD, and approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 27 Feb 2009. The Army requirements were refined in the DCGS-A Capabilities Development Document (CDD), and approved by the JROC 31 Oct 2005. The DCGS-A program is currently in the Production and Deployment phase and was designated as a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) in OSD (AT&L) Memorandum, 29 Mar 2010. \n\nDCGS-A is following an evolutionary acquisition approach to develop and field system capabilities over time to satisfy the requirements of the DCGS-A Capability Development Document (CDD). Following this approach, the first increment was defined and a Capability Production Document (CPD) was created with full consideration of all of the preceding supporting documents and analysis. As part of its initial staffing, a Cost Benefit Analysis was completed in support of the DCGS-A CPD. This analysis projected a significant cost avoidance\/savings over the life cycle by not limiting the hardware configuration to a one size fits all unit types design but rather integrating the DCGS-A SW capabilities into common servers and other IT components fielded at that echelon. This approach was included in the CPD and updated DCGS-A Acquisition Strategy. The CPD was approved by the JROC on 20 Dec 2011.\n\nThe DCGS-A System Engineering Plan (SEP) updated the current development plan and was approved by OASD (R&E) on 5 Dec 2011. The DCGS-A Revised Acquisition Strategy (AS) was approved by the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) on 21 Mar 2012. The DCGS-A Acquisition Program Baseline was approved on 29 Mar 12. The DCGS-A program received a milestone C decision on 29 Feb 2012 and an operational test was completed in Jun 2012. A successful Full Deployment Decision (FDD) for Release 1 Initial Minimum Capability was obtained December 2012.  \n\nPM DCGS-A has been designated as the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) Lead for PEO IEW&S. As such, DCGS-A is currently aligning it's architecture to fit within the Common Operating Environment (COE) as described by the ASA(ALT) COE Implementation Plan. This alignment is in accordance with the G-3\/5\/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements, and enhancements under one COE and one vision. Our acquisition strategy supports this initiative as we continue to collapse PORs and reduce footprint following our capability migration path and iterative development of software releases which continue to increase capabilities to satisfy the remaining CPD requirements beyond Initial Minimal Capability. As DCGS-A continues the path through Increment 1 and beyond, each release will focus on the COE and continually align the Command Post activities with DCGS-A Cloud and POR migration activities.  The program office expects to continue as the DCGS-A System Integrator for software development and hardware integration, and will continue to access multiple vendors by leveraging a variety of competitively awarded contracts."

DCGS-A enables the commander to achieve situational understanding by leveraging multiple sources of data, information, and intelligence to synchronize the elements of Joint and Combined Arms combat power (maneuver, maneuver support and maneuver sustainment support).  The core functions of DCGS-A are: collection and processing of space, airborne, ground and maritime Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor data; control of select Army and joint ISR sensor systems; intelligence synchronization; ISR planning, reconnaissance and surveillance (R&S) integration; fusion of sensor information, and direction and distribution\/dissemination of sensor information.  It draws information from a wide variety of automated and manual sources; on-board sensors, space platforms, unattended air and ground vehicles, existing and new ISR capabilities, and an assortment of databases to enable the land component commander to execute battle command, synchronize fires and effects, rapidly shift battle focus, achieve situational understanding, protect the force, and employ his forces more effectively.  DCGS-A allows commanders at all levels to visualize and understand the threat and environment, predict threat intentions, execute targeting through targeting support, conduct ISR integration and support Information Operations.\n\nThis project provides for the design, development, integration and test of the DCGS-A system of systems at all echelons, from embedded DCGS-A up to Fixed Site operations.  The effort includes system engineering, software integration and development, test & evaluation, and use of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) to develop DCGS-A Mobile systems with common multi-function hardware and software combinations (i.e. user workstations) capable of performing all DCGS-A functions.  Development will focus on common module hardware and software that is scaleable to allow commanders increased flexibility in the intelligence force package deployed such that it can be tailored to the echelon, location, and mission that DCGS-A will be required to support.  Included in the development will be the stand-up of a Federated Systems Integration Lab (SIL) to assess and implement existing and new candidate software applications and components into the DCGS-A baseline design.  A common set of ISR Analysis Tools to support collaboration, exploitation, fusion and collection management will be developed that operate within the construct of distributed, reach operations within the DCGS-A enterprise in order to maximize data access and minimize forward footprint.  This will ultimately result in a DCGS-A design that reduces physical and logistics footprint, eases training burden, and decreases sustainability requirements.\n\nFY09 funds development of Technology Insertion modules providing DCGS-A capabilities into Current Force systems, common module multi-function hardware, Battle Command interoperability and integration and test of new software applications. \n \nFunding for this effort continues under Project 956 beginning in FY 2010."
