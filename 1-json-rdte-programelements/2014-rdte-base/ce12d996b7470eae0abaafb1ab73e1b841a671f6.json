The export control program provides an ongoing assessment and analysis of global goods and technologies.  Determines significant advances in the development, production, and use of military capabilities by potential adversaries.  Determines goods and technologies being developed worldwide with potential to significantly enhance or degrade U.S. military capabilities in the future.  Identified in the Export Administration Act of 1979 and extended by Presidential Executive Order to review militarily critical goods and technologies and to consider worldwide technology capabilities.  The Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL) is a congressionally mandated source document for identification of leading edge and current technologies monitored worldwide for national security, nonproliferation control of weapons of mass destruction, and advanced conventional weapons.\n\nSpecific activities include:\n- Develop and publish in electronic form (including Internet version) restricted editions of the MCTL document that describe the military and proliferation significance of various technologies.\n- Monitor and assess dual-use and military technologies worldwide.\n- Assist in the development of proposals for negotiation in various multilateral export control regimes.\n- Limited worldwide technology capability assessments for the MCTL and other U.S. international critical technologies efforts.\n- Identification and determination of technical parameters for proposals for international control of weapons of mass destruction.\n- Identification of foreign technologies of interest to the DoD and opportunities for international cooperative research and development.\n\n(2) The DoD Damage Assessment Management Office (DAMO) Program:\nThe Defense Industrial Base (DIB) secures critical DoD programs and technology by protecting DoD unclassified information resident on and transiting DIB unclassified networks.  This project further establishes the DoD DAMO to coordinate the conduct of assessments involving the loss of DoD information requiring controls resulting from the unauthorized access and\/or exfiltration of technical data maintained on unclassified DIB networks.  The DAMO identifies and categorizes the impact of the loss of acquisition information contained on the affected systems, organizes, and coordinates the assessment reports with all affected components and DIB members, and establishes a process to appropriately share collected information with all affected parties.  The DAMO establishes policy and procedures for conducting damage assessments applicable to all DoD components and in concert with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (DFAR) procedures pertaining to contracts with the DIB.\n\nSpecific activities include:\n- Provide technical expertise and analyses in assessing the impact of data lost as a result of the unauthorized access and\/or exfiltration. \n- Develop a damage assessment ontology and data repository in order to provide analysis to identify trends in the targeting and compromise of defense program information."
