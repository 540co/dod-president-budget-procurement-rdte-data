This PE provides combat effectiveness and Operating and Support (O&S) cost reduction enhancements for the Abrams tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles through a series of product improvements.\n\nThe strategy for Abrams and Bradley will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future.  This effort was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY 2011.  \n\nThe Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 and M2\/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles are at or exceeds Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations.  In order to host and restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle programs will execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record.  The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams and Bradley Platforms.\n\nThe Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is a materiel solution to support the Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) across the Spectrum of Conflict by replacing five mission roles currently performed by the M113 Family of Vehicles (FOV) and integrating the current M113 FOV Mission Equipment Package (MEP) to a modified existing vehicle platform.\nThe Armored Multi Purpose Vehicle Program is submitted under Program Element 0605028A, Project EB5 for the FY 2014 President's Budget."
