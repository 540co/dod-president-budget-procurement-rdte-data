DACP funds the test and evaluation of technologies and products with potential to improve performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of current acquisition programs at the subcomponent, component, or system level.\n \nSince the program inception in FY 2003, Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) has initiated 176 projects; 117 projects have been completed to date; 83 met Service or Agency testing requirements, and 61 led to procurements with technology currently in use by our warfighters in Iraq, Afghanistan, or at U.S. training facilities.  Given the program tests developed equipment, Service and United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) program managers report that the average Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) and Operations and Support (O&S) non-recurring cost avoidance is at least 5-to-1.\n\nThe DACP provides the DoD an efficiency that is not generally recognized.  With centralized DACP funding in OSD, funding can be readily moved among the Services and USSOCOM to take advantage of emerging opportunities and fund joint projects.\n\nDACP increases opportunities for domestic vendors to enter the DoD acquisition process.  Although business size is not an evaluation criterion, approximately 60 percent of the projects awarded are with technology providers at the small or mid-sized enterprise level.  DACP has the additional DoD\/National Security benefit of expanding the industrial base for Defense acquisition."

From program inception in 2003 until 2012, the Office of Secretary of Defense has initiated 176 projects; 117 projects have been completed to date; 74 met Service or Agency testing requirements and 61 led to procurements with technology currently in use by our war-fighters in Iraq, Afghanistan, or at U.S. training facilities.  The FY 2012 DACP projects have a transition rate of approximately 83 percent for completed projects, exceeding the objective of 40 percent.
