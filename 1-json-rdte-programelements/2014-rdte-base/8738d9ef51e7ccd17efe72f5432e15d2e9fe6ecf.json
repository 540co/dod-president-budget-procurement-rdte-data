Insensitive Munitions (IM) is the Navy's focused effort on propellants, propulsion units, explosives, warheads, fuses and pyrotechnics to reduce the severity of cook-off and bullet\/fragment impact reactions, minimizing the probability for sympathetic detonation, both in normal storage and in use, increasing ship and platform survivability and satisfying performance and readiness requirements."

A joint service IM requirement has been developed and through the IM Strategic Planning process, all PEO's are implementing IM in their priority munitions. Insensitive munitions are identified as a DoD critical technology requirement and considered as part of a weapon design. The IMAD program matures the technology developed by a variety of Science and Technology (S&T) sources for program management integration into weapons systems to meet the IM technical deficiencies documented in the PEO IM Strategic Plans. IMAD provides the link between S&T programs and the PMs by optimizing IM technologies to meet Navy requirements.
