            "val": "Biometrics Enterprise is comprised of two parts:  Biometrics Identity Management Agency and the enterprise data repository called Biometrics Enabling Capability.\n  \nBiometrics Center of Excellence:  DoDD 8521.01E directs the BCoE to conduct biometrics S&T research and engineering for the DoD and other USG sponsors in support of the DoD S&T Roadmap. The BCoE will conduct biometrics test and evaluation activities to include standards conformance testing (which include evaluations and assessments of biometric-enabled IT devices and systems that interoperate with the authoritative biometric database); support DoD acquisition organizations in developmental testing, systems integration, and independent verification and validation; support operational test and evaluation activities that determine system operational effectiveness and suitability; and acquire and conduct COTS and GOTS testing to identify functionality, performance, and conformance to DoD standards.\n\nThe Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) is the Department of Defense's (DoD) authoritative biometric enterprise database repository. The current operational capability is the Next Generation Automated Biometrics Identification System (NG-ABIS aka DoD-ABIS); it will transition to the BEC Increment 0 Program of Record (POR) at the Full Deployment Decision (FDD). NG-ABIS receives multi-modal biometric submissions from collection devices allowing the Warfighter to distinguish friend from foe and enabling near real-time retention, capture or release decisions. The system has a direct impact on the availability of critical intelligence information that is of vital interest to DoD and other government agencies in efforts to capture, detain, question and deny access to known and emerging threats to our National Security. Latent fingerprint matching allows the Warfighter to accurately identify and detain those responsible for Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), weapons trafficking, and other terrorist attacks against US and partner nation's assets across the globe. NG-ABIS stores, processes, shares and matches four different biometric modalities (fingerprint, facial images, palm-prints and iris patterns) against over 9.5 million records as it searches for known and suspected terrorists, enemies and persons of interest. The system uses advanced algorithms to combine partial matches of multiple biometric modalities in order to increase the frequency of conclusive and automated matches; thereby, decreasing the amount of required manpower.\n\nBEC Increment 1 will build upon the success of NG-ABIS\/BEC Increment 0 and will include a web-based interface and cross-domain security capabilities across the SECRET and UNCLASSIFIED security domains. It will also build upon the current capability with increased matching throughput (number of records that can be processed within 24 hours), increased storage capacity and the ability to process bulk biometric submissions. BEC Inc 1 will have an automated, customizable Biometric Enabled Watch List (BEWL) that will be electronically input into the system and link an individual's record to the watchlist. This will facilitate on-demand access and development of watchlist data and provide match alerts to the collector through their collection system as well as to the intelligence community. This future system will also streamline interoperability and data sharing with government agencies and stakeholders including the Department of Justice (DOJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC), Department of State (DOS), United States Central Command (CENTCOM), United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and other DoD and Federal agencies as required and in accordance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 24\/National Security Presidential Directive 59.\n\nBEC Increment 1 is currently conducting Pre-Milestone B acquisition activities to support a Pre-EMD and Milestone B decision reviews planned for FY2014."

The approach begins with establishing the current quick reaction capability as BEC Increment 0 at a Full Deployment Decision.  On 13 May 2011, an ADM designated the Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) as the Full Deployment Decision (FDD) Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), as delegated by the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE).  The Capability Production Document that supports BEC Increment 0 was approved on 14 February 2012.  BEC Increment 0 is planned to be succeeded by BEC Increment 1, which will enter the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase of acquisition with Pre-EMD and Milestone B reviews planned for FY2014, based on a Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved CDD being approved in 2QFY2013.  BEC Increment 1 will provide new capability beyond the current Next Generation Automated Biometrics Identification System (NG-ABIS). PM DoD Biometrics is preparing a forward-looking Acquisition Strategy for the BEC Increment 1 Program that is compliant with the Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.0 process."
