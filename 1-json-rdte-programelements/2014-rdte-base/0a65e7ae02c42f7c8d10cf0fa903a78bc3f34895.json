Capabilities Production Document was approved 14 Mar 09.  To meet the required capability, evolutionary acquisition has been employed to implement the incremental approach outlined in the CPD.  The Gray Eagle UAS is being matured during the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase, which includes the development and integration of key components such as the Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL), Link-16, and integration of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), payloads, appropriate Common Aviation Ground Support Equipment and the One System GCS.  PM JAMS is developing the P+ model of the HELLFIRE missile and participating in the integration and test activities for the entire Gray Eagle system.  PM JAMS is budgeting for the procurement of missiles for the fielded systems.  PM Night Vision\/Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) under PEO Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Systems (IEWS) develops, manages, and competes in the POM and is responsible for meeting all ERMP costs associated for payloads, payload integration, and payload sustainment.  Field Tests at the Electronic Proving Grounds in Ft Huachuca, AZ, and integration tests at the Central Technical Support Facility in Ft Hood, TX, are examples of the tests planned to reduce risk in the SDD phase.\n\nFY2014 and beyond funding allows for the development and integration of Pre-Planned Product Improvements, such as interoperability compliance initiatives and a Universal Armament Interface, and Block upgrades.  These improvements will be implemented through a CPFF engineering services contract and\/or engineering change proposals with the Gray Eagle prime contractor."
