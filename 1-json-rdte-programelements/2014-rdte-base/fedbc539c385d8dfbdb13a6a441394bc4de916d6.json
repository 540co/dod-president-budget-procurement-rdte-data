            "val": "These programs support readiness of the joint force by creating a Joint Training Environment to replicate the complex and ever changing operational environment.   These investments support the Secretary of Defense\u2019s (SECDEF) Combatant Commanders Exercise Engagement and Training Transformation (CE2T2) initiative to enable and enhance Joint Warfighting readiness by training as we intend to fight. The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:\n\n- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)\n- Joint Simulation Systems (JSS)\n- Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC)\n- U.S. Forces Korea Training & Exercise Support (USFK)\n- Air Force JNTC\n- Navy JNTC\n\nJNTC:  The Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program adds joint\/integrated context to existing Service and Combatant Commander (COCOM) training programs. This is accomplished through integrated live, virtual, and constructive training environment and prepares units, and commanders for operations in joint\/integrated operational environments. JNTC can train against a general or mission focused threat; test doctrine, tactics, techniques, procedures, Joint Operational Concepts, and equipment. As the integrating environment, JNTC provides training to the full complement of defense, inter-agency and multi-national audiences. Active and reserve forces train in a realistic joint context with other Services and joint\/integrated battle staffs. Battle staffs from joint, component, and tactical headquarters train and rehearse using real-world command and control systems, with tactical forces represented through simulation support.\n\nJSS:  The Joint Simulation System provides the joint models and simulation enabling trained, capable, and interoperable Joint Forces.  \nThis effort provides warfighters with the joint simulation to keep pace with operational environment supporting the Joint Force 2020 and ensure the Joint Training Environment reacts to strategic guidance such as training in anti-access anti-denial environments.    \n\nJKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the DOD unique and authoritative source for online joint training.  They are tasked to develop a Joint Individual Training Toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products and services.  Products and services are developed in response to OSD(P&R) CE2T2 Program Goals & Objectives guidance, CJCS High Interest Training Items, Joint Staff J7 training priorities, and JKDDC Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) Stakeholder (CCMDs, Services, and Combat Support Agencies) prioritized training requirements.  JKDDC JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education and tailored common training standards to Service members for tasks that are jointly executed, resulting in trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JKDDC JKO technology initiatives principally include Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desk top modeling & simulation based training, OSD requested virtual worlds prototype, and mobile \u201cpilot\u201d courseware training devices.  These capabilities facilitate the training and preparation of tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to CCMD theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined\/Joint Task Force (C\/JTF) billets. Specifically, C\/JTF \u2018battle staffs\u2019 will be adequately trained, as individuals and the staffs collectively, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise. JKO mobile \u201cpilot\u201d courseware training device development facilitates the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms for joint warriors.  The future virtual worlds learning environment will provide training and learning to promote adaptability and agility in the workforce with the capability to tailor and adapt instructional material to fit the learner's strengths and weaknesses, learning style, and level of proficiency.\n      \nUSFK:  This program provides to Joint Training Environment to support the 2015 stand-up of KORCOM as a sub-unified command under PACOM.  This program is developing a Jointly Accredited and Supported Modeling & Simulation federation of constructive simulations capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations.  This simulation system is also interoperable with the Republic of Korea developed Korean Simulation System.  This solution will be capable of interoperating in a common battle space that realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences, tactical to strategic, in Korean theater exercises.  While supporting USFK\u2019s specific requirements, this solution will contain enhancements that will benefit all users of the JLVC.\n\nAir Force JNTC:  Supports the SECDEF's Transformation in Training\/Joint National Training Capability (JNTC).  Develops capabilities that integrate live, virtual, and constructive elements into a seamless joint training environment.  Using a scientific and phased approach and focusing on modeling air and space capabilities, researches new technologies and methods that provide a crucial technology-based foundation supporting all JNTC operations.\n\nNavy JNTC:  Supports SECDEF Transformation of DoD training and Joint National Training Capability.

Based on the FY11 success with VCAT South America training utility in the SOUTCHCOM AOR, SOUTHCOM required an enhanced training product focusing on 5 expanded mission scenarios, in the Andean Ridge geographic region, integrating Defense Language Institute (DLI) approved language training content, while simultaneously demonstrating an improved capability to deliver training via an innovative training technique on JKO.\n\u2022  Continued to operationalize JKO training simulation by developing SGST version 3, a small group training capability focused on improving the training readiness of individuals and small joint headquarters staffs.  Version 2 enhanced joint warrior provided recommendations from version 1, and targeted development of six additional SGST scenario use cases for representative JTF staffs, all designed to complement existing Combatant Command mission rehearsal exercises in preparation for deployment to their respective theaters of operation.  Version 3 increased training audience participant size to 40 concurrent players (vice current 8-10).  Additionally, users are now able to create their training scenarios more efficiently with minimal resources.  Thousands of joint, interagency, intergovernmental and multinational participants will be better trained as individuals and collectively as small teams prior to and during deployment in CCMD environments.\n\u2022  Developed mobile \u201cpilot\u201d training device capabilities based on JKO high payoff courseware. Completed courses include Cross Culture Competency Trainer, Virtual Cultural Awareness Trainer + Language Afghanistan, US Army\u2019s Headstart2 Language Training, US Forces Korea Theater Specific Training, US SOUTHCOM\u2019s Human Rights Awareness, & Operational Swahili training products.  These joint training courses will be playable from the JKO web-based desktop and from iOS and Android operating systems based portable, hand-help devices (phones and tablets)."

This ensures the Joint Force Trainer capabilities development effort synchronizes with warfighter requirements.  Performance metrics include, but are not limited to; time, money, realism, and fidelity as defined below:\n\n\u2022  Navy will produce one JSAF software release to include documentation; will design and implement upgrades to JSAF consistent with approved requirements and CRs and document the effects of JSAF capabilities (robustness) and stability.  Will design, implement, test, and integrate JSAF enhancements in accordance with requirements.\n\n\u2022  Navy will produce one Navy Training Federation Object Model (FOM) (NTF) release to include applicable documentation updates for the Guidance, Rational, and Interoperability Manual (GRIM) and Federation Agreement document (FAD). Will implement JSAF capability enhancements to support evolving joint and Coalition training requirements.\n\n\u2022  Navy will deliver a JSAF\/JNTC-JLVC FOM interoperability Guide.\n\n\u2022  Navy will facilitate integration by providing dedicated support to the effort, improving the quality of participation and documentation of Navy efforts in the JNTC.  Refine and mature the Navy Training Federation Object Model (NTF), it is improving interoperability and integration with other services and the Joint community.  Provides a standardized FOM for integration across the Navy training simulations.\n\n\u2022  Navy\u2019s current Joint Live-Virtual-Constructive (JLVC) and other federation simulation distribution is accomplished by tying simulation data to multicast groups. This is neither a scalable solution nor is it an effective one as federates are not able to publish and subscribe with fine enough precision. The Simulation Aware Software Router will address this shortcoming, and additionally provide a flexible solution for federating heterogeneous networks and on-the-wire protocols without forcing all federates onto a single, uniform, lowest common denominator solution for each training event.  Ultimately, a simulation aware router will allow simulation users to optimize the network for both simulation scalable traffic and for voice and Command, Control, Communications, (Computers), Intelligence (C4I) traffic."
