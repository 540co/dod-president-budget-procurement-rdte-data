            "val": "The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) is the world's premier airborne ground surveillance platform, meeting joint combat capability requirements.  The 707-based E-8C Joint STARS aircraft provides all-weather radar-derived Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) and targeting information on moving and stationary ground\/surface targets to include dismounts, slow moving rotary and fixed wing aircraft, and rotating antennas.  JSTARS provides target information for matching direct attack aircraft, standoff weapons, and ground-based attack assets against selected targets.  It can be cued by other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and target acquisition systems.  This capability enables air and ground regional\/geographic commanders to effectively make and execute battlefield decisions at the component commander's level to battlefield forces.  It also helps achieve predictive battle space awareness.    \n\nThis program element enhances the warfighter's ability to achieve the joint vision of combat operations.  It develops advanced battle management aids and information fusion technologies to enable rapid decisions in tracking and killing time-critical targets.  Concept exploration, program definition\/risk reduction efforts, and studies support continuous improvements in C2ISR, network centric operations capabilities, and interoperability with joint service, allied, and coalition systems.\n\nThis program element currently comprises: four development programs (JSTARS Modernization, Prime Mission Equipment-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (PME-DMS), Communications and Networking Upgrades (CNU) and JSTARS Re-engining), as well as Test Infrastructure and Program Management Administration (PMA).  \n\nActivities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nI. JSTARS Modernization:\n\nThe JSTARS modernization program consists of multiple efforts to develop and integrate platform wide system improvements. Future development efforts will depend on availability of funding. These include, but are not limited to Spiral Development and Avionics-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (Av-DMS) for cockpit upgrades. These efforts are detailed below.\n\nSpiral Development - The Spiral Development effort includes various technology development\/insertion activities to enhance target identification, data processing & transmittal, and weapon control capabilities, such as JSTARS Net Enabled Weapons (JNEW) and Joint Surface Warfare (JSuW), JSTARS Radar Modernization (JSRM),  Blue Force tracker (BFT), Battlefield Airborne Communication Node (BACN), combat identification and future program planning for Analysis of Alternatives recommendations. The JSuW-JNEW activities include participation in the JSuW Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for Network Enabled Weapons (NEW) which includes, but is not limited to, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Air Surface Warfare-Anti-Surface Warfare (JASSM-ASuW). The JSRM activities apply multi-platform radar technology insertion program (MP-RTIP) technology to JSTARS. The MP-RTIP capability on the E-8C will provide the ability to detect, track, and identify both stationary and moving ground vehicles.  Future program planning activities include, but are not limited to, modular equipment enclosure (MEE), automatic identification system (AIS), analyst support architecture (ASA) software, and common data link (CDL) integration. Spiral development efforts also support requirements for current and future Urgent Operational Needs (UON), quick reaction capabilities (QRCs), top-down directed efforts, requirements definition, capability gap analysis, pre-Milestone A (MS A) technical risk reduction activities, BFT, multi-agency communication capability (MACC) and the Air Force tactical receive system (AFTRS) radio replacement for the integrated broadcast service (IBS) data and other large airborne platform integration efforts including self-defense suite (SDS), and radar & aircraft performance improvements. Equipment developed under spiral development are procured under Kill Chain Enhancement-MN-38203.\n\nAvionics Diminishing Manufacturing Sources - The Av-DMS efforts include, but are not limited to, Aircraft Information Program (AIP), Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS), Communications, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) upgrades, Control and Display Unit (CDU) Replacement, Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT), Flight Data Recorder (FDR), Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), Embedded GPS Inertial (EGI) with Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM)\/M-Code GPS, Digital Multi-Function Flight Display (Attitude Direction Indicator, Horizontal Situation Indicator and Attitude Heading Reference System), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), a new flight management system (FMS), flight director, Instrument Landing System (ILS) Marker Beacon multi-mode receiver (MMR), and digital engine instruments.\n\nAdditional Modernization efforts include interoperability with manned and unmanned platforms; space data links; advanced Battle-Management Command and Control (BMC2) concepts; 8.33\/25 kHz VHF Radio with Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) voice and data communication; ISR Constellation; Air Moving Target Indicator (AMTI); Advanced Radar Modes (ARM); Aided Target Recognition (ATR); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\/Enhanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ESAR); Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT); and Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Network Architecture Upgrades (BNAU).\n\nTraining and support systems upgrade modernization efforts include, but are not limited to: Weapon Systems Trainer (WST); Navigator Training System (NTS); and Mission Crew Trainers to include a Mission Maintenance Trainer (MMT), Prime Mission Equipment-Maintenance Training Device (PME-MTD) and the Mission System Trainer (MST).\n\n\nII. Prime Mission Equipment-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources:\n\nDiminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues are categorized as PME-DMS and Av-DMS issues and are top issues for fleet viability. The PME-DMS program will address hardware and software DMS issues and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology refresh for the operator work station (OWS), the central computing subsystem, and the Radar Airborne Signal Processor (RASP) subsystem. \n\nIII. Communications and Networking Upgrades:\n\nThe multi-phased CNU program includes, but is not limited to, replacement of the E-8C Link 16 Tactical Data Link (TDL) equipment with National Security Agency (NSA) Cryptographic Modernization Program (CMP) compliant equipment, the Multi-functional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), IBS, the Family of Advanced Beyond-Line-of-Sight-Terminals (FAB-T), Advanced Tactical Data Links integration, airborne networking, and network centric operation enhancements. All development efforts are complete with the exception of a MIDS JTRS advanced capabilities study.\n\nIV. Re-engining:\n\nThe JSTARS Re-Engining program is a System Design and Demonstration (SDD) program to replace legacy TF33-P102C engines with JT8D-219 engines.  The JT8D-219 engines are predicted to provide the E-8C aircraft improved performance, including thrust, altitude capability, mission duration, time to climb, critical field length (i.e. takeoff performance), fuel efficiency, noise abatement, emissions, and reliability. It also adds the potential for additional electrical power generation for future system upgrades. SDD efforts include flight test, development of weapon system trainer modification hardware & software, technical orders (i.e. flight and maintenance manuals), technical data development, logistic development & analysis, technical analysis & evaluation, engineering support for MIL-STD airworthiness qualification, flight data analysis & upgrade of the T-3 test aircraft's Propulsion Pod System (PPS), and spare engines including upgrade of used JT8D-219 engines to make them production representative. A PPS consists of engines (4), pneumatic bleed air system, engine build up unit, thrust reversers, nacelles, plyons, exhaust ducts, controls, and instrumentation.\n\nWith termination of the re-engining program, the AF completed a modified SDD. This consisted of pneumatic system design, flight manuals, airworthiness certification, and a successful flight test program. The remaining unfunded efforts to complete a full SDD are completion of all logistics development tasks and operational tests.\n\nV. Test and Infrastructure: \n\nThe test infrastructure includes the JSTARS Extended Test Support (JETS), JSTARS Test Force (JTF), and C2 Enterprise Integration Facility (CEIF). All JSTARS efforts rely on the components of the test infrastructure to carry out RDT&E activities. The infrastructure includes but is not limited to a T-3 test aircraft, laboratories, support facilities, priority level (PL-2) security, information assurance, and range support. Due to the conclusion of developmental programs, the T-3 test aircraft will be put in preservation storage.\n\nVI. Program Management Administration:\n\nPMA supports JSTARS acquisition programs with administrative, engineering and technical activities required to support development, fielding, and installation of new and developing capabilities.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development. This budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) is the world's premier airborne ground surveillance platform, meeting joint combat capability requirements.  The 707-based E-8C Joint STARS aircraft provides all-weather radar-derived Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) and targeting information on moving and stationary ground\/surface targets to include dismounts, slow moving rotary and fixed wing aircraft, and rotating antennas.  JSTARS provides target information for matching direct attack aircraft, standoff weapons, and ground-based attack assets against selected targets.  It can be cued by other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and target acquisition systems.  This capability enables air and ground regional\/geographic commanders to effectively make and execute battlefield decisions at the component commander's level to battlefield forces.  It also helps achieve predictive battle space awareness.    \n\nThis program element enhances the warfighter's ability to achieve the joint vision of combat operations.  It develops advanced battle management aids and information fusion technologies to enable rapid decisions in tracking and killing time-critical targets.  Concept exploration, program definition\/risk reduction efforts, and studies support continuous improvements in C2ISR, network centric operations capabilities, and interoperability with joint service, allied, and coalition systems.\n\nThis program element currently comprises: four development programs (JSTARS Modernization, Prime Mission Equipment-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (PME-DMS), Communications and Networking Upgrades (CNU) and JSTARS Re-engining), as well as Test Infrastructure and Program Management Administration (PMA).  \n\nActivities also include studies and analyses to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  \n\nI. JSTARS Modernization:\n\nThe JSTARS modernization program consists of multiple efforts to develop and integrate platform wide system improvements. Future development efforts will depend on availability of funding. These include, but are not limited to Spiral Development and Avionics-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (Av-DMS) for cockpit upgrades. These efforts are detailed below.\n\nSpiral Development - The Spiral Development effort includes various technology development\/insertion activities to enhance target identification, data processing & transmittal, and weapon control capabilities, such as JSTARS Net Enabled Weapons (JNEW) and Joint Surface Warfare (JSuW), JSTARS Radar Modernization (JSRM),  Blue Force tracker (BFT), Battlefield Airborne Communication Node (BACN), combat identification and future program planning for Analysis of Alternatives recommendations. The JSuW-JNEW activities include participation in the JSuW Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for Network Enabled Weapons (NEW) which includes, but is not limited to, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Air Surface Warfare-Anti-Surface Warfare (JASSM-ASuW). The JSRM activities apply multi-platform radar technology insertion program (MP-RTIP) technology to JSTARS. The MP-RTIP capability on the E-8C will provide the ability to detect, track, and identify both stationary and moving ground vehicles.  Future program planning activities include, but are not limited to, modular equipment enclosure (MEE), automatic identification system (AIS), analyst support architecture (ASA) software, and common data link (CDL) integration. Spiral development efforts also support requirements for current and future Urgent Operational Needs (UON), quick reaction capabilities (QRCs), top-down directed efforts, requirements definition, capability gap analysis, pre-Milestone A (MS A) technical risk reduction activities, BFT, multi-agency communication capability (MACC) and the Air Force tactical receive system (AFTRS) radio replacement for the integrated broadcast service (IBS) data and other large airborne platform integration efforts including self-defense suite (SDS), and radar & aircraft performance improvements. Equipment developed under spiral development are procured under Kill Chain Enhancement-MN-38203.\n\nAvionics Diminishing Manufacturing Sources - The Av-DMS efforts include, but are not limited to, Aircraft Information Program (AIP), Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS), Communications, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) upgrades, Control and Display Unit (CDU) Replacement, Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT), Flight Data Recorder (FDR), Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), Embedded GPS Inertial (EGI) with Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM)\/M-Code GPS, Digital Multi-Function Flight Display (Attitude Direction Indicator, Horizontal Situation Indicator and Attitude Heading Reference System), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), a new flight management system (FMS), flight director, Instrument Landing System (ILS) Marker Beacon multi-mode receiver (MMR), and digital engine instruments.\n\nAdditional Modernization efforts include interoperability with manned and unmanned platforms; space data links; advanced Battle-Management Command and Control (BMC2) concepts; 8.33\/25 kHz VHF Radio with Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) voice and data communication; ISR Constellation; Air Moving Target Indicator (AMTI); Advanced Radar Modes (ARM); Aided Target Recognition (ATR); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\/Enhanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ESAR); Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT); and Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Network Architecture Upgrades (BNAU).\n\nTraining and support systems upgrade modernization efforts include, but are not limited to: Weapon Systems Trainer (WST); Navigator Training System (NTS); and Mission Crew Trainers to include a Mission Maintenance Trainer (MMT), Prime Mission Equipment-Maintenance Training Device (PME-MTD) and the Mission System Trainer (MST).\n\n\nII. Prime Mission Equipment-Diminishing Manufacturing Sources:\n\nDiminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues are categorized as PME-DMS and Av-DMS issues and are top issues for fleet viability. The PME-DMS program will address hardware and software DMS issues and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology refresh for the operator work station (OWS), the central computing subsystem, and the Radar Airborne Signal Processor (RASP) subsystem. \n\nIII. Communications and Networking Upgrades:\n\nThe multi-phased CNU program includes, but is not limited to, replacement of the E-8C Link 16 Tactical Data Link (TDL) equipment with National Security Agency (NSA) Cryptographic Modernization Program (CMP) compliant equipment, the Multi-functional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), IBS, the Family of Advanced Beyond-Line-of-Sight-Terminals (FAB-T), Advanced Tactical Data Links integration, airborne networking, and network centric operation enhancements. All development efforts are complete with the exception of a MIDS JTRS advanced capabilities study.\n\nIV. Re-engining:\n\nThe JSTARS Re-Engining program is a System Design and Demonstration (SDD) program to replace legacy TF33-P102C engines with JT8D-219 engines.  The JT8D-219 engines are predicted to provide the E-8C aircraft improved performance, including thrust, altitude capability, mission duration, time to climb, critical field length (i.e. takeoff performance), fuel efficiency, noise abatement, emissions, and reliability. It also adds the potential for additional electrical power generation for future system upgrades. SDD efforts include flight test, development of weapon system trainer modification hardware & software, technical orders (i.e. flight and maintenance manuals), technical data development, logistic development & analysis, technical analysis & evaluation, engineering support for MIL-STD airworthiness qualification, flight data analysis & upgrade of the T-3 test aircraft's Propulsion Pod System (PPS), and spare engines including upgrade of used JT8D-219 engines to make them production representative. A PPS consists of engines (4), pneumatic bleed air system, engine build up unit, thrust reversers, nacelles, plyons, exhaust ducts, controls, and instrumentation.\n\nWith termination of the re-engining program, the AF completed a modified SDD. This consisted of pneumatic system design, flight manuals, airworthiness certification, and a successful flight test program. The remaining unfunded efforts to complete a full SDD are completion of all logistics development tasks and operational tests.\n\nV. Test and Infrastructure: \n\nThe test infrastructure includes the JSTARS Extended Test Support (JETS), JSTARS Test Force (JTF), and C2 Enterprise Integration Facility (CEIF). All JSTARS efforts rely on the components of the test infrastructure to carry out RDT&E activities. The infrastructure includes but is not limited to a T-3 test aircraft, laboratories, support facilities, priority level (PL-2) security, information assurance, and range support. Due to the conclusion of developmental programs, the T-3 test aircraft will be put in preservation storage.\n\nVI. Program Management Administration:\n\nPMA supports JSTARS acquisition programs with administrative, engineering and technical activities required to support development, fielding, and installation of new and developing capabilities.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development. This budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
