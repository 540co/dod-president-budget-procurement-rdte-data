When the FY 2012 budget was approved\/appopriated, the $44.3M was returned by the Army (RDT&E,A) to RDT&E,DW.

            "val": "This program element (PE) demonstrates and provides high performance computing hardware, parallel software, wide area networking services, and expertise that enable the Department of Defense (DoD) Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) community to investigate and understand physical phenomena and behavior of systems through large scale computational simulation. DoD users of these services work in a diverse variety of science and technology areas including structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, material science, chemistry, biology, electromagnetics and acoustics, weather, ocean modeling, signal\/image processing, forces modeling and simulation, environmental quality, electronics\/networking\/systems\/C4I, and space and astrophysical sciences.  The computational expertise and resources (massively parallel, networked, multi-core computers, advanced software applications and secure connectivity) provided by this Program enable DoD researchers and engineers to analyze complex problems and phenomena and develop novel solutions using state-of-the-art, physics-based and discrete event simulations.  The combined capabilities of the HPC centers and the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) enable massive calculations to be completed more efficiently and at reduced cost than if each DoD research organization were to duplicate the necessary resources. For example, DoD personnel use High Performance Modernization Program (HPCMP) resources to do such things as improve the performance of manned and unmanned aircraft, validate design concepts and establish expected performance of new armor and penetrator designs, speed the development of new ship designs, and demonstrate the viability of weapons systems performance. The HPCMP supports the requirements of DoD scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs), the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and support for software applications. Dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) augment the DSRCs to form the total HPCMP computational capability. In 2012 the HPCMP provided approximately 1.47 billion processor hours to a user community representing requirements from all three services and the agencies of the DoD. The bulk of this capability is provided via 13 supercomputers (including systems for classified processing) located in the 5 DSRCs across the country providing a total of approximately 180,000 processors and 1.7 quadrillion floating point operations per second (1.7 petaFLOPS). DoD users store their results in 16 petabytes (16,000,000,000,000 bytes) of storage archival distributed across the centers and duplicated for backup (for a total storage capability of 32 petabytes). The DREN interconnects HPCMP resources and users nationwide via a research infrastructure that provides an aggregate network capacity of 25 billion bits per second to 38 user sites, 5 DSRCs, and 4 smaller affiliated resource centers (ARCs). Individual user site speeds range from 45 to 622 million bits per second, ARC speeds range from 155 to 2488 million bits per second, and DSRC speeds range from 622 to 3110 million bits per second. Mission-critical DoD applications across the spectrum of DoD activities are supported by the software component of the Program through training in advanced computational methods, the development of productive application development environments, tools, and methodologies, and through the direct provision of computational scientists and engineers to improve the performance, accuracy, and relevance of physics-based computational models.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The computational expertise and resources enable DoD personnel to analyze phenomena that are often impossible, not cost effective, too time-consuming, or too dangerous to study any other way.  The High Performance Modernization Program (HPCMP) supports the requirements of the DoD's scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: supercomputing resource centers, the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and support for software applications. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive capabilities and demonstrate new technologies that address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments. Efforts of the DSRCs are augmented by dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) that address near real-time and real-time HPC requirements. The total aggregate computational capability is roughly 1.7 quadrillion floating point operations per second (1.7 petaFLOPS); this capability is expected to double by 2013. All sites in the HPC Modernization Program are interconnected to one another, the user community, and major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which matures and demonstrates state of the art computer network technologies. The DREN interconnects 45 user and center sites at network speeds of up to 3 gigabits per second. The Software Application Support (SAS) effort optimizes and improves the performance of critical common DoD applications programs to run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, matures and demonstrates leading-edge computational technology from academic and commercial partners, and provides collaborative programming environments.     \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly named Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

The computational expertise and resources enable DoD personnel to analyze phenomena that are often impossible, not cost effective, too time-consuming, or too dangerous to study any other way.  The High Performance Modernization Program (HPCMP) supports the requirements of the DoD's scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: supercomputing resource centers, the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and support for software applications. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive capabilities and demonstrate new technologies that address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments. Efforts of the DSRCs are augmented by dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) that address near real-time and real-time HPC requirements. The total aggregate computational capability is roughly 1.7 quadrillion floating point operations per second (1.7 petaFLOPS); this capability is expected to double by 2013. All sites in the HPC Modernization Program are interconnected to one another, the user community, and major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which matures and demonstrates state of the art computer network technologies. The DREN interconnects 45 user and center sites at network speeds of up to 3 gigabits per second. The Software Application Support (SAS) effort optimizes and improves the performance of critical common DoD applications programs to run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, matures and demonstrates leading-edge computational technology from academic and commercial partners, and provides collaborative programming environments.     \n\nWork in this project supports the Army S&T Innovation Enablers (formerly named Enduring Technologies) Portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."
