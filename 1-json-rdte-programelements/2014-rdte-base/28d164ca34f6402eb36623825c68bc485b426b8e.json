The move to a new facility was in response to the Department of Defense Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) and Anti-terrorism\/Force Protection Requirements Regulation (UFC 4-010-01 dtd 8 Oct 2003, as amended 22 Jan 2007).  The regulation is mandatory for facilities leased for DoD use and applies to all new leases executed on or after 1 Oct 2005 and to renewal or extension of any existing lease on or after 1 Oct 2009.  DARPA's prior leased facility did not meet the UFC standards and the lease extended beyond October 2009.  This Program Element funded all expenses associated with planning and movement of the Agency to its new location.  Initial costs included design and trade studies, costs associated with implementing force protection standards, floor plan layout and planning activities that led up to the move.  Further, it funded outfitting of the selected property with the force protection standards, infrastructure, equipment, and furniture required for the DARPA staff and completion of the move in May 2012."
