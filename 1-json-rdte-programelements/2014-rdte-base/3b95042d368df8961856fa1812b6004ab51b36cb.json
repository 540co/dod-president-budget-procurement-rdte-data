The Air Force uses the SENSOR contract for sustaining and upgrading various Air Force systems, including the Eglin radar. \n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory (MIT\/LL), a non-profit Federally-Funded Research & Development Center, performs the HUSIR effort under a master contract with the Electronic Systems Center, in conjunction with support from other agencies as required.  This effort is classified as applied research under that contract.  MIT\/LL transferred ownership of the radar to the Air Force but continues to operate it as part of its Lincoln Space Surveillance Complex as per contract with the Air Force.  MIT\/LL will be responsible for operations and sustainment of the upgraded Haystack radar. The upgrade effort is scheduled to complete in FY14.\n\nThe GEODSS SLEP was awarded as an option on the SENSOR contract.  The GEODSS SLEP uses a phased development and deployment strategy to reduce risk.\n\nThe Globus II SLEP was also awarded as an option on the SENSOR contract.  The Globus II SLEP uses a phased development and deployment strategy to reduce risk. Phase I is under contract (transmitter replacement). Phase II will replace the MCCR and REX subsystems. An assessment was completed on the MCCR and REX subsystems and additional requirements are being refined to be potentially incroporated into the second phase. In FY14, this project is being transferred to a new Program Element."
