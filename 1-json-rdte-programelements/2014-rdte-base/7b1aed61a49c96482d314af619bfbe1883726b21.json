Unpredictable and extended global distribution routes, limited visibility of sustainment requirements, force packaging limitations, lift constraints, anti-access\/aerial denial concerns, complex supply chains, as well as non-networked battlefield command and control, planning, and decision support tools impede timely customer logistical support.  To project unimpeded global power and influence, USTRANSCOM must have access to relevant, real-time information and invest in enabling capabilities that contribute to mission success.  Effective knowledge sharing and transparency across the joint logistics enterprise, facilitated by secure enterprise-wide visibility into logistical processes and the ability to effectively collaborate\/operate in a degraded cyberspace, is required to promote effective, efficient and responsive global management of force projection and sustainment resources."
