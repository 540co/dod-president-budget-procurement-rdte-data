The intended outcome of this integrative effort is to develop concept capability plans that inform the Capabilities Integration Development System (CIDS) process and define future requirements, enabling identification and acquistion of critical Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leader Development, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) capabilities for the future force to provide land power capabilities needed by Joint and Army commanders.  In FY 2012-2018, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding specifically enables the World Class Blue Force (subject matter experts overseeing and coordinating experiments efforts from Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) proper in collaboration with the Schools and Centers), support for Red Cell analysis, and support to Maneuver Brigade Experiments.  Experimentation enables enhanced situational awareness, planning requirements, employment and management of accelerated decision cycles in a network-enabled force, and training requirements of new and emerging technologies.\n\nARCIC, Accelerated Capabilities Division (ACD) (formerly Asymmetric Warfare Division) develops immediate capability solutions in support of the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA) prioritized Current Force capability gaps (i.e. Force Protection, Networked Battle Command, Logistics and Medical in Counterinsurgency Operations (COIN) and Soldier Protection).  ACD conducts Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and DOTMLPF analysis required to ensure capability gap candidate solutions are properly integrated prior to being equipped to deployed forces.  Supports pre-deployment and in-theater assessments to ensure candidate solution meet identifiied requirements, support tactics, techniques and procedures development for use by deployed forces, and ensure equipped systems provide the necessary capability to fill an identified gap.  These assessments support determination of a path forward for equipped system by identifying them as a potential Program of Record (POR) or sustain in theater.  CONOPS, DOTMLPF-Cost analysis and assessment assist deployed forces by ensuring they are able to properly employ equipped systems and assist senior Army leadership in determining how best to resource solution to high priority capability gaps."

Experiments inform Army future concepts and assess high-risk conceptual assumptions in order to focus required capabilities and represent the user's requirements in the future Army.  TRADOC's partnership with ASA(ALT) in connecting Soldiers to the ideas and capabilities earlier rather than later, provides essential user feedback and assists the acquisition community with informing the Army's investment portfolio and decreasing the number of engineering design changes.  Army experiments use the combined resources of Army battle laboratories, operational units, research labs, materiel developers, industry and academia to collaborate in the development, refinements, and assessment of future force concepts - to inform capability developments and validate concepts for current and future force.  In FY12-18, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding enables World Class Blue Force (WCBLUFOR) to provide technical and tactical expertise in Army experiment efforts, in collaboration and integration with Joint, Interagency, Intergovermental, and Multinational partners.  In the near-term, Army experimentation will focus on Prevent, Shape, and Win as foundational elements for this campaign, assessed across all joint campaign phases, with Army level issues across the breadth of a champaign that highlights integration of Army 2020 initiatives."
