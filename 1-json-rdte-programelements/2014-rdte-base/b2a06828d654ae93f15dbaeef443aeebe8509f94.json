Large data stores of enemy photos and video are available but cannot be leveraged by a warfighter or analyst attempting to understand a specific new image in a timely fashion.  The VMR program will enable users to gain insights rapidly through application of highly parallelized image analysis techniques that can process the imagery in massive distributed image stores.
