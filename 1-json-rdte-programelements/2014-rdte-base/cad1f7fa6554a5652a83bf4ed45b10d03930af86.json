            "val": "Regional International Outreach (RIO) - Partnership for Peace (PfP) Information Management System (PIMS) is an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative.  The primary focus of the program is a common information technology platform (GlobalNET) to improve international partner outreach and collaboration efforts in a federated environment. A federated environment \u2013 characterized by the capacity of DoD institutions to directly share participants and content across proprietary community websites - fosters networks of partner influencers and enables better use of DoD resources through collaboration among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, PfP and international partners, other DoD educational institutions and communities as required. The program uses a spiral methodology (making available capabilities as developed), to speed the delivery of open source collaboration technologies the user community. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) oversees execution of the research and development of the GlobalNET effort and its operations, and ensures that the program addresses DoD security cooperation requirements in the context of defense, interagency, and international information sharing and collaboration needs.\n\nThe GlobalNET effort focuses on improving collaboration, supporting outreach efforts, and enabling communication among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, the Combatant Commanders, the DSCA, OUSD (Policy), North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) Military Cooperation Division (MCD), the PfP Consortium of Defense Academies, PfP Partner countries, and other designated DoD institutions and communities. It provides DoD and international partner security practitioners a platform to share information, communicate and collaborate, and improve administrative activities. It also provides the ability to form collaborative communities of interest around security issues. GlobalNET facilitates information sharing and knowledge management concepts in accordance with U.S. policy. PIMS, as a part of the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996, implements the Congressional endorsement for the modernization of Defense capabilities in eligible PfP countries relative to their telecommunications infrastructure.  RIO-PIMS provides allies and partner countries the ability to collaborate in critical cooperative activities that underpin the spirit of the PfP program.  The program supports PfP coalition initiatives through development of distributive collaboration tools to support aspects of U.S. and NATO-approved PfP cooperative activities.  This support is important to achieve the interoperability\/integration outlined in the Guidance for the Employment of the Force.  RIO-PIMS supports internet-based education and collaboration, exercise simulations, and training center requirements. \n\nThe Regional Centers Person\/Activity Management System (RCPAMS) provides an integrated student and activities management framework that was designed to complement the capabilities of the Security Assistance Network (SAN).  The interface between the SAN, RCPAMS, and GlobalNET provides faculty and students an effective information service to ensure student, activity, and alumni management.  Data is shared between the systems ensuring improved data integrity."

This will allow communities to reduce costs and improve public access to information.\n\nEnhance the user experience for browsing courses and groups to allow a much more robust experience, including tighter coupling of events and groups on the GlobalNET platform with courses operated on the Ilias Learning Management System (LMS) deployed in 2013.\n\nProvide a much more structured and granular reporting and goal tracking environment.  This will include the abiulity to offload the reporting data from the transaction servers to a dedicated reporting service and define goals for each member community. \n\n\nWork to extend the service that shares data between RCPAMS and GlobalNET to a generic service so that other communities can exploit the service for their internal business systems. \n\nUpgrade the core platform to be in alignment with the community versioning.  This will include ensuring that  previously identified issues not addressed is due to required effort being on the older versions, are addressed.\n\n\nContinue to optimize both the code and the underlying hardware to improve performance due to additional communities and provisioned accounts.\n\nWork with users to define their evolutionary needs and functionality and ensure that those needs are in alignment with the program goals. When validated, make system changes and ensure the changes meet anticipated needs.\n\nReview RCPAMS requirements and implement upgrades to the software.\n\nComplete recertification of security accreditation process that also reflects the new and updated software capabilities as well newly integrated communities.   \n\nWork with DSCA and OSD-P leaders to identify institutions which need a similar capability.  Work to extend the platform for those institution specific requirements, allowing existing members to avail themselves of the newly developed feature sets."

Independent Operational Test teams were brought on to ensure that GlobalNET and bears independent validation of the development team\u2019s effort.
