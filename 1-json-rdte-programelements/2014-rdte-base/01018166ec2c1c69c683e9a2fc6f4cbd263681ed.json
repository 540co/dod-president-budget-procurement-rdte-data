            "val": "Funding under this program element (PE) sustains a robust defense program, which both reduces the danger of a Chemical, Biological, or Radiological (CBR) attack and enables U.S. forces to survive, and continue operations in a CBR environment.  The medical program (was TB2, TC2, TR2, but in FY13 these continue within one project, TM2) focuses on the development of antidotes, drug treatments, disease surveillance and point-of-need diagnostic devices, patient decontamination and medical technologies management.  The Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) (was in TB2, but it too continues in FY13 in TM2, consistent with consolidation of the medical program) was established to provide the capability for the advancement of regulatory science and flexible manufacturing of biological MCM to address CBR threats, including novel and previously unrecognized, naturally-occurring emerging infectious diseases.  In the physical sciences area, the emphasis is on continuing improvements in CB defense materiel, including contamination avoidance, decontamination, and protection technologies, as well as biological weapon\/agent surveillance.  NT2 consolidated all efforts related to NTAs, including medical pretreatments, therapeutics, detection, threat agent science, modeling, and protection and hazard mitigation.  Research efforts are planned to be initiated for CB defense technologies that will result from a strategic approach of converging nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science.  The PE also provides for applied research in the areas of real-time sensing and immediate biological countermeasures.\n\nKey efforts within this PE are in support of the FY14 policy priorities for Countering Biological Threats.  Approximately $40.8M supports the priority to \"Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, whether caused by natural, accidental, or deliberate events.\"  Approximately $28.4M supports the priority to \"Expand our capability to prevent, attribute, and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism, with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities.\"  Approximately $56.9M supports the priority to \"Leverage science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capacity to respond to and recover from biological incidents.\"\n\nEfforts under this PE will transition to or will provide risk reduction for Advanced Technology Development (PE: 0603384BP), Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (PE: 0603884BP) and System Development and Demonstration (PE: 0604384BP).\n\nIn FY13, all NTA efforts (both Medical and Non-Medical) within the PE were re-aligned to Project NT2 - Techbase Non-Traditional Agents Defense.  Also in FY13, all Medical efforts formerly included in Project TB2 (Medical Biological Defense), Project TC2 (Medical Chemical Defense) and Project TR2 (Medical Radiological Defense), were re-aligned to Project TM2 (Techbase Med Defense).  CB2 Physical Science Applied Research continues, and is the project in which biological threat agent surveillance (biosurveillance) research is pursued."

Efforts in this project support the seamless integration of state-of-the-art-technologies into a collection of systems across the spectrum of capabilities required to support chemical and biological defense missions.  Capability areas in this project include: detection; Information systems technology; protection\/hazard mitigation; and threat agent science.  Detection focuses on developing technologies for standoff and point detection and identification of chemical and biological agents.  Information systems technology focuses on advanced warning and reporting, hazard prediction and assessment, simulation analysis and planning, and systems performance modeling.  Protection and hazard mitigation focuses on providing technologies that protect and reduce the chemical\/biological threat or hazard to the Warfighter, weapons platforms, and structures.  Threat agent science is devoted to characterizing threat agents and the hazards they present in terms of agent fate in the environment, toxicology, and pathogenicity.  This project also supports biological threat agent surveillance (biosurveillance).  This project focuses on horizontal integration of CB defensive technologies in support of the Joint Services.  This project also supports applied biosurveillance research.\n\nMultiple projects and associated funding that had been reflected in FY12 with separate CB2 Applied Research project titles (Detection, Information Systems, Protection & Hazard Mitigation, Threat Agent Science) were re-aligned in FY13 into CB2 Techbase Non-Medical (TBNM) Physical Science Applied Research (PSAR), which pursues research on traditional agents.  Further, all non-traditional agent (NTA)-dedicated research formerly in CB2 was re-aligned to Project NT2 - Techbase NTA Defense."

Innovative biotechnology approaches will be incorporated to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to biological threat agents.  Categories for this project include core science efforts in biological defense capability areas, such as Pretreatments, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics.  Medical Science and Technology (S&T) efforts in this Budget Activity refine promising medical initiatives identified in Budget Activity 1, resulting in the development of countermeasures to protect against and treat the effects of exposure to biological agents.  \n\nThis project includes the Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative (TMTI), (funded as the Transformational Medical Technologies (TMT) program in FY12).  The program was launched to respond to the threat of emerging or intentionally engineered biological threats.  TMT's mission is to protect the Warfighter from genetically engineered biological threats by providing a rapid response capability from identification of pathogens to the delivery of medical countermeasures.  This mission is accomplished through two main efforts: 1) developing broad spectrum (multi-agent) therapeutics against biological agents (e.g. one drug that treats multiple agents); and 2) developing platform technologies to assist in the rapid development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) in response to biological agents (e.g. developing new and innovative ways to mass produce drugs in the event of a biological incident). \n\nThe Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities, based on partnerships between the government and industry, providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the Warfighter and national security needs.  Specifically, the MCMI will provide the capability for the advanced development and flexible manufacturing of biological MCM (to include TMT developed MCMs) to address CBRN threats, including novel and previously unrecognized, naturally-occurring emerging infectious diseases.  MCMI efforts within S&T are concentrated in two areas: 1) advancement of regulatory science, and 2) advancements in flexible manufacturing technologies for MCMs.\n\nIn FY13, all Project TB2 research is re-aligned into Project TM2 - Techbase Medical Defense."

Categories for this project include core science efforts in Medical Chemical, Medical Biological, Diagnostics, and the Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI).  Against radiological threats, this project provides investment for the development of pretreatments (prophylaxis) and post-irradiation therapeutics against radiological\/nuclear exposure.  Against chemical and biological agents, this project funds applied research for the investigation of new medical countermeasures to include prophylaxes, pretreatments, antidotes, skin decontaminants, and therapeutic drugs against identified and emerging biological and chemical warfare agents.   Medical Science and Technology (S&T) efforts in this Budget Activity refine promising medical initiatives identified in Budget Activity 1, resulting in the development of countermeasures to protect against and treat the effects of exposure to chemical and biological (CB) agents.  Diagnostic research focuses on providing high quality data closer to the point-of-need comprising devise innovation, panels of biomarkers driven by bioinformatics, and epidemiological modeling tools.  \n\nThe Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMI) was established to coordinate inter-related advanced development and flexible manufacturing capabilities, providing a dedicated, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable MCM process that meets the Warfighter and national security needs. MCMI efforts within science and technology (S&T) are concentrated in advancing two areas: 1) regulatory science and 2) flexible manufacturing technologies and processes for MCMs.  Efforts conducted in these areas are enablers supporting the DoD Medical Countermeasures Advanced Development and Manufacturing (MCM-ADM) capability.\n\nIn FY13, all Project TB2 research was re-aligned into Project TM2 - Techbase Medical Defense."

Specifically, innovative technical approaches will be used to develop products to mitigate health consequences resulting from Acute Radiation Exposure (ARS) and Delayed Effects of Acute Radiation Exposure (DEARE).  The research and development of medical countermeasures for radiation exposure will ultimately enhance the survivability of Warfighters and will serve to significantly minimize the development of acute radiation syndromes and subsequent health problems.  Results of efforts funded under this project are collaboratively shared with other government agencies, while the Department of Defense maintains an emphasis on the development of pretreatments to protect military personnel who could be involved in responding to a radiological incident.  In FY13, all research in this area is re-aligned into Techbase Medical Defense (TM2)."
