            "val": "This Program Element supports the Joint Service basic research program for Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) defense.  The objective of the basic research program is to advance fundamental knowledge and understanding of those fundamental sciences identified as having potential future impact on the Chemical and Biological Defense Program, with an emphasis in exploring new and innovative research for combating or countering chemical, biological and radiological weapons.  Moreover, basic research supports a Joint Force concept of a lethal, integrated, supportable, highly mobile force with enhanced capability by the individual service member.  Specifically, the program promotes theoretical and experimental research and studies in the physical, life and information sciences.  A portion of this program element directly supports basic research efforts for the transformational medical technologies program.  The work in this program element is consistent with the Chemical Biological Defense Program Research, Development and Acquisition (RDA) Plan.  Basic research technological breakthroughs support applied research (PE 0602384BP) activities.  Basic research activities described in this budget justification leverage existing research programs and activities within the DoD and other government agencies and promotes cross-pollination between government and academia, as well as sponsors promising efforts of world class scientists.  The projects in this PE are placed in BA1, because they are basic research efforts directed towards non-specific or non-unique military applications.  \\\n\nKey efforts within this PE are in support of the FY14 policy priorities for Countering Biological Threats.  This PE supports the priority to \"Leverage science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capacity to respond to and recover from biological incidents.\"  These efforts are captured in the Life Sciences project and total $34.6M.\n\nThe Projects within this BA changed in FY13 to reflect the research areas of Life Sciences (LF1), and Physical Sciences (PS1).  The previous IS1 and TB1 efforts were consolidated into LF1 and PS1."

Surface and environmental sciences focus on the study of physical and chemical properties and phenomena of interactions, especially with regard to Non Traditional Agents (NTAs), that seek to improve capabilities such as detection, protection, and decontamination.  Research in nanotechnology and nanoscale sciences, such as nanoelectromechanical systems, molecular motors, nanomechanical resonance sensing, and nanometer imaging, has potential application across CB capability areas to provide significant enhancement by, for example, decreasing detection response times, increasing medical countermeasure effectiveness against a wider array of threat agents, and providing currently unavailable modalities like detection imbedded in fabrics."

This project supports core science efforts that may be applied to biological defense capability areas, such as Pretreatments, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics.   \n\nThis project includes basic research to support Transformational Medical Technologies (TMT) efforts.  The program was launched to respond to the threat of emerging or intentionally bioengineered biological threats.  Research efforts evaluate the molecular characteristics of the interaction between host and pathogen, characterize the host's response to infection\/intoxication and identify common mechanisms and\/or pathways.  The research also studies the correlates of immunity (common response against different pathogens), and looks for pre-symptomatic bio-markers.\n\nIn FY13, all Project TB1 research efforts are re-aligned to Project LF1 - Life Sciences (Basic Research)."
