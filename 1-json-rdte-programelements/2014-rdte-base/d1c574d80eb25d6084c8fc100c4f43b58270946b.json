The program is revising its material solution strategy to leverage commercially available Non-Developmental Item (NDI) tactical radios in order to rapidly deliver AMF JTRS capabilities to the warfighter. The strategy will support a concept in which NDI radios can be selected from the vendor base and tailored to platform needs. The current strategy is to procure two variations of NDI radios for Airborne platforms, one with Link 16 (Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal [SALT]) and another with wideband networking waveform capability (Small Airborne Networking Radio [SANR]). Maritime\/Fixed Station sites will not be part of the revised procurement."
