It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential S&T efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nWarfighter Sustainment Advanced Technology supports:  Manpower and Personnel, Training, and Readiness; and the Future Joint Warfighting Capabilities identified by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  It supports Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Programs in Airframe\/Ship Corrosion; Turbine Engine Technologies; Littoral Combat; Sea Base Planning, Operations and Logistics; and Sea Base Mobility and Interfaces.  It develops technologies that enable the Navy to better recruit, select, classify, assign, and manage its people; to train effectively and affordably in classroom settings, in simulated and actual environments, and while deployed; and to effect human systems design into weapon systems.

These technologies will enable advanced capabilities for Navy weapon systems at reduced total ownership costs.  Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines (VAATE) is a DoD\/DOE\/NASA\/Industry program to develop and demonstrate versatile, affordable, advanced engine technologies enabling for increased systems capabilities and reduced total ownership costs. The VAATE goal is 10X improvement in propulsion system affordability (capability\/cost) by 2017, with interim goals of 4X by 2009 and 6X by 2013.  The elements of the capability-to-cost index are increased thrust to weight; decreased specific fuel consumption; and reduced development, production, and maintenance costs for the entire integrated propulsion system.  To achieve these goals, VAATE is organized into multiple product areas. Specifically for the Navy, the focus, as part of the Enterprise and Platform Enablers FNC, is on turbine engine capability enhancements for future and emerging systems.  Technologies critical to Navy fighter jets are being worked, including low pressure turbine technologies for short takeoff and landing; high pressure turbine technologies for higher temperature, longer life; fan and compressor technologies for greater engine robustness and durability, and instrumentation and control technologies for greater engine state awareness and less unscheduled maintenance. Technologies being demonstrated include advanced aerodynamic, material, and structural concepts and emerging active control, prognostic health management, thermal management, aircraft subsystem integration, and information technologies.\n\nThe decrease of funding from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is the result of the transfer of resources from this R2 activity to a new FNC R2 activities titled Enterprise and Platform Enablers.  Efforts in this R2 activity have been continued from FY 2012 to FY 2013 into the new R2 activity to support all FNC program EC Investments."
