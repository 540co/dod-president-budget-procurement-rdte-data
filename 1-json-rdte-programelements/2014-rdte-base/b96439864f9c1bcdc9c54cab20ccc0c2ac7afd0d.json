                            "val": "Army Human Resource System (AHRS) is the Army's system of systems that provides commanders the necessary personnel information to make informed decisions on mobilized military personnel resources (both Active Duty and Reserve Component). The implementation of AHRS requires the development of an authoritative Army Corporate database to support the eventual migration to Integrated Personnel and Payroll System-Army (IPPS-A). However, major elements of AHRS are not planned to be subsumed into IPPS-A.  AHRS consists of three major components:\n - Electronic Military Personnel Office (eMILPO) provides the U.S. Army with a reliable, timely, and efficient mechanism for performing Army personnel actions and managing strength accountability.  The application provides visibility of the location, status, and skills of Soldiers both from a high level (tope of the system) and a unit level (bottom of the system).  eMILPO delivers enhanced performance to the Soldier, providing superior data accuracy, and a more intuitive web-based approach resulting in increased productivity, quality, timeliness, security, and user satisfaction.  It re-hosted the USC Title 10 functionality, formerly resident in the Standard Installation Division Personnel System-3 (SIDPERS) application, for migration to IPPS-A.  Selected elements of eMILPO will need to be operated in parallel with IPPS-A until\/unless IPPS-A is able to absorb all eMILPO functionality.\n- Deployed Theater Accountability System (DTAS) is a personnel accountability system that enables the Combatant Commanders (COCOM) to meet Title 10 personnel accountability responsibilities.  DTAS is residing on the Secret Internet Router Network (SIPRnet) and accounts for military and civilian personnel in a deployed theater by unit, day and location supporting force tracking and deployed Operations Tempo (OPTEMP) tracking.  DTAS is a persistent system and will continue to exist Integrated Personnel and Pay System - Army (IPPS-A) migration.\n - The Tactical Personnel System (TPS) is a stand-alone system that supports personnel accountability for task organization\/manifests and jump manifests used by tactical units.  The system interfaces with DTAS, allowing Soldiers to be loaded into DTAS in mass upon arrival in theater.  TPS will continue to exist Integrated Personnel and Pay System - Army (IPPS-A) migration.\n-Personnel Transformation (PT)- Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)- The Army's Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) provides a data integration service in which data can be extracted from the legacy human resource systems and transferred to DIMHRS.  The ESB will be a middleware application which will  provide a single interface to and from DIMHRS from the Army Legacy Systems.  The ESB will provide the infrastructure for the integration of new and existing applications by allowing systems and applications to easily exchange information across different environments and platforms.  It will also form the information bridge between IPPS-A, the Army Legacy Systems, and external systems to create more streamlined systems in support of the military mission and personnel transformation goals. \n\n FY14 funding procures GoArmy Ed. GoArmy Ed is an Army continuing Education System (ACES) program that provides the virtual gateway to request Tuition Assistance (TA) online, anytime for classroom, distance learning, and online college courses.  GoArmy Ed is a dynamic online portal that automates many of the paper-based processes historically conducted in-person at Army Education Centers.  GoArmyEd includes automated registration tools that enforce TA policies and procedures.  GoArmyED is used by Soldiers to pursue their post secondary educational goals: Army Education Counselors to provide educational guidance; and Colleges to deliver degree and course offerings and to report Soldier progress.\n\nModernization initiatives address GoArmyEd functionality gaps by automating and improving business process functions to mitigate the integration of additional users and business rules from the Reserve Component.  GoArmyEd is the Army's enterprise education solution.  The integration of the Reserve Component exceeds the current capability of education counselors.  Education benefits are paramount to recruiting and retention of quality Soldiers and Families."

Three modules support human resources business functions (In\/Out-Processing, Transition Processing, and Personnel Locator); the fourth module, Central Issue Facility (CIF) supports management of over $9.000 million combatant Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment inventory.  The web server architecture is fully internet protocol capable and allows soldiers ready access to their records and commanders and logisticians access to information affecting readiness of combat organizations. \n  \nCoalition Warfighter Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) is a mandated Joint program that requires participation by the US Army to explore near-term technologies that support Joint and Coalition Warfare Interoperability.  Funding is to facilitate Coalition Force interoperability research and development and to comply with CJCSI 6230.2 date 30 April 05.  \n\nArmy Behavioral Health Integrated Data Environment (ABHIDE) will be the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (CHPPM) Suicide Registry.  Data relating to suicides and suicides attempts are collected and stored in a in disparate, non-related databases that cross the domains of medical, personnel and law enforcement.   ABHIDE will provide the capability of integrating the non-related and dispersed data from the separate sources into a single comprehensive database to support both retrospective and predictive analysis.  The information obtained will be used to conduct epidemiological surveillance, identify trends in behavior patterns and identify potential indicators for suicidal tendencies supporting the mitigation of future suicide attempts across all phases of Army service.\n\nISM Core funding is essential for supporting demands to research and develop improved systems to provide for soldier safety and inventory reduction without risking readiness. Supports research and development to comply with Dept of Defense Instruction 8320.4 Serialized Item Management.  Applications to use commercial off the shelf wireless bar code equipment to ensure inventory accuracy throughout 154 warehouses in worldwide locations potentially reduces operating costs by $500.000 million. \n\nFunding for CWID will continue to facilitate Coalition Force interoperability research and development. Funding for ABHIDE will continue development of the system."

The MC4 System fulfills the requirements highlighted in United States Code: Title 10, Subtitle A, Part II, Chapter 55, Section 1074f, mandating the proper documentation of deployed service members' medical treatment to include pre- and post-deployment screening and its associated medical surveillance.  The MC4 System interfaces Force Health Protection and medical surveillance information with Army Mission Command information technology systems.  The MC4 System supports other soldier protection initiatives by providing data for analyses which can be used for identification and development of critical soldier support systems such as body armor, improved helmets, traumatic brain injury protection and trauma reduction.  Current MC4 Program efforts are focused on system engineering, testing, integration, and fielding automation infrastructure for Army users of the Theater Medical Information Program-Joint (TMIP-J) suite of software.  Effort has also been initiated to integrate MC4 with the Army CIO Network 2020 and Common Operating Environment (COE) and as a program of record in the Mobile\/Handheld Computing Environment Working Group.  Funding provides engineering, developmental testing, and integration of information management\/information technology to support Force Health Protection in accordance with the Army Equipment Modernization Plan.\n\nFY 2014 Base funding will be used for the engineering effort required to provide the Defense Health Information Management System (DHIMS) TMIP-J software on the Army platform, as well as the engineering effort for other Army unique capability.  Activities include:\n--Test augmentation to include development testing of TMIP, and other Army unique software capabilities\n--All other testing to include operational, security, acceptance of TMIP and other software products\n--Integration testing of all DHIMS\/TMIP, any follow-on tactical electronic medical record, and other software systems on the MC4 baseline electronic medical record system\n--Research of technologies to integrate software into Army future information infrastructure, such as exploration of virtualization for MC4\n--Evaluation of hardware technology obsolescence and solutions\n--Evaluation and testing of technology upgrades to include capabilities identification through market surveys and demonstrations\n--Evaluation of new health care capabilities not provided by DHIMS\/TMIP, e.g. telehealth\n--Test and evaluation of new capabilities and how well they work in the combat theater\n--Lab site studies with technology and scenarios\n--Interfaces with other systems, e.g. Nett Warrior and FBCB2"

The MC4 hardware is procured as Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) components.  Since TMIP software is a major component of the MC4 System, the MC4 Program will deliver capabilities in increments, recognizing the need for future system updates and Planned Upgrades.  The MC4 Program continues to work with the user community to continually define and refine additional requirements and match them with available technologies to provide the user enhanced capabilities.  These enhanced capabilities will be provided to the user at the earliest possible date.  This approach yields the most operationally useful and supportable capability in the shortest time possible with Cost As an Independent Variable.  Moreover, this approach provides an initial capability with the explicit intent of delivering improved and updated capability in subsequent updates and Planned Upgrades.  This evolutionary development approach will be accomplished through a rapid prototyping process that will progress the system from its current functional capabilities to fully integrated objective capabilities.  Appropriate commercial technology enhancements (e.g. advances in operating systems, voice activated technology, etc) will be incorporated into MC4 products and systems as they become available.  Each MC4 System component will undergo a full range of developmental testing to include software unit testing, integration testing, interoperability testing and software qualification testing. The MC4 system updates and Planned Upgrades will continue to undergo follow-on testing."

PM AcqBusiness is using an evolutionary acquisition strategy to acquire the capabilities in order to realize benefits early and reduce risk.  The full range of PM AcqBusiness Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) services will be achieved through an evolutionary implementation of individual components.  Each service is designed to federate cleanly with and leverage the capabilities provided by other SOA environments by leveraging an open-standards based approach to design.  Each PM AcqBusiness SOA service will implement new functionality, and may or may not utilize other already published SOA services.  Each service capability will be tested and then made available to consumers throughout the acquisition community and the Army.  This approach minimizes the cost incurred for testing the system, as well as minimizes release transition impacts on users.  PM AcqBusiness is using an evolutionary acquisition approach, incorporating the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software, and custom developed software to meet Army requirements.  In this approach, the maintenance release will be streamlined to expedite the fielding of a particular PM AcqBusiness software fix or upgrade.  Maintenance releases will be installed on an \"as needed\" basis after testing and approval by PM AcqBusiness.  This approach minimizes the time required to deliver new capabilities to users.  The PM AcqBusiness acquisition approach embraces the tenets of Subtitle III of Title 40, U.S.C. (Formerly the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  As such, the PM AcqBusiness is: (1) performing Business Process Reengineering (BPR) in advance of development of AcqBusiness capabilities.  AcqBusiness is primarily about changing how the acquisition business functions are done in the Army; (2) encouraging the purchase of commercial products and innovations from private industry;  (3) involving potential suppliers of SOA technology early in the requirements generation process; (4) employing outsourcing wherever possible; and (5) acquiring the AcqBusiness capabilities in interoperable modules, leveraging the evolutionary acquisition approach."

It will follow the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture which is aligned to the mandated Federal Enterprise Architecture. GFEBS was implemented to fulfill the needs and comply with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA), The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, and the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and to fulfill the stated mission of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller (ASA(FM&C)). GFEBS will replace financial systems operating in excess of 30 years including the Standard Finance Systems (STANFINS) and other costly feeder systems which do not allow the Department of Defense (DoD) or the U.S. government to achieve an unqualified opinion on its financial statements. GFEBS will become the Department of the Army's new core financial management system for administering its General Fund. GFEBS was developed using a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that is certified by the Chief, Financial Officer Council (CFOC) and provides the six core financial functions. GFEBS will allow tactical commanders to make informed decisions on a virtually real time system.\n\nOn 1 October 2008, GFEBS deployed to Wave 1 end users at Fort Jackson Garrison, Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) Indianapolis, Indiana and several other organizations. On 1 April 2009, GFEBS deployed to Wave 2 users at Fort Benning, Fort Stewart, DFAS Rome and several other organizations. Wave 3 deployed in October FY10, Wave 4 in January of FY11, Wave 5 in April 2011 and Wave 6 in July 2011. GFEBS is currently fielded to approximately 38,000 trained end users and the last development software release, Release 1.4.4, was fielded to all users in December 2011.  Each fielded release subsumes the previous release keeping all deployed sites executing under the same GFEBS release. The Full Deployment Decision was received by the Milestone Decision Authority on 24 June 2011.  In FY12 GFEBS deployed the remaining waves, 7-8, which encompass the remainder of the Active Army, Army Reserves, Army National Guard and select defense agencies. The Information Technology Development Project M05 provides GFEBS the ability to develop and build reports to meet auditability mandates and to accomplish efforts which enhance the GFEBS system with new reports and interfaces requiring technology development. It provides RDT&E funding to support evolutionary delivery of emerging capabilities.  Although the GFEBS baseline increment has received a full deployment decision, with the increase in users, new requirements emerge which were not necessarily included in the original scope but may provide a significant enhancement to the system, improve processes or may optimize a sub-element."

VIPS will enable a responsive, flexible and efficient means to qualify Applicants to meet manpower resource requirements for the uniformed Services, Coast Guard, and National Guard routine and contingency operations.  VIPS will be the future accessioning system to be used by the US Military Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM) which serves as the single entry point for determining the physical, aptitude, and conduct qualifications of candidates for enlistment.  VIPS will provide the capability to electronically acquire, process, store, secure, and seamlessly share personnel data across the Accessions Community of Interest (ACOI).  When fully implemented, VIPS will reduce the cycle time required to induct enlistees to meet the needs of Homeland Defense, reduce the number of visits to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS), reduce manual data entry errors, and reduce attrition through better pre-screening practices.  The implementation of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach will enable accession data to be securely available to applicants and ACOI partners such as Recruiting and Training Commands, Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), Military Health System, Human Resource Management (HRM), and Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO).  VIPS will support compliance with DoD direction for a net-centric environment and take advantage of automated data capture technology, e.g., medical equipment with the capability to capture and electronically transmit exam results.  The accessioning system of the future will be location independent, virtually paper-free, and automated to assist with bringing the right people at the right time to operational commanders.  On November 1, 2008, the DoD Business Transformation Agency (BTA) assumed program lead."

One is to prepare those systems for subsumption be the Integrated Personnel and Pay System(IPPS-A).  The other is to disconnect and upgrade those systems not being subsumed by IPPS-A.  Many systems have delayed upgrade do to the planned release of DIMHRS.   Systems that will be targeted by HRC to prepare for IPPS-A subsumption or upgrade are the Automated Orders and resources System (AORS), Army Selection Board System (ASBS), Data Base Administration Suite of System (DBA), Enlisted Distribution and Assignment system (EDAS), Enlisted Promotion Model (EPM), Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), Human Resource Command User Registration System (HURS), Integrated Total Army Personnel Database (ITAPDB), Officer Selection Support System (OSSS), Reserve Statistics Accounting System\/Reserve Component Common Personnel Data System (RSAS\/RCCPDS), Senior Enlisted Promotions Model (SEPM), Single Evaluation Processing System (SEPS), Soldier Management System Webified Suite of System (SMSWEB), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Enlisted (TAPDB-AE), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Officer (TAPDB-AO), Total Army Personnel Data Base - Active Reserve (TAPDB-AR), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System (TOPMIS), Total Officer Personnel Management Information System II (TOPMIS II), Keystone Request\/Retain System, and the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (iPERMS).\n     \nThe Program Planning Budget (PPB)- Business Operating System (BOS) will standardize and better integrate the transactional automated information systems used in the HQDA level programming and budgeting processes.  These systems are core to the PPBE business processes of the HQ for gathering programmatic requirements, balancing resources and delivering the Army's program budget to OSD.  This project is streamlining programming and budgeting processes and significantly improving strategic analysis capabilities.  The project is architecting, reengineering, streamlining and consolidating HQDA systems, feeder data base systems, and streamlining the associated processes.  These improvements will improve capability, eliminate redundancies and reduce overall cost of operations.  The PPB BOS project is complementary to the Army's General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) program.   It includes a new effort in FY14, the Army Contract Writing System, a replacement for the DoD Standard Procurement System (SPS).\n\nArmy Contract Writing System is the Army's strategy for a single enterprise-wide contract writing and management solution that will meet the Army's current critical functional contract writing requirements and expand to meet future functional needs.  The Army's goal is to streamline Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L) end-to-end business processes; reduce operating, maintenance and support costs; decrease, and where applicable, mitigate the number and complexity of existing and future interfaces; support financial auditability; as well as promote and improve efficiencies when integrating with existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions.  This is consistent with Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Memorandum; Department of Defense (DoD) Functional Contract Writing and Administration dated 21 October 2011, which directed that no new contracts were to be input into the DoD legacy Standard Procurement System (SPS) after 30 September 2015 and that all use of SPS would cease on 30 September 2017.  Funds are to perform all requisite activities to concurrently develop pre-Milestone A\/B documentation and perform pre-solicitations\/source selection activities expected of a projected ACAT IAM program in order to meet the USD AT&L timeline.  \n\nWill field the full operating capability of the Army Mapper system, which is the Army Geospatial data base of record and the HQDA repository for all Installation & Environment related geo-spatial data systems. \n\nThe Law Enforcement Advisory Program (LEAP), formerly known as the Criminal Information Management System (CIMS), is a collection of mission essential information technology (IT) systems within the Criminal Investigation Command (CIDC) and the Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG). USACIDC and OPMG has been tasked by the Army Health Promotion\/Risk Reduction (HP\/RR)task force to develop and integrate a unified, comprehensive enterprise program \/ system that shall house Classified and Unclassified - Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data which shall leverage existing and future Army LE enterprise information technology (IT) assets and other external data sources providing a full range of law enforcement functions to support business objectives and mission.  This new comprehensive enterprise system will be known as the Army Law Enforcement Reporting and Tracking System (ALERTS) and shall provide US Army LE stakeholders the enhanced capability to rapidly and efficiently manage a variety of LE and criminal intelligence \n(CrimIntel) functions; as well as a broader range of senior executive reporting requirements.  \n\nThe Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) is a web-based software system used at the Defense Forensics Science Center (DFSC), formerly known as the United States Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory (USACIL) at Fort Gillem, GA for the management of casework and tracking of all evidence received and processed.  The DFSC requires RDT&E funding to complete the configuration, installation and validation of additional LIMS modules in support of forensics (to include the Materials Management,Equipment Management, Proficiency Testing, Training and Crime Scene support); and, to support the development, configuration and implementation of an Expeditionary Forensics Laboratory Information Management System (eLIMS)  in theater.  The eLIMS is the conduit between the deployed labs and the laboratory located at Ft. Gillem.  The eLIMS would provide the forensic analysts with the ability to collect, track, store and analyze evidence collected from battlefield crime scenes at required competency levels of testing and calibration.  It will allow the results to be electronically maintained and transmitted to the permanent physical lab at Ft. Gillem, Ga.\nIn addition, the system would afford the analysts electronic access to shared case management and evidence databases at the LAB from their deployed positions.  At the current configuration of LIMS from CONUS locations, transmission of case related information can be processed in real time; however, transmission of case related information in theater takes\napproximately 1-2 hours.  If requirements are not funded, the DFSC will not be able to complete and implement the additional forensic modules for the core LIMS or develop and implement the eLIMS for the deployable labs. The stated objective will be delayed, resulting in a less than efficient process for handling of cases in theater and an inability to meet acceptable levels of turnaround time for casework."

The LEAP program will provide criminal intelligence querying and reporting capabilities in compliance with regulatory and policy standards for Army Law Enforcement regarding investigation of felony crimes.  LEAP will captures criminal case investigative information regarding incidents, location descriptors, entities (name, social security number, rank, title, physical characteristics, sex, birth place, and date), agent assignment, crime description and identifiers, statements, property data, laboratory tests; verifies and stores this data for criminal intelligence purposes: and reports this information to the proper authorities from the Division Commanding Officer to the United States Grand Jury.  The system will extract necessary data for consolidation and input to Defense Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS) monthly reports, National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) monthly reports and the Defense Clearance and Investigations Index (DCII) daily updates.
