This research focuses on dual band infrared (IR) FPAs necessary to search, identify and track mobile targets in all day\/night visibility and battlefield conditions and to improve standoff detection in ground-to-ground and air-to-ground operations.  This project designs, fabricates and validates very large format IR FPAs needed for sensors to simultaneously provide wide area coverage and the high resolution for situational awareness, persistent surveillance and plume\/gunflash detection.  In addition this project develops multispectral and hyperspectral algorithms for on-chip hyperspectral functionality, which offer the ability to perform detection, identification and signature identification at extended ranges as well as the ability to detect targets in \"deep hide\".
