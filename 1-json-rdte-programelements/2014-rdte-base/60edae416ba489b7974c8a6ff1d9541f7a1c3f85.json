The GCSS-AF program modernizes, consolidates, develops, and integrates Air Force and Department of Defense combat support information systems.  \n\nThe modernized system is being developed in compliance with and hosted on the Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), DISA's solution to connect people and systems that have information (data and services) with those who need information, replacing the DII COE.  The modernized system is implemented and sustained worldwide and supports both wartime and peacetime requirements using hardware, software, and communications capabilities available from standard open systems government contracts and communications infrastructure programs.  \n\nIn this manner, GCSS-AF avoids added costs, removes business processing inefficiencies, reduces deployment footprint, and improves the speed with which information flows. GCSS-AF also supports the Global Force Management - Data Initiative (GFM-DI) as a hosted application within its common infrastructure. \n\nActivities also include:  Studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning and continued test and evaluation critical to avoid technical obsolescence of this critical infrastructure.  Development of an automated risk management tool to mitigate increased cyber threats to Air Force Information Technologies and provide an automated risk management tool that integrates assessment and analysis from an enterprise level, address increased threat to Air Force data, and revamp stove-piped responses to attacks, including associated testing and evaluation as well as potential engineering of COTS-based solutions.  Other development activities for Platform as a Service (PAAS) and Software as a Service (SAAS) are directly aligned with GCSS-AF's service oriented framework and the movement of infrastructure and services to a Cloud Computer Environment (CCE).\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
