Training devices and training simulations contribute to the modernization of the forces by enabling and strengthening combat effectiveness through realistic training solutions for the Warfighter.  Training devices maximize the transfer of knowledge, skills, and experience from the training situation to a combat situation.  Force-on-force training at the National Training Center (NTC), Ft. Irwin, CA; Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC), Ft. Polk, LA, and Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC), formerly the Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC), Hohenfels, Germany; and battle staff training in Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) provide increased combat readiness through realistic collective training in low, mid, and high intensity scenarios.  Project 241, Non-System Training Devices-Combined Arms, develops simulation training devices for Army-wide use, including the CTCs.  Project 573 funds key organizational support to Army\/DoD Transformation via innovative simulation and training device efforts.  Program Executive Office (PEO) Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (STRI's) unique geographic co-location with other services facilitates joint training solutions in a common environment.  \n \nFY 2014 Project 241 funds significant development efforts on the Combat Training Center Instrumentation Systems (CTC-IS), Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA), Engagement Skills Trainer 2000 (EST 2000), Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC), One Tactical Engagement Simulation System (OneTESS), and further implementation of Live Training Transformation (LT2) through development of the Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA).\n\nFY 2014 Project 573 will provide for minimum PEO STRI core operations supporting development of training devices and simulations by PEO STRI's four Project Management Offices."

                            "val": "This project supports development of prototype training devices to support Combined Arms (Infantry, Armor, Aviation, Air Defense, Artillery, Engineer, Chemical, and Support troops) training and multi-system training within the Army, to include the Reserve Components.\n  \nCommon Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA) provides the common product-line architecture, product line software, standards, services, and architecture framework for developing the Live Training Transformation (LT2) Product Line of live training systems supporting Army-wide live instrumented Force-On-Force (FOF) and Force-On-Target (FOT) training requirements and is the core live architecture for the Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC-ITE).\n  \nCombat Training Center Instrumentation System (CTC-IS) funds the continued development of the existing Instrumentation Systems (IS) at the National Training Center (NTC), Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) and Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC). Also, CTC-IS funds the continued development of the Range Communication System at the NTC and JRTC, to provide high-fidelity live, virtual, and constructive brigade training rotations which prepare Brigade Combat Teams, Joint partners, and supporting units to deploy in support of Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN).  CTC-IS develops new data communications systems increasing tracking accuracy and coverage at the CTCs to provide greater training fidelity to training units.  \n\nThe Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC) program provides a standardized, combat medical training capability to sustain and validate Combat Medic skills and to support Combat Lifesaver training for Active, Reserve and the Army National Guard components, using both classroom and simulated battlefield conditions to better prepare Soldiers for the application of medical interventions under combat conditions. Each MSTC system is made up of sub-systems that include the Virtual Patient System (VPS), Instruction Support System (ISS) and facility, Medical Training-Command and Control (MT-C2), and the Medical Training Evaluation System (MTES).\n\nThe Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a virtual, small arms, marksmanship training simulator for teams and squads with a standard mix of light, heavy and crew-served weapons used in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and support of Unified Land Operations (ULO). The EST provides training for individual marksmanship, small unit collective gunnery skills and tactical training. It incorporates judgmental use of force, including escalation of force and graduated response scenarios.  As the only validated and accredited virtual small arms training system, the EST is a critical element of the U.S. Army's gated marksmanship training strategy.\n\nThe Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA) provides a net-centric linkage that collects, retrieves and exchanges data among existing Training Aids, Devices, Simulations, and Simulators (TADSS) and Mission Command Systems (Joint and Army). The LVC-IA defines the \"how\" information is exchanged among the different LVC domains and the Mission Command Systems.  The LVC-IA provides enterprise level tools for exercise control, after action review, and system information assurance.  It also provides hardware and software to interface the different Live, Virtual and Constructive communication protocols and provides a correlated common operating picture for the training audience on their organic Mission Command equipment.  The integration of the Live, Virtual, and Constructive TADSS with the Mission Command equipment will enable larger, more robust training events better preparing U.S. Soldiers for their missions at an overall reduced cost.  The end-state goal is an LVC Integrated Training Environment that can approximate Operational Environments in a cost effective manner to provide a high level of value-added training and mission rehearsal opportunities to Army Commanders and their Soldiers. \n\nOne Tactical Engagement Simulation System (OneTESS) develops a live, precision, combined arms Force-on-Force Indirect Fire training capability for Brigade and below exercises at Homestation, Maneuver Combat Training Centers and deployed sites. OneTESS will provide realistic, real-time casualty effects for Force-on-Force tactical engagement training scenarios and the capability to integrate into training instrumentation systems to provide for high fidelity combined arms combat exercises. It is interoperable with current and future Instrumentable-Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES) Line of Sight (LOS) laser based systems.\n\nIntegration and Interoperability (I2) integrates activities and products of current programs of record across the entire PEO STRI portfolio.  I2 baselines persistent interoperability in PEO fielded systems, addresses current issues to facilitate interoperability, institutionalizes a common products\/product line management approach and standards\/policies across training\/test, non-system\/system and modeling and simulation domains.\n\nFY 2014 Project 241 funds significant development efforts on the Combat Training Center Instrumentation Systems (CTC-IS), Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA), Engagement Skills Trainer (EST), Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC), One Tactical Engagement Simulation System (OneTESS), and further implementation of Live Training Transformation (LT2) through development of the Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA)."
