            "val": "This program element (PE) supports upgrading the accuracy, timeliness, availability, and accessibility of scientific, technical, and management information at all levels of the Army Research and Development (R&D) community.  Management of this information is critical to achieve the goals established by the Army's Senior Leadership.  Use of accurate and timely technical information is essential to successfully meeting the milestones required on the path to the future force, allowing Army Science and Technology (S&T) leadership to refine investment strategy and quickly react to emerging opportunities and issues.  This program includes initiatives to improve information derivation, storage, access, display, validation, transmission, distribution, and interpretation; to develop and enhance a single business model for Army S&T knowledge management information technology; to provide for Independent Review Team analysis of technology maturity as part of the Technology Area Readiness Assessment as required by DoDI 5000.2 dated May 12, 2003 as well as the Army Science Board (ASB) (projects 720 and 727).  This program addresses the need to increase the competitiveness and availability of scientific, engineering, and technical skills in the DoD and National workforce through outreach programs aimed at middle school through college students and teachers.  By providing direct working experience for these students in Army laboratories, the programs expose these students to the working world of science and engineering (project 729).  The program includes funding for studies and analyses using behavioral science-based analytic tools to provide policy and decision makers with Soldier-oriented recommendations concerning manpower, personnel, and training issues (project 730).  The program includes funding for support for Army high performance computing centers (project 731).  The program includes funding for improvements to the Army's acquisition process (project 733).  This program supports combatant commanders and major Army commands by providing science advisors to address scientific and technical issues and by providing engineering teams to solve field Army technical problems (project C16).  Finally, this program funds studies by the Board on Army Science and Technology (BAST) (project C18).  Coordination of this program with the other Services is achieved through inter-service working groups.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secreatary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, the Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, Arlington, VA, the Army Corps of Engineers' Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, MS, Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC), Ft.

Effective exploitation of science and technology (S&T) information is critical to achieving the goals established by senior Army leadership.  Activities include Army support for Federal Laboratory Consortium (FLC) as required by Public Law; the Army Science Board; the Army Science Conference; S&T database management efforts; and administration of the Army's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) in accordance with the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982, the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992 and subsequent reauthorizing legislation.  Technology transfer activities make technical information available to both the public and private sectors to reduce duplication in Research and Development programs and to increase competitiveness in the US business community.  Database management efforts support development of decision aids, databases, and automation support for the management and execution of the Army Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) appropriation.

Activities are consolidated under the Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP) which links and networks appropriate components to derive the best synergies to \"present the Army\" a larger pool of technical talent.  Programs  provide students with Army-unique practical experiences at Army laboratories, centers, and institutes; provide incentives for student competitions and support career development opportunities for students.  AEOP increases interest and involvement of students and teachers across the nation in STEM at all proficiency levels and backgrounds to include under-represented and economically disadvantaged groups through exposure to Army sponsored research, education, competitions, internships, and practical experiences.  This project enhances the national pool of science and engineering personnel that in turn supports defense industry and Army laboratory and research, development, and engineering center needs.  Educating the nation's youth in STEM will help ensure a technologically literate citizenry that is required to promote the security and economic competitiveness of the United States. \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secreatary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nWork is performed by the Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Army Research Institute (ARI), the Army Corps of Engineers, Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC), and Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC)."

The FAST program provides Science advisers, recruited from Army Materiel Command (AMC) headquarters and all AMC Major Subordinate Commands (MSC) to serve combatant commands and major commands worldwide.  FAST tours of duty provide significant professional growth opportunities for the Army's scientists and engineers and enable them to focus AMC resources on rapidly identifying and solving field technical problems that enable the improvement of readiness, safety, training, and reduce operations and support (O&S) costs.  The FAST activity is supported by Quick Reaction Coordinators within the engineering centers.  The FAST program recoups many times its cost in O&S savings.  FAST also provides emerging technology demonstration opportunities to the engineering centers and executes a biannual Technology Applications Conference (TAC) on a rotating basis between Forces Command, US Army Europe, US Forces Korea\/Eighth Armyassists COCOMS with their annual Science and Technology Conferences.  FAST also maintains close coordination with the Navy Science Advisor Program (Naval Fleet Forces Technology Integration Office).FAST supports warfighters in OEF with embedded Science and Technology Assistance Teams (STATs) as well as Science and Technology Acquisition Corps Advisors (STACAs).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Materiel Command (AMC), Ft.
