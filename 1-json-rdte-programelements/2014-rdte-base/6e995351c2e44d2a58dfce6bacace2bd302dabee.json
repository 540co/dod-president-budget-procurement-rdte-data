They are Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) Increment 1 and Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS).  In FY14, the program office will initiate the execution of the AFATDS Increment 2 requirements. \n\nAFATDS provides the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications and functions as the land component\u2019s automated Fire Support Command and Control (FSC2) system.  AFATDS is used in the Fires Warfighting Function to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects within the overall Mission Command and Control (MC2) enterprise. Additionally, the system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, to include Navy and Air Force command and control weapon systems; and the German, French, Turkish, and Italian fire support systems.  \n\nAFATDS fuses the essential situational awareness (SA) data, intelligence information and targeting data, in near real time, in order to effectively manage target selection and target engagement in accordance with the Maneuver Commanders guidance and priorities.  Additionally, the system will pair targets to weapons to provide optimum use of fire support assets and timely execution of fire missions.  Also, the system automates the planning, coordinating, and controlling of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).  Furthermore, the system will automatically implement detailed commander\u2019s guidance in the automation of operational planning, movement control, targeting, target value analysis, and fire support planning. Currently, the system interoperates with the other Army mission command systems, and is being used in operations in Afghanistan. The program office is currently fielding non-developmental, rugged common hardware, running the Windows Operating System. The total force will be fielded a Windows based platform by fiscal year 2013.  Currently, AFATDS Version 6.8 and 6.8.X are being developed and expect to achieve Full Materiel Releases (FMR) in 2Q FY2013 and 2Q FY2015.  With the completion of AFATDS Version 6.8.X, the program office will complete the AFATDS Increment 1 requirements and will start the Increment 2 development in 4Q FY2014.  \n\nJADOCS is a Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental and Multinational (JIIM) Targeting, Mission Management, and Common Operational Picture (COP) Windows-based software suite which functions as a complementary system to the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). JADOCS provides integration and synergy between multiple Command & Control (C2) systems of the uniformed services, and joint and combined elements involved in the targeting process and performs coordination and calculates collateral damage. JADOCS Mission Managers support this coordination amongst Warfighter functional areas to rapidly execute critical missions. JADOCS enables coordination and de-confliction of conventional and asymmetric war-fighting missions. JADOCS is fielded to Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Army units involved in the targeting process at Division, Corps and Echelons Above Corps. JADOCS provides the Combatant Commands with the capability to plan and direct theater counter-fire and precision strike operations through the real time synchronization of US and Coalition assets. The application provides the Warfighter with a combination of tools, services and Mission Managers for rapid \"system of systems\" integration, visualization, coordination and deconfliction of critical mission information. It not only enhances Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems in the areas of strike planning but also in SA, joint and combined interoperability and force transition in war."

This hot start capability allows for rapid post-launch time-to-first-fix of GPS signal and maximum utilization of PGM maneuver authority to ensure required target engagement performance.  This is especially critical for short flight times and steer-early solutions such as Mortar and Cannon based PGMs.  Local GPS Satellite visibility challenges due to vertical terrain\/complex environment issues during normal combat operations can prohibit Precision Capable Fires when using GPS Satellite data generated exclusively at the Firing Weapon Platform.   A system-of-systems Network Assisted GPS capability will be developed, integrated, and validated to overcome local GPS Satellite masking problems through the sharing of sufficient timely required GPS Satellite data via Wide-Area Network (WAN) and Local-Area Network (LAN) based materiel solutions that effectively and efficiently leverage mature Technologies and taxpayer investments of existing acquisition programs."

Increment 2 will permit the management and targetability of the collective and coordinated target acquisition data, effective selection of munitions-target pairing from indirect fire weapons (land and sea based), as well as fixed and rotary wing aircraft against targets located throughout an area of operations.  AFATDS Increment 2 will be used to actively plan offensive information operations and exploit electronic attack weapon systems through the use of planning tools for effects and the status and readiness of the systems that can best support the commander's intent.  AFATDS Increment 2, through a network of Fires assets, can assist the commander to accomplish these tasks using it at the operational and tactical levels of war from the Soldier, Sailor, and Marine fighting the tactical fight to the operational staff preparing for the future fight.  AFATDS Increment 2 will provide the supported maneuver commander the capability to plan, coordinate, rehearse, and execute integrated networked fires.  Networked fires will include lethal and non-lethal effects producing weapon platforms and the empowerment of knowing, within seconds, the lethal status and availability of the fires platforms within the commander's area of influence, which include air, sea, and land-based weapon platforms.  Net-centricity will enable the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) commander to view targets that adjacent BCTs have encountered or engaged in their area of operations.  This capability enables the commander to:  exploit under-tasked air support assets, view\/task weapons platforms based on coordinated command-supported relationships, and search target data files and repositories.  Using the web-based tools, the BCT commander can access higher command centers via search wizards over Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) portals and internet gateways to the Global Information Grid (GIG). There is an operational need to provide Fires data to a central database repository within the BCT.  That repository will be accessible through network addressing or web-enabled search wizards to locate information relative to a certain maneuver element, within a BCT or adjacent BCTs, thus supporting unified battle command.  AFATDS Increment 2 will provide three distinct applications that interface via Local Area Network\/Tactical Communications Protocol\/Internet Protocol\/User Datagram Protocol(LAN\/TCP\/IP\/UDP) addressing with a common core database and core system functions\/management that resides on a remote battle command server.  The three applications\u2013Fire Support, Fire Control, and Fire Direction\u2013will support role-based functionality and provide a less complicated AFATDS package to the Warfighter."

It has been updated with subsequent releases reflecting the Spiral development strategy of the program. With the completion of AFATDS Version 6.8.X in 2Q FY2015, AFATDS Increment 1 will have achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC).\n\nThe Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) issued a memorandum in June 2011 approving the Capability Development Document (CDD) for AFATDS Increment 2. Additionally in the memorandum, the JROC validated the Key Performance Parameters, assigned oversight authority to the Fires Center of Excellences Fire Support Command and Control Tactical Software Governance Board, and set a funding ceiling. These actions support the use of the emerging DoD 5000 systems acquisition approach for Information Technology (IT) (IT Box model). AFATDS Increment 2 development will follow the IT Box Model for systems acquisition.  AFATDS Increment 2 will be developed using an incremental approach that will employ fielded and emerging digital platforms, communications systems technology and architecture, and spaced-based systems, to virtually interconnect via web-enabled networks to exploit the capabilities of Fires platforms and precision munitions.  Increment 2 will provide a surface-to-surface Joint Fires asset manager building on the existing capabilities and functions of the current fielded AFATDS. It will provide additional targeting and decision aids, Situational Awareness (SA), Battlefield Visualization, Information Operations (IO) management aids, and control\/coordination and synchronization capabilities for all types of Fires assets to include electronic attack. The AFATDS Increment 2, unlike the current increment of AFATDS, will be based on a net-centric application with open modular service oriented architecture and a decentralized processing approach, which will make it effective, flexible, survivable, mobile, user friendly, and simple to maintain. This increment will also be developed to enable the establishment of detached or decentralized work platforms and applications when network services or connections are not available.  Using the current AFATDS Increment 1 software and functionality as a basis, AFATDS Increment 2 will provide three distinct software applications \u2013 Fire Direction, Fire Control, and Fire Support -  that will provide a less complicated AFATDS package to the Warfighter that will simplify training and support ease of use.  The fire direction application will provide the battery and platoon FDC's the functionality to perform mission processing and reporting.  The fire control application will permit the user to analyze the systems in his command supported relationship and supporting units. The Fire Support application will be used for coordination of fires assets within his area of influence primarily at Fire Support Elements (FSEs) and Fire Support Coordination Cells (FSCCs.).  AFATDS Increment 2 capabilities will be developed over three distinct software versions - Versions 6.9, 7.0 and 7.1.  It is planned to award AFATDS Version 6.9 via full and open competition.  The acquisition strategy for the award of the follow on versions of AFATDS software will be determined after the award of the Version 6.9 software Preliminary Design Review.\n\nAFATDS v6.9 will modernize and re-architect the AFATDS software to align with the requirements of the Inc 2 CDD."

The Vice Chief of Staff of the Army approved JADOCS for acquisition program status under the Capabilities Development for Rapid  Transition (CDRT) process. The approved JADOCS Capability Production Document (CPD) dated 16 April 2012, documents the current JADOCS threshold capabilities that are in the field today. As the lead agency for managing JADOCS capabilities within the Department of Defense, the Fires Center of Excellence, tailored the JADOCS CPD to incorporate Field Artillery tasks not included in the currently fielded version (v 1.0.5.1) of the software. JADOCS retirement will occur when system capabilities are individually or collectively incorporated into Army, Service, or Joint programs or are no longer needed as determined by its multi-Service users. JADOCS Increment 1 will be managed as an Information Technology (IT) program under the IT Box Construct with periodic software updates. JADOCS Increment 1 will support any software refinements \/ modifications to enable enhancements identified by the Warfighter. Future increments of JADOCS will address operational lessons learned, changes in the Joint Operation Centers (JOCs) and the Joint Information Center (JIC), integrated architectures and optimizing the use of the Global Information Grid (GIG) with web based applications.\n\nThe JADOCS program strategy is to capture and sustain JADOCS capabilities IAW the approved JADOCS CPD dated 16 April 2012. All JADOCS Targeting and Fires capabilities required by the US Army and US Marine Corps, not already in AFATDS, will be captured in the AFATDS Increment 1 product, along with any appropriate interoperability, architecture modernization and web application modernizations that may be needed. All other capabilities will be captured in other Army, Service or Joint programs or otherwise sustained, updated, and enhanced as specified by the Warfighter in future increments of JADOCS (until no longer needed as determined by its multi-Service users). An objective of the Increment 1 effort will be to modernize the JADOCS software and develop JADOCS widgets and provide inter- widget communications in accordance with TCM Fires Cells requirements and the requirements of COE. These widgets will support the Warfighting Function (WFF) for the sharing of data and collaboration between unit Commanders and their Staff sections.\n\nA draft JADOCS Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) has been prepared and is currently under review by the HQDA staff.  This ADM will be presented to the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) for review and signature.  It is expected that the AAE will sign the ADM in April 2013.  Under the provisions of the ADM, JADOCS will be established as a formal Army Acquisition Program with milestone decision authority (MDA) delegated to the Program Executive Office, Command, Control and Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) and entry into the acquisition life cycle at Milestone C.  It is projected that the Milestone C Decision Review will be held in 2QFY14."
