These emerging technologies provide Department of Defense (DoD) warfighters and commanders with an important capability that supports such missions as base access, force protection, maritime intercept and counter-piracy operations, counterintelligence screening, humanitarian assistance and displaced persons management.  Additionally, the biometrics and identity information collected during DoD missions are shared with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and the Department of Justice, to support homeland defense, law enforcement, and other national interests.  \n\nIn October 2006, the Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) as Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for biometrics.  In April 2011, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) was designated as the PSA for forensics.   The PSAs for biometrics and forensics have the responsibility to fully address and exercise control over all facets of the DoD\u2019s biometrics and forensics programs, initiatives and technologies.  A central role of the Biometrics and Forensics Science & Technology Program is to support each respective PSA in addressing the technology gaps that preclude our ability to quickly and accurately identify anonymous individuals who threaten our interests and provide the ability to attribute enemy activity to a specific individual. \n\nThe Biometrics and Forensics Program develops an annual comprehensive science and technology (S&T) plan and implements multiple projects to advance capabilities in both biometrics and forensics.

Six projects were focused on biometrics and transitioned to the Army as the Executive Agent for Biometrics.  Three of the projects were focused on forensics and were transitioned to the Army as the Executive Agent for Forensics.  Close coordination between biometrics and forensics operational users and the respective S&T communities helped ensure each delivered product was transitioned to operational use.  The Biometrics transition rate of 100 percent for FY 2012 exceeds the 40 percent benchmark established by DoD Strategic Objective 3.5 - 2D.\n\nIn addition, project performance metrics specific to each effort are identified in the project plan, and individual project success will be monitored through these metrics.  The metrics include items such as target dates from project work break down schedules, production measures, production goals, production numbers and demonstration goals and dates."
