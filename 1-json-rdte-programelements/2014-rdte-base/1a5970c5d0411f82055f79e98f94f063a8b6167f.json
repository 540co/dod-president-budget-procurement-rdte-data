The Logistics R&D program develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that will provide a significantly higher level of support at lower costs, than would be otherwise attainable.  The program has a proven track record of implementation and benefits.  One example is the Department of Defense (DOD) Electronic MALL (EMALL).  DOD EMALL was the first web based, distributed architecture on-line ordering capability.  It has been adopted by the Army, Navy and the Department of Homeland Security.  DLA\u2019s overall Log R&D program has demonstrated positive net present value and a positive return on investment."

Planning Process Improvement:  The program improves elements of current inventory policy models, assesses potential benefits of new technologies and seeks more efficient approaches to deliver customer requirements while reducing inventory   and order fulfillment costs.  \n\n2.)  Technical\/Quality Process Improvement:  The program improves internal efficiency and customer satisfaction through new tools and methods to proactively address supply issues resulting from current technical\/quality processes.  \n\n3.)

Another new project wherein suppliers manage the ordering and delivery of parts for DLA wholesale stock was initiated to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept and its benefits in cost reduction and support to the warfighter. Other projects to improve Customer Collaboration and develop ways to match acquisition strategies to industry capabilities were initiated.  Both projects completing in FY2012 transitioned in FY2012.\n\nTechnical\/Quality Process Improvement: The PQDR Analysis Tool was transitioned to full operation across the DLA enterprise as part of the Product Data Reporting and Evaluation Program at NAVSEA Portsmouth, whose intention is to ultimately make it available throughout DoD. The projects to transition the Counterfeit Parts Strategic Roadmap and Product Verification Process improvements were completed during the year, and transition began. The DNA Marking Feasibility Demonstration project showed such success that the Director decided to mandate use of the technology for all microcircuit items in FSC 5962 beginning in July 2012, and efforts were directed to support the Technical\/Quality Process Owner in implementing that direction.  The Connectors Working Group project to reduce duplicate or unnecessary connectors in the Federal Catalog was unsuccessful and was stopped.  A follow-on project was initiated to improve the Product Verification Process.  Three projects of the four projects completing in FY2012 transitioned in FY2012.\n\nProcurement Process Improvement:  The Decision Support project to evaluate the capabilities of a number of commercially available tools to detect fraudulent practices early \u2013 before award if possible \u2013 and define requirements for a DLA-wide decision support capability was continued through the year. No projects will complete in FY2012."
