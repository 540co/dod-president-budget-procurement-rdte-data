The development program also enables AMRAAM to be compatible with advanced fighters, enhances AMRAAM capability and operational flexibility against current and projected threats, incorporates high payoff technology development, performs risk reduction activities and investigates new variants and\/or alternate missions which may use AMRAAM attributes. The latest AMRAAM variant, the AIM-120D, delivers improved performance via Global Positioning System (GPS) aided navigation, a two-way datalink capability for enhanced aircrew survivability and improved network compatibility, and incorporates new guidance software which improves kinematic performance and weapon effectiveness. The AIM-120D Operational Test Readiness Review was successfully completed in May 2012 and the program is in dedicated Operational Testing (OT).  The aircraft integration program maintains compatibility\/performance of the missile with changes occurring on the F\/A-18E\/F, F-15C\/D\/E, F-16, F-22A, and F-18 C\/D platforms.  To keep the existing inventory as effective as possible, the Air Force and Navy also develop, test, and field improvements that are implemented via software upgrades reprogrammed into fielded AMRAAMs (AIM-120As, Bs, and Cs), and\/or hardware upgrades inserted into production units.  AMRAAM is a joint Air Force\/Navy, Acquisition Category IC (ACAT IC) program with Air Force as lead service. \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7-Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

The System Improvement Program, Increment 1 (SIP-1) has begun and is expected to field in late FY14.  Additional SIP increments are in the planning phase and will further improve the AIM-120D to meet emerging warfighter requirements.\n\nThe Electronic Protection Improvement Program (EPIP) is also underway, with the initial capabilities currently in flight testing.  EPIP Basic capabilities will field in FY14.  The EPIP effort will keep AIM-120C missiles capable against the growing electronic attack threat environment.  Additional capabilities (EPIP Advanced) are in the detail design stage with initial fielding projected for FY15."
