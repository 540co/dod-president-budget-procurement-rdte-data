Consistent with strategic guidance, the JE program targets DoD\u2019s highest priority joint capability gaps.  \nThe intent of the JE program is to enable trained, ready and adaptable joint forces, and improve capabilities of the current and future joint force.  The JE program focuses on producing new conceptual approaches and proposed solutions to combatant command and Service defined problems through the development of actionable joint force improvement recommendations in the critical considerations of joint doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P).  \nThe JE program primarily benefits combatant commanders and Services, and provides collateral benefits to DoD Agencies and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  JE routinely provides indirect benefit to interagency and multinational partners and international organizations with whom the US participates during coalition operations.  \nThe JE Program is carried out by the JCD&E community, comprised of all combatant commands, the Services, the National Guard Bureau, the Joint Staff, OSD, and several DoD agencies.  The Joint Staff leads the JCD&E community.  Other participants in JE activities include a broad range of interagency partners as well as multinational, academic, and private sector agencies.  The Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research & Engineering (ASD(R&E)) within OSD helps provides oversight to ensure alignment with strategic guidance.  \nFlexibility is maintained in the JE Program to address emergent requirements identified by DoD leadership.  Joint experimentation is complementary to Service experimentation.  Where possible, the JCD&E community leverages Service experimentation to address joint challenges.   Joint\/Service experimentation is coordinated within the JCD&E community to cover gaps and pursue efficiency, and the results are shared throughout the community.    \nprojects are categorized by functional joint capability areas (JCAs) which help enable already-established functional capability boards to rigorously vet JE recommendations among subject matter matters throughout the joint community before those recommendations are approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).  For FY12, these categories include Battlespace Awareness, Logistics, Building Partnerships, Command and Control, Force Application, Net-Centric and Protection."

Each Joint Capability Area had unique areas of focus:  \n\nBattlespace Awareness (BA):  The FY12 campaign Included capabilities and concepts required to succeed in preventing proliferation and countering weapons of mass destruction.   The scope of the work also includes experimentation to identify and evaluate enabling technologies that lengthen detection ranges and strengthen ISR and communications ties between special and general purpose forces.\n\nLogistics (LOG): Joint Force Commanders require responsive, agile logistics support to project force, sustain operations and ensure freedom of action wherever the force engages and in whatever form the engagement takes.  The FY12 JCD&E program of work in LOG addresses existing and projected mission critical capabilities and conceptual gaps required to project, sustain, and employ the joint force in all operations.  The scope of work includes experimentation to identify and evaluate enabling technologies and non-materiel solutions that create mechanisms to facilitate more rapid transfer of critical materiel.\n\nBuilding Partnerships (BP):  The FY12 campaign addresses projected mission critical capabilities and concepts required to build security capacity of partner states. The scope of the work includes security and engagement activities per the Capstone Concept for Joint Operations (CCJO) and experimentation to identify and evaluate enabling technologies to enhance US capability to increase the security capacity of partner states.  Specific focus areas for FY12 include:\n-Strengthen and institutionalize General Purpose Force capabilities in conducting security force assistance missions \n-Increase socio-cultural\/ human terrain awareness of the force \n-Increase information sharing capacity between US and partner states and within partner states \n-Develop collaborative planning and assessment tools to support of security force operations \n-Improve effective and efficient methods to provision logistical support to partner states\n\nCommand and Control (C2): The FY 2012 (FY12) JCD&E program of work in C2 includes projected mission critical capabilities and concepts required to effectively command and control the joint force. Specific focus areas for FY12 include experiments on secure, robust and reliable networks to provide responsive command and control in complex chaotic and degraded information environments to integrate and share information with a full range of partners\n\nForce Application (FA): Joint Force Commanders (JFCs) require improved kinetic or non-kinetic capabilities to maneuver and engage adversaries from political, strategic, operational, and tactical perspectives.  The FY 2012 JCD&E program of work in FA addresses projected mission critical capabilities and concepts required to deter and defeat aggression in anti-access\/area denial (A2\/AD) environments.  The scope of work includes experimentation to identify and evaluate enabling technologies that focus on electronic warfare, long range strike, and undersea superiority.\n\nNet-Centric: Joint Force Commanders require a framework for full human and technical connectivity and interoperability that allows all DOD users and mission partners to understand and act on information with confidence, and protects information from those who should not have it.  The FY 2012 JCD&E program of work in the Net-Centric JCA addresses projected mission critical capabilities and concepts required to deter and defeat aggression in anti-access and area denial (A2\/AD) environments.  The scope includes experimentation to identify and evaluate enabling technologies that focus assuring access to space and use of space-based assets.\n\nProtection (PR):  The FY 2012 JCD&E Program of Work (PoW) in PR addresses key capabilities and concepts related to force protection in all domains."
