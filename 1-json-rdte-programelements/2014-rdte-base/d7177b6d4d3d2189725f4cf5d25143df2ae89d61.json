This effort promotes innovative networked systems management capabilities to provide broad situational awareness and manage EW services delivery in a coordinated and collaborative manner.  All impacts on the ability to precisely deliver EW effects (environment, adversary spectrum activities, dynamic platform motion, etc.) while minimizing blue force side effects will be assessed.  Because this venue will employ many developmental and existing UAS, a goal is to include a component to allow assessment of the vulnerability of these UAS to EW effects.\n\nAdvanced Concepts Development\/Demonstration:\n\nAdvanced Threat Countermeasures \u2013 This effort focuses on the investigation of innovative, low cost, near-term Countermeasures (CM) solutions that can be rapidly fielded to counter new classes of advanced missile seekers.  It builds on prior work with the Services (signature collections and analyses of CM delivery mechanisms) to begin the process of assessing potential CM solutions.\n\nSoftware Programmable\/Spectrum Diverse Electronic Attack (EA) Capability \u2013 Opportunities exist to adapt existing technology used for communication and other purposes into highly configurable EA capability.  This technology will help counter adversary movement into advanced military purpose digital electronic systems.  Beginning in FY 2014 JEAT will begin to adapt software configurable communications technology to be used as part of a distributed, networked, EA capability that can be readily adapted for installation in a wide variety of host platforms.\n\nInnovative Technology Exploration:\n\nAdaptive\/Asymmetric Technology \u2013 This effort directly supports ASD(R&E), EW and CM by performing analyses and studies of emerging asymmetric threats.  Past efforts under this JEAT project include the Aircraft Survivability Equipment Joint Analysis Team and the Helicopter Survivability Task Force, both of which resulted in significant strategic technology investments by the Department."

These unfused sensors create a serial information stream which can induce an inadequate response to the threat.
