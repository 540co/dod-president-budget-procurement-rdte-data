The MTPS project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse SOF training systems.  \n\nSub-projects include:\n\n\u2022  Special Operations Mission Planning Environment (SOMPE): Develops, integrates, tests, and validates software enhancements required to meet SOF-unique requirements for, and correct deficiencies to, mission planning, preview, and execution software tools to support all phases of SOF operations from deliberate to time critical.  The SOMPE project automates time-sensitive planning activities and provides enhanced situational awareness during mission execution.  SOMPE provides the interoperable environment for SOF adaptive planning to integrate global operations including, but not limited to, precision strike software, digital navigation, and unmanned aerial systems command and control.  This project also provides the integration of SOMPE with multi-dimensional visualization systems, providing immersive mission rehearsal in minimal timeframes from the SOMPE mission plan.  SOMPE is embedded in the USSOCOM Headquarters, Theater Special Operations Commands, Joint Special Operations Task Forces, Joint Special Operations Aviation Components, SOF warfighters, and SOF warfighter platforms\n\n\u2022  MC\/AC-130J Simulator (MC\/AC-130J): Conducts analysis, development, integration, assembly, test and checkout of SOF-unique MC-130J and AC-130J simulator development efforts modifications to include, but not limited to, all efforts of technical and functional activities associated with the design, development, and production of mating surfaces, structures, equipment, parts, materiels, and software required to assemble equipment (hardware\/software) elements into training mission equipment as a whole and not directly part of any other individual element. \n\n\u2022  Terrain Following\/Terrain Avoidance Silent Knight Radar Simulator (TF\/TA  SKR): Integrates, tests, and validates the SKR capability into the MH-47G and MH-60 combat mission simulators.
