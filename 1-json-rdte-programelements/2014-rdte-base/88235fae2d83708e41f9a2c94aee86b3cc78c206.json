Funding supports planning, conducting, and reporting on the operational effectiveness and suitability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Funding also supports ongoing development and implementation of new requirements relative to integrated testing. The CNO, as well as acquisition executives and managers at all levels, have a continuing need for expeditious and efficient conduct of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) by COMOPTEVFOR in support of training and equipping fleet forces.  To this end, this funding supports COMOPTEVFOR's continued pursuit of a variety of senior management initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies in T&E; these senior management initiatives include IT database and decision making technology upgrades, implementation of Integrated Testing and Mission Based Test Design across all programs, and improved staffing and expertise in the areas of DON acquisition processes, Modeling and Simulation, Statistical Studies, Cost Analysis, Information Assurance, and similar disciplines. All of these senior management initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of testing and evaluation, thus ensuring delivery to fleet units of fully tested and capable combat systems.  OT&E issues have direct long term Navy-wide implications on the Fleet's readiness and war fighting capability. Rapid advances in technology, changes in fleet tactics, and increased complexity of weapons systems and platforms, combined with reductions in manpower, force structure, and budgets have created an increased need for technical and operational analyses that are sophisticated and timely in order to ensure an optimal return on investment of Navy resources. Funding is also provided for Navy support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) sponsored Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E) program."
