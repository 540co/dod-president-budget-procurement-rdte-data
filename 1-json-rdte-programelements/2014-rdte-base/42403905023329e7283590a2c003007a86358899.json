This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct MISO in support of combatant commanders. The MISO sub-projects funded are grouped by the level of organization they support.  Sub-projects include:  \n\n\u2022   The MISO Broadcast System consists of fixed and deployable multi-media production facilities for radio and television programming, distribution systems, and dissemination systems to provide MISO support to theater commanders. This program is comprised of several interfacing systems that can stand alone or interoperate with other MISO systems as determined by mission requirements. This program includes the fixed site media production center; a light and medium media production capability; a distribution system that provides a product distribution link to systems worldwide; a media system; a transit case Fly-Away Broadcast System (FABS) that consists of a combination of amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), shortwave (SW), and television (TV) transmitters, and radio\/TV production systems; software defined radio and a long range broadcast system which transmits analog and digital broadcasts. The long range broadcast system will include, scatterable media, telephony, and Internet broadcast. MISO media displays will consist of easily transportable, state of the art, electronic media displays designed to disseminate and direct broadcast electronic messages, which will influence foreign target audiences, and will support the MISO direct broadcast mission requirements.  Additionally, lightweight and tactical media development work stations will allow soldiers to produce MISO products in deployed locations."
