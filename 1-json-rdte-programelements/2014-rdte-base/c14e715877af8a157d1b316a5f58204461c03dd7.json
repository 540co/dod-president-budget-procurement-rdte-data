These technologies provide key capabilities through training methods and techniques that prepare Soldiers and leaders to effectively operate in complex digitized, networked environments; enable the use of embedded training technologies envisioned for future command and control (C2) systems; as well as foster cognitive, behavioral, and psychological flexibility, adaptability, and mission readiness.  Project 792 evaluates new selection measures, refines performance metrics, assesses innovative training techniques, and analyzes methods and tools to better adapt training to meet goals and requirements. Increased funding in FY12 for this PE is based on work shifted from PE 0602785A due to need for increased focus on maturation and demonstration of selection techniques and tools as well as training methods.\n\nWork in this project complements and is fully coordinated with 0603015A (Next Generation Training & Simulation Systems), 0602308A (Advanced Concepts and Simulation), PE 0602716A (Human Factors Engineering Technology) and PE 0602785A (Manpower\/Personnel\/Training Technology.)\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the US Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Ft. Belvoir, VA."
