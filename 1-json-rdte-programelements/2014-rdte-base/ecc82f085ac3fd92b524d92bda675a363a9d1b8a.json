            "val": "U.S. participation in NATO AGS was ratified by SECDEF signature of the NATO AGS Program Memorandum of Understanding (PMOU) in June 2009. The PMOU went into effect in Sept 2009 when fifteen nations, including the United States, financially committed for procurement and delivery of the NATO Commander's number one priority to the war fighter.  Canada withdrew in August 2011, leaving 14 participating nations.  \n\nIn FY2012, OSD transferred the NATO AGS project to the USAF for management and execution. The NATO AGS project funds the U.S. share of the cost for NATO to acquire an air-to-ground ground surveillance capability, improvements to the radar, and the U.S. support of NATO AGS-related activities. Operations and continuing support will be funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package funded within the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). \n\nThe AGS system will be a NATO-owned and operated airborne ground surveillance capability that provides continuous, wide area surveillance information in all weather conditions for use at the strategic, operational and tactical levels of command. Interoperable with other national assets, AGS will provide NATO decision makers with near real time, continuous information and situational awareness concerning friendly, neutral, and opposing ground forces to support mission planning and execution, including force protection and targeting. \n\nThe NATO AGS Program includes an air segment consisting of a five (5) NATO-developed air vehicles, using elements of the USN Triton (previously Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS)) command and control architecture and the U.S. Radar Technology Insertion Program (RTIP) radar; a unique configuration to allow export of system; a ground segment for data exploitation and distribution that consists of fixed-based site and transportable\/mobile ground stations; establishment and operation of a management organization; development of operations and support concepts; and definition and establishment of an initial support capability.  As part of the U.S. government agreement with NATO AGS Management Agency (NAGSMA), the U.S. will integrate Maritime Moving Target and Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar capability into the RTIP radar for NATO AGS. This design and development includes correcting deficiencies, flight testing on the modes and system level performance validation. \n\nThe system level configuration changes include a unique configuration to allow for export of the system. (Additional details are classified and available on a need-to-know basis.)\n\nDeliveries are planned for 2016-2017. The follow-on sustainment and operations will be supported by all 28 NATO nations through their contributions of funding to the program. Mission elements will support 2 orbits. The main operating base (MOB) air vehicles and mission C2 will be in Naval Air Station Sigonella, Italy. Exploitation at MOB will be developed by Selex. EADS and Selex will develop the transportable and mobile general ground stations. \n \nThe program, managed by the NAGSMA, is composed of design, development and demonstration, as well as initial in-service support (IISS). While the current program includes IISS, the current Direct Commercial Sale (DCS) contract with Northrop Grumman does not include these tasks.\n\nThe DCS contract between Northrop Grumman and NAGSMA was signed on 20 May 2012. This funding is the U.S. cost share for the acquisition of the NATO airborne ground surveillance capability as well as the cost share associated with the IISS. IISS and In-Service Support (ISS) will be contracted under separate action. It is anticipated that ISS costs will be commonly funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package, using the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). This funding also includes developmental activity for RTIP to include additional functionality and configuration requirements, studies and analysis related to mission security and exportability, and current and future program planning, project execution, engineering, and program management support to NATO.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."

                            "val": "U.S. participation in NATO AGS was ratified by SECDEF signature of the NATO AGS Program Memorandum of Understanding (PMOU) in June 2009. The PMOU went into effect in Sept 2009 when fifteen nations, including the United States, financially committed for procurement and delivery of the NATO Commander's number one priority to the war fighter.  Canada withdrew in August 2011, leaving 14 participating nations.  \n\nIn FY2012, OSD transferred the NATO AGS project to the USAF for management and execution. The NATO AGS project funds the U.S. share of the cost for NATO to acquire an air-to-ground ground surveillance capability, improvements to the radar, and the U.S. support of NATO AGS-related activities. Operations and continuing support will be funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package funded within the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). \n\nThe AGS system will be a NATO-owned and operated airborne ground surveillance capability that provides continuous, wide area surveillance information in all weather conditions for use at the strategic, operational and tactical levels of command. Interoperable with other national assets, AGS will provide NATO decision makers with near real time, continuous information and situational awareness concerning friendly, neutral, and opposing ground forces to support mission planning and execution, including force protection and targeting. \n\nThe NATO AGS Program includes an air segment consisting of a five (5) NATO-developed air vehicles, using elements of the USN Triton (previously Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS)) command and control architecture and the U.S. Radar Technology Insertion Program (RTIP) radar; a unique configuration to allow export of system; a ground segment for data exploitation and distribution that consists of fixed-based site and transportable\/mobile ground stations; establishment and operation of a management organization; development of operations and support concepts; and definition and establishment of an initial support capability.  As part of the U.S. government agreement with NATO AGS Management Agency (NAGSMA), the U.S. will integrate Maritime Moving Target and Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar capability into the RTIP radar for NATO AGS. This design and development includes correcting deficiencies, flight testing on the modes and system level performance validation. \n\nThe system level configuration changes include a unique configuration to allow for export of the system. (Additional details are classified and available on a need-to-know basis.)\n\nDeliveries are planned for 2016-2017. The follow-on sustainment and operations will be supported by all 28 NATO nations through their contributions of funding to the program. Mission elements will support 2 orbits. The main operating base (MOB) air vehicles and mission C2 will be in Naval Air Station Sigonella, Italy. Exploitation at MOB will be developed by Selex. EADS and Selex will develop the transportable and mobile general ground stations. \n \nThe program, managed by the NAGSMA, is composed of design, development and demonstration, as well as initial in-service support (IISS). While the current program includes IISS, the current Direct Commercial Sale (DCS) contract with Northrop Grumman does not include these tasks.\n\nThe DCS contract between Northrop Grumman and NAGSMA was signed on 20 May 2012. This funding is the U.S. cost share for the acquisition of the NATO airborne ground surveillance capability as well as the cost share associated with the IISS. IISS and In-Service Support (ISS) will be contracted under separate action. It is anticipated that ISS costs will be commonly funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package, using the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). This funding also includes developmental activity for RTIP to include additional functionality and configuration requirements, studies and analysis related to mission security and exportability, and current and future program planning, project execution, engineering, and program management support to NATO.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year."
