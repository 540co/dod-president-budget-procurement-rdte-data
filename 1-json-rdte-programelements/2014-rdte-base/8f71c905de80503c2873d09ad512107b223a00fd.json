Each increment is broken into phases to initiate requirements analysis, the design phase and the development, integration and verification phase of a specific incremental development effort. The (REDI) II contract is a follow-on Indefinite Delivery\/Indefinite Quantity contract to the current REDI contract.  REDI II provides maximum flexibility to manage various modernization projects.  The REDI II contract allows for the issuance of orders for efforts associated with the planning, analysis, design, development, qualification ,test and documentation of F-22 weapon system performance enhancements, life-cycle improvements, Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades, and associated efforts essential to accomplishing the F-22 mission."
