Therefore, SOF Communications Advanced Development is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.   \n\nUnited States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that C4 systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4 systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and the timely exchange of information to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration within the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a multitude of existing and projected national assets that allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments. \n\n \u2022  SOF Deployable Node (SDN) is a family of satellite communications systems that includes the following variants:  heavy, medium, and light.
