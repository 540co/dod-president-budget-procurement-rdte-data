JITC executes the T&E mission in support of Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I),and is the DoD\u2019s Sole Interoperability Certifier and the only Non-Service Operational Test Agency (OTA).\n\nAs an MRTFB, JITC coordinates directly with commercial vendors to obtain critical pre-acquisition test results. This early involvement, and a focus on automation and instrumentation, enables rapid delivery of enhanced military capabilities at a reduced cost.\n\nWith a focus on T&E for IT that includes Cyber, Cloud services, Mobility and other National Security Systems, JITC has the unique mission to provide consistent, structured and effective T&E services ensuring Joint\/Coalition interoperability; issuing Interoperability Certifications; conducting Operational Evaluations; providing direct interoperability support to the warfighter; and maintaining a federated IT infrastructure to support all DoD Customers."

While maintaining a focus on improving automation, instrumentation and virtualization, this MRTFB is working toward ensuring assets support customers with testing on demand services to enable rapid delivery of enhanced military capabilities at a reduced cost.\n\nTest facilities are located in Ft. Huachuca, AZ; Indian Head, MD; Ft. Meade, MD with infrastructure comprised of 140,000 square feet of raised floor space, four acres of outdoor information technology (IT) range space divided into 47 unique environments; reachable through eight different communication networks. Additionally, the infrastructure is compliant with multiple levels of security, scaled to support more than 1,000 annual testing events to evaluate the DoD\u2019s Command, Control, Communications, Computing and Intelligence (C4I) Information, cyber technology and enterprise (Cloud) services.  \n\nThis infrastructure can be configured into more than 350 unique configurations to support any interoperability testing event worldwide.\n\nMRTFB Capabilities encompass reference implementation models (RIM) of more than 200 IT systems, testing tools to aid both test execution and data collection\/analysis, and structured test and evaluation (T&E) methodologies and processes.  \n\u2013  The RIMs represent major C4I capabilities (e.g. data link standards and sensors); Cyber IT (e.g. Public Key Infrastructure(PKI) and Host Based Security System(HBSS)); Command and Control (C2) systems (e.g. Common Data Link); tactical transport systems (e.g. Teleport, HF\/RF\/UHF); Intelligence Systems (e.g. Motion Imagery and Integrated Broadcast System); enterprise services (e.g. mobile device managers, Infrastructure as a Service, enterprise email); and enterprise environments (e.g. Coalition Interoperability Assurance and Validation, Joint Information Environment (JIE)) and others.\n\u2013  The testing tools expedite T&E in areas supporting Business Transformation (e.g. Hewlett Packard Performance Center); Exercise Support (e.g. Joint Analysis Net-centric Enabled Test Tools); Enterprise Services (e.g. DISA Enterprise Test Environment and TestForge.mil); CYBER IT (Mission Thread Tool) and others.\n\u2013  The T&E Methodology Processes employ a streamlined approach to evaluating customer products against stated capabilities and\/or requirements, ensuring they comply with statutory and regulatory mandates.  The methodologies are based on structured evaluation criteria designed to: test the critical elements of the product, eliminate over tested products, over priced deliverables and missed deadlines."
