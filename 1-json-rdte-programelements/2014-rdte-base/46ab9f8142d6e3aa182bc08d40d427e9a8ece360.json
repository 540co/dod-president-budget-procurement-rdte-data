Technology initiatives, in collaboration with the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) and industry, identify and develop investment strategies to advance the manufacturing processes needed to support the specific technology.  Above-the-shop-floor investments focus on new manufacturing processes that have potential to significantly improve manufacturing efficiencies. Single specific projects address investment opportunities not associated with selected technology initiatives and enable the program to respond to urgent, compelling manufacturing needs and provide seed funding to more high risk-high payoff technologies.\n \t\t\t\nData calls are launched through two methods to identify technology initiatives and single specific issues requiring investment.  One method is through the JDMTP.  The JDMTP is comprised of the ManTech Directors from the Services, Defense Logistics Agency, and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The call is distributed through the ManTech Directors to the four JDMTP sub panels: Metals Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Composites Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Electronics Processing and Fabrication Subpanel and Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise Subpanel. Potential candidates are evaluated by the JDMTP based on criteria set forth in the call and announcements and down-selected for further development prior to final selection.  The other method is through Broad Agency Announcements to industry.  Priority is given to investments that support affordability and producibility of critical enabling manufacturing technologies that cut across multiple platforms.  Investments also balance defense priorities in specialty materials, electronics, propulsion and power, and manufacturing processes including \"above the shop floor\" (lean and business technologies facilitating interoperable manufacturing).  Final projects are selected by the OSD ManTech Director, considering input from the JDMTP and Director of Manufacturing, and as approved by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (MIBP).  Technology initiatives and projects are executed at the Component level."

This program will reduce the cost of the current radar system by $1M per ship set, and will fit into the existing TRS-3D top side and below decks available footprint. The open architecture configuration will allow upgrades for new technologies over the lifetime of the program as well as offer lower cost via the potential for open competition for the radar\u2019s building blocks.  Radar manufacturing and support capability will be transferred from a foreign company to a domestic company and facility.  Transmit\/Receive (T\/R) module packaging cost will be reduced through near-hermetic, commercial Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) packaging and automated Surface Mount Technology (SMT) assembly techniques, reducing touch labor costs.  Model Based Enterprise (MBE) concepts will be integrated to ensure supportability and technology refresh via an Intelligent Technical Data Package.  The commercial packaging effort for T\/R module components as a part of this program will have a direct impact on the Volume Search Radar (VSR) on CVN-79 \u2013 creating a $1M\/hull cost savings for the Navy.  This effort will provide the Navy with the first truly open architecture radar solution that will be able to accommodate different Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technologies, Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) technologies, processor, and power supplies from multiple vendors.  The system will use fiber optics to connect the above-deck equipment (antenna) with the below-deck equipment (signal processing and control) which will allow greater flexibility in location of below-deck equipment (allowing a lower center of gravity and thus improved ship stability)."

The size, weight, power, and cost components of conventional atomic clocks are too high for tactical applications. Chip Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) provides improved long-term frequency stability that gets integrated into long-term time accuracy. The focus of this project is leveraging Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) investments in the CSAC technology to reduce operational costs and transition beyond custom fabrication of the current CSAC.  Objectives include improving the existing batch manufacturing processes such as atomic cell filling, cell sealing, physics package assembly, and sub-system testing to reduce the \u201ctouch hours\u201d required for CSAC assembly and testing. Development of a network of multiple vendors to foster competition and ensure a viable supply base is a complementary goal. Current manual assembly processes can produce CSAC in small quantities with low yield at high cost ($8,000\/unit).  The DMS&T funding enables producibility at an affordable cost ($100\u2013$300\/unit). Successful performance enables an environment of continued operation of critical C4ISR systems, regardless of the presence or absence of global positioning system (GPS). The ability to rapidly reacquire GPS military code in a hostile Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI) environment is an additional targeted benefit."

These efforts provide significant productivity and efficiency gains in the defense manufacturing base.  These manufacturing technologies accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs.\n\nTin Whisker Mitigation project: One significant issue is the need to move toward lead-free electronics.  However, current methods to produce lead-free solder create further issues such as the formation of unwanted tin whisker structures, which can cause electronics to short out.  The Tin Whisker Mitigation project will demonstrate controlled grain structure in soldered joints and plated surfaces.  The objective is to show significantly reduced or completely prevented tin whisker growth, while maintaining the original performance characteristics of the test components.\n\nSilicon Carbide (SiC) High Efficiency Power Switches: Another emerging manufacturing technology undergoing development is for Silicon Carbide High Efficiency Power Switches to enable a new class of power electronics that allows flexible new architectures at higher voltages, higher frequencies, less volume \/ weight, higher temperatures, higher efficiency (reduced fuel consumption), and better power quality for Program Executive Office Ground Combat Systems and the Air and Missile Defense Radar Radar Power Conversion Module.\n\nMini Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) Cameras and ManTech for SWIR Imagers: Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC)-less SWIR imagers are being developed that are smaller, use less power, have a lower cost than currently available SWIR imagers, and offer improved functionality over sensors presently in use.  These new SWIR imagers will be used by warfighters including SOF to see target designation lasers during day and night, to identify friend or foe at long range at night, and to operate with covert lasers.  Applications include several night vision and targeting system programs with the Army, Navy, Air Force, and SOCOM.\n\nManufacturability of Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs): One emerging manufacturing technology undergoing development focuses on the manufacturability of VCSELs. This effort will allow the enhanced use of high-power laser diode technologies by reducing their operational cost, increasing their reliability and yield, and improving their large array scalability without substantially increasing the processing and packaging requirements. Will apply a modern factory approach of a fab-less front-end with specialized in-house process steps, allowing more flexibility for DoD procurement cycles and leveraging installed, previously-invested capital. This project is expected to benefit numerous programs, including: PUMA, RAVEN, TigerShark, Anubis, Spectre-FINDER, Speckles, TigerMoth, WAAS, PAWS, IPODS, AngelFire, MAV-OBAT, nLoss, LOS-short, CLRF, JETS, IDNST, TLDS, Big Safari, OEF, OIF,  STINGER , and ARGUS.\n\nFuture efforts will focus on advances in fuel cells, radars, conformal sensors, and solder free electronics."

These efforts will provide significant productivity and efficiency gains in the defense manufacturing base.  These manufacturing technologies will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs.\n\nAdvanced materials manufacturing technologies undergoing development include materials for ballistic survivability and materials for rapid fabrication of structural components.\n\nCast Eglin Steel: An effort is underway to establish Cast Eglin steel chemistry specs to maximize strength and ductility for maximum protection and effectiveness for Hard and Deeply Buried Target (HDBT) targets. Will create a primary casting process for the single piece cast underbody protection system, and bomb bodies. Developing cast-in pockets, slopes, and curves in order to meet geometric and blast requirements.\n\nCold Spray Deposition: The objective for Cold Spray Deposition is to create a proven repair process and original equipment manufacturer applied corrosion\/wear prevention treatment for magnesium gearbox housings and parts on numerous platforms. Inability to repair is causing significant readiness, sustainment, and safety issues (20% of the fleet is affected at any given time). Working with the original equipment manufacturer to transition the process to industry to treat new parts and to maintain, repair, and overhaul condemned gearboxes in storage.  \n\nNet-Shaped Field Assisted Sintering Technology (FAST): FAST will set the processing limits and qualify the process for the production of two ultra high temperature materials components that require full density materials with nano tailored microstructures that are not achievable via other processes.  This technology addresses near net shaped, thin walled axial rocket nozzle inserts (flute shaped) made from W (Tungsten) and TaC alloys and sharp leading edges with attachment features made from Hf-based ceramics.  This effort will mature the manufacturing readiness of conventional FAST while reducing costs and providing faster delivery times.\n\nFastener Fill: The F-35 Fastener Fill project will address the challenges incurred in the manual fastener fill installation process, which can take as long as 2 minutes per fastener and provides no indication of installation quality other than feel.  With over 40,000 fasteners per aircraft for F-35, this is a significant manufacturing issue.  In addition, excess materials must be manually skived to meet flushness requirements. The project objective is to refine the contractor\u2019s prototype Rapid Intelligent Fastener Fill System which is an automated combination melt, compress, and skive tool capable of installing fastener fill material in less than 15 seconds per fastener. \n\nAutomated and Rapid Boot Installation Process: This process will reduce the labor-intensive nature of the installation procedures, which are not suitable for full-rate production and represent 40% of the cost in component finishing. A risk assessment analysis has identified the following areas to be targeted: (1) automation of the hand-cut\/trimmed, multi-piece boot installations; (2) automation of additional trimming, bonding, and pasting activities currently performed manually; (3) improved quality of technician skill\/training; and (4) reduction of the waste incurred in cutting\/darting boots."

                                        "val": "Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing is a series of efforts addressing advanced manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, advanced manufacturing enterprise, machining, robotics, assembly, and joining.  These manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs.\n\nWith our adversaries forced to innovate rapidly to survive, it's become increasingly important for the U.S. military to improve its own agility and flexibility. The focus is to find a solution to overcome a burdensome acquisition cycle requiring a great amount of cost, time, security, and storage space. Through the use of secure satellite data links or a local parts database, warfighters can access CAD designs for replacement parts, allowing them to repair equipment without the need to establish supply chains or wait for shipments. It allows operators to modify a part's design based on its performance in the field.\n\nEmerging manufacturing technologies undergoing development include:  Large-scale, challenge for advanced, interoperable machine tool applications, and methods for exchange of 3D official technical data throughout the supply chain and between government and contractors.\n\nNational Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII): Collaborative efforts with NAMII enable the production of finished parts directly from digital data such as 3D Computer-aided design (CAD) drawings. It provides almost limitless freedom to designers, allowing the use of very complicated geometries. It is as economical to produce single items as it is to produce thousands and thus undermines economies of scale. Using additive manufacturing would allow for rapid replacement of parts in the field and enable deployed units to remain mission-ready.  Through the use of secure satellite data links or a local parts database, warfighters near deployment locations could access CAD designs for replacement parts, allowing them to repair equipment without the need to establish supply chains or wait for shipments. It would allow operators to modify a part's design based on its performance in the field.  There is a strong need to fabricate timely and affordable aerospace structures in a production environment for rapid fielding of materials and systems.  An example of a system that could benefit is an air flow control actuator within an inlet duct.  This program involves design, fabrication, testing and performance analysis of various parts using additive manufacturing.  Complex designs, such as conformal lattice structures, may only be successfully manufactured using methods such as additive manufacturing.\n\nMTConnect Challenge: The MTConnect Challenge focuses on developing manufacturing solutions (tools) using newly developed MTConnect interoperable protocol, for use on machining platform development. MTConnect is an open communication standard that provides the capability to pass data from machine tools to higher level systems for further processing using the XML based standard.  \n\nFramework for Assessing Cost and Technology (FACT): Producibility analysis tools will be matured so that component performance, manufacturing processing techniques and cost can be simultaneously considered to achieve an optimum design solution.  Current producibility analysis tools do not reuse and connect existing design, manufacturing and cost models. Sustainment and Maintenance will be impacted by maturing advanced sustainability analyses operating within FACT to reduce sustainment costs associated with spare parts acquisition and weapon system maintenance.  The technology will enable correct selection of a manufacturing process to minimize cost given the estimated spare part lot sizes. Block Upgrades or Recapitalization using FACT will be critical for performing analyses associated with integrating new requirements into an existing platform to highlight the manufacturing and lifecycle costs associated with the necessary changes to the weapon system in order to meet new operational requirements."
