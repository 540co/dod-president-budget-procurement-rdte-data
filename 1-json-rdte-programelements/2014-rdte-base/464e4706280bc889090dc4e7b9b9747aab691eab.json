This project supports Army transformation by providing mature technology to greatly expand the capabilities of unmanned aircraft, in current operating roles and future unmanned wingman roles. This project also develops, demonstrates and integrates manned and unmanned sensor and weaponization technologies such as advanced missiles, guns, fire controls, advanced target acquisition and pilotage sensors into Army aviation platforms.  Efforts are directed toward reducing the integrated weight of weapons, increasing engagement ranges, providing selectable effects on a variety of threats, and enabling cost-effective integration across multiple aviation platforms.   \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering S&T focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the Aviation Development Directorate of the Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), Joint Base Langley-Eustis, VA."
