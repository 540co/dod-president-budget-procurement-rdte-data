The HS model, developed by Greenwave Scientific Inc., designed to be used to make accurate measurements of the specific absorption rate (SAR) of RF energy in the human body from Counter Radio-Controlled Electronic Warfare (CREW) devices.  The absorption of radiofrequency (RF) by the human body is very complex.  It is well known that even uniform RF exposures lead to non-uniform absorption in almost all human exposure situations.  Current methods to measure SAR in the human body are elegant and elaborate processes but they can only be carried out in the laboratory.  These consist of open and closed human phantom shells filled with liquids that simulate the electrical properties of human tissue.  To measure the uneven absorption of RF energy a small electric field probe is mechanically moved around inside the phantom shell during exposure.  \n\nContinue work on the HS model and the evaluation of the accurate measurements of the specific absorption rate of radio frequent energy in the human body from Counter Radio-Controlled Electronic Warfare devices.  Start developing some initial research studies looking at the long term use of the Counter Radio-Controlled Electronic Warfare devices."

The acquisition strategy for these products involved direct partnership with the acquisition and procurement professionals at Marine Corps Systems Command.  The program's major Product Areas in the Medical Development Program are:  1) Equipment 2) Pharmaceuticals\/Biologics, and 3) Knowledge\/Concepts. The primary Program Areas of Interest are in: 1) Expeditionary Medicine (Navy in Terrestrial, Maritime Surface, Submarine, & Aviation Operations and USMC in Expeditionary Operations) - in these areas the focus is on Levels I and II in Clinical Care Medicine; and 2) Products developed for battlefield treatment of Combat Casualties & Combat Trauma, focusing on delivery of Levels III and IV of care.  \n\nFor areas 1 and 2, there are two primary acquisition strategies. The first is to test and evaluate commercially-developed medical product candidates in managed trials for ultimate Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Partnerships with commercial developers ensure that products of military interest are available for procurement across the DoD, Federal Government, and commercial market. During development, DoD end users are included in the process to the extent possible.  The second strategy is to drive the development process with DoD program investments. This process involves developing in-house or industrial prototypes in government-managed programs to meet military and regulatory requirements for production and fielding. \nBoth strategies promote advanced preparation of procurement plans in line with the product availability.  Major Medical Development programs falling in these categories are: MOVES and MOVES anesthesia module (Equipment), Dengue vaccine, and Infusible Hemostatic-Phase I Clinical Trials (Pharmaceuticals\/Biologics). \n\nThe Third Product Area (Knowledge\/Concepts) is focused on the introduction of technologies, techniques, and procedures that alter medical practice and standards of care.  These primarily require early involvement of the senior leadership of military medicine, in that the result of the program is modification of concepts of operations, policy, and\/or doctrine.  These are often much smaller; Medical Development Program examples include Navy\/USMC Medical Planning Requirement Assessment and Crisis Action Planning Tool Transition.\n\nPrograms such as System for Objective Decision-Making on Timing of Wound Closure involve both material and knowledge solutions."
