            "val": "The Joint Program Office (JPO) supports all Services and Special Operations Command (SOCOM). The Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) is the worldwide Department of Defense (DoD) standard network for transmitting time-sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence and targeting data to all echelons of Joint Service operational users. The JPO's role is to complete consolidation and replacement of existing IBS terminal functionality and capability, and to complete execution of the IBS Technical Transition Plan (TTP). The JTT family of systems currently consists of the JTT-Senior and JTT-IBS. The TTP is a comprehensive refresh effort of the entire IBS network focused on rearchitecting the broadcast from its current multi-broadcast, multi-data format structure, to a single broadcast (Common Interactive Broadcast - CIB) and single data format (Common Message Format - CMF). The JTT family of systems is a critical component of the TTP as these systems are the only IBS receiver\/transceiver devices in the DoD being modernized to support both the new consolidated broadcast architecture and the National Security Agency's (NSA) crypto modernization mandate. The JTT upgrades must execute the over-the-air broadcast portion of the TTP and IBS data flow via the existing over-the-air IBS broadcast networks. The JTT is the official IBS producer system, and ensures continued IBS interoperability to a variety of tactical receivers across DoD and the Services throughout the TTP implementation period and beyond. This program funds the completion of evaluation of JTT hardware and software modules, as well as performance enhancements to the family of JTT equipment. This is necessary to ensure crypto modernization compliance and to complete migration to a rearchitected CIB and CMF-based IBS broadcast structure. Funds also support the coordination of JTT configuration management, training, equipping and supporting the Warfighter with improved Joint Readiness and Interoperability.\n\nFY14 Funds of $0.079 million support the continued test and evaluation of the Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) crypto modernization waveform for migration to the IBS intelligence Data Enterprise."
