Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A\/MH-6M.  These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts, and they must be capable of rapid deployment; undetected penetration of hostile areas; and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  Sub-projects include:  \n\n\u2022  A\/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade is necessary to restore structural, performance, and safety margins for the aircrews.  An airframe structural modification will address structural failures due to high intensity, high gross weight operations, and a decade of battle damage.  A main\/tail rotor drive train and engine control replacement effort will reduce airframe loads and restore sufficient safety and performance margins.  An avionics upgrade (NDI\/COTS) will replace obsolescent components and provide basic situational awareness.  This upgrade is critical to keep a 1960's vintage aircraft in the fight until a suitable replacement aircraft is available, estimated to be in the 2025 timeframe.\n\n\u2022  Hostile Fire Indicating System (HFIS) detects, classifies, and alerts the aircrew to the presence of small arms and crew served weapons fire for SOF MH-47\/60 platforms.  By providing detection and angle of arrival information, the HFIS will allow the aircrew to perform evasive and counter-fire actions significantly increasing the aircraft's probability of survival .  The Helicopter Survivability Task Force (HSTF) funds incorporated Hostile Fire Indication in the Infrared Spectrum as well as provided sensor fusion of Infrared, Ultra-Violet, and acoustic sensors to reduce false alarms and increase probability of detection.  \n\n\u2022   The MH-47 Engine Automatic Re-Light (EARL) system will detect the presence of an impending or an in-progress engine flame-out event and re-establish combustion within the engine to avoid an actual engine flame-out.  EARL will recognize the event much faster than a pilot and then proceed to reignite\/restart the engine while monitoring and adjusting engine parameters including the ignition system and fuel flow scheduling.  \n\n\u2022   MH-47 Low Cost Modifications program develops technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the Active Parallel Actuator System (APAS), Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), and Engine Barrier Filter.\n\n\u2022   Next Generation Forward Looking Infrared (NGFLIR) program procures a laser rangefinder and designator to the ANZSQ-3.  The program also procures and installs the Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR) Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) drop-in, advanced dual color (long and mid-wave) IR detector upgrade for the ANZSQ-2 NGFLIR on the light and heavy assault platforms within the Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA) fleet.\n\n\u2022   MH-60 SOF Modernization program provides for the systems engineering and platform integration efforts, to include continued flight and qualification testing and test support.   \n\n\u2022   Reduced Optical Signature Emissions Solution (ROSES) program provides reduced optical signature of the current infrared expendable decoys for purposes of reducing Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA) aircraft vulnerabilities.  This flare solution will have the capability to decoy currently fielded infrared missiles and more sophisticated emerging threats. \n\n\u2022   Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) solution will fuse information from currently fielded aircraft sensors with emerging technology to display real-time reference points, obstacles, and landing zone information to the aviator.  The DVE solution will provide MH-47\/60 aircrews with visual cues for obstacle avoidance and aircraft control during all phases of flight and significantly increase crew and passenger survivability in DVE such as dirt and snow.  Additional funding is provided to begin software development."

The airframe\/rotors development effort will be a sole source contract to Boeing, who owns the technical data associated with the A\/MH-6 airframe.  The engine control work will be performed by Rolls-Royce and Goodrich Power and Engine Control (GPEC) under subcontract to Boeing.  As part of the airframe upgrade, the main and tail rotor blades are being replaced with one of several blades available off-the-shelf through a competitive evaluation.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins, with the intent to leverage the Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) source code to the extent possible.  Any new hardware components will be NDI\/COTS and will be competitively selected.  The production software effort will be a FFP contract.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.\n\n\u2022   HFIS - This effort will develop, integrate, install, and field the capability to detect, classify, and alert the aircrew to the presence of small arms fire, anti-aircraft artillery, and rocket propelled grenades.  HFIS will allow aircrews to perform evasive and counter-fire actions, which will increase aircraft survivability and mission success.  A competitive source selection process will be conducted for the HFIS effort to the extent possible.  Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer. The HSTF funds incorporated Hostile Fire Indication in the Infrared Spectrum as well as provided sensor fusion of Infrared, Ultra-violet, and acoustic sensors to reduce false alarms and increase probability of detection.   \n \n\u2022   MH-47 EARL system - This effort develops and qualifies a solution to address safety issues in the MH-47 fleet through the development, test, qualification, and fielding of changes to the engine control system to perform automatic engine failure detection and flame-out protection. Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer.  \n\n\u2022  MH-47 Low Cost Modifications  - This efforts develops technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the APAS, ANC, and Engine Barrier Filter.  This effort will consist mostly of Government executed integration, testing, and qualification efforts with some analytical engineering services to be procured.  Because of proprietary considerations, efforts may be directed to the original equipment manufacturer.  \n\n\u2022   MH-60M SOF Modernization Program - This supports the Systems Integration and Qualification efforts on the prototype MH-60M helicopter. This includes, but is not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation. There are no proprietary considerations that may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer.  \n\n\u2022   ROSES - This effort developed and qualified a flare solution that discharges fewer expendables per dispense and emits less visible light to improve aircrew's ability to survive in sophisticated threat environments.  Proprietary issues with the existing flare and lack of suitable alternatives (based upon market research) dictated a sole source contract with the current manufacturer as the best value to the Government.\n\n\u2022   DVE - This effort integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in degraded visual environments.  A competitive source selection process will be conducted for the DVE solution to the extent possible while capitalizing on Science and Technology initiatives and other Service DVE investments.  Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the original equipment manufacturer. Additional funds will be employed to begin the development of the software\/firmware for the Synthetic Vision Backbone which uses Digital Terrain Elevation Data or High Resolution digital elevation maps, Threat Data, and Blue Force Tracker.  This is  combined with Q2 Electro-Optic Sighting System overlay and Silent Knight Radar or DVE sensors (not yet defined) to provide a synthetic vision scene to aid the aircrew in degraded visual environments. The Synthetic Vision Backbone is sensor agnostic, maximizing the use of a priori data with sensors used for change detection."
