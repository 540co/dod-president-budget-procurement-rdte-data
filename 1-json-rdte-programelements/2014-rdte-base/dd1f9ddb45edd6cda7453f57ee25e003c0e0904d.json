Provides programmatic integration of the Air Force-led, joint DoD-DOE program through the B61 LEP Project Officers Group (POG) and its subgroups.  In accordance with Air Force Materiel Command mission assignment memo (dated 17 Feb 2011) and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)-Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU dated 28 June 2012), the USAF is responsible for development, acquisition & delivery of a guided tailkit assembly (TKA) and All Up Round (AUR) technical integration, system qualification & fielding of the B61-12 variant. \n \n\nThe Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) effort will develop a weapon system to replace the Air Force's Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), operational since 1986.  The LRSO weapon system will be capable of penetrating and surviving advanced Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) from significant stand off range to prosecute strategic targets in support of the Air Force's global attack capability and strategic deterrence core function.  \n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 5, System Development and Demonstration (SDD), because it is conducting engineering and manufacturing development tasks aimed at meeting validated requirements prior to full-rate production."
