            "val": "This project funds analytical products necessary for inherently-governmental Army Test & Evaluation Command\/Army Evaluation Center's (ATEC\/AEC) mission.  Products result from investigating, analyzing, assessing, and reporting on the survivability of Soldiers, and on the survivability, lethality and vulnerability (SLV) of the highest priority Army systems whether those systems are employed during stability, support, defensive, or offensive missions.  Developed through measurement, experiment, test support, and modeling and simulation (M&S), the products funded by this project are used in many ways to make the Army force more survivable.  The project provides quantitative lethality and survivability analyses and data for fielded and developmental systems as the Army makes the required choices to decisively transform into a modular Brigade Combat Team (BCT) based organization.  Specific survivability analysis products include assessments of systems such as Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T), Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP), Stryker, Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV), Army fire support systems, direct fire munitions; Army air defense and missile defense systems; Army aviation systems including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; network communications and other network enabled battle command systems communication systems; and selected joint services systems particularly relevant to the Army's joint and expeditionary role.  Products also include analysis and data concerning individual Soldier items including protective equipment such as helmets and vests.  These survivability products are leveraged into rapid-equipping initiatives and other technical support for operational forces involved in the current fight.  Continued development of these products also guarantees preservation of the Army's vitally needed technical corporate memory for expert survivability advice.\n\nSurvivability analyses funded by this project are conducted across the spectrum of battlefield threats to include guns, missiles, mines and other methods of inflicting physical damage; jammers, countermeasures, and other electronic warfare techniques; information assurance and computer network operations; and directed energy weapons.  This survivability information enables developers, users, and decision makers to perform credible survivability tradeoffs for both Soldiers and materiel.  These technical survivability details enable properly informed decisions concerning systems and tactics that maximize both the combat power and survivability of Army forces.  Survivability data and analysis results funded by this project are efficiently leveraged for many different Army uses, reducing total cost to the Army by eliminating the need for duplicative capabilities funded by individual system developers.  Central funding of this mission assures the Army accurate and consistent treatment of survivability across all classes of systems, across all formal system Evaluations, and across the Army's AR 5-5 studies process.  Work program is prioritized principally by the ATEC\/AEC and is used by them in the Army's formal Evaluation process in such a way that ATEC can comply with its legally mandated responsibility to assess system survivability along with effectiveness and suitability.  Program Managers (PM) and the Program Executive Officers (PEO) use the survivability analyses and data funded by this project to make design decisions that are optimized for survivability, to direct specific weapon system development efforts that are needed for survivability enhancement, and to structure product improvement programs. Soldier survivability data and analysis is leveraged to support the survivability portion of the HQDA G1 MANPRINT program.  TRADOC combat developers exploit the survivability products funded by this project to initiate and improve survivability\/lethality requirements, and to develop and refine doctrine and tactics.  Also, the quantitative analytical results funded by the project are leveraged as core inputs to formal AR 5-5 studies and other studies as directed by Army leaders.  While the Army is at war, analytical results funded by this project are also directly leveraged for survivability support to current operations.  Finally, for particularly urgent or controversial survivability issues, data and analysis funded by this project are used directly by senior Army decision makers to assure technically sound program\/production decisions.   \n \nThis project also supports highly technical specialized information assurance and computer network defense survivability analysis of Army battle command\/networked systems as well as Army network architectures and technology.  Supports ATEC and other electronic warfare vulnerability testers and evaluators by developing and providing highly technical specialized field countermeasure environments that threat forces may employ against Army communications networks, air defense and other systems.

Without the survivability products funded by this project, ATEC would not have a technically credible account of survivability issues at milestone decision points and systems could be fielded with unknown vulnerabilities leading to unnecessary US casualties.
