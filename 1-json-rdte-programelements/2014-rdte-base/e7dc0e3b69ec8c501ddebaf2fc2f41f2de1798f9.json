This program maintains or improves the health of essential parts of the defense industry to avoid reconstitution costs for capability after a Defense procurement hiatus on major investment programs or critical supply chain products where affordable and innovative mechanisms are available to work with the producers in the interim.\n\nA stated purpose of the program is to provide for sustainment of the industrial base through a break in production.  Criteria for project selection will include factors such as 1) identifiable path of preservation, transformation or innovation between an existing capability and a capability with a very high probability of being needed in the short to medium term (< 5 years); 2) loss of the capability is likely in the absence of the proposed project; 3) analysis showing that the project results in a lower overall cost to the department than if capability is developed from scratch when needed; and 4) preference is given to projects supporting multiple programs or services with no clearly identifiable principle beneficiary."

These tools collaboratively identify elements of the industrial base where current acquisition programs will not invest enough in production and\/or research to support the minimum sustaining rate that would keep critical suppliers viable.  While industrial base risks identified through these assessment tools are to be mitigated primarily through direct engagement with military departments, agencies, and industry, exceptional cases will require defense-wide intervention via investment accounts, often in collaboration with multiple Services and agencies, to ensure adequate industrial capability to support future defense needs.\n\nThis funding is a key tool for addressing supply chain risks and diminishing manufacturing sources.  Investments are prioritized though a careful analysis at every tier of the supply chain according to a numerical scale of risk-area's fragility and criticality.  Criticality examines characteristics that make a specific product or service difficult to replace if disrupted; fragility examines characteristics that make small deviations in the status quo likely to have substantial effects on an industry \/ supplier.  These concepts underpin AT&L\u2019s core mission and inform critical investment, budgetary, and programmatic decision-making."
