This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular\/asymmetric warfare.\n\nThis program develops and demonstrates advanced technologies, including Electromagnetic (EM) Rail Gun for naval weapon systems.  This Program Element (PE) includes elements of the following Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs); Time Critical Strike, and ForceNet.  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of four key transformational capabilities required by Sea Strike, as well as technically enable elements of both Sea Shield and Force Net.\n\nDue to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE."

These experiments are integrating S&T capabilities directly into current combat systems and SOA C2 systems.  This is a joint series of experiments with the AF and Army including Navy PEO IWS and PEO C4I which will lead to transition directly into the Advanced Capability Builds 12 - 16 for the IWS POR and into CANES for PEO C4I POR.  In FY2012, Navy will continue work associated with the LTEs and perform integrated prototype testing in a more operational environment.\n\n2)  Autonomy and Data to Decision: This Navy effort involves integrated reverie and land scenarios.  The objective is to develop autonomous networked sensor systems (disparate platforms and sensors) that significantly reduce (objective eliminate) human system management and analysis to enable small forces such as Navy reverie expeditionary teams to focus on the execution of missions with significant sensor support. Currently mission execution is limited by the number of people that have to be engaged in sensor management and analysis.  Autonomous Data to Decision capability is also adaptable to autonomous sensor networks in support of forward operating base protection.
