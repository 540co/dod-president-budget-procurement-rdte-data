To accomplish this objective, seven project areas were developed: RA - Information Science and Applications, RE - Counter-Terrorism Technologies, RF \u2013 Detection and Forensics Technologies, RG - Defeat Technologies, RI - Nuclear Survivability, RM - WMD Counterforce Technologies, and RT - Target Assessment Technologies.  These projects support technology requirements in line with the Joint Functional Concepts (Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01).  The missions and plans of these projects are described below and in the R-2a Budget Exhibits.  \n\nThe DTRA\u2019s Proliferation, Prevention and Defeat program element supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats priorities. The strategy spells out four focus areas: 1) Promote global health security efforts through building and improving international capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, whether caused by natural, accidental, or deliberate events, 2) Establish and reinforce norms against the misuse of the life sciences, 3) Expand our capability to prevent, attribute, and apprehend those engaged in biological weapons proliferation or terrorism, with a focus on facilitating data sharing and knowledge discovery to improve integrated capabilities (Capability Expansion), and 4) Leverage science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements to improve global capacity to respond to and recover from biological incidents (Leveraging Science).  There are three of the four focus areas (1, 3, and 4) supported in this program element under projects RE-Counter-Terrorism Technologies, RM-WMD Counterforce Technologies, and RT-Target Assessment Technologies.  Details are provided in the R-2a exhibits."

The systems engineering effort provides research and development with requirements, technology, architecture analyses and proof-of-principle capability necessary for making decisions on strategic planning, research and development investments, new initiatives, cooperation, ventures with new customers, and accomplishment of high-level, short notice special projects.  This includes analysis of National, Department of Defense (DoD) and other Federal agencies' strategic guidance and plans in the combating WMD, Combating Terrorism and Homeland Defense arenas through analytical political-military and technical studies, workshops and conferences.  The Technical Reachback effort provides 24 hour\/7 days per week information and analyses on potential impacts of a WMD event to Warfighters and First Responders in consult with DTRA\u2019s Combating WMD Research and Development subject matter experts.  This project also provides support to international CWMD science and technology cooperation by developing modifications, improvements, or new technologies and information tools suitable for foreign release and cooperative efforts. Further, this project provides the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) on-site support to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers, Europe (SHAPE) with a current primary focus on support to U.S. European Command (USEUCOM), NATO, and SHAPE in combating WMD and maintaining the NATO nuclear deterrent.  A significant element of this project includes support to Command Elements and the warfighting Combatant Commands (COCOMs) on strategies for reducing\/countering the WMD threat in the COCOMs Areas of Responsibility.  This project also provides for the solution to the Secretary of Defense mandate for DTRA to account, maintain, report, and track the National Nuclear Weapons Stockpile & Nuclear Weapon-Related Materiel during peacetime, crisis, and wartime.  In support of national requirements necessary to maintain a viable nuclear deterrent, the Defense Integration and Management of Nuclear Data Services provides a platform to ensure continued sustainability and viability of the nuclear weapon stockpile. Finally, it conducts the development, validation and fielding of the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES) as a part of the U.S. commitment under arms control treaties\n\nThe FY 2012 to FY 2013 decrease is predominately due to the net effect of a one-time increased investment for the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES) in FY 2012 and a realignment of funding from Program Element (PE) 0603160BR to PE 0602718BR for the information technology test and engineering program for Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) 3.  \n\nThe decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to the net effect of the consolidation of Reachback Support operations in Project RM - WMD Counterforce Technologies in Program Element (PE) 0603160BR and increased investment in research and development analysis support funded by a transfer from PE 0602718BR."

                            "val": "The Counter-Terrorism Technologies project is an over-arching project that develops and transitions a full spectrum of new technologies to counter emergent Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) thus enabling warfighters to improve their ability to detect, disable, interdict, neutralize, and destroy chemical, biological, nuclear production, storage, and weaponization facilities.  This project supports Joint U.S. Military Forces, and in particular, the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  This research and development support directly enhances USSOCOM, the highest priority mission areas in the National Security Strategy, the National Strategy to Combat WMD, the National Military Strategy, to Combat WMD, the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the Guidance on the Employment of the Force, and therefore a high priority for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).  The following efforts are included in this project:\n\nThe Counter WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) Counterproliferation (CP) research and development program is a collaborative effort with US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) where the DTRA manages and sub-allocates funding directly to USSOCOM to develop warfighter-unique technologies in support of USSOCOM\u2019s Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation (CT\/CP) mission.  New CT\/CP technologies are developed under USSOCOM management that provides warfighters with the operational capability to counter WMD threats.\n\nThe Counter WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) technologies program builds upon collaborative efforts with the warfighter.  This program develops proofs of concept and subsequent advancements in research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) and provides multi-mission capabilities that may be applied throughout the entire spectrum of warfare while significantly eliminating collateral damage.  The CWMD-T technologies program develops technologies to enable the warfighter to locate, identify, characterize, and access Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) WMDs, their production and storage facilities, and associated enablers along multiple nodes concurrently or simultaneously within the terrorist pathway to disrupt, delay, degrade, destroy, or deny WMDs while minimizing risk to U.S. forces in support of CT\/CP offensive operations.\n\nThe USSOCOM Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction \u2013 Terrorism Support Program (SCSP) addresses Commander USSOCOM responsibilities under the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Unified Command Plan (UCP) for integrating and synchronizing operations and activities to prevent terrorists from developing, acquiring, proliferating, or using WMD.\n\nFurther, Program RE supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threat priority\/focus areas 3) Capability Expansion and 4) Leveraging Science.  One example is Counter WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) Counterproliferation (CP) research and development, which funds rapid technology development to provide warfighters with the operational capability to prevent employment of biological weapons.  Further details are classified.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to decreased investment for CWMD-T testing and defeat programs. \n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to increased investment in CWMD-T support to USSOCOM."

Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both.  It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of advanced technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems or rapid WMD elimination capabilities that are most relevant to the COCOM's WMD Defeat CONOPS and their AOR.  This program includes developing specific WMD agent\/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation (DT&E) of next-generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved based on this technology.  The program is addressing defeat of adversaries' offensive WMD programs through integration of current conventional weapons capabilities and next generation kinetic and non-kinetic solutions to provide full-spectrum asymmetric defeat options.  The program addresses requirements delineated in the Quadrennial Defense Review and Strategic Planning Guidance as codified Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), Service requirements documents, and COCOM and Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal C-WMD capability.\n\nThe increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to increased investment in Counter WMD Hard Target Defeat (HTD) Weapons Development to mature and demonstrate innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon capability for the physical or functional defeat of the WMD structures, functions, and\/or the agents themselves with a minimum of collateral effects from incidental release of agent. \n\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to increased investment in CWMD HTD Weapons Technologies efforts."

This program develops and demonstrates radiation-hardened, high performance prototype microelectronics to support the availability of RHM and photonics for DoD missions from both private sector and government organizations. \n\nMighty Guardian Force-on-Force Tests aid in satisfying requirements for the Services by providing denial of access to nuclear resources in all environments: operational, storage and in transit.  The results of the evaluations identify security vulnerabilities to weapons systems that are then addressed through targeted application of research and development projects requested by the resource owners.  These projects are designed to demonstrate, test, and evaluate security enhancement systems prior to service procurement.\n\nNuclear Weapons Surety, as tasked by the DoD Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program, provides Combatant Commands (COCOMs), Services, and Joint Chiefs of Staff with technical analyses, studies, research, and experimental data necessary to identify and quantify risks of plutonium dispersal and Loss of Assured Safety due to accidents, fires or natural causes during peacetime operations of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapon systems.  Additionally, this will provide studies necessary to quantify the probability of success against targeted terrorist attacks on DoD facilities, while leveraging these risk assessment advances.  It also provides new and innovative technologies for the protection of nuclear resources in support of COCOMs and Services.  \n\nThe increase from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to an increased investment in experimental capabilities and radiation hardened microelectronics.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is due to decreased investment in Mighty Guardian and Radiation Hardened Microelectronics."

This activity specifically focuses on two critical components in countering the WMD threat: \nDevelop end-to-end planning capabilities including weaponeering tools to aid the Combatant Commander's (COCOM) targeting and weapons officers in choosing the proper weapon, fuze, and employment parameters to optimize the defeat of WMD and related hard targets.  Deliver modernized, validated and fast running attack planning tools and integrating software.  Leverage attack planning tools to support force protection planners and vulnerability assessment teams. \nDevelop, integrate, demonstrate and transition emerging\/innovative technologies to provide the warfighter with an enhanced near real-time combat and battle damage assessment capability.  Capability is achieved through the development of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and weapon-based sensors, platforms, taggants, seekers and other innovative technologies to; remotely sense, identify, track and target WMD-related threats; perform battle damage assessment\/indication of strikes against these threats; and locate, track, collect, detect, selectively identify, and characterize Chemical Weapon and Biological Weapon aerosol agents released during these WMD counterforce strikes.\n\nThis project supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threat priority\/focus area 1) Global Health Security and 3) Capability Expansion.  The DTRA initiated a Bio Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Initiative to develop technologies and tactics that improve the national ability to search for, detect, and identify biological terrorist threats before release. This initiative will develop layered sensing technologies that can be used within a fused approach to enhance the detection of biological threats.  The intent is to provide a capability to narrow the area of interest so that a localized search can be accomplished using collection, in-field confirmatory, and close in Bio-threat analysis technologies.\n\nThe Technical Reachback support provides 24 hour\/7 days per week information and analyses on potential impacts of a WMD event to Warfighters and First Responders in consult with DTRA\u2019s Combating WMD Research and Development subject matter experts.  This effort develops and integrates capabilities and processes to support WMD effects and consequences, to include secondary and tertiary effects.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to termination of DTRA\u2019s Near Real Time Battle Damage Assessment Program for Global Strike.\nThe increase from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to increased investment in WMD Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance activities and the consolidation of Reachback Support operations from Project RA-Information Science and Applications."

It leverages fifty years of testing expertise to investigate weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferant nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD (nuclear, biological and chemical).  The project maintains testing infrastructure to support the testing requirements of warfighters, other government agencies, and friendly foreign countries on a cost reimbursable basis.  It creates testing strategies and a WMD Test Bed infrastructure focusing on the structural response of buildings and Hard & Deeply Buried Targets that house nuclear, biological, and chemical facilities.  It provides support for full and sub-scale tests that focus on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels.  This capability does not exist anywhere else within the DoD and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Combat WMD.

                            "val": "For some Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) targets and hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs), physical destruction may not be possible, practical, or desirable with current conventional weapons and employment techniques.  It may be possible or preferable, to achieve operational objectives by denying or disrupting the mission or function of the target facility.  Functional defeat, however, requires extensive and highly detailed analysis of the target.  The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining its vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and if necessary, suppressing reconstitution efforts and re-attacking the facility.  Target Assessment Technologies develops for the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) and the Intelligence Community (IC) the analytical tools and process required to find and characterize WMD targets and HDBTs and then, in near-real-time, assessing the results of attacks against those targets.  Overall objectives are to develop new methodologies, processes and technologies for detecting, locating, identifying, physically and functionally characterizing, modeling, and assessing new and existing hard and deeply buried targets to support physical or functional defeat.  Applying these processes to WMD time-dependent target characterization and threat analysis present a further technical challenge.  The Target Assessment Technologies project is meeting this challenge through three subordinate and related activities: (1) Targeting and Intelligence Community Technology Development; (2) Find, Characterize, Assess Technology Development; and (3) Counter-WMD Analysis Cell (C-WAC) Technology Development.\n\nProgram RT supports the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threat priority\/focus area 3) Capability Expansion and 4) Leveraging Science.  The Counter WMD Analysis Cell (C-WAC) technology development program has cooperative Research and Development projects with the United Kingdom and Commonwealth nations.  The C-WAC is developing information sharing means with Commonwealth nations.  The C-WAC project is also developing the Bio Dual-Use Support Tool as an aid in discriminating the employment of dual use technologies in the disguised development of bio warfare capabilities.    \n\nThe decrease from FY 2012 to FY 2013 is predominately due to decreased investment in Counter-WMD Analysis Cell collaboration with the National Counterproliferation Center (NCPC) and the Intelligence Community.  \n\nThe decrease from FY 2013 to FY 2014 is predominately due to decreased investment in development of tools for the analysis of chemical weapons threats, decreased investment in the development and integration of sensor systems for target characterization and assessment, and the realignment of test bed facilities to RR-Test Infrastructure in PE 0602718BR to better reflect the nature of those activities."
